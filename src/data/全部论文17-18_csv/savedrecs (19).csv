Food safety is one of several dimensions of food quality that are typically unobservable at the time of purchase. Branding can overcome this information problem by allowing firms to build reputations based on the quality of their products. If a reputation for food safety is valued directly by consumers, or if food safety is correlated with other valued attributes, firms producing safer food should be able to use their brand equity to charge higher prices. In addition, firms with stronger brand equity have stronger incentives to meet food safety standards in order to maintain that equity. Using data from more than 900 maize flour samples representing 23 distinct brands in eastern and central Kenya, we explore the relationship between price and contamination with aflatoxin. Aflatoxin is a fungal toxin common in maize, groundnuts, and other crops around the world. We find a strong negative correlation between price and contamination at the brand level, consistent with the hypothesized positive relationship between brand equity and food quality.","[Hoffmann, Vivian] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Markets Trade & Inst Div, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Moser, Christine] Western Michigan Univ, Dept Econ, 1903 W Michigan Ave, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Western Michigan University,"Moser, C (通讯作者)，Western Michigan Univ, Dept Econ, 1903 W Michigan Ave, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA.",christine.moser@wmich.edu,,"Hoffmann, Vivian/0000-0002-6464-3748",Western Michigan University Faculty Research and Creative Activities Award (FRACAA); Department of Economics; CGIAR Research Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH); Global Center for Food Systems Innovation (GCFSI) at Michigan State University,Western Michigan University Faculty Research and Creative Activities Award (FRACAA); Department of Economics; CGIAR Research Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH); Global Center for Food Systems Innovation (GCFSI) at Michigan State University,"Data collection was funded by the Western Michigan University 2012-2013 Faculty Research and Creative Activities Award (FRACAA) and the Department of Economics.

However, cash-constrained smallholders often lack the resources to pay an insurance premium, which may undermine its wider adoption. This article investigates alternative insurance payment methods that may help to enhance the adoption of index-based weather insurance. We use a choice experiment to elicit smallholders' willingness to pay in cash or labor for index-based weather insurance in four districts in the south-central highlands of Ethiopia. The insurance schemes were created using a fractional factorial design with three factors: work, cash, and payout rate. We analyze the choice data using a random parameter mixed logit model. We find that the average participants need a subsidy to pay cash for insurance because their willingness to pay is less than the expected cost of the insurance. On average, they are willing to pay only 0.81 ETB (Ethiopian currency) to get an expected yearly payout of 1 ETB. However, most are willing to participate in work-for-insurance programs at lower daily wage rates than is common for other work programs in Ethiopia.","[Tadesse, Million A.] Univ Waterloo, Dept Econ, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Alfnes, Frode; Holden, Stein T.] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Sch Business & Econ, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway; [Erenstein, Olaf] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Apdo Postal 6-641, Mexico City 06600, DF, Mexico",University of Waterloo; Norwegian University of Life Sciences; CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT),"Tadesse, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Dept Econ, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",mayten01@gmail.com,"Holden, Stein/AAD-4502-2019; Alfnes, Frode/I-8970-2016","Alfnes, Frode/0000-0002-3072-9308; Erenstein, Olaf/0000-0002-7491-5786","Research Council of Norway [208540]; CIMMYT, the MAIZE consortium research program","Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); CIMMYT, the MAIZE consortium research program","We would like to thank Dr. Abdulai (coeditor of the journal), anonymous reviewers and Daniel Osgood for the useful comments and suggestions that help improve the quality of the article.

The metafrontier estimates reveal considerable productivity differences in milk production across the EU at the regional (NUTS-2) level. Milk yield per cow is the highest in the old Member States, especially in those regions located in the northwest of the EU, while the lowest productivity is observed in Eastern Europe. The same structure was found for both the TFP (Total Factor Productivity) levels and TFP growth. Moreover, the results for technical change suggest that farm sizes are not optimal in many regions in Central and Eastern Europe from a dynamic perspective. The comparative analysis suggests that in the new compared to the old Member States, fewer farms could benefit from the movement of the frontier. Moreover, there are no signs that poorly performing farms are catching up with the best performing farms in the EU regions/countries.","[Cechura, Lukas; Kroupova, Zdenka] Czech Univ Life Sci, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic; [Grau, Aaron; Hockmann, Heinrich; Levkovych, Inna] IAMO, Agr Markets Mkt & World Agr Trade, Halle, Germany",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO),"Cechura, L (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",cechura@pef.czu.cz,"Grau, Aaron/HMV-1764-2023; Levkvoych, Inna/AAE-2690-2019; Kroupova, Zdenka Zakova/AAO-8608-2021; , IAMO/G-2328-2012; Cechura, Lukas/H-6694-2018","Kroupova, Zdenka Zakova/0000-0001-5834-3338; Cechura, Lukas/0000-0003-2727-1874",European Union [312029],European Union(European Union (EU)),"The project has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration under grant agreement no. 312029 (www.compete-project.eu).

Design/methodology/approach - The authors investigated all the research teams that have been conducting research projects under the variety development special program. The data collected include detail information on research capacity, research areas, performance, and process of their research projects. Based on the survey data, the authors assessed the innovations and progress of the variety development special program. Findings - Unlike other countries, most GM products in China are developed by public research institutes. There is rising concern on the ability of China's public sector to continuously generate indigenous GM technology that can compete with multinational companies. The study surveyed 197 research institutes and 487 research teams and found that the GM program in China lacks coordination: researchers do not want to share their research materials with others. Due to the lack of coordination, most of the hundreds of research teams often worked independently in the year 2008-2010. Moreover, the authors found the lack of coordination may be due to the reason that the interests of researchers are not well protected. This paper also provided the recent progress and policy changes of GM program in China, and it found that the efficiency in the later three years improved a lot. In order to establish a competitive national public GM research system, China should continuously consolidate and integrate the upstream, midstream, and downstream activities of the whole GM innovation process. China's public sector may also need to work more closely with both the domestic and international private sectors. Originality/value - This paper is a comprehensive analysis on the development of transgenic technology in China. The results of this paper can provide evidence for the dynamic adjustment of the policies in the variety development special program and can also provide reference for the future assessment of the variety development special program.","[Cai, Jinyang; Hu, Ruifa] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Cai, Jinyang] Sustainable Dev Res Inst Econ & Soc Beijing, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Huang, Jikun; Wang, Xiaobing] Peking Univ, Sch Adv Agr Sci, China Ctr Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Institute of Technology; Peking University,"Huang, JK (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Sch Adv Agr Sci, China Ctr Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jkhuang.ccap@pku.edu.cn,", IAMO/G-2328-2012",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71403019, 71210004, 71333013]; National Key Program on GM New Varieties [2016ZX0815-001]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Program on GM New Varieties,"This research was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (71403019, 71210004, 71333013), and the National Key Program on GM New Varieties (2016ZX0815-001).",,19,5,9,1,49,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

The results of the survey point out the fact, that Slovakian farmers perceive the price risk, production or income risk as the most important risk factors, and the diversification as a most important strategy of the risk management. The most significant positive correlations were found between the land size and the perception of the price risk importance, between the number of years in office and the perception of the price risk importance. Concerning the production or income risk, the significant positive correlation was found in the legal form of business.

Studies focusing on the HRM of basic agricultural enterprises have been published in many countries. In the Slovak Republic, experts and academics from the Slovak University of Technology in Nitra, and the Slovak Research Institute of Agricultural and Food Economics have arrived at perceptive conclusions on the current state of human capital in the agri-food sector and have proposed innovative directions for further development. Surprisingly, however, academia still fails to perceive HR management as a partner in an enterprise, rather than simply a service unit in the organisational structure of the agricultural enterprise. Therefore, an in-depth analysis of the role of HRM departments is missing and this paper aims to fill that gap. The methodology of research is based on Ulrich's model of the mixed roles of HR departments (2009), which is used as a framework to determine the quality levels of role performance, defined by the model, of HRM departments.

Targeted staggered control (TSC) has been introduced to reduce pesticide use in cotton cropping and generate an estimated benefit of FCFA48,800 (Euro74.40) per cotton hectare accruing from increased productivity and reduced pesticide cost. However, TSC application requires extra time for pest identification and scouting, and its adoption remains low due to the lack of funding to boost farmers' awareness and cover training costs. An interval regression model was used to analyze responses to a double-bounded contingent valuation survey with data collected from 300 cotton farmers. The results showed that 87.3% of cotton farmers were willing to pay for TSC services. Annual WTP per cotton hectare was estimated at FCFA16,962 (Euro25.80), revealing an existing demand for TSC adoption. Respondents' WTP was driven by farm and socio-economic characteristics. Financial mechanisms managed by farmers could thus potentially foster technology adoption, and in turn, generate economic and environmental benefits.","[Kpade, Cokou Patrice] Univ Agr Ketou, Ketou, Benin; [Mensah, Edouard Romeo; Ndjeunga, Jupiter] Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, Niamey, Niger; [Fok, Michel] Int Ctr Agr Res Dev CIRAD, UPR AIDA, Montpellier, France",CGIAR; International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid-Tropics (ICRISAT); CIRAD,"Kpadé, CP (通讯作者)，Univ Agr Ketou, Ketou, Benin.",kpadepatrice1@hotmail.com,"Kpade, Cokou Patrice/AAW-4397-2020; Mensah, Edouard Romeo/IWM-1428-2023","Kpade, Cokou Patrice/0000-0001-9819-5624; Mensah, Edouard Romeo/0000-0002-6462-378X; FOK, Michel/0000-0001-8709-5687",,,,,57,10,10,2,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

We show that resource reallocation between farms mainly occurred between incumbent farms and between farms with different productivity growth. Resource reallocation is estimated to account for around half of the industry-level productivity growth that occurred between 1978 and 2010, and its contribution appears to have increased over time. Moreover, we also show that resource reallocation effects vary across different inputs, partly due to their different mobility. This analysis improves our understanding of how reforms targeting structural adjustment - and the resource reallocation this generates - can influence aggregate productivity growth.","[Sheng, Yu; Jackson, Thomas; Gooday, Peter] Australian Bur Agr & Resource Econ & Sci, Dept Agr, Canberra, ACT, Australia",,"Sheng, Y (通讯作者)，Australian Bur Agr & Resource Econ & Sci, Dept Agr, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",yu.sheng@agriculture.gov.au,"SHENG, Yu/GXZ-8269-2022; Sheng, Yu/ABC-2411-2020",,,,,,30,9,11,1,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Empirical evidence from rural China,CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Public goods; Relationship; Rural China,GRASS-ROOTS DEMOCRACY; ETHNIC DIVERSITY; LOCAL GOVERNANCE; DETERMINANTS; TRUST,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate how different types of the village relationship influence different types of public goods provision in rural China. Design/methodology/approach - The three components (clan-based relationship, neighborhood relationship and external relationship) were derived by employing factor analysis. The simultaneous discrete choice model was used to estimate the influence of these components on public goods provision, using the survey data from the China Household Income Project conducted in 2007. Findings - The findings indicate that considering different components of village relationship allows for a better understanding of the public good provision. The results indicate that the neighborhood relationship has a significantly positive effect on rural public goods provision, particularly on water conservancy and irrigation, while the external relationship has a significantly positive effect on all types of public goods. Practical implications - Local public goods provision is the core of the new rural construction in China. These findings imply that relationship in villages plays a vital role in the provision of public goods and is necessary in the construction of the new harmonious countryside in China. The results also have implications for rural public goods provision in other developing countries. Originality/value - To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to quantitatively model the impact of different relationships on public goods provision at the rural level. A consideration of the different components in village relationship allows for a more precise understanding of the pubic goods provision in the village.","[Wang, Yuxin; Liu, Qing; Wu, Yanrui; Wu, Huaqing] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Econ, Hefei, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yanrui] Univ Western Australia, UWA Business Sch M252, Crawley, Australia",Hefei University of Technology; University of Western Australia,"Wu, HQ (通讯作者)，Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Econ, Hefei, Peoples R China.",wuhuaqing@hfut.edu.cn,"Wu, Yanrui/C-2458-2013","Wu, Yanrui/0000-0002-8966-1459","Humanities and Social Science Planning Foundation of Ministry of Education of China [14YJCZH155]; Anhui Social Science Foundation [AHSKQ2015D22]; National Statistical Research Funds of China [2016LY05]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [JZ2015HGBZ0475, JS2016HGXJ0014, JZ2016HGTB0715]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71373026, 71471053]",Humanities and Social Science Planning Foundation of Ministry of Education of China; Anhui Social Science Foundation; National Statistical Research Funds of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors would like to thank participants at the fourth Wanjiang Economic Forum (WEF): The Chinese Economics Society of Australia (CESA) - Hefei University of Technology (HFUT) Joint Conference for helpful comments and suggestions.

Because monitoring nutrient applications is difficult, regulators instead oversee NMP adoption. In this paper we examine whether having NMPs make hog farms more likely to adopt nutrient management practices. We estimate nutrient application and uptake rates to assess whether operations with NMPs are less likely to over-apply nutrients. Using an endogenous treatment effects model to control for potential confounding and selection bias, we find that NMPs are positively correlated with the adoption of nutrient management practices, as well as with the reduced application of excess nutrients.","[Sneeringer, Stacy; Key, Nigel] ERS, USDA, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [Pon, Shirley] NMR Grp Inc, Somerville, MA USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Sneeringer, S (通讯作者)，ERS, USDA, Washington, DC 20250 USA.",ssneeringer@ers.usda.gov,,,,,,,29,2,4,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

We construct a general dynamic dual model for U.S. agriculture that allows tests for full variability and strict fixity to be performed for each input as well as tests for functional form. We estimate the model using a generalised Box-Cox functional form. Most test results are robust to functional form, but test results of fixity are sensitive for two of four inputs. The generalised Leontief is found to be significantly preferred to the translog and normalised quadratic functional forms for the dynamic model. With this functional form, family labour exhibits strict fixity, while land, capital and hired labour exhibit quasifixity. The estimated adjustment rates for the three quasi-fixed inputs are 15, 27 and 47 per cent. Production uncertainty has limited impacts on aggregate investment decisions for quasi-fixed inputs. The insignificant elasticity between state-contingent outputs suggests that an ex post analysis conditional on the realised states of nature is appropriate.","[Yang, Sansi] Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Shumway, C.

We study the case of subsidies on pulses in select Indian states and their impact on consumption and ultimately nutrition (protein intake). As a natural experiment, we use the introduction of pulses into India's Public Distribution System (PDS) where the variations in prices were brought about by the inclusion of pulses in the PDS in some states and not in others. Our difference in difference (DID) estimates show that change in the consumption of pulses because of their inclusion in the PDS, though statistically significant, was of a small order. The impact was not large enough to bring about any sizable difference in consumption of pulses or the total protein intake. The results withstand several robustness checks including randomized inference and triple differencing based on location and other consumer characteristics.","[Chakrabarti, Suman] IFPRI, PHN Div, New Delhi, India; [Kishore, Avinash] IFPRI, SAO, New Delhi, India; [Roy, Devesh] IFPRI, Agr Nutr & Hlth A4NH, Washington, DC 20005 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Roy, D (通讯作者)，IFPRI, Agr Nutr & Hlth A4NH, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",d.roy@cgiar.org,"Chakrabarti, Suman/AAY-1792-2021","Chakrabarti, Suman/0000-0002-5078-2173",,,,,43,26,28,1,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

We conducted an intercept survey of flex motorists as they refueled in five U.S. states. We overcome the problem caused by sample prices favoring low-ethanol blends by augmenting revealed preference data with stated preference data. A sample-selection problem arises because motorists with high willingness to pay seek out the relatively few stations that sell high-ethanol blends. We use responses from two questions to inform sample selection. We find the average U.S. motorist requires a substantial discount to switch to high ethanol blends beyond the price that equates the cost per mile of driving.","[Pouliot, Sebastien] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Pouliot, Sebastien] Farmingdale State Coll, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, Farmingdale, NY 11735 USA; [Liao, Kenneth A.] Farmingdale State Coll, Dept Econ, Farmingdale, NY USA; [Babcock, Bruce A.] Univ Calif Riverside, Sch Publ Policy, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",Iowa State University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; Farmingdale State College; State University of New York (SUNY) System; Farmingdale State College; University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Pouliot, S (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA.;Pouliot, S (通讯作者)，Farmingdale State Coll, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, Farmingdale, NY 11735 USA.",pouliot@iastate.edu,,,"Biobased Industry Center at Iowa State University; National Science Foundation [EPS-1101284]; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture Hatch project [1010309]; NIFA [1010309, 913628] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",Biobased Industry Center at Iowa State University; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture Hatch project; NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),"The authors acknowledge support from the Biobased Industry Center at Iowa State University, the National Science Foundation under Grant Number EPS-1101284, and the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture Hatch project 1010309.",,30,2,4,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

We demonstrate how, under FSMA, certain categories of suppliers will gain advantage over others. Growers and suppliers within the United States, and their buyers, are likely to gain relative to foreign producers and importers because FSMA imposes specific requirements for importers. Among fully regulated growers, large growers will benefit relative to small growers.

A better understanding of the gender technology gap is essential for policy formulation and programme planning to ensure equity in resource allocation, and household-level food security in low and middle income countries, such as Ghana. We employ a metafrontier approach to analyse the differences in the efficiency of male and female farmers, recognising the endogeneity of some of the variables in the inefficiency effects model, in particular the credit constraints of the rice farmers under study. Our findings show that while the rice farms themselves are very similar, average yields for male managed farms tend to be significantly higher than female managed farms reflecting higher seeding and fertiliser application rates on male managed farms. However, there is no significant difference between the genders in either land used for rice or total output per farm household. We find some evidence that relative to the metafrontier, male managed farms are less efficient than female managed farms. The results further show gender technology gap amongst the smallholder rice farmers with females' technology gap ratio being significantly greater than that of males, with females operating on a production frontier closer to the metafrontier. Policies that provide females more access to productive resources and other agricultural services could assist in the generation of relatively higher output.","[Owusu, Victor; Donkor, Emmanuel] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Kumasi, Ghana; [Owusu-Sekyere, Enoch] Univ Free State, Bloemfontein, South Africa",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; University of the Free State,"Owusu, V (通讯作者)，Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Kumasi, Ghana.",vowusu.agric@knust.edu.gh,"Owusu-Sekyere, Enoch/AAR-7580-2020; Owusu, Victor/GQA-8523-2022; Donkor, Emmanuel/H-3745-2014; Owusu, Victor/N-7114-2019","Owusu-Sekyere, Enoch/0000-0002-4993-5064; Donkor, Emmanuel/0000-0001-9279-1484; Owusu, Victor/0000-0002-5277-1128",,,,,53,21,21,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

Smart technologies, big data, and improvements in crop genetics present producers with promising new opportunities for meeting these needs. However, a changing climate and an expanding global population impose challenges to increasing crop and livestock production while sustaining the natural resource base and protecting environmental quality. Sustainable agricultural development will call for systems approaches to allocate land among competing uses, coupled with the adoption of conservation technologies incentivized by cost-effective policies that have been based on evidence from sound economic, behavioral, biological, and technological research.

If knowledge is what is believed by the preponderance of a community, then the key to advancing knowledge is to build substantive arguments-ones that are persuasive. To evaluate the substantiveness of an argument, this article develops a framework based on validity, topic, and audience. Applying that framework to two highly-cited articles, this article concludes that validity is a necessary condition for a substantive argument, but relevance (of topic to audience) is the sufficient condition. Applied economists are well-positioned to build compelling, objective arguments by fitting appropriate theory and methods to relevant, important topics.","[Swinton, Scott M.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Swinton, SM (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",swintons@msu.edu,,,Michigan State University; Michigan AgBioResearch,Michigan State University; Michigan AgBioResearch,"For helpful comments, the author thanks audiences at Michigan State and Ohio State universities, and at the 2017 AAEA annual meeting, July 31, 2017, in Chicago, IL.

The results point to a high sensitivity of the poor's consumption to agricultural productivity as well as to stronger impacts on the urban poor than on the rural poor. The current situation is already characterized by severe food insecurity, such that a decline in agricultural productivity is likely to further plunge the urban poor into a deep food crisis. By contrast, positive agricultural productivity trends may help alleviate poverty and food insecurity. Agricultural productivity may indeed affect the poor's food consumption mainly through large changes in agricultural prices and real incomes.","[Zidouemba, Patrice Relouende] Polytech Univ Bobo Dioulasso, Rural Dev Inst, Bobo Dioulasso 1091 01, Burkina Faso; [Gerard, Francoise] UR 47 GREEN Gest Ressources Renouvelables & Envir, 45bis,Ave Belle Gabrielle, F-94736 Paris, France",,"Zidouemba, PR (通讯作者)，Polytech Univ Bobo Dioulasso, Rural Dev Inst, Bobo Dioulasso 1091 01, Burkina Faso.",patrice.zidouemba@gmail.com; francoise.gerard@cirad.fr,"Francoise, GERARD/GQQ-2448-2022","ZIDOUEMBA, Patrice Relouende/0000-0002-7389-5605",,,,,64,11,12,2,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

Design/methodology/approach - Using the citation analysis method, this paper analyzed the distributional characteristics and evolution of source periodicals, fields, authors and topics of 2,203 highly cited journal papers from the database of China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and 189 cited journal papers from database of Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) in agricultural economics first-authored by Chinese scholars from 2006 to 2015. Findings - First, over the past decade, agricultural economics research in China has seen a rapid development. Specially, 103 scholars and 42 institutes have played key roles in the development, and 12 Chinese periodicals and 3 international journals have been the most influential outlets. Second, the coverage of the topics in Chinese agricultural economics research is broad and has expanded over the past decade. The rural land issue has been the most popular topic, while the issues regarding rural institutional arrangements and industrialization in rural areas have been explored extensively. However, issues in other fields, such as agricultural markets and trade, rural labor, food safety, etc. have to be further studied. Third, the improvements of economic theory and quantitative analytic techniques, the supports from research funding, and an increase in the collaboration between Chinese scholars and those from other countries have made great contribution to the rapid development of Chinese agricultural economics research over the past decade. Originality/value - This paper is an original work that identifies the most influential journal papers including highly cited journal papers from CNKI and cited journal papers from SSCI, using citation frequency and standard Essential Science Indicators method. This is a contribution relative to the methods used by previous studies, which did not account for frequency of citation of a paper. Moreover, this study is based on data from two databases, CNKI and SSCI, suggesting that the coverage of sample papers is broader compared to those of previous studies.","[Chen, Qiuhong] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Rural Dev Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Qiuhong] China Agr Univ, Natl Agr & Rural Dev Res Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Geng, Ning] Shandong Normal Univ, Dept Publ Adm, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Kan] Lanzhou Univ, Dept Management, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; China Agricultural University; Shandong Normal University; Lanzhou University,"Chen, QH (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Social Sci, Rural Dev Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Chen, QH (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Natl Agr & Rural Dev Res Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China.",chenqiuhong66@126.com,"CHEN, QING/IXN-5937-2023; Chen, QH/GXH-3158-2022; chen, qian/HKE-2403-2023","CHEN, QING/0000-0001-5250-1710;",,,,,16,11,12,3,89,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Results showed that demand for rice with respect to prices and expenditure is relatively inelastic compared to other foods. Demand for food in general tends to be less elastic at higher levels of income and for urban households. In the short term, a market shock such as a 10% decrease in income or a 30% increase in rice prices forces households to spend a larger portion of their expenditure on rice at the expense of other foods. Low-income households face a higher risk of undernourishment as their daily calorie intake is more negatively affected by the shocks than high-income households. The results suggest the importance of policies that provide necessary safety net programs for the poor.","[Hoang, Hoa K.] Univ Missouri, FAPRI, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, 101 Pk De Ville Dr,Suite E, Columbia, MO 65203 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Hoang, HK (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, FAPRI, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, 101 Pk De Ville Dr,Suite E, Columbia, MO 65203 USA.",hoangh@missouri.edu,"Hoang, Hoa T.

We develop a structural vector autoregression model of a commodity futures market and use it to explain two recent spikes in cotton prices. In doing so, we make two contributions to the literature on commodity price dynamics. First, we estimate the extent to which cotton price booms and busts can be attributed to comovement with other commodities. Finding such comovement would be necessary but would not be sufficient evidence to establish that broad-based financial speculation drives commodity prices. Second, after controlling for aggregate demand and comovement, we develop a new method to point identify shocks to precautionary demand for cotton separately from shocks to current supply and demand. To do so, we use differences in volatility across time implied by the rational expectations competitive storage model. We find limited evidence that financial speculation caused cotton prices to spike in 2008 or 2011. We conclude that the 2008 price spike was driven mostly by precautionary demand for cotton, and the 2011 spike was caused by a net supply shortfall.","[Janzen, Joseph P.] Montana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Econ, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Smith, Aaron; Carter, Colin A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Smith, Aaron; Carter, Colin A.] Giannini Fdn Agr Econ, Davis, CA USA",Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Janzen, JP (通讯作者)，Montana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Econ, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",joseph.janzen@montana.edu,,,"Economic Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture [58-3000-9-0076]","Economic Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA))","This article is based on work supported by a Cooperative Agreement with the Economic Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture under Project Number 58-3000-9-0076.

Namely, as all countries of the SEE strive to be full members of the EU; market opportunities have been changing, primarily because of the reduced barriers on trade with the EU, as well as with the regional countries. In order to investigate the effects of the liberalization process of the agri-food sector of the SEE countries on their export, as well as the total foreign trade, a gravity model based on panel data in the period 2005-2015 has been estimated. According to the results, liberalization of the market in the SEE countries, as a consequence of the EU enlargement process, as well as regional integrations, had positive effects on the total foreign trade of agri-food products. Despite the positive liberalization effects on the agri-food trade, all SEE countries have a lower level of competitiveness than the EU countries, so an organized access to products which possess comparative advantages will be an important condition for the achievement of their particular positions at the international market.","[Matkovski, Bojan; Zekic, Stanislav; Savic, Mirko; Radovanov, Boris] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ Subot, Novi Sad, Serbia",University of Novi Sad,"Matkovski, B (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ Subot, Novi Sad, Serbia.",bojan.matkovski@ef.uns.ac.rs,"Matkovski, Bojan/ABF-8436-2021; Savic, Mirko/AGG-9050-2022","Matkovski, Bojan/0000-0003-2563-3843; Zekic, Stanislav/0000-0003-3872-1332",,,,,20,8,8,0,7,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

A complex methodology of family farm sustainable economic development assessment based on the family farm sustainable economic development index has been created following analysis of family farm sustainable economic development assessment methodologies, which are proposed by scientists and used in practice. The Kruskal-Wallis test and hierarchical cluster analysis were used to check the relevance of the index in family farm sustainable economic development assessment. The index value range was calculated using descriptive statistics. The characteristics of the index allow creating models for family farm sustainable economic development classification types based on k-means clustering. The family farms were classified into nine types. Examples of Lithuanian family farms were provided to demonstrate practical applications of the index. Furthermore, analysis of Lithuanian family farm sustainable economic development types by specialisation enabled to identify the main reasons for the existing situation in the farms.","[Savickiene, Jurate; Miceikiene, Astrida] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Savickiene, J (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Kaunas, Lithuania.",jurate.savickiene@asu.lt,,"Savickiene, Jurate/0000-0001-8826-2459; Miceikiene, Astrida/0000-0003-1432-7971",,,,,24,19,21,13,103,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Since that time, the degree of competition in crop markets has been a central concern of policymakers, donors, and researchers. We review the evidence on that topic by first developing a conceptual framework to guide our analysis, then discussing the findings from four categories of literature. We have two main findings. First, there is a paucity of empirical evidence on this question, which hinders our ability to draw strong conclusions. Second, that point notwithstanding, the evidence that does exist is broadly supportive of the notion that crop markets are competitive. The dominant themes in the literature are that trading profits are highly variable, trader entry and exit rates are high, and price co-movements between markets suggest relatively efficient levels of competitive arbitrage. It is possible that the high costs of entry foster non-competitive conditions at the level of large-scale, long-distance subnational trade, but we find no positive evidence to that effect, only the satisfaction of certain necessary conditions.","[Dillon, Brian] Univ Washington, Evans Sch Publ Policy & Governance, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Dambro, Chelsey] Catholic Relief Serv, Baltimore, MD USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Dillon, B (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Evans Sch Publ Policy & Governance, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",bdillon2@uw.edu,,,Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1134677]; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1134677] Funding Source: Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates FoundationBill & Melinda Gates Foundation Grand Challenges Explorations InitiativeCGIAR); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation),"Brian Dillon is an assistant professor in the Evans School of Public Policy and Governance, University of Washington.

The promotion of natural resource management (NRM) technologies is widely seen as more sustainable to increase agricultural productivity and food security. Relatively little is known about how input subsidies affect farmers' decisions to adopt NRM technologies. There are concerns of incompatibility, because NRM technologies are one strategy to reduce the use of external inputs in intensive production systems. However, in smallholder systems of Africa, where the average use of external inputs is low, there may possibly be interesting complementarities. Here, we analyse the situation of Malawi's Farm Input Subsidy Program (FISP). Using panel data from smallholder farm households, we develop a multivariate probit model and examine how FISP participation affects farmers' decisions to adopt various NRM technologies, such as intercropping of maize with legumes, use of organic manure, water conservation practices and vegetative strips. As expected, FISP increases the use of inorganic fertilizer and improved maize seeds. Yet, we also observe a positive association between FISP and the adoption of certain NRM technologies. For other NRM technologies, we find no significant effect. We conclude that input subsidies and the promotion of NRM technologies can be compatible strategies.","[Koppmair, Stefan; Qaim, Matin] Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany; [Kassie, Menale] ICIPE, Nairobi, Kenya; [Kassie, Menale] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Mex, Mexico",University of Gottingen; International Centre of Insect Physiology & Ecology (ICIPE); CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT),"Koppmair, S (通讯作者)，Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany.",stefan.koppmair@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Kassie, Menale/ADT-2906-2022; Qaim, Matin/P-4489-2016","Kassie, Menale/0000-0002-6754-2432; Qaim, Matin/0000-0003-4143-0763",,,,,41,23,25,1,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

I demonstrate that the authors offer no consistent, underlying philosophical basis for when the federal government should (and should not) intervene and offer no framework for making tradeoffs when proposed guarantees come into conflict. Moreover, the authors misjudge the trajectory and impacts of changes in food and agriculture and thus overstate the urgency and scope for intervention.

Central to the Masters Hypothesis are three basic tenets: (i) long-only commodity index funds were directly responsible for driving futures prices higher; (ii) the deviations from fundamental value were economically very large; (iii) the impact was pervasive across commodity futures markets. There has been a great deal of empirical research on the Masters Hypothesis and commodity market bubbles. However, surprisingly few studies have found evidence that directly support the main tenets of the Masters Hypothesis. Some have attributed the lack of supporting evidence to the low-power of time-series tests, market efficiency issues and a lack of conditioning variables within models. In this paper, we address each of these issues using updated data and new empirical approaches. Still, price behaviour consistent with the Masters Hypothesis is surprisingly difficult to find in the data. This is an important finding given the on-going policy debate and regulations proposed or being implemented to limit speculative positions in these markets.","[Sanders, Dwight R.] Southern Illinois Univ, Dept Agribusiness Econ, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Irwin, Scott H.] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Agr Mkt, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Sanders, DR (通讯作者)，Southern Illinois Univ, Dept Agribusiness Econ, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA.",dwights@siu.edu,"Irwin, Scott H./AAN-1996-2020; Irwin, Scott H./CAA-2702-2022","Irwin, Scott H./0000-0003-4556-0848; Irwin, Scott H./0000-0003-4556-0848",,,,,54,19,23,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

Implicit in this line of research is the assertion that the traditional quadratic model of crop yield suffers from specification bias. This article examines this assumption by using the Flexible Fourier Transforms (FFT) to allow for global flexibility in the weather effects while also maintaining the traditional quadratic model as a nested model specification. In order to speak to the global flexibility of FFT, as well as to provide both robustness to outliers and information on the scale effects of weather variables, this article compares FFT with restricted cubic spline (RCS) and quadratic models in a quantile regression framework. Using U.S. county-level data on corn, soybeans, and winter wheat from 1975 to 2013, we find that while the threshold effects are largely captured by the traditional quadratic model, we statistically reject the hypothesis that the quadratic model is sufficiently flexible. We find that, under the more flexible FFT functional forms, at lower temperatures there is a greater positive impact of marginal increases in temperature on yield than with the quadratic model, which suggests a different yield-temperature relationship than found in much of the literature on threshold effects of temperature on crop yields, and is more consistent with the positive effects of minor temperature increases found in some of the Ricardian climate effect literature.","[Cooper, Joseph] Econ Res Serv, Market & Trade Econ Div, USDA, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [Wallander, Steven] Econ Res Serv, Resource & Resource & Rural Econ Div, USDA, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [Tran, A.

This requirement, however, has not been met in practice. We develop a proposal by Meilke to use quota prices as measures of comparative advantage. We evaluate the quota price approach and other proposed methods, from a Hayekian and Coasean market process perspective.

The conclusions can be generalized for medium-sized and large companies. The results show that investment subsidies from the RDP had not such a significant effect as expected. Investment subsidies from the RDP affected only the labour productivity of large meat processors and the ROA of non-family companies. However, they should preferably help small and medium-sized companies to be more competitive.

The average principle, the marginal principle, and the linear combination principle are derived for the competitive behaviour, collusive behaviour, and Cournot behaviour, respectively. The Nash equilibrium and economic efficiency in the cooperative system are then discussed. Finally, the model is numerically solved in an illustration. The marginal principle ensures the cooperative system to remain socially optimal in the competitive market.","[Wang, Yung-Chang] Chinese Culture Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Taipei, Taiwan",Chinese Culture University,"Wang, YC (通讯作者)，Chinese Culture Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Taipei, Taiwan.",ycwwang@yahoo.com.tw,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,12,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Agricultural scientists are less likely to recommend a single-plant enterprise for a region because of risk and return concerns. From a risk/return perspective, a plant enterprise selection problem can be considered as a portfolio optimisation problem. We use a multiple benchmark tracking error (MBTE) model to select an optimal plant enterprise combination under two goals. A cardinality constraint (CC) is used to efficiently balance multiple objectives and limit over-diversification in a region. We use Chinese national and province level datasets from multiple plant enterprises over 25 years to identify the best plant enterprise combination with two objectives under consideration: return maximisation and risk minimisation. A simulated case using discrete programming is applied in order to analyse a farmer's choice of specific plant enterprise and the transaction cost during rotation. In the continuous problem, the MBTE model is found to be efficient in choosing plant enterprises with high returns and low risk. The inclusion of a CC in the MBTE model efficiently reduces the plant enterprise number and volatility while creating smaller tracking errors than the MBTE model alone in an out-of-sample test. In the discrete problem, a CC can be used to search for the optimal number of plant enterprises to obtain high returns and low risk. The study and methods used can be helpful in choosing an optimal enterprise combination with multiple objectives when there are over-diversification concerns.","[Ma, Qiuzhuo] Guangdong Univ Foreign Studies, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Paudel, Krishna P.] Louisiana State Univ, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Paudel, Krishna P.] LSU Agr Ctr, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Gu, Liting; Wen, Xiaowei] South China Agr Univ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Guangdong University of Foreign Studies; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; South China Agricultural University,"Paudel, KP (通讯作者)，LSU Agr Ctr, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.;Paudel, KP (通讯作者)，Louisiana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, 225 Martin Woodin Hall, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",kpaudel@agcenter.lsu.edu,,"Paudel, Krishna/0000-0002-9780-5520",key project of the National Science Foundation of China: Research of Food Risk Identification and Early Warning In the Production and Supply Process [71633002]; United States Department of Agriculture Hatch/Multistate project [LAB 94358],key project of the National Science Foundation of China: Research of Food Risk Identification and Early Warning In the Production and Supply Process; United States Department of Agriculture Hatch/Multistate project,"The authors would like to sincerely thank Teo Chung Piaw, Zhichao Zheng, and Yunchao Xu for many stimulating discussions.

It examines whether there are differences in the effect according to business location - rural or urban, the agricultural supply chain and according to CAP Pillars. A microeconomic approach is employed, based on firm data from FAME dataset combined with detailed subsidies information from Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The generalised method of moments (system GMM) is used to estimate the effect of CAP payments in both static and dynamic models of employment. The results suggest positive net spillovers of CAP payments to non-farm employment. Although the magnitude of the effect is small, it is economically significant. In general, Pillar 1 has a stronger positive employment effect relative to Pillar 2. However, Pillar 2 payments have a stronger positive effect per Euro spent in rural areas and within agricultural supply chain.","[Rizov, Marian] Univ Lincoln, Lincoln, England; [Davidova, Sophia; Bailey, Alastair] Univ Kent, Canterbury, Kent, England",University of Lincoln; University of Kent,"Rizov, M (通讯作者)，Univ Lincoln, Business Sch, Lincoln LN6 7TS, England.",mrizov@lincoln.ac.uk,,"Rizov, Marian/0000-0002-8895-1980; Bailey, Alastair/0000-0002-4682-3251",,,,,41,12,14,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0165-1587,1464-3618,,EUR REV AGRIC ECON,Eur.

A popular narrative paints a picture whereby opioid overdoses among white, male, less-educated, rural workers have been caused by reduced economic opportunities borne by such people. In this article, we causally test the validity of this theory by using Bartik-type variables to explore the relationship between local economic conditions and county opioid overdose death rates. We add to the literature by exploring how both employment and wage growth in different types of industries are related to opioid overdose deaths for the population as a whole, as well as for rural (vs. urban), male (vs. female) and white (vs. black) populations. We find mixed evidence. Our results confirm that wage and employment growth in industries more likely to employ low-skill workers are important protective factors for rural, white males. However, we also find evidence that economic improvements in low-skill industries are just as important in protecting blacks and women against opioid overdoses, and for workers in metro counties. We also find evidence that employment growth in high-paying industries has led to increases in opioid overdoes rates.","[Betz, Michael R.; Jones, Lauren E.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Human Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Betz, MR (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Human Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",betz.40@osu.edu,"Betz, Michael/I-5430-2013; Jones, Lauren E/GQZ-4156-2022","Jones, Lauren E/0000-0002-6236-7874",National Institutes of Health [P2C-HD058484]; Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center's SEED grant,National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center's SEED grant,"This research was supported by National Institutes of Health grant P2C-HD058484, distributed through the Ohio State University's Institute for Population Research.

Decisions on financing and regulating agricultural GHG mitigation are often informed by cost-effectiveness analysis of the potential GHG reduction in the sector. A commonly used tool for such analysis is the bottom-up marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) which assesses mitigation options and calculates their cumulative cost-effective mitigation potential. MACCs are largely deterministic, typically not reflecting uncertainties in underlying input variables. We analyse the uncertainty of GHG mitigation estimates in a bottom-up MACC for agriculture, for those uncertainties capable of quantitative assessment. Our analysis identifies the sources and types of uncertainties in the cost-effectiveness analysis and estimates the statistical uncertainty of the results by propagating uncertainty through the MACC via Monte Carlo analysis. For the case of Scottish agriculture, the uncertainty of the cost-effective abatement potential from agricultural land, as expressed by the coefficient of variation, was between 9.6% and 107.3% across scenarios. This means that the probability of the actual abatement being less than half of the estimated abatement ranged from <1% (in the scenario with lowest uncertainty) to 32% (in the scenario with highest uncertainty). The main contributors to uncertainty are the adoption rate and abatement rate. While most mitigation options appear to be win-win' under some scenarios, many have a high probability of switching between being cost-ineffective and cost-effective.","[Eory, Vera; Topp, Cairistiona F.

Research on biofortified orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP) has shown that the crop improves the vitamin A status of children who consume as little as 100 grams per day, and intensive promotion strategies improve dietary intakes of vitamin A in field experiments. However, little is known about OFSP adoption behavior, or about the role that nutrition information plays in promoting adoption and changing diet. We report evidence from similar randomized field experiments conducted in Mozambique and Uganda to promote OFSP. We further use causal mediation analysis to study impact pathways for adoption and dietary intakes. Despite different agronomic conditions and sweet potato cropping patterns across the two countries, the project had similar impacts, leading to adoption by 61% to 68% of farmers exposed to the project, and doubling vitamin A intakes in children. In both countries, two intervention models that differed in training intensity and cost had comparable impacts relative to the control group. The project increased the knowledge of key nutrition messages; however, added knowledge of nutrition messages appears to have minimally affected adoption, conditional on assumptions required for causal mediation analysis. Increased vitamin A intakes were largely explained by adoption and not by nutrition knowledge gained, though in Uganda a large share of impacts on vitamin A intakes cannot be explained by mediating variables. Similar impacts could likely have been achieved by reducing the scope of nutrition trainings.","[de Brauw, Alan; Gilligan, Daniel O.; Kumar, Neha] IFPRI, Washington, DC 20005 USA; [Eozenou, Patrick] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Meenakshi, J.

Design/methodology/approach The authors estimate fixed effect models to track the changes in agro chemical consumption at household level over time and evaluate the effect of certified food production, using an unbalanced panel data set covering 4,830 households in six provinces over the period 2005-2013. Findings On average, the authors do not find significant effects of certified food production on either chemical fertilizer or pesticide consumption among Chinese farmers. The effects are heterogeneous across villages, but the heterogeneous effects show no clear pattern that is consistent with different types of certification. The findings are robust to the use of alternative panel structure and certification indicators. The lack of knowledge about certification among farmers, the price premium and differences in regulation enforcement across regions may explain why the authors do not find negative effects on agro chemical use. Practical implications This study suggests that careful inspections and strong enforcement of certified food production is needed to ensure that the environmental goals of certified food production can be achieved and the reputation of certification in China can be improved. The inspection of certification producers and the enforcement of current regulations should be stricter for the further healthy development of certified food production in China. Originality/value This study is the first attempt to systematically evaluate the impact of food certification on the use of agro chemicals in Chinese agriculture.","[Nie, Zihan; Heerink, Nico] Wageningen Univ, Dev Econ Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Heerink, Nico] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Publ Adm, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Tu, Qin] Beijing Normal Univ, China Inst Innovat & Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Jin, Shuqin] Res Ctr Rural Econ, Minist Agr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Jin, Shuqin] Wageningen Univ, Environm Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Nanjing Agricultural University; Beijing Normal University; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs; Wageningen University & Research,"Nie, ZH (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Dev Econ Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.",zihan.nie@wur.nl,"Heerink, Nico/AAA-2045-2020","Heerink, Nico/0000-0002-9911-3501",,,,,36,12,12,2,49,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Case of Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition standards,AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS-ZEMEDELSKA EKONOMIKA,,,English,Review,,,,,,groundwater protection; producers; rural development,KNOWLEDGE; MANAGEMENT; NETWORKS,"This review focuses on Czech implementation of standards for soil and water protection called Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions (GAEC), with linkage to the European Union (EU) level. I investigate different elements of adaptive institutional economics: (i) summarise current knowledge regarding the social reasons for introducing GAEC; (ii) assess the evidence linked to GAEC to better understand the potential as well as boundaries of formalizing cause-effect links; (iii) clarify the pertinence of producers' claims on costs accruing from GAEC implementation. These three points highlight the thesis of this paper: implementation in farmers' practices of the theoretical concept of sustainability in terms of bridging together economics, society and the environment. The economic reasoning for GAEC introduction within adaptive institutional economics stems from the relational positioning of the knowledge of the costs of the impact of agricultural land use on other characteristic rural land uses. GAEC are needed, albeit the size of support obtained by producers surpasses the costs of complying; therefore, the result pays off for farms. We have learned that GAEC implementation is important from regional to EU levels and that its role is more related to economic institutional adaptation than to regulation. Adaptation of institutional economics is therefore feasible, making it possible to understand GAEC as a network which manages and enables knowledge transfer linked directly to regulation. Institutional economics can link sustainability with farmers' practices and accounts for the behaviour of the farmers. In this review, I find that, for society, it is necessary to require measurement of agri-environmental outcomes for water resources, soil and biodiversity through GAEC at appropriate scales. These scales are likely to be relevant to adaptive institutional economy localities perceived by the rural public.","[Polakova, Jana] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Agroecol & Biometeorol, Fac Agrobiol Food & Nat Resources, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Polakova, J (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Agroecol & Biometeorol, Fac Agrobiol Food & Nat Resources, Prague, Czech Republic.",jpolakova@af.czu.cz,"Polakova, Jana/AIE-0269-2022; Poláková, Jana/AAY-1366-2021","Poláková, Jana/0000-0001-6166-1943","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)","Supported by the Institutional Support Programme for long-term conceptual development of a research institution of the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic.",,46,1,1,0,7,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Then the authors examined the role of education as the moderator of the interrelations between social capital, learning and the adoption of crop management practices. Design/methodology/approach Based on a survey of 317 small farmers from three districts of Southern Punjab, the authors used structural equation modeling and bootstrapping to test these relationships. Findings The study confirms that bonding social capital and bridging social capital are positively related to the adoption of best crop management practices. Moreover, the authors empirically demonstrate that exploitative and explorative learning act as the parallel mediators between social capital and the adoption of best crop management practices. Practical implications By focusing on building social capital and maintaining meaningful interactions with the social networks, the small farmers can improve their existing methods and practices of managing the existing varieties of crops.

Smoothing, like any other type of forecast inefficiency, implies that some of the information in these forecasts is predictable. Based on the evidence of smoothing, we decomposed market surprise and forecast revision into predictable and unpredictable components. Our results show that futures markets tended to react only to the unpredictable component, therefore indicating that market participants were aware of smoothing and adjusted for it in forming their price expectations.","[Isengildina-Massa, Olga] Virginia Tech Univ, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Karali, Berna] Univ Georgia, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Irwin, Scott H.] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Irwin, Scott H.] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Lawrence J Norton Chair Agr Mkt, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Isengildina-Massa, O (通讯作者)，Virginia Tech Univ, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",oimassa@vt.edu,"Irwin, Scott H./CAA-2702-2022; Irwin, Scott H./AAN-1996-2020","Irwin, Scott H./0000-0003-4556-0848; Irwin, Scott H./0000-0003-4556-0848; Isengildina Massa, Olga/0000-0002-2024-5385; Karali, Berna/0000-0001-7969-7506",,,,,23,4,4,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

It uses the agent-based simulation package Mathematical Programming-based Multi-Agent Systems (MPMAS) to capture nonseparable production and consumption decisions at household level, considering livestock and eucalyptus sales for consumption smoothing, as well as farmer responses to policy interventions. We find the promotion of new maize and wheat varieties to be an effective adaptation option, on average, especially when accompanied by policy interventions such as credit and fertilizer subsidy. We also find that the effectiveness of available adaptation options is quite different across the heterogeneous smallholder population in Ethiopia. This implies that policy assessments based on average farm households may mislead policy makers to adhere to interventions that are beneficial on average albeit ineffective in addressing the particular needs of poor and food insecure farmers.","[Berger, Thomas; Troost, Christian; Wossen, Tesfamicheal; Latynskiy, Evgeny] Univ Hohenheim, Hans Ruthenberg Inst, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany; [Wossen, Tesfamicheal] Int Inst Trop Agr, PMB 82, Abuja, Nigeria; [Tesfaye, Kindie] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr, POB 5689, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Gbegbelegbe, Sika] Int Inst Trop Agr, POB 30258, Lilongwe, Malawi",University Hohenheim; CGIAR; International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA),"Berger, T (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Hans Ruthenberg Inst, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany.",thomas.berger@uni-hohenheim.de,,"Troost, Christian/0000-0003-4626-7117; Wossen, Tesfamicheal/0000-0003-3793-7078; Tesfaye, Kindie/0000-0002-7201-8053","CGIAR program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) through CIMMYT; Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts; Universities of the State of Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany","CGIAR program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) through CIMMYT(CGIAR); Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts; Universities of the State of Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany","Thanks are due to Gerald Shively and two anonymous reviewers for their most helpful comments.

I develop a model of trade between a farmer and a middleman, allowing for middlemen to differ in terms of their social preferences, and provide an empirical test of the theory using a framed field experiment carried out in India. The model predicts a non-monotonic relationship between the benefit of information and the cost of switching to a new middleman. I find that actual middlemen do differ with regard to their social preferences, and that the benefit of information to the farmer varies with the cost of switching. While it is not possible to confirm a non-monotonic relationship between the benefit of information and the cost of switching based on these data, the results are consistent with the predictions of the model.","[Mitchell, Tara] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Econ, Dublin, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin,"Mitchell, T (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Econ, Dublin, Ireland.",mitchet@tcd.ie,,,"Suntory and Toyota International Centres for Economics and Related Disciplines (STICERD), LSE","Suntory and Toyota International Centres for Economics and Related Disciplines (STICERD), LSE","Tara Mitchell is an assistant professor in the Department of Economics, Trinity College Dublin.

An ordered probit regression estimated changes in WMC as a first-order Markov process. The most important determinants of post-resistance cost increases were initial WMCs, adoption of labor-intensive remedial practices, and wick application of herbicides. Cultivation and mechanical/chemical-intensive practices did not increase WMCs. Post-resistance changes in WMC ranged between $85 and $138 ha(-1), depending on the practices adopted. WMCs increased by $88 ha(-1) when cost-neutral practices were adopted.

However, in the case of weekly price series, increasingly available, the testing procedures usually applied in this step are not suitable to deal with evolving seasonal effects. In this study, a method of testing for seasonal unit roots in weekly series of agricultural prices is described. When the deterministic seasonal component does not remain constant over time, the restricted evolving spline model (RESM) is shown to be a useful parametric formulation to capture the deterministic seasonal pattern. Therefore, the RESM model should be included as a deterministic component in auxiliary regression for unit root tests at seasonal frequencies. This proposal is applied to three weekly series of Canary Islands banana prices. From the standard seasonal unit root tests, the null hypothesis is failed to be rejected at the 5% or 10% significance level at some seasonal frequencies for each one of the series. Once critical values are obtained by simulation exercises when the RESM model is included, the hypotheses of unit root are rejected at each one of the seasonal frequencies for all of the three series.","[Caceres-Hernandez, Jose Juan; Martin-Rodriguez, Gloria] Univ La Laguna, Fac Econ Empresa & Turismo, Dept Appl Econ & Quantitat Methods, San Cristobal la Laguna, Spain",Universidad de la Laguna,"Cáceres-Hernández, JJ (通讯作者)，Univ La Laguna, Fac Econ Empresa & Turismo, Dept Appl Econ & Quantitat Methods, San Cristobal la Laguna, Spain.",jcaceres@ull.es; gmartinr@ull.edu.es,"Caceres-Hernandez, Jose Juan/ABH-1360-2020; Cáceres-Hernández, José Juan/C-1436-2009","Caceres-Hernandez, Jose Juan/0000-0003-0092-8864;",,,,,47,6,6,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Eswaran and Kotwal (1986) famously derive this inverse farm-size/productivity relationship from the structure of agrarian production. The focal prediction of their model is that, in otherwise equivalent economies, a more egalitarian land distribution raises both output and producer welfare. The traditional (spot) procurement system implicit in the Eswaran and Kotwal model, however, diverges fundamentally from modern (contractual) procurement practices. We therefore develop a new model of agrarian production in order to determine whether the introduction of a modern value chain alters the welfare effects of land redistribution. The inverse farm-size/productivity relationship persists in our model, but we find that more egalitarian land distribution leads to nonmonotonic changes in producer welfare. We also find that the introduction of a modern sector can harm the laboring classes.","[Henderson, Heath] Drake Univ, Coll Business & Publ Adm, Econ, Des Moines, IA 50311 USA; [Isaac, Alan G.] Amer Univ, Dept Econ, Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA",Drake University; American University,"Isaac, AG (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, Dept Econ, Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",aisaac@american.edu,,"Isaac, Alan/0000-0003-1344-587X",NSF [BCS-1039497],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Heath Henderson is an assistant professor of economics at Drake University, College of Business and Public Administration.

Focusing on vertical markets such as the food chain, this Address considers developments in theory, methods and data that help economists understand how information is conveyed between food consumers and agricultural producers. Central to this understanding is the increasingly important role played by the food industry (retailing, manufacturing and processing) in price transmission. Not only is the food industry a major source of the price changes that producers and consumers face but it also mediates price signals originating in other parts of the food chain in increasingly nuanced ways, as revealed by highly detailed retail (scanner') data that is becoming progressively available to researchers. While the speed, magnitude and asymmetry of price transmission are valuable descriptors of price adjustment in vertical markets, we should be wary of inferring too much about the competitive setting on the basis of prices alone. Theory-consistent empirical models are a step in the right direction and represent a useful complement to the approaches developed in the New Empirical Industrial Organisation literature which address the issue of market power directly. Being the mechanism underlying food inflation, price transmission also has an important macro-economic dimension, and concerns about competition surface here too. Given the rapidly changing nature of the food industry in many countries, the need to understand the forces shaping price transmission is as cogent as ever.","[Lloyd, Tim] Bournemouth Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Econ, Bournemouth, Dorset, England",Bournemouth University,"Lloyd, T (通讯作者)，Bournemouth Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Econ, Bournemouth, Dorset, England.",tlloyd@bournemouth.ac.uk,,,,,,,81,46,46,0,56,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

The key to our research design is that extension visits vary between agents (some agents give more consultation than others), which leads to random variation in treatment. We find that the service affects nutrient utilization, which possibly reduces leakages and eutrophication in the Baltic Sea. A large and positive impact on farms value added implies that the net benefit from the extension services is positive. The improvements are mainly due to better land management practices so that more efficient use of fertilizers increases crop production and thereby decreases the nitrogen balance.","[Nordin, Martin] Lund Univ, AgriFood Econ Ctr, POB 730, SE-22007 Lund, Sweden; Lund Univ, Dept Econ, POB 730, SE-22007 Lund, Sweden",Lund University; Lund University,"Nordin, M (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, AgriFood Econ Ctr, POB 730, SE-22007 Lund, Sweden.",martin.nordin@nek.lu.se,,,,,,,34,11,13,1,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Political decisions, especially these related to the agricultural sector, may be treated as of a great importance. As a consequence, farm owners seek to diversify their sources of income and run other strategies aiming to stabilize their earnings i.e. by off-farm activities. The paper selected key groups of the determinants of the off-farm income with the aim to evaluate the current state and to propose further steps of the detailed analysis. The authors identified the mechanisms how the particular instruments influence farmers' decisions on generating the off-farm income. It may be concluded that the significance of direct payments is still very high. Subsidies generally discourage farmers from the non-agriculture employment. The influence of socio-demographic characteristics is significant, however, the strength of this impact is determined by the additional factors like the situation in the labour market. In case of environmental determinants, it should be noted that there is a limited group of factors that may be out of control by the farm operators. The value added of the article is an attempt to identify the mechanisms how the particular instruments may influence farmers' decisions on generating the off-farm income.

We assess changes in the structure of articles, including increased article length, reliance on mathematical modeling and empirical analysis, and the dramatic rise in collaborative publication in the form of expanding co-author teams. We also explore changes in the degree of topical specialization and the geographic coverage of research published in AJAE. We use co-authoring relationships to construct collaboration networks specific to the journal and document the striking increase in the density of these networks.

While some research has found a correlation between food deserts and consumer outcomes, it is unclear whether food deserts truly affect consumer choices. In this article, we compare food prices in food deserts, defined as low-income, low-access census tracts, and nonfood deserts to observe whether and to what extent consumers face higher prices for a complete diet in food deserts. If a nutritionally complete diet costs significantly more in food deserts, resident consumers may be constrained from consuming healthier foods. We use store-level scanner data from a nationally representative sample and calculate a census-tract level Exact Price Index (EPI) based on a food basket defined by the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP). The EPI addresses potential biases from both product heterogeneity and variety availability. We find that the overall price impact of living in a food desert is small; low-access areas have only 3.5% higher EPI than high-access counterparts. However, consumers who are constrained to shop within their own census tracts face a much higher EPI than high-access counterparts (9.2%). The higher EPI primarily comes from lower variety availability in food deserts.","[Fan, Linlin] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Starkville, MS 39762 USA; [Baylis, Kathy; Gundersen, Craig] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Champaign, IL USA; [Ver Ploeg, Michele] ERS, USDA, Washington, DC USA",Mississippi State University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Fan, LL (通讯作者)，Mississippi State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Starkville, MS 39762 USA.",lfan3@illinois.edu,,"Ver Ploeg, Michele/0000-0001-8476-7281",,,,,42,15,18,5,64,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Drawing on a unique primary panel data set from a representative cross section of 35 tea estates in Sri Lanka over the period 2002-2014, this study implements a structural model of estate profit maximisation to estimate the elasticity of labour demand with respect to different components of weather. Results indicate a negative relationship between labour demand and rainfall in the south-west monsoon, the north-east monsoon and the second inter-monsoon. A positive relationship is found between labour demand and rainfall in the first inter-monsoon. Overall, predicted changes in rainfall by 2050 are anticipated to reduce labour demand by approximately 1,175,000 person-days per year across Sri Lanka's tea plantation sector.

This study presents an updated meta-analysis to explore the source of HB and methods to mitigate it. While previous meta-analysis on this topic often involves a few dozen articles, this analysis includes 131 studies after reviewing over 500 published and unpublished articles. This enables the inclusion of several important factors that have not been investigated before. These include relatively recent willingness to pay elicitation methods such as choice experiments and the Turnbull lower bound estimator. Newly emerged HB reduction techniques such as consequentiality and certainty follow-up treatments are also included. For explanatory variables that have been examined in previous studies, this analysis does not always report consistent findings. In particular, holding everything constant and contrary to commonly-held beliefs, the method of auction does not offer much reduction to HB compared to more conventional methods such as a referendum vote. However, choice experiment, cheap talk, consequentiality and certainty follow-up all significantly contributed to explaining and mitigating the magnitude of HB.

Using reports prepared for program participants by the extension agency, customized surveys were used to collect data on whether recommended practices were adopted. Data were also collected from producers who were willing but unable to participate in the program due to its unexpected cancellation. A count model compared the number of practices adopted by participants and nonparticipants to evaluate the program's efficacy, and a probit model using participants' adoption data were used to understand factors affecting adoption. Simple, low-cost, and easily trialed practices were adopted at high rates, though some higher cost practices associated with observable benefits were also adopted at moderate or high rates. Farm-specific characteristics, such as size, tenure, or group membership were also significantly linked to the likelihood of adoption. Results suggest that the extension program was successful in encouraging adoption of environmentally beneficial practices with caveats; project completion and quality were not verified, and decreasing marginal returns to extension efforts may have been realized within the small participant pool.","[Rollins, Curtis L.; Simpson, Stephanie R.; Boxall, Peter C.] Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, 515 Gen Serv Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada",University of Alberta,"Boxall, PC (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, 515 Gen Serv Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada.",rollins1@ualberta.ca; stephanie.r.simpson@gmail.com; pboxall@ualberta.ca,"Rollins, Curtis/AAB-1782-2019","Rollins, Curtis/0000-0002-4508-694X",Linking Environment and Agriculture Research Network (LEARN); Alberta Land Institute,Linking Environment and Agriculture Research Network (LEARN); Alberta Land Institute,We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Linking Environment and Agriculture Research Network (LEARN) and the Alberta Land Institute.

Using panel data from Ethiopia, we investigate the role of social capital and the covariate risk of climate change and their interaction. We find that households with greater social capital tend to be more specialised, implying that diversification and informal insurance are substitutes in the mitigation of risk. We also find that this effect is significantly weaker in regions more prone to climate change, which is consistent with the average farmer being aware that informal insurance is not an effective protection against risks that affect the entire social network.

We exploit an experiment on the dissemination of biochar, a soil amendment that can improve fertility on weathered and/or degraded soils. We find that social networks transmit information about the average benefits of adoption, but also its risk, and that observed variability inhibits uptake to a greater degree than positive average results engender it. Paradoxically, this relationship is stronger among networks that do not discuss farming, but disappears among farmer networks that do. This is resolved with a simple model of social learning about conditional, rather than unconditional benefit distributions. As farmers observe factors associated with outcomes in their networks, they constrain the distribution of their own potential outcomes. This conditional distribution diverges from the unconditional distribution that the econometrician observes. We conclude that social learning is characterized by implicit model-building by sophisticated decision makers, rather than simple herding towards observed good results.","[Crane-Droesch, Andrew] Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC 20024 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Crane-Droesch, A (通讯作者)，Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC 20024 USA.",andrew.crane-droesch@ers.usda.gov,,,USAID Development Innovation Ventures [AID-OAA-F-00016]; U.S. Government's Feed the Future program through a Borlaug Fellowship in Global Food Security; International Food Policy Research Institute; Center for Effective Global Action; Innovations for Poverty Action,USAID Development Innovation Ventures(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); U.S. Government's Feed the Future program through a Borlaug Fellowship in Global Food Security; International Food Policy Research Institute(CGIAR); Center for Effective Global Action; Innovations for Poverty Action,"Andrew Crane-Droesch is a research economist for the Economic Research Service, USDA.

Primary research, consisting of a questionnaire survey, was used to study the awareness of these issues among the rural population. Based on the selected results of both the primary and secondary research, the authors conclude that a possible path to social inclusion, is, alongside specific social services, social farming, which harmonizes the potential of the rural natural environment with the attitudes of the rural population (the actors and observers of social inclusive activities within their locality).

Findings Households renting-in land trended to plant more maize, and the more land was rented by a household the more maize was planted, while wheat acreage showed non-response to farmland renting-in. Practical implications Overall, the analysis suggests that policy makers should be prepared for different changing trends of grain crop acreage across the nation as farmland transfer continues. Future research should pay attention to the effect of farmland transfer on agricultural productivity and rural household income growth.

Design/methodology/approach A multinomial endogenous treatment effects model which accounts for selection bias was used. Findings The results show that outsourcing decisions are driven mainly by the size of the farm, the age of the household head and other household characteristics. Further, the authors find that outsourcing labor for pest and disease control has no significant effect on pest control cost and rice yields, though it reduces the number of pesticide applications. Conversely, outsourcing of professional services can increase rice yields by 4.1 percent, and at the same time it increases pest and disease control costs by 50.6 percent. However, it is found that outsourcing of professional services exerts no significant impact on the farm profitability. Practical implications This study suggests that households with large farm size are more likely to outsource professional services and, therefore, service providers and governments should target those farmers to provide incentives and create greater awareness of the benefits from the outsourcing of professional services. Moreover, the increase in yields along with the government subsidy justifies the outsourcing of professional services by farmers. However, service providers and policy makers have a lot of leeway to come up with cheaper methods for pest and disease management in rice production. Originality/value This study is the first attempt to simultaneously evaluate the determinants and impacts of outsourcing pest and disease management on rice production in China.","[Sun, Dingqiang; Rickaille, Michael; Xu, Zhigang] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing Agricultural University,"Xu, ZG (通讯作者)，Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",zgxu@njau.edu.cn,"Xu, Zhigang/B-4370-2017",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473122, 71333008, 71573133]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD)",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD),"The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos 71473122, 71333008 and 71573133) and a project Funded by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD).

To assess the sensitivity of maize prices to ethanol production, this study explores the linkage between the U.S. ethanol market and developing countries' maize prices. The econometric approach, based on a panel structural vector autoregression model, captures market interdependencies and the likelihood that developing countries' responses are both heterogeneous and dynamic. The results indicate that the U.S. ethanol market's impacts on maize prices in developing countries are heterogeneous and that coastal countries are more susceptible to U.S. economic shocks. The estimates also suggest that countries more dependent on food imports and/or receiving U.S. food aid are at a higher risk of being affected by such shocks. Overall, the results indicate that those countries with the greatest sensitivity and exposure to global agricultural commodity markets could benefit from domestic policies and international assistance, which reduce their exposure to impacts from the U.S. maize market.","[Hao, Na] Beijing Technol & Business Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Pedroni, Peter] Williams Coll, Dept Econ, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA; [Colson, Gregory] Univ Georgia, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Wetzstein, Michael] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Beijing Technology & Business University; Williams College; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Pedroni, P (通讯作者)，Williams Coll, Dept Econ, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA.",ppedroni@williams.edu,,"Colson, Gregory/0000-0002-9863-4399",,,,,28,14,15,4,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Within this framework we examine how changes in nearby preserved open space and alternative development constraints affect an individual private landowner's decisions regarding both regeneration harvests and conversion dates. We also examine how such policies affect development density once conversion from forestry to residential use occurs. We show that when residential rents change over time, the nature of the timber problem at the urban-forest interface changes because it forces us to allow for the possibility of changes in land use from timber to residential use. As a result, the traditional Faustmann setup is not suitable to study forest management decisions at this interface. We also find that in the presence of rising income, increases in permanently preserved open space hasten regeneration and conversion cuts of a neighboring parcel currently under forest use and leads to lower density development once conversion takes place compared to the case where income is constant. We also find that both a binding development moratorium and a binding minimum-lot-size policy can postpone regeneration and conversion cut dates and thus help to protect open space, even if only temporarily. However, the policies do not have the same effects on development density of converted forestland. While the former leads to high-density development, the latter encourages low-density development.","[Cunha-e-Sa, Maria A.; Franco, Sofia F.] Univ Nova Lisboa, Nova Sch Business & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal; [Franco, Sofia F.] ISEG ULisboa, UECE Res Unit Complex & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa,"Franco, SF (通讯作者)，Univ Nova Lisboa, Nova Sch Business & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal.",sfranco@novasbe.pt,,"Cunha-e-Sa, Maria A./0000-0002-7988-3760",national funds by FCT (Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia); FCT Strategic Project [PEst-OE/EGE/UI0436/2011]; FCT [UID/ECO/00124/2013]; POR Lisboa [LISBOA-01-0145-FEDER-007722]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PEst-OE/EGE/UI0436/2011] Funding Source: FCT,national funds by FCT (Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); FCT Strategic Project(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); FCT(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); POR Lisboa; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),The authors are grateful to Jan K.

This paper contributes to filling this knowledge gap. Using a unique set of spatially disaggregated prices for five different coffee varieties, we examine how the ECX has influenced the dynamics of international and domestic prices for coffee, the largest traded commodity in terms of trade value on the exchange floor. We follow a multivariate Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) approach to assess the extent of market interdependence (conditional correlations) and volatility transmission. We also evaluate structural changes in price dynamics over time.

We use a series of autoregressive models to study price determination, spatial and temporal price transmission, and price variance. We account for district-level agricultural production, correcting for bi-directional causality between output and prices using ground station rainfall data. In addition, to test hypotheses regarding the importance of transportation infrastructure we incorporate information on road and bridge density and fuel costs. For both rice and wheat, we find strong evidence of local price intertemporal carryover and very weak evidence of price transmission from regional, central, and border markets to local markets, suggesting very low degrees of market integration. Fuel costs are positively correlated with food prices, and road and bridge density are negatively correlated with prices. We find evidence of asymmetric effects: positive price shocks are correlated with higher subsequent price volatility compared with negative price shocks of similar magnitude. Roads and bridges are important for moderating price levels and price volatility in Nepal's rice and wheat markets, which explains roughly half of the spatial and temporal variation in price mark-ups between regional and local markets.","[Shively, Gerald] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Thapa, Ganesh] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Kathmandu, Nepal",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Shively, G (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",shivelyg@purdue.edu,,,Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Nutrition; United States Agency for International Development,Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Nutrition; United States Agency for International Development(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"Support for this research was provided by the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Nutrition, which is funded by the United States Agency for International Development.

Eschewing nuclear power, countries are relying on renewable energy sources to meet future energy needs. In this paper, I examine the prospects of reducing GHG emissions by 80% by first summarizing extant global energy sources and production, trends, and projections of energy demand, and the potential mix of future energy sources. I consider the role of conservation and then focus on the electricity sector to determine how wind and biomass could contribute to the 80% target.

We measure the effect of broadband deployment on location decisions of new rural firms. Location-specific fixed effects are controlled by a counterfactual baseline that measures how local broadband service in the early 2000s affected local new firm entry in the early 1990s before broadband was available anywhere. The change in location choice probability of new firms from the counterfactual baseline to the actual response ten years later is the difference-in-differences estimate of the effect of broadband deployment on locations of new firms. We find that broadband availability has a positive and significant effect on location decisions of new firms in rural areas, which is confirmed by a robustness test using ZIP Code dummy variables. The broadband effect is largest in more populated rural areas and those adjacent to a metropolitan area, suggesting that this effect increases with agglomeration economies.","[Kim, Younjun] Univ Nebraska Lincoln, Bur Business Res, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [Orazem, Peter F.] Iowa State Univ, Econ, Ames, IA USA",University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; Iowa State University,"Kim, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska Lincoln, Bur Business Res, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.",younjun7kim@gmail.com,"Orazem, Peter/D-6525-2016","Orazem, Peter/0000-0003-2092-5089",,,,,76,60,66,11,85,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Some food waste analyses seem to treat household food waste as a mistake or careless decision; however, consumer decisions to waste also likely reflect trade-offs and economic incentives. These issues were explored in large surveys of U.S. food consumers using both within- and between-subject designs, where we study consumers' decisions to discard food in different scenarios that vary safety, price, and opportunity costs. We find that food waste is a function of consumers' demographic characteristics, and that decisions to discard food vary with contextual factors.","[Ellison, Brenna] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Lusk, Jayson L.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Ellison, B (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",brennae@illinois.edu,"Carvalho, Raquel/GYJ-7447-2022","Ellison, Brenna/0000-0002-4042-0056",Willard Sparks Endowed Chair at Oklahoma State University,Willard Sparks Endowed Chair at Oklahoma State University,"Brenna Ellison is a Assistant Professor in the Department of Agricultural and Consumer Economics, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and Jayson L.

We found that rice yield exhibited highly nonlinear responses to temperature changes: rice yield increased with temperature up to 28 degrees C and decreased sharply with higher temperatures. Holding current growing seasons and regions constant, average rice yield in China is projected to decrease by 10-19 per cent by 2050 and 11-33 per cent by 2070 due to future warming under the global climate models HadGEM2-ES and NorESM1-M.

The large gap in lentil yields between Nepal and other lentil-producing countries underscores the importance of improving yields and income of smallholders. When it comes to the financial viability of small farms, particularly in developing countries, and globalisation, contract farming (CF) may prove useful in achieving efficiency and profitability in smallholder lentil farms in Nepal. This study employs the propensity score matching approach to examine the effects of the adoption of CF on yields, profitability and costs of smallholder lentil farms in Nepal. Findings from this study reveal that contrary to popular belief, CF adoption by lentil producers in Nepal has a positive and significant effect on per-hectare revenues, profits and yield and a negative impact on variable and transportation costs. The study finds that only very smallholder lentil farms (0.01-0.05 ha) benefit from CF.","[Mishra, Ashok K.] Arizona State Univ, WP Carey Sch Business, Morrison Sch Agribusiness, 7271 E Sonoran Arroyo Mall, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA; [Kumar, Anjani; Joshi, Pramod K.] IFPRI South Asia, New Delhi, India; [D'Souza, Alwin] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ USA",Arizona State University; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Mishra, AK (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, WP Carey Sch Business, Morrison Sch Agribusiness, 7271 E Sonoran Arroyo Mall, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA.",Ashok.K.Mishra@Asu.edu,"Dsouza, Alwin/AAM-1870-2020; Kumar, Anjani/AAP-3673-2020; Dsouza, Alwin/J-6922-2019; Kumar, Anjani/AGO-6128-2022","Dsouza, Alwin/0000-0003-3461-9736; Dsouza, Alwin/0000-0003-3461-9736;",,,,,63,28,28,2,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

We explore this question in the context of rural Ethiopia using a 2014 cross-sectional dataset indicating whether or not youth household members from a previous 2010 survey had migrated by 2014, and in which sector they worked in 2014. We estimate a household fixed effects model and exploit exogenous variation in the timing of land redistributions to overcome endogenous household decisions about how much land to bequeath to descendants. We find that larger expected land inheritances significantly lower the likelihood of long-distance permanent migration and of permanent migration to urban areas. Inheriting more land also leads to a significantly higher likelihood of employment in agriculture and a lower likelihood of employment in the non-agricultural sector. Conversely, the decision to attend school is unaffected. These results appear to be most heavily-driven by males and by the older half of our youth sample. We also find suggestive evidence that several mediating factors matter. Land inheritance is a much stronger predictor of rural-to-urban permanent migration and non-agriculturalsector employment in areas with less vibrant land markets, in relatively remote areas (those far from major urban centers), and in areas with lower soil quality. Overall, these results affirm the importance of push factors in dictating occupation and migration decisions in Ethiopia.","[Kosec, Katrina; Ghebru, Hosaena; Holtemeyer, Brian; Schmidt, Emily] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Mueller, Valerie] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Kosec, K (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",k.kosec@cgiar.org,,"Schmidt, Emily/0000-0003-0109-7687","CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets; IFPRI's Ethiopia Strategy Support Program; United States Agency for International Development (USAID); U.K. Department for International Development (DfID)","CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets; IFPRI's Ethiopia Strategy Support Program; United States Agency for International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); U.K. Department for International Development (DfID)","Katrina Kosec is a senior research fellow, Hosaena Ghebru is a research fellow, Brian Holtemeyer is a senior research assistant, and Emily Schmidt is a research fellow, all at the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI).

The model considers management decisions of heterogonous producers within an intertemporal framework, with the decision to join the cooperative assumed to be endogenous. Farm-level data of apple farmers from three provinces in China are used to estimate the impact of cooperative membership on investment in organic soil amendments and chemical fertilizer. A recursive bivariate probit model that accounts for potential endogeneity of cooperative membership and selection bias is employed in the empirical analysis. The empirical results show that cooperative membership exerts a positive and statistically significant impact on the likelihood of investing in organic soil amendments. The findings also reveal that tenure security, human capital, farm size, and access to credit positively and significantly influence the probability of a farmer joining a cooperative and the likelihood of investing in soil quality measures.","[Ma, Wanglin] Lincoln Univ, Dept Global Value Chains & Trade, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Abdulai, Awudu] Univ Kiel, Dept Food Econ & Consumpt Studies, Kiel, Germany; [Goetz, Renan] Univ Girona, Dept Econ, Girona, Spain",Lincoln University - New Zealand; University of Kiel; Universitat de Girona,"Abdulai, A (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Food Econ & Consumpt Studies, Kiel, Germany.",aabdula@food-econ.uni-kiel.de,"Ma, Wanglin/M-7744-2019; Abdulai, Awudu/AAI-3517-2021; Goetz, Renan/G-3158-2015","Ma, Wanglin/0000-0001-7847-8459; , Awudu/0000-0003-4618-2789; Goetz, Renan/0000-0002-4672-8502",German Research Foundation (DFG); Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad Spain [ECO2016-75927-R],German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad Spain(Spanish Government),Awudu Abdulai acknowledges the support of the German Research Foundation (DFG).

Design/methodology/approach Based on the provincial panel data during 1995-2014, the agricultural productivity of China and its regional disparity are analyzed. First, the agricultural TFP and its decomposition are dynamically evaluated by means of data envelopment analysis-Malmquist productivity index. Second, the agricultural radial production efficiency in year 2014 and the input redundancy changes from 1995 to 2014 are measured based on the BCC-slacks-based measure model. Findings The results showed that the overall agricultural TFP of China grew 4.3 percent annually during 1995-2014, mainly as a result of technical progress. However, the declines of technical efficiency and scale efficiency slowed down the agricultural TFP growth. The TFP growth in the Western region and Central region far exceeded the Eastern region in last few years. In 2014, most effective decision-making units were in the Western region. The input redundancies in the agricultural production increased substantially after 2006, especially for the pesticide use amount, reservoir capacity and agricultural machinery power. Originality/value Combining the dynamic and static analyses, the paper fulfilled the study of China's agricultural productivity and the input redundancies in recent years, and also presented the regional disparities.","[Diao, Panpan; Zhang, Zhonggen] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Management, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Jin, Zhenyong] Henan Agr Univ, Sch Foreign Studies, Zhengzhou, Henan, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; Henan Agricultural University,"Zhang, ZG (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Sch Management, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",zhgzhang@zju.edu.cn,,,,,,,57,22,23,2,43,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

By including region-by-year fixed effects in our econometric equation, we compare changes in farm sales and expenditures in states that lift restrictions on interstate banking to changes in states that do not lift such restrictions within the same census region. Our estimates indicate that county-level farm sales increase by about 3.4% and county-level net farm income rises by $1.57 million (in 1982 dollars) after a state deregulates its banking sector by allowing interstate bank expansion. We also find evidence that farm expenditures, in particular expenditures on feed, fuel, machine and equipment rental, as well as interest payments, grew as a result of the banking deregulation. The positive impacts on farm sales, net income, and interest payments are larger in metropolitan counties than in rural counties, consistent with the notion that interstate bank entry following deregulation was concentrated in larger metropolitan markets, leading to a greater reduction in the cost of credit in those areas.","[Kandilov, Amy M.

Design/methodology/approach The study uses data from official statistical yearbooks and the satellite remote sensing image data of Landsat TM 30m. Multivariate analysis is conducted to examine the effect of labor cost, difficulty in replacing agricultural input factors and other factors underpinning changes in grain acreage and grain structure adjustment. Findings The heterogeneity of changes in grain acreage and proportion of arable area for grain production are mainly determined using the labor cost and difficulties in the replacement of agricultural input factors. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to systematically analyze the heterogeneity in restructuring grain production at provincial level and its causes. The results not only provide evidence of grain production restructuring at regional level, but also contribute to the understanding of the law of structural change in agricultural production.","[Zheng, Xuyuan; Liu, Weiping] Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Econ, Fuzhou, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Xu, Zhigang; Ying, Ruiyao] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Ye, Chunhui] Zhejiang Univ, Chinese Acad Rural Dev, Sch Publ Affairs, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Fujian Agriculture & Forestry University; Nanjing Agricultural University; Zhejiang University,"Ying, RY (通讯作者)，Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",yry@njau.edu.cn,"Xu, Zhigang/B-4370-2017",,"National Social Science Foundation of China [13ZD160, 14ZDA038]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71573133, 71603053]; Outstanding Youth Science Foundation of Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University [xjq201734]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD); China Center for Food Security Studies in Nanjing Agricultural University; Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program [ASTIP-IAED-2015-03]; Center for Food Security Studies in Jiangsu; Center for Modern Grain Circulation and Security Collaborative Innovation in Nanjing University of Finance and Economics",National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Outstanding Youth Science Foundation of Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD); China Center for Food Security Studies in Nanjing Agricultural University; Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program; Center for Food Security Studies in Jiangsu; Center for Modern Grain Circulation and Security Collaborative Innovation in Nanjing University of Finance and Economics,"The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from National Social Science Foundation of China (Nos 13 & ZD160; 14ZDA038), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos 71573133; 71603053), Outstanding Youth Science Foundation of Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University (No. xjq201734), the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD), China Center for Food Security Studies in Nanjing Agricultural University, the Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program (No. ASTIP-IAED-2015-03), Center for Food Security Studies in Jiangsu and Center for Modern Grain Circulation and Security Collaborative Innovation in Nanjing University of Finance and Economics.",,31,4,4,5,61,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Transmission across differentiated agricultural products is important to investigate, but it has not been explored given its complexities for assessment. Using data from Australian cattle markets, we examine the dynamics of Meat Standards Australia price premium transmission between states. An impulse response function analysis using Bayesian vector autoregression with sign restriction identification shows that shocks to prices and price premiums are partially transmitted contemporaneously between markets and it takes several weeks to complete transmission. In addition, we find an asymmetry of price and price premium shocks originating in Southern Queensland that have an inverse immediate impact in New South Wales, and take months to transmit the usual price response. This outcome may be explained by differences in cattle availability in each state, which can be related to forage availability due to weather conditions. Based on these results, producers can forecast fluctuations on price premiums and adjust their cattle supply accordingly.","[Morales, Luis Emilio] Univ New England, Sch Business, Agr Econ, Armidale, NSW, Australia; [Hoang, Nam] Univ New England, Sch Business, Econometr, Armidale, NSW, Australia; [Stuen, Eric] Univ Idaho, Dept Business, Econ, Moscow, ID 83843 USA",University of New England; University of New England; Idaho; University of Idaho,"Morales, LE (通讯作者)，Univ New England, Sch Business, Agr Econ, Armidale, NSW, Australia.",emilio.morales@une.edu.au,"Stuen, Eric/AAD-8332-2020; Morales, Luis/I-2166-2019; Hoang, Nam/H-5549-2018","Morales, Luis/0000-0001-6935-9634; Hoang, Nam/0000-0003-2938-1209",,,,,41,2,2,1,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

The density ratio approach models individual densities as distortions from a common baseline density. We introduce a probability integral transformation to the density ratio method that simplifies the modeling of distortion functions. We further present an implementation approach based on the Poisson regression, which facilitates model estimation and diagnostics. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate good finite sample performance of the proposed method. We apply this method to estimate the corn yield distributions of ninety-nine Iowa counties, and to calculate crop insurance premiums. Lastly, we illustrate that we can employ the proposed method to effectively identify profitable insurance policies.","[Zhang, Yu Yvette] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Zhang, YY (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",yzhang@tamu.edu,,"ZHANG, YU YVETTE/0000-0003-2708-338X",,,,,41,18,21,5,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Flexible repayment schedules allow a redistribution of principal payments during periods with low agricultural returns to periods when agricultural returns are high through predefined grace periods. We apply propensity score matching to investigate how different numbers of grace periods reflecting different levels of production diversification affect the credit risk of crop farmers. In this attempt, three delinquency categories reflecting various levels of credit risk are assessed. Moreover, we consider the specifics of the regions where loans were disbursed. Our results reveal that loans with predefined grace periods show significantly higher delinquencies. This effect is significant over all three delinquency categories for loans disbursed to low diversified crop farmers. For the more diversified farmers, this effect is only significant for the lowest delinquency category. Hence, predefined grace periods might bridge periods with low agricultural returns but come at the cost of higher credit risk for the lender. The magnitude of these effects is, however, small.","[Weber, Ron; Musshoff, Oliver] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Weber, Ron] KfW Dev Bank, Sect Policy Unit Financial Sect Dev, Palmengartenstr 5 9, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Weber, R (通讯作者)，Georg August Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.;Weber, R (通讯作者)，KfW Dev Bank, Sect Policy Unit Financial Sect Dev, Palmengartenstr 5 9, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany.",ron.weber@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Mußhoff, Oliver/AAZ-1868-2021","Mußhoff, Oliver/0000-0002-3746-623X",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG),Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The authors are grateful to the management and the employees of Access Microfinance Holding AG in Berlin and Access Bank in Madagascar for providing the data and supporting us during the eye-opening field visits.

Here we use annual data from 1983 to 2010 covering the 50U.S. states to examine the impact of Extension on net changes in the number of farmers. The historical transition of farmers out of U.S. agriculture raises the question of whether Cooperative Extension and underlying Hatch-funded research spending keeps farmers in agriculture or accelerates their exit. On balance, nearly 500,000 more farmers left than entered agriculture over the period studied. We estimate that without Extension, as many as 137,700 (or 28%) additional farmers would have disappeared on net. Overall, Extension programs are a remarkably cost effective way of keeping farmers in agriculture. Alternatively, shifting just 1.5% of federal farm program payments to Extension would have reduced net exits over this period by an estimated 11%, or 55,000 farmers.","[Goetz, Stephan J.] Penn State Univ, Northeast Reg Ctr Rural Dev, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Goetz, Stephan J.] Penn State Univ, Natl Agr & Rural Dev Policy Ctr, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Goetz, Stephan J.] Penn State Univ, Dept Agr Econ Rural Sociol & Educ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Davlasheridze, Meri] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Marine Sci, Galveston, TX 77553 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Texas A&M University System,"Davlasheridze, M (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Marine Sci, Galveston, TX 77553 USA.",davlashm@tamug.edu,,", Meri/0000-0001-5468-7192; Goetz, Stephan/0000-0003-4529-552X","NIFA/USDA [2014-51150-22094]; NIFA [2014-51150-22094, 687260] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",NIFA/USDA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),"The authors thank Mary Ahearn, John Mann, and George Morse for valuable discussion or suggestions; nevertheless the authors are solely responsible for any remaining errors or omissions.

The aim of the paper is, therefore, to analyse the direction and intensity of action of the selected internal corporate factors and external factors of the macro-environment on the financial structure of Czech and Slovak agricultural enterprises and to identify differences in the action of these factors between the Czech and Slovak companies. The methods of multiple regression and correlation analysis have been used as the main research methods. The achieved results pointed at the fact that in addition to the internal corporate factors, the external factors of the macro-environment were also statistically highly significant for certain groups of agricultural enterprises. The paper also points to some differences in the direction and intensity of action of the chosen factors on the examined level of debt - the total indebtedness and the credit indebtedness of the studied agricultural enterprises.","[Kalusova, Lenka; Badura, Peter] Univ Econ Bratislava, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Kalusova, L (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Bratislava, Slovakia.",kalusova.lenka1@gmail.com,"Badura, Peter/ABH-7665-2020","Badura, Peter/0000-0003-2477-2438; Kalusova, Lenka/0000-0002-4968-3266",Slovak and Czech enterprises [I-15-104-00]; [VEGA 1/0004/13],Slovak and Czech enterprises;,"The work is a creative output of the grant task of the VEGA 1/0004/13 Recent Trends and Methods of Financial Management and Their Impact on Enterprise Financial Stability and Young Teachers', Researchers', and Ph.

Labour and capital taxes lead to higher prices for agricultural products, causing a decrease in consumer demand and lower income for agricultural producers (mostly utilizing marginal land). A polynomial single-product model has been used to demonstrate that reducing the tax burden on agricultural producers - specifically taxes on labour and capital - will result in increases in differential land rents on the average and relatively better plots, and/or the emergence of the rent on the marginal land. Thus, substituting labour and capital taxes for land/property taxes reduces the overall tax burden of agricultural producers on marginal lands.","[Rymanov, Alexander] Novosibirsk State Univ Econ & Management, Dept Corp Governance & Finance, Novosibirsk, Russia",Novosibirsk State University of Economics & Management,"Rymanov, A (通讯作者)，Novosibirsk State Univ Econ & Management, Dept Corp Governance & Finance, Novosibirsk, Russia.",rymanov@yandex.com,"Rуmаnоv, Аlеxаndеr/I-4475-2013","Rуmаnоv, Аlеxаndеr/0000-0002-2085-0681; Rymanov, Aleksandr/0000-0002-4061-4918",,,,,22,5,5,3,17,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Our findings reveal that China's growth in agricultural imports is highly concentrated among a small group of firms, where the top 10% of Chinese agricultural importers account for nearly 90% of its agricultural imports. We also find evidence of a significant turn-over of importers of agri-food products. Over 40% of new firms entering China's agricultural import market during our sample exited after just 1.7 years. Finally, decomposing import growth patterns for Canada and its competing suppliers reveals significant differences in the intensive and extensive margins of trade that hold important implications for trade policies aimed at enhancing Canada's position as a major agri-food supplier in the Chinese market.","[Xie, Chaoping] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Gao, Jianfeng] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Grant, Jason H.] Virginia Tech, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Ctr Agr Trade, Blacksburg, VA USA; [Anders, Sven] Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, Edmonton, AB, Canada",Nanjing Agricultural University; The World Bank; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; University of Alberta,"Xie, CP (通讯作者)，VirginiaTech, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",xiecp@vt.edu,,"Anders, Sven/0000-0001-8261-6973; Gao, Jianfeng/0000-0001-8711-9423",International Agricultural Trade Research Consortium [CP-2017],International Agricultural Trade Research Consortium,"International Agricultural Trade Research Consortium, Grant/AwardNumber: CP-2017",,37,5,5,3,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

It argues that a common thread linking many of the challenges is the need for more effective models of communication so that our economic concepts, ideas and research findings can be more timely, better understood and, most importantly, have greater impact. Five important challenges are examined: loss of trust in experts; emotions and decision making; the role of the media; the roles of agri-food and rural economists; and competition from other disciplines and interests. A good practice communications framework is then proposed embodying ten important communication principles: understanding the target audience; understanding the political context of decision makers; generating a robust evidence base; building reputation and credibility; need for cross disciplinary working; consulting with stakeholder groups; getting the timing right; producing high quality presentations; making use of social media; and being prepared for challenges. Four stereotypical categories of communication incorporating different standards of rigour and relevance are identified: Ivory tower; Gold Standard; Populist; and Quicksand. Responses by the Agricultural Economics Society and the European Association of Agricultural Economists to the need for more accessible communications via the development of the innovative outreach journal EuroChoices are outlined.","[Davis, John] AFBI, Econ, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Davis, John] Queens Univ, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland",Agri-Food & Biosciences Institute; Queens University Belfast,"Davis, J (通讯作者)，AFBI, Econ, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland.;Davis, J (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland.",john.davis@afbini.gov.uk,,,,,,,48,7,7,2,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

The first is the decades long food insecurity crisis faced by sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries which is still prevalent. The second is the negative impact greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture may have on future food production and which is likely to worsen the food insecurity problem. The conundrum SSA farmers face is how to increase food output through productivity growth while minimizing GHG emissions. To measure changes in productivity growth and GHG emissions, this study evaluates the agricultural performance of 18 SSA countries by utilizing the Malmquist-Luenberger index to incorporate good and bad outputs for the years 1980-2012. The empirical evidence demonstrates that productivity is overestimated when bad outputs are not considered in the production model. The analysis provides a better understanding of the effectiveness of previous mitigation methods and which informs an appropriate course of action needed to achieve the twin objectives of increasing agriculture productivity while reducing GHG emissions.","[Majiwa, Eucabeth] Jomo Kenyatta Univ Agr & Technol, Res Prod & Extens Div, Nairobi, Kenya; [Lee, Boon L.; Wilson, Clevo] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture & Technology; Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Lee, BL (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",bl.lee@qut.edu.au,"Lee, Boon/K-5178-2019","Lee, Boon/0000-0002-3594-0575; MAJIWA, EUCABETH/0000-0003-0262-715X; Wilson, Clevo/0000-0002-3885-0495",,,,,59,11,12,1,56,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

The decline in the number of average-sized farm and the growth in the number of large farms are due primarily to technological innovations that push operations producing commodities to grow as a means of capturing economies of size. The increase in the relative number of small farms is also due partially to technical advances that allow for the production of food goods with the desired quality attributes to be delivered to the appropriate market. This market is continually being differentiated due to demographic and income shifts. The growing heterogeneity in farm structure complicates the assessment and design of farm policy. The social policy objective of improving the livelihood of farmers and their families could be achieved through farm support and extension programs when the sector was homogeneous. The policy objective has shifted toward improving the competitiveness of the sector, but for which of its components? The trend toward greater heterogeneity is likely to continue and thus so will the internal and external support for any policies targeted toward the farm sector.","[Weersink, Alfons] Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ FARE, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University of Guelph,"Weersink, A (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ FARE, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",aweersin@uoguelph.ca,"Weersink, Alfons/O-1521-2019","Weersink, Alfons/0000-0001-5081-3593","Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA)","Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA)","Helpful comments and suggestions were provided by Brady Deaton, Lauren Benoit, Kelly Hodgins, Travis Jansen, and editors of the CJAE.

This paper investigates the effects of spatial spillover of agricultural R&D on regional economic growth across EU-28 NUTS-II regions in the period 1995-2014. In particular, we extend previous studies by considering spillover in all sectors of agricultural R&D performance including business enterprise, government and higher education. The spatial Durbin panel data model is employed to estimate brooders effect including direct and indirect effects. Empirical results show a positive effect of agricultural R&D and its spatial spillover on regional growth in all performance sectors. Moreover, the impact of spatial spillover of agricultural R&D on regional growth depends on the performance of the R&D sectors; positive spillovers are stronger in the business enterprise sector. Finally, the interaction effect between the economic output of the agricultural sector of each region with that of its neighbours is significantly positive.","[Anousheh, Shahrzad; Hojabr-Kiani, Kambiz] Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Dept Econ, Tehran, Iran; [Mojtahed, Ahmad] Allameh Tabatabai Univ, Dept Econ, Tehran, Iran; [Mojtahed, Ahmad; Ranjbar, Homayoun] IAU Isfahan Khorasgan Branch, Dept Econ, Esfahan, Iran",Islamic Azad University; Allameh Tabataba'i University,"Hojabr-Kiani, K (通讯作者)，Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Dept Econ, Tehran, Iran.",hojabrkianik@gmail.com,,,,,,,41,3,3,0,26,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

We also quantify heterogeneity among households along the wealth spectrum regarding their ability to adapt to evolving weather patterns. This approach yields two key findings. First, adverse weather history prompts households to devote more time to maize cultivation on their own farms, to the detriment of other, possibly more remunerative income sources. Households also reduce application of productivity-enhancing inputs, such as fertilizer and improved maize varieties, in response to adverse weather history. Our results are robust to different clustering structures and falsification tests aimed at ruling out alternative explanations to observed trends. Second, we find that, by maintaining a more diversified income structure, wealthier households are better able to adapt to adverse weather history. Consequently, adverse changes in past weather may be regressive in nature, creating a climate-induced poverty trap that locks poor smallholder households into low-value maize cultivation from season to season. This finding suggests that developing more weather-resilient maize varieties and promoting smallholder livelihood diversification strategies may help mitigate the effects of adverse weather on the most vulnerable households.","[Sesmero, Juan; Ricker-Gilbert, Jacob] Purdue Univ, Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Cook, Aaron] Penn State Univ, Dept Agr Econ Sociol & Educ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Sesmero, J (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",jsesmero@purdue.edu,,,"USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) [2014-51130-22492]; Purdue Research Foundation; Department for International Development (DFID)/Malawi; USAID/Malawi; USAID's Environment, Growth, and Technology Division","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA); Purdue Research Foundation; Department for International Development (DFID)/Malawi; USAID/Malawi(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); USAID's Environment, Growth, and Technology Division(United States Agency for International Development (USAID))","This study received support from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), Grant no. 2014-51130-22492, and the Purdue Research Foundation.

Results show that the negative impacts of a cereal price increase substantially outweigh the effects of price volatility on household welfare across the entire income distribution. The amplitude and the distribution of those effects depend heavily on specific factors, such as: the weight of food consumption over total expenditure; the budget share devoted to cereals; the substitution effect among food groups; and the relative number of net sellers versus net buyers accessing the market.

The program relies on cash transfers (rather than asset transfers) in addition to business skills training, business mentoring, and savings. Participation in each of the program's three rounds was randomly determined through a public lottery. In the short-to-medium-run, we find that the program has a positive and significant impact on income, savings, and asset accumulation, similar to more traditional poverty graduation programs that rely on asset transfers.","[Gobin, Vilas J.; Santos, Paulo] Monash Univ, Econ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Toth, Russell] Univ Sydney, Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Monash University; University of Sydney,"Gobin, VJ (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Econ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",vilas.gobin@monash.edu,,,,,,,36,10,11,1,35,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

This paper addresses this question by investigating the causal effect that a farmer's pension program has on the amount of land enrolled in a farmland set-aside program by using a unique dataset in Taiwan as an illustration. The dataset was constructed by compiling administrative profiles of a farmland set-aside program and a farmer's pension program in 2010. The final sample consists of 852,375 parcels of the set-aside land, and the regression discontinuity design model was estimated to cope with the endogeneity bias. Although the social welfare program and the farmland use program have different policy objectives, our empirical results indicate a significant interaction between these two programs. Landowners who received pension payments enrolled 14% more land into the farmland set-aside program than those who received no such payments. In term of policy relevance, our results suggest that a more effective farm safety net can be achieved by considering the interaction between the social welfare and farm production program.","[Chang, Hung-Hao] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Chang, HH (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Taipei, Taiwan.",hunghaochang@ntu.edu.tw,,,,,,,29,3,3,1,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

However, there is concern that a lack of effective competition amongst supermarket retailers has resulted in inflated prices for these products which are deterring consumers from eating more of these healthy foods. We investigate this by examining the nature and extent of price competition for fresh fruits and vegetables amongst UK supermarket retailers, drawing on a panel of weekly retail and corresponding wholesale market prices over a seven-year period. We find that the extent of supermarket competition varies across the products, being quite intense on some but much weaker on others, where the retailers do not fully respond to each other's prices and where the extent of their competitive interaction varies significantly with each other.","[Lan, Hao; Dobson, Paul W.] Univ East Anglia, Norwich Business Sch, Norwich, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia,"Lan, H (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Norwich Business Sch, Norwich, Norfolk, England.",hl545@hotmail.com,,,University of East Anglia; Economic and Social Research Council [RES-000-22-3524],University of East Anglia; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Dr. Lan is the principal author, and acknowledges the assistance and support of his supervisor, Prof. Paul Dobson, leading the Norwich Business School research impact project on encouraging food and drinks vendors to adopt pricing behaviour that helps consumers make informed purchasing decisions and reduce excessive or wasteful consumption.

However, previous SLM studies overlook the tradeoffs involved in maintaining SLM investments over time. We address this limitation by combining a household survey that evaluates the economic impacts of SLM investments and maintenance, with a hydrological model that explores location-specific infrastructure effects. We then use a multi-market model to evaluate the impacts of alternative SLM investments on agricultural production, prices, and incomes over time. Analysis suggests SLM investments must be maintained for at least seven years to show significant increases in value of production, and that terraces on moderate and steep slopes are most effective in increasing agricultural yields. However, the benefits of terracing do not outweigh the cost of foregone off-farm labor opportunities, nor compensate for lower agricultural prices from increased supply. Thus, SLM investments must be paired with other input and infrastructure investments, as well as subsidies for initial labor costs, in order to incentivize adoption and long-term SLM maintenance.","[Schmidt, Emily] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Dev Strategy & Governance Div, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Chinowsky, Paul] Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Robinson, Sherman] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Environm & Prod Technol Div, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Strzepek, Kenneth] MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, Ctr Global Change Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave,54-1312, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Schmidt, E (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Dev Strategy & Governance Div, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",e.schmidt@cgiar.org,,"Schmidt, Emily/0000-0003-0109-7687",,,,,56,12,15,4,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

In this context, a reasonable question relates to what forms of assistance are most equitable for taxpayers and also have desirable properties for farm businesses. In this study it is argued that traditional and current approaches to drought assistance are not equitable and do not provide sufficient protection to farmers from default and thus insolvency risk. But there is an instrument available to government which can be designed to minimise taxpayer subsidies while at the same time delivering insurance for farmers against default: a Revenue Contingent Loan (RCL). Following the principles inherent in the Higher Education Contribution Scheme, a RCL is financial assistance repaid contingent on a farm's capacity to pay, meaning that loan defaults can be avoided. We model the revenue streams associated with a hypothetical loan of this type and illustrate the advantages for a farm business of these kinds of debt.","[Botterill, Linda Courtenay] Univ Canberra, Australian Polit, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Botterill, Linda Courtenay] Univ Canberra, Sch Govt & Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Chapman, Bruce] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Coll Business & Econ, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Chapman, Bruce] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Finance & Actuarial Stat, Coll Business & Econ, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Kelly, Simon] Univ Canberra, Inst Governance & Policy Anal, Canberra, ACT, Australia",University of Canberra; University of Canberra; Australian National University; Australian National University; University of Canberra,"Chapman, B (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Coll Business & Econ, Canberra, ACT, Australia.;Chapman, B (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Finance & Actuarial Stat, Coll Business & Econ, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",Bruce.Chapman@anu.edu.au,"Kelly, Simon/HRE-4393-2023; Kelly, Simon/X-7282-2018","Botterill, Linda/0000-0002-6060-5090; Kelly, Simon/0000-0002-8245-0181","Australian Research Council (ARC) [LP110200496, DP140100311]; Australian Research Council [LP110200496] Funding Source: Australian Research Council",Australian Research Council (ARC)(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"The authors wish to thank the Australian Association of Agricultural and Resource Economics for the invitation to present at the 2016 Annual conference and Lin Crase for input.

The differential approach to the theory of the multiproduct firm is employed to examine ex ante decisions about feed grain demand and livestock supply. The estimation results suggest that livestock producers have little flexibility in adjusting the demand for corn in response to an increase in corn prices. The substitutable relationship between corn and distillers' grains contributes to alleviating pressures on feed costs in response to high corn prices. In addition, the estimation results highlight that the composition of livestock supply can be altered by changes in livestock prices. On the basis of the estimated elasticities, the decompositions of profit-maximizing input demand are conducted to examine the effects of changes in corn prices on feed grain demand and livestock supply. The decomposition results reveal that an increase in corn prices reduces corn demand but raises the demand for distillers' grains mainly due to the substitution effects of corn price changes. The decomposition results also show that an increase in the price of corn reduces cattle supply but raises the supply of chicken and pork due to the output relationships in supply.","[Suh, Dong Hee] Korea Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Coll Life Sci & Biotechnol, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 02841, South Korea; [Moss, Charles B.] Univ Florida, Inst Food & Agr Sci, Food & Resource Econ Dept, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",Korea University; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Suh, DH (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Coll Life Sci & Biotechnol, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 02841, South Korea.",dhsuh@korea.ac.kr,"Moss, Charles/U-5254-2017","Moss, Charles/0000-0002-1172-7112; Suh, Dong Hee/0000-0002-6154-3864",Korea University Grant; National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government [NRF-2014S1A3A2044459],Korea University Grant; National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of Korea),This research was supported by a Korea University Grant and the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2014S1A3A2044459).,,48,12,15,0,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

We fill this knowledge gap by testing whether hiring in tractor services has raised returns to scale in agriculture at the household level in Nepal Terai that has undergone rapid growth in the tractor use through custom-hiring services. Using Switching Regression and Inverse-Probability-Weighted Generalized Method of Moments, we address two sources of endogeneity involved with the estimation of returns to scale; (1) farmers' self-selection on whether to hire in tractor services and (2) use of inputs in the production function. For both Cobb-Douglas and Translog production function specifications, we find that hiring in tractor services significantly increased the returns to scale in agricultural production by about 0.2 approximate to 0.3 among farm households not owning tractors, for which suitable control groups are found.

The crux of their argument is that the internal rate of return assumes intermediate cash flows can be reinvested (or borrowed) at same return as the initial investment, which is generally not correct or reasonable, (page 1492). This article first demonstrates that reinvestment decisions are embodied in the project specification, and that the internal rate of return makes no inherent reinvestment assumption. The article then clarifies the algebraic properties of the marginal internal rate of return and the reinvestment implications of the internal rate of return and modified internal rate of return within the context of public agricultural research evaluation.","[Oehmke, James F.] US Agcy Int Dev, 2-10-269RRB,1300 Penn Ave, Washington, DC 20523 USA",United States Agency for International Development (USAID),"Oehmke, JF (通讯作者)，US Agcy Int Dev, 2-10-269RRB,1300 Penn Ave, Washington, DC 20523 USA.",joehmke@usaid.gov,,,,,,,28,7,8,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

The distributional approach allows one to better understand how school food impacts children prone to low-quality diets separately from those prone to higher-quality diets. Using a fixed-effects quantile estimator, I find notable heterogeneity in the general population-school food has positive impacts below the median of the dietary-quality distribution, and negative but insignificant impacts at upper quantiles. Children demonstrating substantial nutritional needs (i.e., food insecure or receiving free/reduced price meals) exhibit positive impacts at all levels of diet quality with especially high benefits at low quantiles. Although school food programs may not benefit the above-average child, they do improve the diets of the most nutritionally disadvantaged.","[Smith, Travis A.] Univ Georgia, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Smith, TA (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",tasmith@uga.edu,,,,,,,65,32,39,3,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Using detailed trade and firm-level data for Italy and France, we investigate the relationship between trade integration, imported intermediate inputs and firm performance in the food industry. Our main findings show that an increase in import competition spurs firm-level productivity growth. Furthermore, the productivity growth effect attributable to imported intermediate inputs is significantly stronger than the effect due to imported final products. In addition, we find that new imported inputs are of particular importance, especially for Italian food firms, though less so for the French firms. Finally, the productivity growth effect of trade integration tends to be asymmetric across firms: more productive firms gain more from trade integration.

Design/methodology/approach - Using survey data of the agricultural sector obtained from China over two years, the authors highlight the effect of job switching between farm and non-farm activities on the demand for insurance by applying the difference-in-differences and triple differences methodologies. Findings - The results show that compared with farm income, non-farm income is associated with an increased (decreased) demand for insurance among households in Eastern (Western) China. The inequality in degree of economic development between the regions plays an important role in this finding. Both education and income exhibit a positive relationship with insurance demand for most regions. In addition, in 2007, regardless of farm or non-farm sector, switches are (except in the northeast region) associated with a significant increase in insurance expenditures. Households who switched from the farm to non-farm sector in 2007 are significantly negatively associated with insurance expenditures in the western region. Social implications - Inequalities in the degree of economic development play an important role in insurance consumption.

Even so, little is known about the association between NCMS expansion and labor force supply among rural residents in China. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of the NCMS on labor force supply for rural Chinese populations. Design/methodology/approach - Using data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS), a difference-in-differences (DD) approach is employed to estimate the impact of NCMS expansion on labor supply outcomes, including hours of worked in agriculture, off-farm labor force participation, not working, and weeks off due to illness. A number of falsification tests are conducted to identify whether the assumption of common trends of DD analyses is satisfied. The robustness of results is checked through additional estimation, including panel fixed effects and instrumental variable approach. Findings - Results show that the NCMS expansion has a positive effect on the hours of worked in agriculture and off-farm labor force participation, and reduces the likelihood of not working and weeks off due to illness. The effect on hours of agricultural production is larger for male adults, those aged 50 or more, and individuals in low-income families. This study demonstrates the importance of potential health improvements from public health insurance in promoting rural residents' labor productivity. Originality/value - Studies concerning the effects of public health insurance on labor supply in developing countries remain limited. The findings of this study provide important insights into how public health insurance programs, like the NCMS, may affect patterns of labor supply among rural residents, and can help policymakers improve health policies aimed to reduce the number of uninsured farmers while maintaining high levels of labor supply, productivity, and health status among the most vulnerable of populations.","[Shen, Zheng] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Parker, Marie; Fang, Xiangming] Georgia State Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Brown, Derek] Washington Univ, Brown Sch, St Louis, MO USA; [Fang, Xiangming] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Dept Appl Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; Washington University (WUSTL); China Agricultural University,"Fang, XM (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.;Fang, XM (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Dept Appl Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",xmfang@cau.edu.cn,"Brown, Derek S/J-3035-2013; Fang, Xiangming/B-8650-2014; Shen, Zheng/AAD-3458-2019","Brown, Derek S/0000-0001-9908-9882; Shen, Zheng/0000-0001-8178-2419","National Institute for Nutrition and Health; China Center for Disease Control and Prevention; Carolina Population Center [P2C HD050924, T32 HD007168]; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; NIH [R01-HD30880, DK056350, R24 HD050924, R01-HD38700]; NIH Fogarty International Center [D43 TW009077, D43 TW007709]; China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Ministry of Health","National Institute for Nutrition and Health; China Center for Disease Control and Prevention; Carolina Population Center; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NIH Fogarty International Center(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC)); China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Ministry of Health","This research uses data from China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS).

Through two separate studies, we examine the impact of sellers' responses to online NCRs on consumer purchasing intention. Results reveal that product-related NCRs reduce consumer purchasing intentions more than service-related NCRs and having no reaction to NCRs from the sellers decreases consumer purchasing intentions. In addition, consumer trust mediates the relationship between seller's response to online NCRs and consumer purchasing intentions. The results also show that the impact on consumer purchasing intentions can be modified by the type of NCRs and sellers' responses.

We use Nielsen Homescan data to investigate the relationship between store format and the healthfulness of consumers' grocery shopping. Accounting for a rich set of controls, as well as food retail market structure, we simultaneously estimate the healthfulness of consumers' food purchases and the shares of food expenditure at traditional and nontraditional store formations. We find that healthier food choices are generally associated with higher food expenditure shares at supermarkets and supercenters and lower shares at drug stores and convenience stores. In addition, market concentration has a negative effect on shopping healthfulness.","[Volpe, Richard] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Agribusiness Dept, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA; [Jaenicke, Edward C.] Penn State Univ, Dept Agr Econ Sociol & Educ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Chenarides, Lauren] Arizona State Univ, Morrison Sch Agribusiness, WP Carey Sch Business, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Volpe, R (通讯作者)，Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Agribusiness Dept, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA.",rvolpe@calpoly.edu,,,,,,,56,15,17,1,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

The PP provision is defined as the failure to plant an insured crop by the final planting date due to adverse events. If the farmer decides not to plant a crop, the farmer receives a PP indemnity. Late planting (LP) is an option for farmers to plant a crop while maintaining crop insurance after the final planting date. Crop insurance may alter farmers' behavior in selecting PP or LP and could increase the likelihood of PP claims even though farmers can choose LP. This study finds evidence that a farmer with higher insurance coverage tends to choose PP more often (ex-post moral hazard). Spatial panel models attest to the existence of the ex-post moral hazard in PP empirically. Empirical results show that the PP ratio has a positive relationship with insurance coverage in the case of corn production.","[Kim, Taehoo] KREI, Ctr Agri Policy Evaluat, Naju Si 58217, South Korea; [Kim, Man-Keun] Utah State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Logan, UT 84322 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University,"Kim, MK (通讯作者)，Utah State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",mk.kim@usu.edu,,"Kim, Man-Keun/0000-0002-0205-9618",,,,,36,9,12,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Considerable uncertainty remains regarding impacts on crop insurance programs. We utilize a panel of U.S. corn yield data to predict the effect of warming temperatures on the mean and variance of yields, as well as crop insurance premium rates and producer subsidies. While we focus on corn, we demonstrate that the subsidy impacts are likely to carry over to other major program crops. We find that warming decreases mean yields and increases yield risk on average, which results in higher premium rates. Under a 1 degrees C warming scenario, we find that premium rates at the 90% coverage level will increase by 39% on average; however, there is considerable statistical uncertainty around this average as the 95% confidence interval spans from 22% to 61%. We also find evidence of extensive cross-sectional differences as the county-level rate impacts range from a 10% reduction to a 63% increase. Results indicate that exposure to extreme heat and changes in the coefficient of variation are large drivers of the impacts. Under the 1 degrees C warming scenario, we find that annual subsidy payments for the crop insurance program could increase by as much as $1.5 billion, representing a 22% increase relative to current levels. This estimate increases to 3.7 billion (57%) under a 2 degrees C warming scenario. Our results correspond to a very specific counterfactual: the marginal effect of warming temperatures under current technology, production, and crop insurance enrollments. These impacts are shown to be smaller than the forecasted impacts under a commonly used end-of-century general circulation model for even the most optimistic CO2 emissions projection.","[Tack, Jesse] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Coble, Keith] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA; [Barnett, Barry] Univ Kentucky, Dept Agr Econ, Lexington, KY USA",Kansas State University; Mississippi State University; University of Kentucky,"Tack, J (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",jtack@ksu.edu,"Coble, Keith H./A-3090-2008","Coble, Keith/0000-0003-4148-2870",,,,,63,37,42,3,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

In this article, we measure the impacts of the Wheat Initiative package of technologies, and its marketing assistance component alone, on yields among a promotional group of farmers. The package includes improved techniques, improved inputs, and a guaranteed market for the crop. Relying on crop-cut measures and farmers' own assessments, we find that full package led to an average 14% higher yields. Implementation of the Wheat Initiative was successful in making certified seed and fertilizer accessible to farmers and increasing their uptake, though only 61% of the intervention group adopted row planting and few farmers received marketing assistance. The measured yield difference may underestimate the true yield difference associated with the technology because of incomplete adoption of the recommended practices by intervention farmers and adoption of some practices by control farmers.","[Abate, Gashaw Tadesse] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Bernard, Tanguy; de Brauw, Alan; Minot, Nicholas] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20005 USA; [Bernard, Tanguy] Univ Bordeaux, GREThA, F-33600 Pessac, France",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Universite de Bordeaux; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"de Brauw, A (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",a.debrauw@cgiar.org,,"Minot, Nicholas/0000-0001-9657-0427; Bernard, Tanguy/0000-0003-2554-0217","Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; CGIAR Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets","Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); CGIAR Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets(CGIAR)","This article was carried out as part of the Research for Ethiopia's Agricultural Policy (REAP) project funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the REAP project is designed to provide analytical support to the Ethiopian ATA.

We answer this question using a data set that identifies Ontario farmers' conservation practices on their own land as well as the land they rent. Using a fixed-effects regression approach, we find that the role of tenure varies for different types of conservation practices. Farmers were found to be just as likely to adopt a machinery-related practice such as conservation tillage on their rented land as that land which they own. On the other hand, farmers were found to be less likely to adopt site-specific conservation practices such as planting cover crops on rented land. However, this effect diminishes as the expected length of the rental relationship increases when the landlord has a farming background.","[Deaton, B.

Entomologists later determined that rootworms on these fields had developed resistance to the insecticidal proteins produced by Bt-CRW corn. This article explores what corn farmers' seed and soil insecticide choices imply about rootworm resistance in the United States. First, a soil insecticide demand function is derived using a damage-abatement model. Next, this demand function is estimated using field-level data from 2005 and 2010. We find that rootworms (Diabrotica spp.) cost farmers approximately $1.3 billion in 2005 and $2 billion in 2010. When used, Bt-CRW seeds were very effective, reducing average yield losses by approximately five bushels per acre and providing over twice as much control (on average) as soil insecticides. We found no evidence that soil insecticide use was higher on fields where resistance was most likely to develop. However, we did find that demand for soil insecticides was elastic. These results suggest that rootworm resistance was not widespread in 2010, but that it could substantively increase soil insecticide use if it evolved and spread.","[Wechsler, Seth; Smith, David] USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20250 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Wechsler, S (通讯作者)，USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20250 USA.",seth.wechsler@ers.usda.gov,,,,,,,37,57,64,1,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

This study explores the problem of endogenous hub location in fresh produce value chains in the Northeastern United States. To overcome limitations in the literature, we incorporate the effects of economies of scale and production seasonality into our models. Three experimental models are designed to examine the effects of alternatively applying yearly, quarterly, and monthly data on model solutions. We explicitly assess how interactions of scale economies and seasonality influence the structure and spatial attributes of an optimal regional produce aggregation hub system. The three models generate marketed different solutions and in many respects they lead to different conclusions about developing local/regional supply chains. The monthly model allows for production seasonality and actual hub operation cycle frequency and thus leads to more efficient hub solution with rich policy implications.","[Ge, Houtian] Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Canning, Patrick; Perez, Agnes] Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC 20024 USA; [Goetz, Stephan] Penn State Univ, Northeast Reg Ctr Rural Dev, Dept Agr Econ Sociol & Educ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Cornell University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Ge, HT (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",hg434@cornell.edu,,"Goetz, Stephan/0000-0003-4529-552X","U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA); USDA NIFA [2011-68004-30057]; NIFA [2011-68004-30057, 687258] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); USDA NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),This research was partially supported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

We examine farm-and market-level impacts of multiple technology adoption choices using comprehensive household survey data collected in 2010/11 and 2012/13 in Ethiopia. Economic surplus analysis combined with panel data switching endogenous regression models are used to compute the supply shift parameter (K-shift parameter), while at the same time controlling for the endogeneity inherent in agricultural technology adoption among farmers. We find that our improved technology set choices have significant impacts on farm-level maize yield and maize production costs, where the greatest effect appears to be generated when various technologies are combined. The change in maize yield and production costs results in an average 26.4% cost reduction per kilogram of maize output (the K-shift parameter). This increases the producer and consumer surpluses by US$ 140 and US$ 105 million per annum, respectively. These changes in economic surplus help to reduce the number of poor people by an estimated 788 thousand per year. We conclude that deliberate extension efforts and other policies that encourage integration of technologies are important for maize technologies to yield their full potential at both farm and market levels.","[Kassie, Menale; Tessema, Yohannis] Icipe, Nairobi, Kenya; [Marenya, Paswel; Jaleta, Moti] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Zeng, Di] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Erenstein, Olaf; Rahut, Dil] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Texcoco, Mexico",International Centre of Insect Physiology & Ecology (ICIPE); CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); University of Adelaide; CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT),"Kassie, M (通讯作者)，Icipe, Nairobi, Kenya.",mkassie@icipe.org,"Kassie, Menale/ADT-2906-2022; Rahut, Dil Bahadur Bahadur/AAD-8370-2022; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Zeng, Di/O-8947-2019","Kassie, Menale/0000-0002-6754-2432; Rahut, Dil Bahadur Bahadur/0000-0002-7505-5271; Erenstein, Olaf/0000-0002-7491-5786; Zeng, Di/0000-0001-6403-5606","MAIZE Consortium Research Program; Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR); Australian and International Food Security Research Centre (AIFSRC); Sustainable Intensification of Maize-Legume Cropping Systems for Food Security in Eastern and Southern Africa (SIMLESA) Programme; UK aid from the UK government; Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida); Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC); Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), Germany; Kenyan Government","MAIZE Consortium Research Program; Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR)(Australian Ctr Intl Agr Res); Australian and International Food Security Research Centre (AIFSRC); Sustainable Intensification of Maize-Legume Cropping Systems for Food Security in Eastern and Southern Africa (SIMLESA) Programme; UK aid from the UK government(CGIAR); Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida); Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC); Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), Germany; Kenyan Government","This research received support from the MAIZE Consortium Research Program, the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) and the Australian and International Food Security Research Centre (AIFSRC) through the Adoption Pathways Project and the Sustainable Intensification of Maize-Legume Cropping Systems for Food Security in Eastern and Southern Africa (SIMLESA) Programme led by CIMMYT.

Both countries are powerful economic countries in the world, thus we attempt to know whether energy consumption and air pollution vary as the economy develops. The data for the research spanning from 1970 to 2014 was gathered from an indicator of the World Bank. The time span was decided due to the data availability of both countries. To examine the long-run equilibrium relationship, there was performed the ARDL bound test. Results of unit root indicated that all the variables were integrated of order one. In the case of the ARDL bound test, the values of F-statistics exceeded the upper bound value, which means they are statistically significant. The estimation results substantiated the positive coefficient of energy consumption at the 1% significance level in China, implying that air pollution can increase as the energy consumption rises in China. However, the empirical results of the USA were exactly on the contrary. The outcomes of the CUSUM and CUSUMSQ tests revealed that all coefficients in both the short- and long-run models were stable. Based on the above analysis, the study suggests that China should adopt innovation and environmentally friendly modern technologies. Specifically, China ought to inspire and motivate energy saving and low-carbon research innovations, energy saving industries, green investment and carbon sequester technologies as well as public environmental awareness creations to mitigate environmental deterioration and climate change.","[Koondhar, Mansoor Ahmed; Li, Houjian; Liu, Weiwei; He, Ge] Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Management, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Qiu, Lingling] Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Econ, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Sichuan Agricultural University; Sichuan Agricultural University,"He, G (通讯作者)，Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Management, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",hege01@126.com,"he, he/JPL-3505-2023; Koondhar, Mansoor Ahmed/AAH-8768-2019; Koondhar, Mansoor Ahmed/GOJ-8640-2022","Li, Houjian/0000-0003-4852-8042",,,,,66,26,26,1,22,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Using household data drawn from the China Health and Nutrition Survey in 2011, a two-stage demand model is applied to estimate a food demand system for each of the income classes. After obtaining the estimated income elasticities of eight studied food groups for each income class, the authors then examine the responsiveness of food demand to the changes in income distribution by means of four scenarios with varying income distribution. Findings The empirical results indicate that substantial differences in food consumption exist across various income classes. Specifically, the lowest-income households are more sensitive to price and income changes for most studied food groups than the highest-income households are. In general, income responsiveness is higher for meats, aquatic products and dairy products. Based on estimated income elasticities, the projected food consumption under different income distribution patterns shows that changes in income distribution have significant influences on food consumption. In addition, the authors conclude that a more equal distribution of income would be associated with a higher demand for food in rural China. Originality/value This paper employs a two-stage demand model to estimate food demand in rural China by income classes. The results imply substantial differences in food demand for various income classes. Therefore, income distribution should be taken into account instead of an average estimation for the population as a whole when investigating food demand in rural China. Given the significant changes in income distribution in rural China, this study provides several important policy implications to alleviate income inequality and poverty, as well as to improve nutrition for lower-income classes.","[Ren, Yanjun; Loy, Jens-Peter] Univ Kiel, Dept Agr Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Zhang, Yanjie; Glauben, Thomas] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ IAMO, Halle, Saale, Germany",University of Kiel; Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO),"Zhang, YJ (通讯作者)，Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ IAMO, Halle, Saale, Germany.",zhang@iamo.de,"Ren, Yanjun/GXW-1802-2022; , IAMO/G-2328-2012; Loy, Jens-Peter/JKJ-3029-2023","Ren, Yanjun/0000-0002-8384-8925; Glauben, Thomas/0000-0003-0640-9387; Loy, Jens-Peter/0000-0002-4965-1862","National Institute of Nutrition and Food Safety, China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Carolina Population Center [5 R24 HD050924]; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; NIH [R01-HD30880, DK056350, R24 HD050924, R01-HD38700]; Fogarty International Center, NIH; China Scholarship Council; China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Ministry of Health","National Institute of Nutrition and Food Safety, China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Carolina Population Center; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Fogarty International Center, NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC)); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Ministry of Health","This research uses data from China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS).

We propose a model to explain the rationale of nested names, with collective labels being effective in reaching unaware consumers, while individual brands help firms to reach aware consumers. We also incorporate decision-making within the group of producers joining collective labels, taking into account their heterogeneity in providing quality. We show that nested names emerge when consumers become more aware of information on the label's quality, as well as when producers become more heterogeneous. Welfare may decrease, however, when the group switches to nested names because they may lead to lower quality incentives for the majority of producers. Our results also provide insights into the historical and recent trends in food industries, such as within-label differentiation and label fragmentation, as well as their respective welfare implications.","[Yu, Jianyu] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ SWUFE, RIEM, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Bouamra-Mechemache, Zohra] Univ Toulouse Capitole, INRA, Toulouse Sch Econ TSE R, Toulouse, France; [Zago, Angelo] Univ Verona, Dept Econ, Verona, Italy",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; INRAE; University of Verona,"Zago, A (通讯作者)，Univ Verona, Dept Econ, Verona, Italy.",angelo.zago@univr.it,,,European Union [331724]; University of Verona; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71503209]; NSFC-CNRS programme [71711530152],European Union(European Union (EU)); University of Verona; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); NSFC-CNRS programme,The research (by Zago) leading to these results has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement no. 331724 (ProdOrg&FoodSupply) and from Cooperint 2015 at the University of Verona.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper mainly uses the traditional method of Engel curve, which is compared with income growth and food consumption, to study farmers' welfare improvement in rural China. Findings - The Engel coefficients identify three different stages for farmers' welfare change after 1978. The first stage is the period between 1978 and 1988, in which farmers' welfare has been continuously enhanced due to the institutional bonus of the 1978 economic reform and increased government purchase price of agricultural products. The second stage is the period between 1989 and 1995, in which farmers' welfare has been slightly deteriorated mainly due to the end of institutional reform bonus, suppressed food prices, relative high inflation, and instable political situation. The third stage is the period after 1995, in which farmers' welfare returns to a growing path, as the dual price system was abolished, the transition from a planned economy to a market economy had been completed, and the government carried out protective policies for agriculture and started to heavily subsidize agriculture. The Engel coefficient still remained at a very high level at 0.59 in 1995, but it continuously decreased to 0.33 in 2015. The welfare enhancement for farmers mainly results from deepened market-oriented reform, protective policies for agriculture, and prevalent off-farm employment. The Engel coefficient is also linked to food demand elasticities. Along with the decreasing Engel coefficient in the past 40 years, income elasticities also continuously decrease from 0.55 in 1978 to 0.08 in 2015. Food demand is very inelastic now, and any further increase in income will not substantially increase food demand any more. Research limitations/implications - Inequality has not been analyzed. Originality/value - This paper reviews the methodological advantages of the Engel curves, and uses it to identify different stages of welfare change and estimate income elasticities of food demand for farmers in China after the 1978 economic reform.","[Yu, Xiaohua] Univ Gottingen, Courant Res Ctr PEG, Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Yu, XH (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Courant Res Ctr PEG, Gottingen, Germany.",xyu@uni-goettingen.de,,"Yu, Xiaohua/0000-0003-4257-8081; Yu, Xiaohua/0000-0002-1467-4829",Natural Science Foundation of China [71633005],Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The author thanks the precious comments from Dr Te Bao from the Nanjing Technological University and Qiran Zhao from the China Agricultural University.

However, quality signaling in the presence of asymmetric information typically requires paying measurement costs. Given that previous research has indicated that the value of genetic information is generally not enough to offset the current cost of testing, we evaluate random sampling as a strategy to reduce the overall cost of testing. An economic approach to sample size determination is introduced utilizing a Bayesian decision theoretic framework to balance the expected costs and benefits of sampling. Data from 101 pens (2,796 animals) of commercially-fed cattle are used to empirically evaluate optimal sampling. Assuming profit is linear (nonlinear) in genetic information, results indicate that at the baseline parameter values an optimal sample size of nine (five) out of 100 animals generates returns from sampling of $7.87/head ($5.96/head). Sensitivity analyses indicate that the degree of asymmetric information (absolute difference between seller and buyer prior expectations of quality) is the major driver of the overall results. The results provide strong evidence that random sampling generates benefits that far exceed the costs.","[Thompson, Nathanael M.; Lusk, Jayson L.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Brorsen, B.

Given their current and expected economic environment, farmers must use their human capital in mapping out a trajectory for their farm. This study considers particular aspects of farmers' human capital and its influence on farm growth, or lack of it. Farmers' characteristics as expressed through their personality, intelligence and objectives are the main human capital aspects considered in a sample of smaller NZ dairy farms. They are somewhat typical of western farmers working on smaller farms. They can be broadly classed into Expanders, Maintainers and Retractors. It is hypothesised each group will have distinct and different personal characteristics and these influence the farmers' choice of trajectory. This is in addition to purely economic factors. It is also hypothesised the characteristics influence the farmers' choice of development strategy and how challenges to the strategy are viewed. The data collected from the small dairy farms support the hypotheses suggesting the design of policy and extension programs must allow for these human capital drivers. Using past data, it is also shown aspects of human capital are different in large farms emphasising the same conclusion.","[Westbrooke, Victoria; Nuthall, Peter] Lincoln Univ, Dept Land Management & Syst, Lincoln, New Zealand",Lincoln University - New Zealand,"Nuthall, P (通讯作者)，Lincoln Univ, Dept Land Management & Syst, Lincoln, New Zealand.",nuthallp@lincoln.ac.nz,"Westbrooke, Victoria/T-7052-2018","Westbrooke, Victoria/0000-0003-2040-155X",,,,,61,6,6,1,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Using the convergence test proposed by Phillips and Sul (2007), the study finds strong evidence of convergence in total agricultural productivity growth and positive correlation between growth and public investment in R&D. The analysis of convergence indicates that the productivity gap between different regions in China has lessened, suggesting agricultural productivity is convergent across all provinces in China. We find R&D being statistically and economically more important in technological catch-up than in innovation. Human capital also plays a major role in productivity growth. The finding of strong positive inter-region spillover effects implies that expanding cooperation across regions for public agricultural research is more efficient and training of researchers can improve total factor productivity, especially in less productive regions.","[Zhan, Jintao; Tian, Xu; Zhang, Yanyuan] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Yang, Xinglong] Jilin Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Changchun 130118, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Qu, Zhongqiong; Tan, Tao] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Publ Adm, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing Agricultural University; Jilin Agricultural University; Nanjing Agricultural University,"Tan, T (通讯作者)，Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Publ Adm, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",jintao.zhan@njau.edu.cn; xutian@njau.edu.cn; 602758759@qq.com; yxlchv@126.com; qzq@njau.edu.cn; tantao@njau.edu.cn,,", xu/0000-0002-1070-3581","National Natural Science Foundation [71303114, 71673139, 71603129]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD)",National Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD),"The research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation grant (Nos. 71303114, 71673139, and 71603129) and the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD).",,77,10,11,5,75,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

If the capital asset pricing policy remains in effect, it will likely take a longer time to achieve an efficient allocation of quota across producers in the industry.","[Elskamp, Rebecca; Hailu, Getu] Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, JD MacLachlan Bldg, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University of Guelph,"Elskamp, R (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, JD MacLachlan Bldg, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",relskamp@uoguelph.ca; ghailu@uoguelph.ca,,,"Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA)-University of Guelph Partnership [200222]","Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA)-University of Guelph Partnership","The authors are grateful to the Dairy Farmers of Ontario (DFO) for providing confidential data.

Using the dynamic properties of the model, data from beyond the sample period are analysed by employing the variance decomposition and the impulse response function. The findings reveal that R&D can be readily linked to the variation in productivity growth beyond the sample period.

Further, we account for input endogeneity using an original method of moments estimator.

We find that the emission content of Australian macroeconomic activity has changed over the 15-year period. Consumption-based emissions have been growing faster than production-based emissions since 2001. We show that emissions embodied in Australian imports are increasingly becoming a significant source of emissions. We investigate emissions in Australian imports and find that increased trade with China contributed substantially to the increase in Australia's consumption emissions. China was the largest exporter of emissions to Australia and accounted for almost half of emissions embodied in Australian imports since 2002. The growth of trade with China coincides with the increase in imported emissions as well as the increase in aggregate consumption emissions. Our results suggest that tracking consumption emissions together with production emissions provides a more complete picture of Australian emissions.,"[Levitt, Clinton J.] Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Sch Business & Econ, Private Bag 84, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Saaby, Morten] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark; [Sorensen, Anders] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Econ, Porcelaenshaven 16A, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark",University of Tasmania; University of Southern Denmark; Copenhagen Business School,"Levitt, CJ (通讯作者)，Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Sch Business & Econ, Private Bag 84, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",Clinton.Levitt@utas.edu.au,,"Sorensen, Anders/0000-0002-8310-4221",Rockwool Foundation,Rockwool Foundation,All three authors would like to thank the Rockwool Foundation for financial support (more information about the Rockwool Foundation can be found at http://www.rockwoolfonden.dk/home).

Thus, we compare four designs with respect to their effect on outcomes, especially willingness to pay (WTP) estimates and predicted market shares. Regarding statistical efficiency all designs perform rather well but the WTP estimates differ significantly on several occasions.

Due to the potential for large-scale animal depopulation and uncertain trade flow restrictions, the economic costs and animal welfare implications of disease outbreaks have prompted efforts to control their spread within and across trade boundaries. We build a partial equilibrium model of the beef supply chain in Ontario to examine the welfare impacts of a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak inside and outside the province. Somewhat surprisingly, economic impacts for Ontario are not dramatically different between an outbreak within the province versus an outbreak in western Canada: losses total $245 and $217 million, respectively. When the outbreak occurs outside Ontario and provincial zoning is recognized, losses total only $93 million. Restrictions on international and, inter-and intra-provincial movement of livestock and beef products are the main driver of losses. A strength of our model is that we are able to disaggregate these impacts across the various market participants (i.e., producers, processors, retailers, consumers). Retailers and consumers incur little to no losses as imports from the United States easily fill shortages in supply. Production losses from livestock movement restrictions and depopulation are partially offset by higher prices, while processors bear the brunt of the losses due to reduced supply and higher livestock prices.","[Cairns, Alexander] Revenue Management Solut, 777 S Harbour Isl Blvd, Tampa, FL 33602 USA; [Tolhurst, Tor; Poon, Kenneth; Ker, Alan P.; Duff, Stephen; Jacques, David] Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Room 312,JD MacLachlan Bldg, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Yang, Lin] Ontario Minist Agr Food & Rural Affairs, Strateg Policy Branch, 1 Stone Rd West, Guelph, ON N1G 4Y2, Canada",University of Guelph,"Ker, AP (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Room 312,JD MacLachlan Bldg, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",Alex.p.cairns@gmail.com; Ttolhurs@uoguelph.ca; kpoon@uoguelph.ca; aker@uoguelph.ca; Stephen.duff@ontario.ca; djacques@uoguelph.ca; lyang07@uoguelph.ca,,,,,,,27,2,2,2,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

The computation of shadow prices with an innovative approach reveals that, while prices for carbon dioxide and methane range within acceptable levels, the price of nitrous oxide is exorbitant. This suggests that, if policy-makers intend to encourage farmers to reduce this type of pollution, policy measures should be accompanied by sufficient subsidies to compensate farmers or other incentives aiming at nitrous oxide reduction.","[Dakpo, K.

The purpose of this paper is to assess scientists' attitudes on whether China needs to develop its national agricultural GM technology and their willingness to buy GM food. Design/methodology/approach - A stratified sampling method was used to select and interview 806 scientists from six major agricultural universities and 20 research institutes under two national academies in China in 2013. Based on these data, the authors use both descriptive statistics and multivariate regression analysis to examine scientists' attitudes toward agricultural GM technology and food, using GM soybean oil as an example of GM foods. Findings - The survey results show that nearly three-quarters of scientists agree that China needs to develop its agricultural GM technology, but their attitudes differ largely. Only 29 percent of scientists are willing to buy GM soybean oil, similar to urban consumers (25 percent) in China. The knowledge of biology is extensive for some scientists but varies significant among scientists and correlates positively with their attitudes toward agricultural GM technology and GM soybean oil. Younger and male scientists with higher professional titles, and those involved in GM research are more in favor of China's GM technology compared to other scientists. Female scientists, scientists with lower professional titles, those that have never engaged in GM research or are from non-agricultural scientific disciplines are less willing to buy GM soybean oil. Interestingly, their low willingness to buy GM soybean oil is inconsistent with the fact that it is the most common edible oil in China. Originality/value - This study is the first to examine scientists' attitudes toward GM technology and food in China. The results of this study contribute to understanding the current debates on GM technology and the relevance of research, based on the willingness to buy GM food, for decision making regarding the commercialization of GM technology.","[Huang, Jikun; Wang, Xiaobing] Peking Univ, China Ctr Agr Policy, Sch Adv Agr Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Peng, Bowen] Minist Agr, Foreign Econ Cooperat Ctr, Dept Project Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",Peking University; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs,"Huang, JK (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, China Ctr Agr Policy, Sch Adv Agr Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jkhuang.ccap@pku.edu.cn,", IAMO/G-2328-2012",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71333013]; National Key Program on Genetically Modified New Varieties [2011ZX08015-002A, 2016ZX08015-001]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Program on Genetically Modified New Varieties,"The authors would like to thank the collaborators who coordinated the surveys in their institutions, including Jiming Wang and Chunfang Liu from the Chinese Academy ofAgricultural Sciences, Junfei Bai from China Agricultural University, Yuanyun Ling and Yong Wang from Huazhong Agricultural University, Guanghua Lin and Funing Zhong from Nanjing Agricultural University, and Chunling Xue from South China Agricultural University as well as Huanguang Qiu and the others who conducted the surveys in Northeast Agricultural University and Northwest Agriculture and Forestry University.

The empirical analysis is based on the data from a 2011 survey of more than 200 small and medium size agricultural producers, food processors and retailers. There is determined the impact of open innovation and a company's absorptive capacity on the innovation performance employing two stage approaches. First, a cluster analysis is applied to categorise companies based on their open innovation absorptive capacity, firm and managerial characteristics. Second, using semi-non parametric probit models, there is found that open innovation positively influences the innovation performance for the product and market innovation. Estimations indicate that the absorptive capacity has positive impacts on the technological- and organisational innovation and on innovation propensity. The results suggest that there exists a considerable heterogeneity both within and between the supply chain segments regarding to the innovation performance.","[Toth, Jozsef] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Budapest, Hungary; [Ferto, Imre] Hungarian Acad Sci, Budapest, Hungary",Corvinus University Budapest; Hungarian Academy of Sciences,"Toth, J (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, Budapest, Hungary.",jozsef.toth@uni-corvinus.hu,"Ferto, Imre/GPS-7523-2022; Ferto, Imre/A-7371-2009; Fertő, Imre/AAQ-4634-2021; Toth, Jozsef/ABI-6303-2020","Ferto, Imre/0000-0002-3742-5964;",Sustainable Development-Habitable Region-Livable Landscape [TAMOP-4.2.1.B-09/1/KMR-2010-0005]; Hungarian Scientific Research Fund (OTKA) [K 84327],Sustainable Development-Habitable Region-Livable Landscape; Hungarian Scientific Research Fund (OTKA)(Orszagos Tudomanyos Kutatasi Alapprogramok (OTKA)),"Supported by the TAMOP-4.2.1.B-09/1/KMR-2010-0005  Sustainable Development-Habitable Region-Livable Landscape and the Hungarian Scientific Research Fund (OTKA, K 84327) 'Integration of small farms into the modern food chain'.",,30,5,5,2,29,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

In 2013, the USDA curtailed its crop report publication for the first time in decades due to an appropriations lapse, thereby offering the chance to study the impact on markets of missing government data. As expected, derivatives markets for corn and soybeans did not display characteristic short-run patterns in terms of uncertainty resolution and price changes that are normally observed around scheduled USDA release times. We are unable to detect evidence of a prolonged period of heightened uncertainty, realized volatility around the missing report, or abnormal pricing errors in the absence of government data.

Utilising a between-subject design with three treatments, we find significantly higher marginal willingness-to-pay values in hypothetical than in nonhypothetical settings, confirming the presence of hypothetical bias.

Thus, expert evaluations should have a greater impact on the price of higher-end segments. We analyze the effects of tasting notes on wine prices across price categories and find that certain keywords used in tasting notes to describe wine characteristics exert a significant influence on wine prices.

The analysis develops supply functions of irrigable land from a water resource model for 282 river basins and applies them within a global economy-wide model. The analysis reveals two key findings. First, explicitly representing irrigated land has a small impact on global food, bioenergy and deforestation outcomes. This is because this modification allows irrigated and rainfed land to expand in different proportions, which counters the effect of rising marginal costs for the expansion of irrigated land. Second, changes in water availability have small impacts on global food prices, bioenergy production, land use change and the overall economy, even with large-scale (c. 150 exajoules) bioenergy production, due in part to endogenous irrigation and storage responses. However, representing water scarcity and changes in water availability can be important regionally, with relatively arid areas and/or areas with rapidly growing populations fully exhausting our estimated maximum irrigation capacity that allows for improved irrigation efficiency, lining of canals to limit water loss, and expanding storage to fully capture average annual water flows.","[Winchester, Niven; Ledvina, Kirby; Strzepek, Kenneth; Reilly, John M.] MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, 77 Massachusetts Ave,E19-439h, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Strzepek, Kenneth] Univ Boulder Colorado, Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Boulder, CO USA; [Reilly, John M.] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Winchester, N (通讯作者)，MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, 77 Massachusetts Ave,E19-439h, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",niven@mit.edu,,"Winchester, Niven/0000-0003-2703-4596; Ledvina, Kirby/0000-0003-1025-2212",BP; Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change,BP; Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change,"The authors wish to thank Rosemary Albinson, Bo Chen, Andrew Cockerill, Jo Howes, Fabio Montemurro, James Primrose and Cameron Rennie for helpful comments and suggestions.

This study conducts an econometric analysis to examine the effects of reference prices on the dynamics of tomato price and farm revenue. Findings indicate that the suspension agreements have resulted in significant adjustments in the U.S. and Mexican tomato prices, and that the two prices are now more interdependent under the 2013 agreement. Although the 2013 suspension agreement has boosted the prices of U.S. tomatoes, simulation analysis shows that the Mexican industry reaps most of the benefits from increased prices under the 2013 suspension agreement.

Using Huang and Stoll's (1997) model of liquidity costs, we estimate whether changes to liquidity costs are driven by its adverse selection, inventory, or order processing components. Commodity index fund roll activity reduces the asymmetric information cost component of liquidity cost due to an increased proportion of noninformation-based trading, but the inventory cost component increases as (mostly long only) commodity index funds sell their nearby positions and buy the first deferred contractraising liquidity providers' risk of building a position. The sum of these two effects is that liquidity costs remain low during index fund roll periods, averaging one tick (0.25 cents). On USDA report release days, we find that informed traders raise the asymmetric information component of liquidity costs in the first hour after release, but the inventory cost component is reduced due to the increase in volume. Similar to index fund roll activity, liquidity costs on USDA report release days remain low, averaging one tick. Our findings that liquidity costs are minimally changed during USDA report releases and commodity index fund roll periods is consistent with other recent research on liquidity costs, but we show that what drives liquidity costs differs substantially depending on the circumstances surrounding daily trading.","[Shang, Quanbiao; Mallory, Mindy; Garcia, Philip] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Mallory, M (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",mallorym@illinois.edu,,,Office of Futures and Options Research; U.S. Department of Agriculture-National Institute of Food and Agriculture Hatch Project [ILLU-470-363],Office of Futures and Options Research; U.S. Department of Agriculture-National Institute of Food and Agriculture Hatch Project,The authors would like to acknowledge support of the Office of Futures and Options Research and U.S. Department of Agriculture-National Institute of Food and Agriculture Hatch Project ILLU-470-363.

The estimation of these target catch rates is based on the assumption of relative homogeneity of the fleet in terms of efficiency, productivity and cost structure. In this study, these assumptions are examined through the estimation of a stochastic production frontier. While technical efficiency varies between vessels, average efficiency is relatively constant over the fishing season. However, average productivity of the fleet increases, with smaller vessels (in terms of engine power) exiting the fishery earlier. This would likely increase the average cost of fishing towards the end of the season, with implications for setting the target catch rate. Based on a standard assumption as to the relationship between costs and vessel size, we find that the MEY target catch rates are most likely currently underestimated. However, the implementation of a precautionary minimum catch rate (which is above the MEY target catch rates for recent years) has maintained the fishery at a profitable level.","[Pascoe, Sean; Hutton, Trevor; Van Quang Nguyen] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, POB 2583, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Pascoe, Sean] EcoSci Precinct, 41 Boggo Rd, Dutton Pk, Qld, Australia; [Coglan, Louisa; Van Quang Nguyen] QUT Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Pascoe, S (通讯作者)，CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, POB 2583, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.;Pascoe, S (通讯作者)，EcoSci Precinct, 41 Boggo Rd, Dutton Pk, Qld, Australia.",sean.pascoe@csiro.au,"Coglan, Louisa/AAF-2356-2019; nguyen, quang/JDC-4463-2023; Pascoe, Sean/D-9710-2011","Coglan, Louisa/0000-0001-5730-7845; quang, nguyen van/0000-0002-0483-3857; Pascoe, Sean/0000-0001-6581-2649",FRDC; CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere,FRDC; CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere,The assistance of the NPF Industry association (NPFI) in collecting the economic data is acknowledged.

It focuses on the African Union (AU) and its eight Regional Economic Communities. The international cooperation schemes between the World Bank, EU, FAO and African countries in agricultural policy are reviewed. The paper concludes that, despite numerous cross-border initiatives, governance of agricultural policies in the pan-African context remains fragmented. Policy-making and cooperation schemes need to be stepped up to address continent-wide challenges in the sector. There is an urgent need for the AU and the EU to intensify their cooperation in agricultural policies and development. The AU in collaboration with its regional bodies should establish a common agricultural policy for the continent. Such initiatives need to be Africa-driven and adapted to African needs. The EU should only provide technical know-how and institutional support if welcomed by African partners. Collective action towards rural areas via greater coordination of African agricultural policies and actions would help to develop the missing institutional framework needed for agricultural development in the continent. Fostering economic growth through agricultural development and reforms may also lead to a reduction of migration as witnessed by the EU in the sixties.","[Blizkovsky, Petr] Council European Union, Brussels, Belgium; [Grega, Libor; Verter, Nahanga] Mendel Univ Brno, Brno, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Verter, N (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.",nahanga.verter@mendelu.cz,"Verter, Nahanga/E-4845-2018; Grega, Libor/L-7042-2018","Verter, Nahanga/0000-0002-5889-134X; Grega, Libor/0000-0002-7517-991X",,,,,29,2,2,1,25,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - The author surveys literature and statistics related to the subject to comprehensively picture the 40-year course of the shift and reallocation of agricultural surplus labor. Findings - In the past 40 years, reforms in relevant areas have eliminated institutional barriers deterring labor mobility and allowed agricultural laborers to exit from low-productivity farming employment, migrate beyond rural-urban boundary and across regions, sectors, and ownerships, and enter higher productivity employment in non-agricultural sectors. As a result, resources allocative efficiency has been substantially improved, contributing a significant part to labor productivity growth and thus economic growth of the Chinese economy as a whole. Social implications - To sustain this source of economic growth as far as China completes its transition from upper-middle income status to high-income status, deepening reforms is urgently needed. The author provides policy suggestions for further reform.

Organization institution in agriculture is one of the domains with drastic innovations. The purpose of this paper is to map the emergence and evolution of various agricultural organizations in China since 1978. Development status and the trend of agricultural organization system are analyzed. Further, the role of farmer cooperatives is discussed. Design/methodology/approach - Data used in the paper are mainly from statistical yearbooks and documents published by the government including Ministry of Agriculture and Bureau of Industry and Commercial. Both descriptive and deductive analyses are adopted to achieve different analytical purposes. Findings - The vast small-farm sector, co-existence of various types of organizations, and innovation of other organizations will continue and sustain for a long-time period in China. Despite the fast development of modern farmers and various organizations, it is important that traditional farmers participate effectively in modern agriculture. Farmers act collectively via a cooperative in a desirable way, which determines the central position of farmer cooperatives in the agricultural organization system. Research limitations/implications - This paper is a qualitative analysis on agricultural organizations in China, yet no quantitative estimation regarding the comparison of various organizations is conducted due to insufficient data. Originality/value - This paper fills the gap of a comprehensive review of the emergence, development status, and trend of agricultural organizations in China.","[Huang, Zuhui] Zhejiang Univ, China Acad Rural Dev, Sch Management, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Liang, Qiao] Zhejiang Univ, China Acad Rural Dev, Sch Publ Affairs, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University,"Huang, ZH (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, China Acad Rural Dev, Sch Management, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",zhhuang@zju.edu.cn,,"Liang, Qiao/0000-0001-7473-7863","National Natural Science Foundation of China project [71333011, 71573227]; Zhejiang Philosophy and Social Science [17NDJC193YB]",National Natural Science Foundation of China project(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Zhejiang Philosophy and Social Science,"This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China project (Grant Nos 71333011, 71573227) and Zhejiang Philosophy and Social Science (Grant No. 17NDJC193YB).",,41,52,53,10,127,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

The text argues that one of the tools of social inclusion - social economy represented by social entrepreneurship and social farming - is a sort of innovative practice. The findings suggest that the understanding of social inclusion evolves within policy documents towards highlighting social economy through matching its theoretical concept with political measures. However, social economy is still not considered by the documents as an innovative approach. If analysing projects funded under Czech Rural Development Programs, social inclusion in rural areas is not the main theme, especially in regions exposed to the risk of social exclusion. In addition, the main actors (NGOs or social entrepreneurs) who are said to support social economy or social farming are not active in submitting projects in rural areas under the Rural Development Program 2007-2013.

Scientists recommend controlling the vector of the disease, and area-wide pest management has been proposed as a superior alternative to individual pest management. We analyzed a unique dataset of farm-level citrus yields that allowed us to test this hypothesis. We found that yields of blocks located in an area with higher participation in coordinated sprays were 28%, 73%, and 98% higher in 2012/13, 2013/14, and 2014/15, respectively, compared to the yields of blocks under the same management but located in an area with lower participation. These results provide evidence on the efficiency of a well-performing pest management area to deal with citrus greening. However, participation in Citrus Health Management Areas has not been commensurate with this evidence. We present survey data that provide insights about producers' preferences and attitudes toward the area-wide pest management program. Despite the economic benefit we found area-wide pest management can provide, the strategic uncertainty involved in relying on neighbors seems to impose too high of a cost for most growers, who end up not coordinating sprays.","[Singerman, Ariel; Useche, Pilar] Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Lence, Sergio H.] Iowa State Univ, Int Agr Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Lence, Sergio H.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Useche, Pilar] Univ Florida, Ctr Latin Amer Studies, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Iowa State University; Iowa State University; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Singerman, A (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",singerman@ufl.edu,,,,,,,47,34,37,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

We find that pesticide use is strongly correlated with increased value of harvest, but is also correlated with higher costs associated with human illness, including increased health expenditures and time lost from work due to sickness in the recent past.

This paper investigates relations between biofuel policies and prices of rapeseed, the major feedstock used for biodiesel production in Europe, and the impact of rapeseed prices on crop acreages in Germany and France. Biodiesel is an important biofuel in Europe, and Germany and France are the largest biodiesel producers in Europe. First, the various biofuel policies in Germany and France are discussed, followed by an analysis of their effects on rapeseed prices. Although theory indicates that such effects exist, we could not find empirical evidence for them. Second, using regional land use panel data from Germany and France we investigate empirically whether crop shares have been affected by rapeseed prices in the period 2000-2015 and whether these price effects changed because of biofuel policy changes. Results show that wheat shares in Germany and France did respond to rapeseed prices, but barley shares did not. Moreover, mandatory blending introduced in Germany in 2007 and production quotas introduced in France in 2005 led to a stronger effect of rapeseed prices on wheat shares, but again did not affect barley shares.","[Gardebroek, Cornelis; Baller, Lieneke] Wageningen Univ, Agr Econ & Rural Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Reimer, Jeffrey J.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Wageningen University & Research; Oregon State University,"Gardebroek, C (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Agr Econ & Rural Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.",koos.gardebroek@wur.nl,"Reimer, Jeffrey/G-7015-2016","Reimer, Jeffrey/0000-0003-4434-174X",,,,,49,7,8,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

This is particularly significant for agricultural science, which is expected to produce solutions to future challenges that will arise from population growth, climate change and ecosystem degradation. Much econometric effort has been devoted to analysis of investment in agricultural research and its effects on farm productivity. This analysis, reviewed here, has produced a consensus suggesting that returns are high, although they are achieved only after long lags. However, policy-makers perceive the occurrence of impacts as too few, and poorly targeted with respect to their needs. An attribution gap between the outcomes of agricultural research and how they reach farmers has motivated evaluation of the process of transmission and translation of agricultural research outputs into ultimate impacts. This gap can be narrowed by Participatory Impact Pathway Analysis, implemented mostly so far in low income countries. However, it is a costly and cognitively complex approach. Content analysis of the UK's 2014 REF Impact Case Studies uncovers the mind set of researchers and their managers regarding the description of impact and how it is supposed to occur. This reveals a nascent conservatism that focuses on research that can be shown to have impact, rather than research impact itself. From the overall discussion it can be concluded that the impact evaluation of agricultural science raises more profound issues than simply efficiency or transparency. Confirmation bias threatens impact evaluation, principally by distracting from other important stories about how and why the ultimate effects occur, but also by transforming the nature of the process itself. Methodological pluralism, with greater integration and triangulation between different evaluation approaches, is a promising means of resolving these problems.","[Midmore, Peter] Aberystwyth Univ, Aberystwyth Business Sch, Econ, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales",Aberystwyth University,"Midmore, P (通讯作者)，Aberystwyth Univ, Aberystwyth Business Sch, Econ, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales.",pxm@aber.ac.uk,,,IMPRESA FP7 project [609448],IMPRESA FP7 project,"Peter Midmore is Professor of Economics, Aberystwyth Business School, Aberystwyth University.

The empirical results reveal that the majority of farm income inequality was long-run or structural in nature, reflecting differences in both farm business size and farm-specific factors such as land quality, managerial ability and business structures. Evidence of absolute convergence in farm incomes is explained by short-run adjustments towards equilibrium or target incomes conditional upon prices, technology and farm business size, with farm business growth conditional upon survival found to have had no significant redistributive effect.","[Allanson, Paul; Kasprzyk, Kalina] Univ Dundee, Dept Econ Studies, Dundee, Scotland; [Kasprzyk, Kalina] Frontier Econ, London, England; [Barnes, Andrew P.] SRUC Scotlands Rural Coll, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Dundee; Scotland's Rural College,"Allanson, P (通讯作者)，Univ Dundee, Dept Econ Studies, Dundee, Scotland.",p.f.allanson@dundee.ac.uk,"Allanson, Paul/JFK-4328-2023; Barnes, Andrew P/E-5503-2015","Allanson, Paul/0000-0001-9799-8425; Barnes, Andrew/0000-0001-9368-148X",Economic and Social Research Council/Scottish Government,Economic and Social Research Council/Scottish Government,"This work was supported by an Economic and Social Research Council/Scottish Government Collaborative PhD Studentship: 'The design of the Single Payment Scheme'.

This article estimates the potential longer-run or enduring effects of fertiliser subsidy programmes on smallholder farm households' demand for commercial fertiliser and maize production over time. We use four waves of panel data on 462 farm households in Malawi for whom fertiliser use can be tracked for eight consecutive seasons between 2003/2004 and 2010/2011. Panelestimation methods are used to control for potential endogeneity of subsidised fertiliser acquisition. Results indicate that farmers acquiring subsidised fertiliser in three consecutive prior years are found to purchase slightly more commercial fertiliser in the next year. This suggests a small amount of crowding in of commercial fertiliser from the receipt of subsidised fertiliser in prior years. In addition, acquiring subsidised fertiliser in a given year has a modest positive impact on increasing maize output in that same year. However, acquiring subsidised fertiliser in multiple prior years generates no statistically significant effect on maize output in the current year. These findings indicate that potential enduring effects of the Malawi fertiliser subsidy programme on maize production are limited. Additional interventions that increase soil fertility can make using inorganic fertiliser more profitable and sustainable for smallholders in sub-Saharan Africa and thereby increase the cost-effectiveness of input subsidy programmes.","[Ricker-Gilbert, Jacob] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Jayne, T.

Unlike any other literature in this context, we take account of the existence of a newly-established market in salmon futures, which determines risk premia and other relevant variables, that influence risk-averse fish farmers in their harvesting decision. We consider the cases of single and infinite rotations. The value function of the harvesting problem determined in our arbitrage-free setup constitutes the fair values of lease and ownership of the fish farm when correctly accounting for price risk. The data set used for this analysis contains a large set of futures contracts with different maturities traded at the Fish Pool market between June 12, 2006 and March 22, 2012. We assess the optimal strategy, harvesting time, and value against two alternative setups. The first alternative involves simple strategies that lack managerial flexibility; the second alternative allows for managerial flexibility and risk aversion as modeled by a constant relative risk aversion utility function, but without access to the salmon futures market. In both cases, the loss in project value can be very significant, and in the second case is only negligible for extremely low levels of risk aversion. As a consequence, for a risk-averse fish farmer, the presence of a salmon futures market as well as managerial flexibility are highly important.","[Ewald, Christian-Oliver; Ouyang, Ruolan] Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch Econ, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Ewald, Christian-Oliver] Univ Sydney, Sch Math & Stat, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Siu, Tak Kuen] Macquarie Univ, Dept Appl Finance & Actuarial Studies, Fac Business & Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Glasgow; University of Sydney; Macquarie University,"Ewald, CO (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch Econ, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.;Ewald, CO (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Math & Stat, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",christian.ewald@glasgow.ac.uk,"Ewald, Christian/GSN-6992-2022; Ewald, Christian/HTN-7407-2023; Siu, Tak Kuen/AAJ-6372-2020","Ewald, Christian/0000-0003-3288-0164; Ouyang, Ruolan/0000-0002-6697-2019; Siu, Tak Kuen/0000-0003-2823-5138",,,,,37,11,12,1,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses exploratory data analyses methods, including descriptive statistics, graphical analysis, econometrics and propensity score matching, and data from a 2008 survey of 342 households in Awat County of Aksu Prefecture to explore the role of political capital in an agricultural household setting. Findings - Preliminary results suggest that wasteland usage has a positive association with income, and that household political capital, in the form of Communist Party membership or being a village cadre, correlates with wasteland usage because it improves access to irrigation water. Originality/value - A constant topic of debate in China is the role of political capital in influencing livelihoods.

Our study uses a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to estimate the disaggregated impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2018, which lowered personal and corporate tax rates. Focusing on agriculture, we use survey data to calculate how the TCJA would change the tax rates faced by farmers at the sector level. We use Internal Revenue Service data to calculate tax rates for all other producers. We then simulate the economy-wide and sectoral effects of TCJA. We find that the TCJA would cause a reduction in agricultural output as resources would be reallocated to other sectors. Using our survey data, we extend the CGE results to measure the impacts to farm households-from changes in on- and off-farm income. We find that most farm households would have income gains from tax reform. Our tax reform scenario highlights the fact that investment weighs heavily on model results. That is, firms that are attractive to domestic and foreign investment have gains in demand for their products, while other sectors, such as primary agriculture, experience decreases in production. A sensitivity analysis that reduces the attractiveness of the United States in foreign investment shows smaller impacts of TCJA, especially for macroeconomic variables.","[Beckman, Jayson] USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [Gopinath, Munisamy] USDA, Econ Res Serv, Markets & Trade Econ Div, Washington, DC USA; [Tsigas, Marinos] US Int Trade Commiss, Washington, DC USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Beckman, J (通讯作者)，USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20250 USA.",JBeckman@ers.usda.gov,,"Munisamy, Gopi/0000-0002-6249-7548",,,,,37,3,3,3,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

This article explicitly examines the economics of technical change and the interaction between weather and technology as revealed in a half century of panel data on U.S. Midwest rainfed state-average corn yields. Observed yields reflect two components: yield potential and damage to the potential caused by weather and pests. Yield potential is modeled as a stochastic production frontier where nitrogen fertilization, public corn research, and introduction and adoption of biotech corn seeds impact yield potential and excess heat impacts nitrogen productivity. The yield-damage/damage-control function permits biotech corn plants to abate adverse effects of weather and pest events. Results include the following: nitrogen use, public corn research, and biotech seed-corn adoption increase yield potential; soil moisture stress reduces yield potential, and excess heat severely reduces nitrogen productivity.

A novel sequential primal-dual estimation routine to calculate TFP change is proposed, using a multi-output input distance function in the first stage, followed by a cost minimization routine in the second stage. TFP change is estimated as the direct sum of the estimates of technical change, technical efficiency change, allocative efficiency change, input price effects, changes in output markup, and changes in returns to scale in each state. The validity of the proposed methodology is supported by the remarkable overlap and high correlation of our annual estimates of TFP change with the USDA's measures of change in TFP by state. Although technical change tends to be the largest contributor to productivity change, it bears a low and statistically insignificant correlation with TFP change on an annual basis, whereas annual changes in the markup effect and returns to scale are highly and significantly correlated with TFP changes. This is the first study to find a slowdown of technical progress in the U.S. farm sector in the 1990s and 2000s, and technical regress during the farm crisis of the 1980s. While technical efficiency shows a positive overall trend, allocative efficiency shows a negative overall trend, and their combined effect (i.e., the overall cost efficiency) slows down TFP growth. The policy recommendations from previous studies on the drivers of TFP should be revised in light of these findings.","[Plastina, Alejandro; Lence, Sergio H.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Lence, Sergio H.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Int Agr Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Iowa State University; Iowa State University,"Plastina, A (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",,"Plastina, Alejandro/AFU-1119-2022","Plastina, Alejandro/0000-0001-7333-5459",,,,,46,18,19,1,61,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Regional research intensity ratios, which account for size differences, indicate research spending has consistently favored southern and western states over northern, central, and eastern ones. Farm production patterns have, however, changed in recent years and regional output growth is being driven by new commodity mixes. In this article, we ask which region had the highest factor productivity growth and rate of return to investments in public agricultural research and higher education. Our analysis relies on a 1980-2008 Indian agricultural production and policy data set together with a dual heteroscedastic production frontier to decompose total factor productivity (TFP) growth into formal technical progress and efficiency elements. The model's regional flexibility affords region-to-region comparison of multiple research return rates, TFP growth, and the elements influencing them. Regardless of return-rate measure or allocation scenario evaluated, the North has enjoyed the highest return to research spending, and the Central and East the lowest. Factor productivity growth has however been strongest in the South, primarily on account of efficiency gains. Overall, though, the technical progress and productivity growth easily attributable to government-supported research has accounted for about one-quarter of the sector's TFP growth.","[Rada, Nicholas; Schimmelpfennig, David] Econ Res Serv, USDA, 355 E St NW,5-253A, Washington, DC 20024 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Rada, N (通讯作者)，Econ Res Serv, USDA, 355 E St NW,5-253A, Washington, DC 20024 USA.",nrada@ers.usda.gov,"Schimmelpfennig, David/IWM-6630-2023",,,,,,54,7,9,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

The article appeals to a simple model to frame the relationship between migration and the probability that a reallocation of land in the village will occur in the following year. Empirically, the article first demonstrates that a village leader's support for an administrative land reallocation carries with it the risk of losing a future election. Exploiting election timing and village heterogeneity in lineage group composition, the article identifies the effect of reallocation risk on migration decisions. In response to an expected land reallocation in the following year, the probability that a rural resident migrates out of the county declines by 2.4 percentage points, which accounts for 15% of the annual share of village residents, aged 16 to 50, who worked as migrants during the period.

This article sets out to fill this gap by providing methodological contributions and empirical results. First, we consider panel data multicrop models featuring random intercept and slope parameters to account for the heterogeneous responses of crop producers to economic drivers. Second, we show that Monte Carlo expectation-maximization algorithms are particularly well-suited to estimating this type of model. Third, based on an application of our empirical modeling framework with a sample of French grain crop producers, we demonstrate substantial variability in farmers' responses to economic incentives. Fourth, we use the estimated model and a simple statistical calibration procedure to build farm-specific simulation models, which are then used to evaluate the effects of the rapeseed price increase induced by European Union (EU) biofuel support. Our simulation results demonstrate that ignoring the variability in the considered farmers' responses to the economic incentives results in significant overestimation of the increases in rapeseed yield levels and variable input use levels induced by EU biofuel support, as well as significant underestimation of the variability in the congruent increases in rapeseed acreages.","[Koutchade, ObafSmi Philippe; Carpentier, Alain; Femenia, Fabienne] French Inst Agr Res INRA, SMART LERECO Unit, Rennes, France",INRAE,"Femenia, F (通讯作者)，French Inst Agr Res INRA, SMART LERECO Unit, Rennes, France.",Fabienne.Femenia@inra.fr,,"KOUTCHADE, Obafemi Philippe/0000-0001-7327-3139",,,,,37,11,11,0,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

We develop a theoretical model of trade with vertically-linked industries whereby upstream manufacturers compete in export markets and may decide to acquire ownership stakes in an intermediary. The model highlights how more productive firms succeed in managing the double marginalization problem and in reducing the costs of exporting through forward acquisition. The predictions from the model are tested using firm-level data on the French food industry. The results demonstrate that acquiring an intermediary lowers prices and distribution costs, and reveal that the benefits from forward acquisitions can be quite large. Conversely, we find that vertical ownership creates a market externality among manufacturers due to the reallocation of market shares from small firms to large firms, thereby forcing some low-productivity firms to exit foreign markets.","[Gaigne, Carl; Latouche, Karine; Turolla, Stephane] French Inst Agr Res INRA, SMART LERECO Unit, Rennes, France",INRAE,"Gaigné, C (通讯作者)，French Inst Agr Res INRA, SMART LERECO Unit, Rennes, France.",carl.gaigne@inra.fr,,"Gaigne, Carl/0000-0002-1540-234X",,,,,37,20,22,3,35,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

This paper employs a partial equilibrium model which takes into account the impact mechanism of subsidy policies to simulate the impact of current subsidy policies on grain supply and demand and on enhancing grain self-sufficiency in China. The simulation results suggest that subsidies can generally promote grain production, reduce consumption, increase imports, reduce exports and increase ending stocks. Subsidies may also result in increases in grain self-sufficiency rate and stock-to-use ratio, but the increases are relatively small, indicating that the subsidies lack efficiency. Given that subsidies constitutes only a very small share of farmers' total income, and that significant scope remains for increasing subsidy levels in China, employing subsidy policies can help to enhance or at least maintain China's grain self-sufficiency at a high level. Various measures should be implemented to improve the inefficiency of the current subsidy system, such as (1) combining different types of subsidies; (2) providing discriminatory subsidies to poor/rich farmers or developing/developed areas; and (3) increasing subsidy rates for wheat and corn.","[Qian, Jiarong; Zhao, Zhijun] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Econ & Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ito, Shoichi] Kyushu Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Fukuoka, Japan; [Mu, Yueying] China Agr Univ, Collage Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xuejun] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Agricultural Economics & Development, CAAS; Kyushu University; China Agricultural University; Nanjing Agricultural University","Wang, XJ (通讯作者)，Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",wangxj@njau.edu.cn,,,"Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program [ASTIP-IAED-2015-05]; Basic Research Foundation for the Central Public Institutes [0052014001-1, 0052015001-1]; Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars; State Education Ministry; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD)",Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program; Basic Research Foundation for the Central Public Institutes; Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars(Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars); State Education Ministry; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD),"The authors acknowledge the funding support from the Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program (ASTIP-IAED-2015-05), a Project Sponsored by the Basic Research Foundation for the Central Public Institutes (0052014001-1; 0052015001-1), a Project Sponsored by the Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, the State Education Ministry and the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD).",,24,11,11,4,56,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach This paper closely follows the framework of Rozelle et al. (1999), Taylor et al. (2003) and Atamanov and Van den Berg (2012)new economics of labor migrationto demonstrate the heterogeneous effects of migration on agricultural productivity, using simultaneous equations extended by an interaction term of off-farm income and household wealth. Findings The results empirically verify two key theoretical predictions: the loss of labor available for agricultural activities decreases rice yield per worker per day, and the off-farm income that may relax liquidity constraints has a positive offsetting effect, which becomes weaker with increasing household wealth. The final calculation based on these two contradictory influences indicates that the lost-labor effect dominates across all levels of household wealth, resulting in a negative net impact of rural-urban migration on agricultural productivity. The key results are shown to hold for land productivity as well. Originality/value To the best of the author's knowledge, it is the first paper to examine the impacts of rural-urban migration on labor productivity and the heterogeneity across households with different levels of wealth. A major policy issue facing national leaders is whether the massive and ongoing outflow of labor will be a threat to China's rural development and its food security in the future.

The purpose of this paper is to analyze the effects of Chinese soybean trade policies on the domestic soybean market during the food crisis. Design/methodology/approach A Markov switching error correction model is constructed for the empirical analysis. Market integration, market equilibrium and market stability are compared among three regimes: the normal state, crisis state and post-crisis state. In order to reduce the disturbance from external markets factors on the results, the US soybean market is selected as a control group in that it did not use any soybean intervention trade policies during the food crisis. Findings The empirical results indicate that China's temporary soybean trade policies lead to a decrease in market integration between domestic and international soybean markets and a reduction in domestic soybean market stability. Originality/value It is the first time that China's soybean market is selected as a sample and case on this issue. The regime shifting non-linear model could be more applicable because there exists a non-linear transmission relationship between grains markets during food crises. The results imply that China's temporary soybean trade policies do not improve market integration and stability. China should reconsider implementing soybean trade intervening policies to protect the domestic market and safeguard food security.","[Sun, Lin; Qi, Mingxian] Zhejiang Univ Technol, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Reed, Michael R.] Univ Kentucky, Dept Agr Econ, Lexington, KY USA",Zhejiang University of Technology; University of Kentucky,"Sun, L (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ Technol, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",sunlin@zjut.edu.cn,,"Reed, Michael/0000-0001-8694-646X","National Natural Science Foundation [71673251, 71303216]",National Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Special gratitude is expressed to Bingchuan Hu from Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and Professor Chunhui Ye from Zhejiang University for their continuous encouragement during the whole research period.

A survey of farmers from Maryland is used to estimate the direct effect of cover crop cost sharing on the acres of cover crops, and the indirect effect of cover crop cost sharing on the acres of two other practices: conservation tillage and contour/strip cropping. A two-stage simultaneous equation approach is used to correct for voluntary self-selection into cost-sharing programs, and to account for substitution effects among conservation practices. Using model parameters from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Chesapeake Bay Program, the estimated effects of cost sharing are then translated to pollution reduction in order to quantify water quality benefits. The results indicate that the large cover crop cost sharing effort in Maryland had considerable effects on cover crop acreage, substantially reducing nitrogen and phosphorus runoff. Moreover, after accounting for the indirect effects on conservation tillage, the cost per pound of phosphorus abatement in the Chesapeake Bay decreased by between 60-67%.","[Fleming, Patrick] Franklin & Marshall Coll, Econ & Publ Policy, Lancaster, PA 17604 USA",Franklin & Marshall College,"Fleming, P (通讯作者)，Franklin & Marshall Coll, Econ & Publ Policy, Lancaster, PA 17604 USA.",pfleming@fandm.edu,,,,,,,29,22,26,3,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

This article reviews the literature in this area and identifies the positive and negative aspects of labeling food processes. The good parts are that, under appropriate third-party or governmental oversight, process labels can effectively bridge the informational gap between producers and consumers, satisfy consumer demand for broader and more stringent quality assurance criteria, and ultimately create value for both consumers and producers. Despite the appeal of the Consumer Right to Know slogan, process labeling also can have serious unintentional consequences. The bad parts are that consumers can misinterpret these labels and thus misalign their personal preferences and their actual food purchases. The ugly parts are that these labels can stigmatize food produced with conventional processes even when there is no scientific evidence that they cause harm, or even that it is compositionally any different. Based on this review of the literature, we provide three policy recommendations: (i) mandatory labeling of food processes should occur only in situations in which the product has been scientifically demonstrated to harm human health; (ii) governments should not impose bans on process labels because this approach goes against the general desire of consumers to know about and have control over the food they are eating, and it can undermine consumer trust of the agricultural sector; and (iii) a prudent policy approach is to encourage voluntary process labeling, perhaps using smart phone technology similar to that proposed in 2016 federal legislation related to foods containing ingredients that were genetically engineered.","[Messer, Kent D.] Univ Delaware, Dept Appl Econ & Stat, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Costanigro, Marco] Colorado State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Kaiser, Harry M.] Cornell Univ, Dept Appl Econ & Management, Appl Econ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",University of Delaware; Colorado State University; Cornell University,"Messer, KD (通讯作者)，Univ Delaware, Dept Appl Econ & Stat, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",messer@udel.edu,"Messer, Kent/AAK-8811-2020",,,,,,96,83,96,7,118,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

Most studies focus on consumers' preferences for low-input turfgrasses at a state or regional level, but none have examined consumer preferences at a national or international level. In addition, we explore possible consumer preference heterogeneity and market segments. We find that one of the most influential turfgrass attributes for both U.S. and Canadian consumers is the ability to withstand foot traffic. Consumers' preferences are greatly affected by maintenance attributes. Low mowing frequency, followed by water usage and fertilizer requirements, are considered the most important attributes for consumers. Generally speaking, many consumers are willing to pay high premiums for turfgrasses with lower maintenance requirements. Three consumer segments are identified based on participants' heterogeneity in their preferences for turfgrass attributes: Balanced Consumers, Low-input Conscious Consumers, and Appearance Conscious Consumers. Our results imply that breeding and promotion of low-input turfgrasses species, which could benefit consumers and the environment, should receive greater attention from the turfgrass seed industry.","[Yue, Chengyan] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, Hort Mkt, 1970 Folwell Ave, St Paul, MN 55126 USA; [Yue, Chengyan; Watkins, Eric; Horgan, Brian P.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Hort Sci, 1970 Folwell Ave, St Paul, MN 55126 USA; [Wang, Jingjing] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, 1970 Folwell Ave, St Paul, MN 55126 USA; [Bonos, Stacy A.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Plant Biol & Pathol, 59 Dudley Rd,Foran Hall, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Nelson, Kristen C.] Dept Fisheries Wildlife & Conservat Biol, 1530 Cleveland Ave N, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Nelson, Kristen C.] Dept Forest Resources, 1530 Cleveland Ave N, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Murphy, James A.; Meyer, William A.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Plant Biol & Pathol, 59 Dudley Rd, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Yue, C (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, Hort Mkt, 1970 Folwell Ave, St Paul, MN 55126 USA.;Yue, C (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Hort Sci, 1970 Folwell Ave, St Paul, MN 55126 USA.",yuechy@umn.edu; wang2797@umn.edu; ewatkins@umn.edu; bonos@aesop.rutgers.edu; nelso468@umn.edu; murphy@aesop.rutgers.edu; wmeyer@aesop.rutgers.edu; bphorgan@umn.edu,"wang, dan/JEF-0836-2023; wang, jing/GRS-7509-2022; wang, jing/GVT-8700-2022; WANG, JINGYI/GSJ-1241-2022","Watkins, Eric/0000-0001-7225-1747","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture; Specialty Crops Research Initiative [2012-51181-19932]","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Specialty Crops Research Initiative","This material is based upon work that is supported by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Specialty Crops Research Initiative under award number 2012-51181-19932.",,88,33,39,3,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

Thus, a household's location with respect to markets and the resource stock determines household market participation and associated resource degradation. Applying a discrete-choice framework for fuelwood collection in a developing country, we characterize the spatial pattern of market participation regimes and forest use. All else being equal, autarkic households are closest to the forest and furthest from the market, buyer households are closest to the market and furthest from the forest, and seller households are at intermediate distances. Empirical tests based on survey data from northern Uganda support the predictions from our theoretical model.

The government of Burkina Faso, following the example of a number of other countries in the region, launched a subsidy programme in 2008 to encourage farmers' uptake of chemical fertilisers and foster cereal production. This article explores the importance of fertiliser profitability in explaining the relative, apparent low use of chemical fertilisers by farmers in Burkina Faso. Using large-scale plot data, we estimate maize yield response to nitrogen to be 19 kg/ha on average and to vary with soil characteristics. Profitability, which we measure through the calculation of a marginal value cost ratio, is estimated at 1.4 on those plots which received fertilisers, with significant variations across regions. For those plots on which fertilisers were not applied, we predict that fertilisers should have been profitable in most cases under the current level of subsidised fertiliser prices. These findings suggest that the low uptake of chemical fertilisers might have been driven by factors other than profitability, including insufficient supply of subsidised fertilisers to farmers in need. Our results also call for increasing the availability of credit to farmers in order to encourage adoption of chemical fertilisers. Finally, our results also show that not taking into account the endogeneity of nitrogen use in the yield equation may produce biased estimates of the maize yield response to nitrogen.","[Koussoube, Estelle] Univ Paris 09, PSL, LEDa, DIAL UMR 225, Paris, France; [Koussoube, Estelle] IRD, DIAL UMR 225, LEDa, Paris, France; [Nauges, Celine] Univ Toulouse, INRA, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Laboratoire dEconomie de Dauphine LEDa; Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Laboratoire dEconomie de Dauphine LEDa; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; INRAE,"Nauges, C (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse, INRA, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France.",celine.nauges@toulouse.inra.fr,,,,,,,47,30,34,2,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0165-1587,1464-3618,,EUR REV AGRIC ECON,Eur.

A newly developed right-tailed unit root testing procedure is applied to detect price bubbles in the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) and Chinese agricultural futures market during the period 2005-14. Results show that Chinese markets experienced less prominent speculative bubbles than the international markets for its high self-sufficiency commodities (wheat and corn), but not for low self-sufficiency commodities (soybean). The difference in price behavior is attributed to differences in market intelligence, and to Chinese agricultural policies related to trade as well as domestic government policies.

It proposes an analytical framework mitigating the problem of endogenous switching between accumulation regimes and disentangling the true state-dependence of poverty. Specifically, a dynamic asset threshold separating households into downward and upward mobility regimes is identified after taking households' unobserved characteristics and observed regime-differentiated accumulation strategies into account. The static analysis identifies causality running from settling into a downward mobility regime to the probability of poverty measured by consumption. Furthermore, allowing for endogenous initial poverty status, the dynamic analysis finds strong true state-dependence in poverty. Households with the same characteristics are nearly twice as likely to be poor as if they had not previously switched to the accumulation regime. Assets below the dynamic threshold serve as a conduit through which poverty propagates itself. Factors that help to break this vicious circle are identified.","[You, Jing] Renmin Univ China, China Antipoverty Res Inst, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [You, Jing] Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; Renmin University of China,"You, J (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, China Antipoverty Res Inst, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.;You, J (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",jing.you@ruc.edu.cn,,"You, Jing/0000-0002-0152-0724","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71403282, 71673283]; National Social Science Foundation of China (NSSFC) [15ZDC026]",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China (NSSFC),"The author is grateful to two anonymous reviewers, Adam Ozanne, Bernard Walters, Xiaobing Wang, Nick Weaver, Katsushi Imai, and Albert Park for their useful comments and insightful discussion on an earlier draft.

Transaction cost, resource base and knowledge governance arguments are used to explain the choice of innovation strategy. Our results show that the decisions to innovate in-house or through outsourcing are independent from each other. In addition, we find that several organisational characteristics such as communication systems, human resource practices and specialisation are likely to influence both strategies. Conversely, organisational characteristics such as the allocation of authority and the business network do not seem relevant in determining the innovation strategies of the European agri-food sector.","[Materia, Valentina C.] Wageningen Univ & Res, Management Studies Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Pascucci, Stefano] Univ Exeter, Sch Business, Exeter, Devon, England; [Dries, Liesbeth] Wageningen Univ & Res, Agr Econ & Rural Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; University of Exeter; Wageningen University & Research,"Materia, VC (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ & Res, Management Studies Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.",valentina.materia@wur.nl,"Materia, Valentina Cristiana/GLS-0904-2022","Materia, Valentina Cristiana/0000-0002-8486-1857; Dries, Liesbeth/0000-0002-1061-1441",,,,,62,21,24,1,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

The purpose of this paper is to examine firm managers' attitudes toward GM technology, biotechnology R&D investment, and political lobbying activities. Design/methodology/approach - Using data from surveys of 160 managers in the food, feed, chemical, and seed industries in 2013-2014, this paper employed three probit models to examine the determinants of managers' attitudes, biotechnology R&D investment, and lobbying activities. Findings - The results show that most Chinese agribusiness managers are concerned about GM foods and oppose its adoption. Nevertheless, one-third of the firms invest in biotechnology R&D and less than 15 percent of managers lobbied the government to change biotechnology policies. The econometric estimation results suggest that profit change expectation is the main factor affecting managers' attitudes and biotechnology R&D investment decisions, whereas lobbying activities are significantly influenced by their attitudes and biotechnology R&D investment. In addition, managers' attitudes toward GM foods also significantly influence firms' decisions to invest in biotechnology R&D. Originality/value - This paper has improved on previous research in two ways. First, it analyses the determinants of agribusiness firm managers' attitudes toward GM technology, biotechnology R&D investment, and lobbying activities. Second, the methodology involves an analysis of agribusiness firm survey data in the food, feed, chemical, and seed industries, which is the first time to use such data to research on economic interest group in agricultural biotechnology field.","[Deng, Haiyan] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Hu, Ruifa] Beijing Inst Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Huang, Jikun] Peking Univ, China Ctr Agr Policy, Sch Adv Agr Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Pray, Carl; Jin, Yanhong] Rutgers Univ New Brunswick, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, New Brunswick, NJ USA; [Li, Zhonghua] China Crop Protect Ind Assoc, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Institute of Technology; Beijing Institute of Technology; Peking University; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Deng, HY (通讯作者)，Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71,210,004]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71,210,004).",,28,15,17,0,60,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - The three-stage least squares were used to address simultaneity and over-identification problems in comparison with two-stage least squares (2SLS). The Durbin-Wu-Hausman test was employed to identify the endogeneity of the commercialisation and specialisation variables. The validity, relevance, and strength of the instruments were tested using the Stock-Yogo weak instrument diagnostics test. Findings - A two-way interrelationship between specialisation and commercialisation were confirmed, and suggest that farmers' decisions on farm commercialisation and production specialisation are actually separate and interacting. Social implications - By demonstrating that a virtuous cycle exists between agricultural commercialisation and on-farm specialisation, policies can be formulated to complement these two effects that may help increase small holders' income. Farmers' market participation can be indirectly improved by combining market improvement and risk management tools to encourage production specialisation. Originality/value - The insights of this study cast further light onto the farm market participation theory by emphasising that higher asset endowments enable small farmers to specialise in production with comparative advantage.","[Li, Lihua] Lanzhou Univ, State Key Lab Grassland Agroecosyst, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Li, Lihua; Bellotti, William D.] Western Sydney Univ, Sch Sci & Hlth, Penrith, NSW, Australia; [Varua, Maria Estela] Western Sydney Univ, Sch Business, DAP Econ Finance & Property, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Komarek, Adam M.] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Shankar, Sriram] Australia Natl Univ, Coll Arts & Social Sci, Ctr Social Res & Methods, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Lanzhou University; Western Sydney University; Western Sydney University; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Australian National University,"Li, LH (通讯作者)，Lanzhou Univ, State Key Lab Grassland Agroecosyst, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China.",17184104@student.westernsydney.edu.au,"Bellotti, William D/B-5013-2016; Komarek, Adam/AAW-9399-2020","Komarek, Adam/0000-0001-5676-3005; Shankar, Sriram/0000-0001-9096-9883",Australian Centre of International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) John Allwright Fellowship,Australian Centre of International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) John Allwright Fellowship,This study is funded by the Australian Centre of International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) John Allwright Fellowship.

The dynamic model accounts for consumers' storing behavior, and allows us to study soda consumers' price sensitivity (how responsive consumers are to the overall price) and sale sensitivity (the fraction of consumers that store soda during temporary price reductions). By matching store-level purchase data to county-level data on obesity incidence, we find higher sale sensitivity in populations with higher obesity rates. Conversely, we find that storers are less price sensitive than non-storers, and that their price sensitivity decreases with the obesity rate. Our results suggest that policies aimed at increasing soda prices might be less effective than previously thought, especially in areas where consumers can counteract that price increase by stockpiling during sale periods; according to our results, this dampening effect would be more pronounced precisely in those areas with higher obesity rates.","[Wang, Emily; Rojas, Christian; Colantuoni, Francesca] Univ Massachusetts Amherst, Dept Resource Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Rojas, C (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts Amherst, Dept Resource Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",rojas@umass.edu,,,,,,,55,10,12,1,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Such markets will be averse to quality loss, offering distinct prices and substantial rewards to farmers for the supply of quality produce. Farmers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where informal markets exist, have often assessed the rewards for the supply of quality produce as inadequate. Hence, this study investigates if intermediary buyers are actually indifferent to quality loss in supplies based on two scenariosthe informal market scenario and a hypothesized grade scenario. The analysis builds on survey data from marketers in two informal maize markets in Ghana. For the hypothesized grade scenario, random effect regression was used to examine the influence of marketer-specific characteristics on premiums offered to farmers over different quality levels. The findings suggest that although informal markets seem not to adequately value loss reduction, investing in institutional infrastructures, such as grades and standards can change this. Furthermore, interaction among marketers and association participation positively influences the value marketers place on quality loss reduction. The result highlights the importance of standard grading systems and collaborating with market groups in minimizing quality loss.","[Bassey, Nkoyo Etim; Kuhn, Arnim; Storm, Hugo] Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Nussallee 21, D-53115 Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn,"Bassey, NE (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Nussallee 21, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",nkoyo.bassey@ilr.uni-bonn.de,"Storm, Hugo/AAT-9629-2021; Storm, Hugo/GVU-3032-2022","Storm, Hugo/0000-0003-3791-3615; Storm, Hugo/0000-0003-3791-3615; Kuhn, Arnim/0000-0001-6342-4749; Nelson, Nkoyo/0000-0002-2729-1528",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under the BiomassWeb project [031A258D]; German Research Foundation (DFG) [STO 1087/1-1],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under the BiomassWeb project; German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),The authors are grateful to Kwadwo Amankwah and Akonu Augustine for their immense support in Ghana.

Yet, informational barriers often mean adoption rates remain low. In this study, we focus on how learning from others represents one means of removing informational barriers. We capture the effect of social learning through an explicitly spatial econometric model applied to farm-level maize adoption rates in Mozambique. We find that social learning is significant and can help explain the apparent clustering of adoption among farmers. Agencies interested in promoting variety adoption, therefore, would be well served to leverage the strength of existing information networks, rather than imposing solutions that work against interfarmer information flow.","[Fang, Di] Univ Arkansas, Dept Agr Econ Agribusiness, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Richards, Timothy J.] Arizona State Univ, WP Carey Sch Business, Agribusiness, Mesa, AZ USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; Arizona State University,"Fang, D (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas, Dept Agr Econ Agribusiness, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",difang@uark.edu; trichards@asu.edu,,"Fang, Di/0000-0002-0717-7576; Richards, Timothy/0000-0001-8832-9609",,,,,47,4,4,1,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

Our theoretical model suggests that certain characteristics of an insured farmer (or farm) under both types of coverage can be sources of advantageous selection. Farmers who advantageously select are more likely to purchase insurance coverage and less likely to realise a loss. A supplementary empirical analysis, based on data from the Philippine crop insurance market, illustrates how sources of advantageous selection can be identified econometrically.","[He, Juan] Huazhong Agr Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Rejesus, Roderick; Zheng, Xiaoyong] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC USA; [Yorobe, Jose, Jr.] IRRI, Social Sci Div, Laguna, Philippines; [Yorobe, Jose, Jr.] Univ Philippines, Laguna, Philippines",Huazhong Agricultural University; North Carolina State University; CGIAR; International Rice Research Institute (IRRI); University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Los Banos,"Zheng, XY (通讯作者)，North Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC USA.",xzheng@ncsu.edu,,,"National Science Foundation of China [71703048]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in China [2662017QD011]; US Department of Agriculture Hatch Projects [NC02442, NC02598]",National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in China; US Department of Agriculture Hatch Projects,"Jose Yorobe is in the Social Sciences Division, IRRI, and also the University of the Philippines, Laguna, Philippines.

The results reveal an increase in TFP of 6.6 per cent over the whole observation period, with technological progress being the major source of productivity growth. Meanwhile, efficiency decreased. Farms experienced great technological progress from 1991 to 2000. From a methodological point of view, the comparison with results obtained with Malmquist indexes shows similar trends but different magnitudes, with the Malmquist index overestimating the TFP and technological changes compared to the Fare-Primont index. In addition, the use of a sequential approach that restricts technological change to being positive or null allows for the precise calculation of technology changes, disregarding the effects of external conditions that are captured in efficiency changes. Finally, the estimation of full dimensional efficient facets (FDEFs) that guarantees the positivity of all shadow prices used to assess the mix efficiency component of TFP change is promising.","[Dakpo, K.

Using DNA fingerprinting through Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), we identified different cultivars in farmers fields. We also used this information to remove possible bias in the adoption model that could have resulted from a misclassification of improved varieties (IVs). As a result, we found that farmers substantially overestimate their use of IVs and there are important differences in the determinants of adoption between farmer self-identification and DNA fingerprinting. This finding implies that the incorporation of DNA fingerprinting in IV adoption studies is important to ensure the accuracy of future agricultural economic research and the relevance of subsequent policy recommendations.","[Floro, Victorino O.] Georgetown Univ, Global Human Dev Program, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Labarta, Ricardo A.; Martinez, Jose M.] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Valle Del Cauca, Colombia; [Becerra Lopez-Lavalle, Luis A.] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Agrobiodivers Res Area Cassava Program, Valle Del Cauca, Colombia; [Martinez, Jose M.] Univ Valle, Dept Econ, Cali, Colombia; [Ovalle, Tatiana M.] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Cassava Genet Program, Valle Del Cauca, Colombia",Georgetown University; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; Universidad del Valle; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT,"Floro, VO (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Global Human Dev Program, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",vof2@georgetown.edu,"Martinez, Jose Maria/JYQ-1053-2024; Labarta, Ricardo/HMU-9249-2023; Lopez-Lavalle, Luis Augusto Becerra/H-4678-2019","Martinez, Jose Maria/0000-0003-4464-2374; Labarta, Ricardo/0000-0003-3517-8768; Lopez-Lavalle, Luis Augusto Becerra/0000-0003-3520-2270; Floro IV, Victorino/0000-0003-4949-3590",CGIAR Research Program on Roots Tubers and Bananas; Global Human Development Program at Georgetown University,CGIAR Research Program on Roots Tubers and Bananas(CGIAR); Global Human Development Program at Georgetown University,"Victorino Floro IV is a CIAT Visiting Researcher from the Global Human Development Program at Georgetown University, USA.

Schultz introduced the idea of the productivity residual to agricultural economics (1956). Schultz's main message was that growth in conventional inputs accounted for little of the observed growth in agricultural output, and that there was work to be done by agricultural economists to understand and ultimately eliminate this unexplained residual called productivity. Thus was launched the economics of agricultural productivity as a sub-field within agricultural economics, along with the economics of agricultural R&D and innovation and related government policy. Much progress has been made in the decades since. Still, critical issues remain unresolved. This matters because agricultural innovation and productivity matter, and so do the related policies that rest to some extent on our established understanding of the economic relationships. In this paper I review some unsettled issues related to economic models and measures applied to agricultural R&D and productivity, and some unfinished business in terms of economic and policy questions that are not yet well answered. Before doing that, I present some evidence on agricultural productivity and why it matters. Next, with a nod to factology, I present available productivity measures from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and International Science and Technology Practice and Policy (InSTePP) Center, and compare them in the context of translog cost function models. In subsequent sections I use these and other data to develop new evidence related to two contentious questions: (a) Do farmers benefit from public agricultural R&D?

This article applies a stochastic frontier inefficiency model to a panel of 77 wine grape farms in South Africa between 2005 and 2015 and allows the comparison of efficiency levels for the old established wine regions with those of newer entrants. Thus, we investigate whether experience plus first choice of location matters more than the follower's advantage of newer technology. In all regions, a greater share of permanent labor and increased supervision raised efficiency, while more inorganic fertilizer and less irrigation has the opposite effect. Innovations in trellising had insignificant effects (except in the old regions) but not replacing old vines reduced efficiency. However, a higher proportion of red varietals also lowered efficiency in the old regions due to a fall in the price of red wine as these farmers continued to concentrate on quality reds. The new regions compensated for falling prices by increasing crop size with irrigation and fertilizer and extending the area planted, but with less concern for quality. This appears to be more successful in efficiency terms, but as international demand for quality wine increases it may be a poor long-term strategy.","[Piesse, Jenifer] Bournemouth Univ, 89 Holdenhurst Rd, Bournemouth BH8 8BE, Dorset, England; [Piesse, Jenifer; Thirtle, Colin; Vink, Nick] Univ Stellenbosch, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa; [Conradie, Beatrice] Univ Cape Town, ZA-7700 Cape Town, South Africa; [Thirtle, Colin] Imperial Coll London, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England",Bournemouth University; Stellenbosch University; University of Cape Town; Imperial College London,"Piesse, J (通讯作者)，Bournemouth Univ, 89 Holdenhurst Rd, Bournemouth BH8 8BE, Dorset, England.;Piesse, J (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa.",jpiesse@bournemouth.ac.uk,"Conradie, Beatrice/ABG-3218-2020; Vink, Nick/K-5330-2013","Conradie, Beatrice/0000-0002-4675-6300; Vink, Nick/0000-0002-5874-0939",,,,,24,10,10,1,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Second, it validates the self-reported ANA behaviour across both approaches. Third, it explores the concordance of stated methods with that of the inferred method. Results show that WTP estimates from serial-level data differ from those from choice task-level data.

Applying the tool of a global meat tax will lead to a double dividend as negative externalities are reduced and at the same time huge tax revenues will be generated which could be used to make further steps in the direction of achieving the stated FAO goal in the Rome Declaration.","[Chloupkova, Jarka] European Commiss, Brussels, Belgium; [Chloupkova, Jarka; Zdechovsky, Tomas] European Parliament, Brussels, Belgium; [Svendsen, Gert Tinggaard] Aarhus Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Aarhus, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Chloupkova, J (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Brussels, Belgium.;Chloupkova, J (通讯作者)，European Parliament, Brussels, Belgium.",jarka.brussels@gmail.com,"Svendsen, Gert Tinggaard/AAQ-1877-2021","Svendsen, Gert Tinggaard/0000-0003-1463-5421",,,,,26,8,9,3,35,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The purpose of this paper is to identify which attributes generate the highest total revenue or social surplus, information that breeders can take into account as they allocate resources to focus on attributes in their breeding programs. Design/methodology/approach - This study used mail-in and online surveys to collect consumer and producer choice experiment data, and then employed mixed logit models to analyze and simulate individual producer and consumer willingness to pay (WTP) for the apple attributes. Findings - Based on the simulation results, this study derived the supply and demand curves and the market equilibrium prices and quantities for each apple attribute. Based on the WTP analysis for both consumer and producer, this paper found the highest equilibrium price and welfare for apples come from crispness, followed by flavor. Originality/value - The authors propose a framework to estimate the equilibrium prices and quantities of a product based on the results of choice experiments. The framework can be easily adapted to understand any countries' producer and consumer preferences for certain products.","[Choi, Jong Woo] Korea Rural Econ Inst, Naju Si, South Korea; [Yue, Chengyan] Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Dept Appl Econ & Hort Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Yue, Chengyan] Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Hort Mkt, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Luby, James] Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Dept Hort Sci, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Zhao, Shuoli] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, Plymouth, MN USA; [Gallardo, Karina] Washington State Univ, Sch Econ, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [McCracken, Vicki] Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [McFerson, Jim] Washington Tree Fruit Res Commiss, Wenatchee, WA USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; Washington State University; Washington State University,"Yue, CY (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Dept Appl Econ & Hort Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.;Yue, CY (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Hort Mkt, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",yuechy@umn.edu,"McCracken, Vicki/AAA-1854-2020",,"Specialty Crop Research Initiatives, US Department of Agriculture","Specialty Crop Research Initiatives, US Department of Agriculture","This project was funded by Specialty Crop Research Initiatives, US Department of Agriculture.",,48,5,5,0,14,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

We hypothesize that both extreme output price levels and market deregulation fostered efficient reallocation of production resources. We use a farm-level dataset containing financial accounting data for a period of 15 years. Farm-level productivity is estimated by a proxy variable approach that is robust to endogenous input choice. We compare this approach to other estimation techniques as well as an index-based analysis. After aggregation we decompose sector productivity into unweighted mean productivity and a covariance term measuring the allocation of resources toward more productive farms. We observe an increase in the covariance term coinciding with a period of deregulation efforts and volatile milk prices. We seek to find support for our hypotheses by a regression analysis linking the measure for the potential covariance between resource reallocation and productivity on the one hand, and deregulation as well as price variability on the other. In this analysis we find some empirical evidence for the hypotheses.","[Frick, Fabian; Sauer, Johannes] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Agr Econ, Munich, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Frick, F (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, Dept Agr Econ, Munich, Germany.",fabian.frick@tum.de,,"Frick, Fabian/0000-0001-7017-9745; Sauer, Johannes (Jo)/0000-0003-2674-0229",,,,,56,27,28,1,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

But might remote partnerships be a better way of expanding a farm business given projected climate change and price volatility? This question is addressed using farm business financial modelling. Representative farms at 27 locations in Western Australia are constructed to enable comparison of the value of buying out a neighbour versus expansion using geographically distant joint venture (JV) partners. The farm models consider economies of size, bulk purchase price discounts, the variability and correlation of returns associated with farm expansion, and impacts of climate change. Random selection of a remote partner generates little improvement in wealth; on average only 2.3 and 1.6 per cent, respectively, under current and projected future climate across all locations. However, there is large variation in wealth appreciation opportunities for each location and between locations. Preferred partnerships are a function of each farm's characteristics. Locations highly preferred as JV partners under current climate are similarly preferred partners under projected future climate. The main sources of additional wealth come from economies of size advantages, risk-spreading benefits of combining geographically separated farms and bulk discounts. Farmers seeking business expansion will often benefit greatly from careful selection of a remote partner.","[Kingwell, Ross; Feldman, David] Univ Western Australia, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Kingwell, Ross; Farre, Imma; Plunkett, Brad] Western Australia, Dept Primary Ind & Reg Dev, S Perth, WA, Australia; [Thomas, Quenten] Quisit Pty Ltd, Innaloo, WA, Australia",University of Western Australia; Government of Western Australia; Department of Agriculture & Food - Western Australia,"Kingwell, R (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Crawley, WA, Australia.;Kingwell, R (通讯作者)，Western Australia, Dept Primary Ind & Reg Dev, S Perth, WA, Australia.",ross.kingwell@dpird.wa.gov.au,"Kingwell, Ross/AAU-9315-2020; Plunkett, Brad/JJG-0705-2023; kingwell, ross/AAK-2952-2021","Kingwell, Ross/0000-0003-0324-9488;",,,,,24,2,2,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

The broadband loan programs increase access to high-speed Internet in recipient communities, which can raise farm sales by increasing both farm output and prices received by producers. Further, high-speed Internet may drive down costs by providing information on cheaper inputs and better management practices, leading to an overall improvement in farm profits. Using U.S. county-level data on farm sales and expenditures in 2000 and 2007, we employ an inverse probability weighting technique to control for endogenous selection in an econometric model that also accounts for spatial dependence. We find that the two USDA broadband loan programs have had positive causal impacts on farm sales, expenditures, and profits in a subset of rural counties-those adjacent to metropolitan counties-but not in other types of counties.","[Kandilov, Amy M.

Agricultural economists get a significantly lower payoff to research quality, whether measured by quality-weighted journal articles (based on nine different weighting schemes) or by citations. Instead, salary depends on the quantity of journal articles, while article counts have no independent effect on economist salaries. These differences in the reward structure for research are not due to either the extension focus of agricultural economists or to disciplinary differences in publishing with students and instead may reflect institutional factors that govern incentives within universities. One-third of academics in the agricultural economics departments studied here have doctoral training in economics; the very different disciplinary reward structures may cause frustration for these faculty due to the muted returns to research quality that agricultural economics departments seem to offer.","[Gibson, John; Burton-McKenzie, Ethan] Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand",University of Waikato,"Gibson, J (通讯作者)，Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand.",jkgibson@waikato.ac.nz,"Gibson, John/AAM-6159-2020","Gibson, John/0000-0003-3886-6873",,,,,0,5,5,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Recent research applies these methods to address two key issues confounding identification: missing counterfactuals and nonrandomly misclassified treatment status. In this paper, we illustrate and extend the recent literature by using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) to study the robustness of prior conclusions. The SIPP confers important advantages: the detailed information about income and eligibility allows us to apply a modified discontinuity design to sharpen inferences, and the panel nature allows us to reduce uncertainty about true participation status.

Drawing on insights from the technology-adoption literature on learning and experimentation, and also on findings from a simple two-period Bayesian model of farmer decisions to participate in a new market, we incorporate measures of neighboring farmers' experience into the decision model. Results suggest that farmers delay entry to observe their neighbors' outcomes; we find a negative relationship between the number of neighbor participants in a given period and a farmer's own decision to enter the supply chain. We find evidence that farmers delay entry for strategic reasons, allowing neighbors to bear the costs associated with a first wave of adjustment to the market, including higher product rejection rates and lower initial annual transactions with supermarkets, compared to revenues from marketing in the traditional way. Results are robust to definitions of neighbors using both administrative and geographic designations. Our results raise questions about the optimal sequence and level of farmers' market participation and exit, which remain largely unexplored in the literature.","[Michelson, Hope C.] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Michelson, HC (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",hopecm@illinois.edu,,,US Agency for International Development (USAID) [EDH-A-00-06-0003-00]; AAEA McCorkle Scholarship; Cornell Latin American Studies Program; Social Science Research Council International Dissertation Research Fellowship,US Agency for International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); AAEA McCorkle Scholarship; Cornell Latin American Studies Program; Social Science Research Council International Dissertation Research Fellowship,"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, hopecm@illinois.edu.

Consequently, a neutrally framed HL task is proven to be an appropriate reflection of the risk farmers take in real production decisions.","[Vollmer, Elisabeth; Hermann, Daniel; Musshoff, Oliver] Georg August Univ Goettingen, Farm Management Grp, Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Vollmer, E (通讯作者)，Georg August Univ Goettingen, Farm Management Grp, Gottingen, Germany.",elisabeth.vollmer@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Mußhoff, Oliver/AAZ-1868-2021; Hermann, Daniel/HNI-8466-2023","Mußhoff, Oliver/0000-0002-3746-623X; Hermann, Daniel/0000-0003-0023-3675",,,,,75,24,23,3,35,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0165-1587,1464-3618,,EUR REV AGRIC ECON,Eur.

What does a dual membership mean for countries participating in multiple regional negotiations? We address the question from the perspective of tea exporters in Vietnam, a member of both the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). Focusing on the removal of tariffs and the cooperation on pesticide residue standards, we find that the TPP agreement will raise Vietnam's tea exports by about $4 million a year if TPP endorses Codex standards. However, Vietnamese tea exports will decline if TPP endorses American standards, unless sufficient technical assistance is provided. After the RCEP agreement takes effect, tea exporters from China and India will further penetrate the TPP markets by re-exporting from Vietnam.","[Xiong, Bo] State Calif, Dept Social Serv, Sacramento, CA 95814 USA",,"Xiong, B (通讯作者)，State Calif, Dept Social Serv, Sacramento, CA 95814 USA.",bonapartexiongbo@gmail.com,,,,,,,19,6,6,13,116,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

The cost estimates for temporal separation, the highest in our evaluation, imply that the exclusion of this measure in Germany is justified. The costliest measures of the ones that are currently applied in Germany are joint and strict liability for all damages. Our results further show that neighbours do not cause a problem and opportunities for reducing costs through agreements with them exist. Finally, we find that farmers' attitudes towards GM crops affect the probability of adoption of Bt maize.

We conduct a choice experiment in five states in the Midwestern and South-central regions of the U.S. to examine the effect of crop-contract attributes on the joint discrete-continuous choice decisions to adopt an energy crop and convert acres to it from a status quo use, while controlling for the effect of various farmers' risk and time preferences, sociodemographic characteristics, and availability of crop insurance for conventional crops. We find robust evidence that high discount rates, high upfront establishment costs and need for crop-specific investments create disincentives for adoption and allocation of land to energy crop production. The effects of riskiness of returns and risk aversion are less robust across specifications. The effect of conventional crop insurance on the energy crop adoption decision differs across types of insurance; in particular, farmers with revenue insurance are statistically significantly less likely to adopt an energy crop. Our results have implications for the design of effective contracts and policy incentives to induce the production of energy crops.","[Khanna, Madhu] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer, 1301 W Gregory Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Louviere, Jordan] Univ South Australia, Sch Business, Sch Mkt, David Pank Bldg,160 Currie St, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Yang, Xi] Univ Illinois, Energy Biosci Inst, 1206 W Gregory Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of South Australia; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Khanna, M (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer, 1301 W Gregory Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",khanna1@illinois.edu,,"Louviere, Jordan/0000-0001-7688-164X","Energy Biosciences Institute, University of California, Berkeley; USDA/NIFA","Energy Biosciences Institute, University of California, Berkeley(University of California System); USDA/NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA))","The authors are grateful for support provided for this research by the Energy Biosciences Institute, University of California, Berkeley and by the USDA/NIFA.",,51,33,34,2,46,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Employing the concept of social surplus, it can be shown that, when futures prices are used to estimate future spot prices, the errors in prediction produce to some degree resource misallocation, which in turn results in welfare losses. Therefore, the social welfare associated with the presence of futures markets can be measured using a Social Loss index. The indicator was calculated for the period 1975-2015 and for several subperiods, which allow us to analyse functional efficiency before and after the 2007-2008 spikes in the prices of agricultural commodities. Futures contracts for 12 products are evaluated. The products are grouped in three different categories: soft products', livestock' and grains and oilseeds'. The results indicate that livestock contracts tended to be more efficient than the rest of the contracts during the whole period, but in 2008-2015 their efficiency decreased vis-a-vis the rest of the products. Nevertheless, 2008-2015 proved to be the most efficient subperiod, confirming the remarkable development of agricultural futures markets over time.","[Consuegra, Meliyara; Garcia-Verdugo, Javier] UNED, Dept Appl Econ, Madrid, Spain; [Garcia-Verdugo, Javier] CNMC, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED),"Consuegra, M (通讯作者)，UNED, Dept Appl Econ, Madrid, Spain.",mconsuegra@cee.uned.es,,,,,,,32,10,10,2,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

One category that has been relatively underserved has been the market for local and organic small grains, such as wheat. Small grains provide multiple benefits to organic farms, but are underutilized because of their relatively low economic value compared to other organic crops. Small- and medium-scale producers in the northeastern region of the United States have faced challenges to produce and profitably market small grains for a whole host of reasons. Policy initiatives by New York State and GrowNYC's Greenmarket have expanded the market for local and organic grains and fueled the revival of small grain production in the Northeast. To meet demand, it was necessary to create the full value chain including the necessary infrastructure to handle relatively small amounts of a crop ordinarily sold as a commodity and processed at an industrial scale. This case study examines the articulation of a value chain with independent-but interdependent-enterprises connected by innovative agreements and strategic partnerships. The value chain includes the owner-operator of a farm located in the Finger Lakes region of New York, a milling enterprise started as a partnership with another farmer, and a community-supported bakery, where the farmer is also a partner. The case study also demonstrates how institutions and policies can help establish new markets to meet consumer demand, how farmers and entrepreneurs can identify market opportunities, and shows the articulation of a value chain on a micro-scale.","[Baker, Brian P.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Russell, June A.] Greenmarket, GrowNYC, Farm Inspect & Strateg Dev, New York, NY USA",Cornell University,"Baker, BP (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",bpb33@cornell.edu,,,National Institute of Food and Agriculture Organic Research and Extension Initiative [2011-51300-30697],National Institute of Food and Agriculture Organic Research and Extension Initiative,"Brian P.

A THEORETICAL ANALYSIS,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Fisheries; aquaculture; consumer preferences; food security; biological interactions,FISH-MEAL; FISHERIES; MANAGEMENT,"This article offers a theoretical analysis of the impact that the introduction of aquaculture has on wild fish stocks and consumer utility, taking into account three key components: (1) the dependence of aquaculture on reduction fisheries for the feeding of the farmed species; (2) biological interactions between the wild edible species-the predator-and the wild feed species-the prey; and (3) consumer preferences for wild and farmed fish. Fisheries are in open access, while the aquaculture sector is competitive. We show that when biological interactions are moderate, the introduction of aquaculture is beneficial in the long run: it improves consumer utility and alleviates the pressure on the edible fish stock. Results are deeply modified when biological interactions are strong: the stock of edible wild fish is reduced and the introduction of aquaculture may even cause a decrease in consumer utility. We then explore the consequences of improving aquaculture efficiency and the sensitivity of consumer preferences to the farmed fish characteristics, in the case where biological interactions are absent. Lastly, we analyze how our outcomes on the entry of aquaculture are affected when the wild edible fishery is optimally regulated, in combination with different assumptions on the regulation of the feed fishery. Results are again conditional on the intensity of biological interactions.","[Regnier, Esther; Schubert, Katheline] Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France",Paris School of Economics; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Schubert, K (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France.",schubert@univ-paris1.fr,,,,,,,30,11,11,1,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

The purpose of this paper is to assess the extent of rice harvest losses in major grain-producing areas in China by a sampling survey, and to further analyze the main factors influencing rice harvest losses using an ordered multinomial logistic model. Design/methodology/approach - In this study, data were collected using a multi-stage sampling method from ten major rice-producing provinces/regions in China. On this basis, five counties were selected from each of these provinces/regions. In the actual survey, house numbers were randomly selected, and then corresponding farmer households were visited by trained investigators. Findings - The survey found that 56.22 percent of respondents believed that rice harvest losses were 4 percent or lower in China, though there were differences among the provinces. The proportion of family business income, planting scale, mechanization level, timely harvest, and operational meticulousness had negative effects on rice harvest losses. On the other hand, farmers' experience of employment as migrant workers had a positive effect on rice harvest losses. In addition, bad weather and short handedness during harvest significantly increased rice harvest losses. Originality/value - The meaning of rice harvest losses was defined based on previous research findings on the definition of grain harvest losses and the realities in China. The current rice harvest losses in different areas in China were analyzed based on sampling survey data from 957 farmers in ten provinces in China.","[Wu, Linhai; Hu, Qipeng; Wang, Jianhua] Jiangnan Univ, Sch Business, Food Safety Res Base Jiangsu Prov, Wuxi, Peoples R China; [Wu, Linhai] Jiangnan Univ, Synerget Innovat Ctr Food Safety & Nutr, Wuxi, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Dian] Soochow Univ, Sch Dongwu Business, Dept Econ, Suzhou, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Dian] Jiangnan Univ, Sch Food Sci & Technol, Wuxi, Peoples R China",Jiangnan University; Jiangnan University; Soochow University - China; Jiangnan University,"Wu, LH (通讯作者)，Jiangnan Univ, Sch Business, Food Safety Res Base Jiangsu Prov, Wuxi, Peoples R China.;Wu, LH (通讯作者)，Jiangnan Univ, Synerget Innovat Ctr Food Safety & Nutr, Wuxi, Peoples R China.",wlh6799@126.com,"wang, jian/HRB-9588-2023",,"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [201513004-6, 2017JDZD01, 2015JDZD01]",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This work was a staged achievement of the 2015 special project on nonprofit grain industry research, Research on investigation and assessment techniques for post-harvest grain losses and waste (Project Number: 201513004-6), and the project Food Safety Risk Management (China) (Project Number: 2017JDZD01) supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities and Research on Chinese Food Safety Incidents Based on Big Data, a project of Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Project Number: 2015JDZD01).",,43,14,14,3,30,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - Reduction of antimicrobial uses in food animal production is relevant to both preventing antimicrobial resistance and ensuring global food security. This study focuses on reviewing antimicrobial impact on global food security, particularly in farm production by documenting the main drivers, functions and alternatives of antimicrobial animal uses, comparing different approaches used in evaluating its production effects and providing recommendations for future research and policy development. Findings - Three main approaches, controlled animal experiments, comparisons between with and without using antimicrobials at the farm level and comparisons before and after antimicrobial ban as growth promoter, have been used in measuring food security effects of antimicrobial uses in food animal production. They are, however, answering different questions with different measuring conditions. The positive production impact of antimicrobial use is often associated to its functions as a growth promoter and in preventing and treating diseases. In this review the author question the technical legitimacy for antimicrobials as a growth promoter and argue that antimicrobials should be treated as a special class of conditional and supportive input in farm production instead of using it as a normal input in its impact evaluation. Research limitations/implications - An approach of combining damage control function and disease epidemiological model instead of a simplified production function should be used in its impact evaluation including in evaluating those used as antimicrobial growth promoters. Practical implications - In reducing antimicrobial uses in animal production, apart from more active adoption of the alternatives, we call for a better understanding for the decision makings of antimicrobial use in the production process including government-veterinarian-farm links. Originality/value - This study examines the main issues in current economic research in antimicrobial food animal production, clarifies ambiguities in antimicrobial production functions and in different approaches used in impact evaluation, provides a roadmap for reduction of antimicrobial uses and a new approach for the policy evaluation.","[Wu, Ziping] Agrifood & Biosci Inst, Agr & Food Econ, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland",Agri-Food & Biosciences Institute,"Wu, ZP (通讯作者)，Agrifood & Biosci Inst, Agr & Food Econ, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland.",z.wu@qub.ac.uk,"Wu, Ziping/HTQ-0518-2023","Wu, Ziping/0000-0003-3661-0110",,,,,62,3,3,1,46,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,Leeds,"floor 5, Northspring 21-23 Wellington Street, Leeds, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

It contributes to the literature by providing additional broad support for the hypothesis that low rates of fertilizer use and improved seed variety adoption can be attributed to the fact that the SSA landscape is heterogeneous, so fertilizer and improved seed are not always advantageous, especially when considering the potentially high cost to farmers of obtaining fertilizer and improved seed. The analysis finds a synergy between nitrogen fertilizer and improved seed varieties. While the benefits of nitrogen tend to increase overtime without improved seed varieties and the benefits of improved seed varieties tend to decrease overtime without nitrogen, combining the two provides more sustained productivity benefits. Therefore, securing both nitrogen use and improved seed variety adoption is important for promoting sustained maize productivity increases across much of SSA. The research also contributes to the literature by using a methodology for calculating willingness to pay bounds that assess the importance of farmers' risk tolerances as a barrier to fertilizer use or improved seed variety adoption.","[Hurley, Terrance] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, Ruttan Hall 231,1994 Buford Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Koo, Jawoo] Int Food Policy Res Inst, IFPRI HEADQUARTERS, 1201 Eye St NW, Washington, DC 20005 USA; [Tesfaye, Kindie] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, POB 5689,CMC Rd, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT),"Hurley, T (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, Ruttan Hall 231,1994 Buford Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",tmh@umn.edu,"Koo, Jawoo/HNR-9802-2023; Koo, Jawoo/F-9397-2010","Koo, Jawoo/0000-0003-3424-9229; Hurley, Terrance/0000-0003-2135-7570",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; University of Minnesota; International Food Policy Research Institute; International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center; Agricultural Experimentation Station [MIN-14-034],Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); University of Minnesota(University of Minnesota System); International Food Policy Research Institute(CGIAR); International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center; Agricultural Experimentation Station,"This article was prepared for the HarvestChoice project with support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the University of Minnesota, the International Food Policy Research Institute, the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center, and Agricultural Experimentation Station Project No. MIN-14-034.",,43,11,12,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Each estimate can be compared with a corresponding futures price, i.e. the market forecast. The differences help discern the market expectations about the expected demand for the new crop relative to historical experience, which can help support outlook analyses. We find that in recent years, a 100 million bushel change in the expected supply of corn results in about a 6 cent per bushel negative change in the price of December corn.

One way to address the issue is the formation of GM-free or GM-only clubs. We model the decisions of individual farmers to cultivate either GM or non-GM crops and combine this with a game theoretic model of club formation to investigate the feasibility of such clubs. We consider two liability regimes: GM farmers are liable or they are not. We consider two benchmarks: Nash equilibrium without negotiations and the efficient allocation and compare those with partial co-operation through a Coasean club. We find that in both regimes a relatively large club can form but they are not always necessary to reach the efficient allocation. In fact, if farmers can freely decide under profit maximisation what to cultivate, they reach 95% of an efficient allocation. This holds independent of the property rights system and provides strong support for coexistence policies based on ex-post liability such as in the US and Spain.","[Punt, Maarten J.] Univ Sothern Denmark, Management & Econ Resources & Environm MERE Grp, Odense, Denmark; [Wesseler, Justus] Wageningen Univ, Agr Econ & Rural Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Punt, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Sothern Denmark, Management & Econ Resources & Environm MERE Grp, Odense, Denmark.",m.j.punt@gmail.com,"Wesseler, Justus/H-5347-2016",,European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) [KBBE -2011-5-289157],European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)(European Union (EU)),"Maarten Punt is in the Management and Economics of Resources and the Environment (MERE) Group, University of Southern Denmark, Denmark.

The second is to adapt hierarchical Bayesian methods as an alternative to the frequentist approach to estimate wheat yield response to nitrogen fertilizer. The economically optimal rate of nitrogen varies between 64 and 169 kg/ha and is consistently higher with the Bayesian method and higher under most scenarios when nonnormality is assumed for the plateau parameter.

Two water recovery instruments are used: purchasing water rights (buyback) from farmers, and saving water by subsidising irrigator adoption of technically efficient technology. A moratorium on buyback has focused environmental recovery on subsidised technically efficient technology adoption. Economists argue that national welfare is maximised via buyback and highlight the limitations of efficiency savings to recover sufficient environmental water. A risk is that water recovery targets may be reduced in future, limiting welfare gains from water reform. This article evaluates possible welfare trade-offs surrounding environmental water recovery outcomes where arbitrary limits on buyback are imposed. Results suggest that, on average, strategies which attempt to obtain >1500gigalitres (GL) of water from on-farm efficiency investments will only provide sufficient resources to meet environmental objectives in very wet states of nature. We conclude that reliance on technically efficient irrigation infrastructure is less economically efficient relative to water buyback. Importantly, the transformation of MDB irrigation will significantly constrain irrigators' future capacity to adapt to climate change.","[Adamson, David; Loch, Adam] Univ Adelaide South Australia, Ctr Global Food & Resources, Adelaide, SA, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Loch, A (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide South Australia, Ctr Global Food & Resources, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",adam.loch@adelaide.edu.au,"Loch, Adam/F-4246-2013; Adamson, David/A-5310-2011","Loch, Adam/0000-0002-1436-8768; Adamson, David/0000-0003-1616-968X","University of Queensland's School of Economics Search & Visitors Committee; University of South Australia's School of Commerce; ARC DECRA Grant [DE160100213, DE150100328, DP140103946]; ARC DECRA Grant",University of Queensland's School of Economics Search & Visitors Committee; University of South Australia's School of Commerce; ARC DECRA Grant(Australian Research Council); ARC DECRA Grant(Australian Research Council),"Collaborative funding for this study was provided by the University of Queensland's School of Economics Search & Visitors Committee, and the University of South Australia's School of Commerce.

Using a new and comprehensive database on nontariff measures (NTMs), this article examines the coverage, frequency, and diversity of NTMs for the food sector in Malaysia, and then estimates their impact on food imports from ASEAN. The food sector in Malaysia is found to be highly regulated, dominated by technical measures, namely, labeling for sanitary and phytosanitary and technical barriers to trade reasons, product quality, and restricted substances. The empirical results subsequently verify that, overall, technical measures are import restrictive. This article therefore contends that harmonization of food standards and regulations at the regional level is important for enhancing trade. However, building common ground for food safety regulations should be NTM- and sector-specific, to realize progress in terms of regulatory convergence. This is particularly true for the food sector, since complete harmonization is not practical and not politically feasible.","[Devadason, Evelyn S.] Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Chandran, V.

In order to measure the tariff equivalents of technical barriers, the price wedge method is utilized. Based on the utility function specified in the study, the constructed model is adopted to evaluate the elasticity of substitution between the imported fruits and Japanese domestic fruits, and the consumers' preference parameters for different kinds of fruits. Sample data are chosen from the beginning of 2002 to the end of 2015. Based on the estimated preference parameters and elasticity of substitution, the results show that Japanese consumers prefer domestic fruits to the imported fruits. Besides, the results reveal that although the substitution and preference parameters are higher for the improved quality of imported fruits in the context of the positive list system, the scales of tariff equivalents of technical barriers are larger than the regular custom tariffs, and the technical barriers would cause extra huge costs for the imported fruits. Especially, in the three consecutive years after the implementation of the positive list system, tariff equivalents of technical barriers almost reached 150%, and then gradually decreased in the following years.","[Gao, Qianhui] China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Management, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Ito, Shoichi] Kyushu Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Fac Agr, Fukuoka, Japan; [Saito, Hisamitsu] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Econ & Business Adm, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan",China University of Mining & Technology; Kyushu University; Hokkaido University,"Gao, QH (通讯作者)，China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Management, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",qianhuigaokyushu@gmail.com,"Saito, Hisamitsu/E-5761-2014","Saito, Hisamitsu/0000-0002-8090-3538","Jiangsu Provincial Department of Science and Technology (Jiangsu Provincial Soft Science Research Funding Project) [BR2017006]; MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences [15YJC790021]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2016M591946]; Jiangsu Province Postdoctoral Science Foundation [1501051C]; Project of Philosophy and Social Sciences in Colleges and Universities of Jiangsu Province [2016SJD790025]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26285058, 15K17042] Funding Source: KAKEN","Jiangsu Provincial Department of Science and Technology (Jiangsu Provincial Soft Science Research Funding Project); MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Jiangsu Province Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Project of Philosophy and Social Sciences in Colleges and Universities of Jiangsu Province; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This study is sponsored by the following several projects: Jiangsu Provincial Department of Science and Technology (Jiangsu Provincial Soft Science Research Funding Project No. BR2017006), MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences (Project No. 15YJC790021), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Funded Project (Project No. 2016M591946), Jiangsu Province Postdoctoral Science Foundation Funded Project (Project No. 1501051C), and Project of Philosophy and Social Sciences in Colleges and Universities of Jiangsu Province ('Quantitatively measuring the effects of agricultural technical extension service on agricultural technical efficiency') (Project No. 2016SJD790025).",,11,2,2,5,65,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

However, adoption of such technologies has been low in Ethiopia, despite numerous efforts to disseminate the technologies in the past. Some studies argue that adoption of technologies is low because welfare effects of the technologies could be insignificant or negative to certain groups of farmers. This article employed propensity score matching and inverse probability weighting estimator with regression adjustment to examine the difference in household nutrition and income between adopters and nonadopters of dairy technologies in rural Ethiopia. We find that adoption of cross-bred dairy cows and improved forages increases household nutrition and income. The significant household nutrition and income impact for adopters support the notion that many Ethiopian smallholders have not adopted dairy technologies because adopters and nonadopters of dairy technologies have inherent differences in welfare outcome potentials. The results suggest that interventions that enhance access to farm resources and address barriers to input and output value chains could improve adoption of dairy technologies.","[Kebebe, E.

Reflecting these risks and benefits, multiple public and private organizations offer guidance to consumers on seafood consumption. The effect of this guidance is unknown; previous literature has been unable to disentangle the effects of messages with differing health information, provided by different sources, on demand for different types of seafood. The result is ambiguity regarding the drivers of observed changes in seafood demand. This study investigates the effect of health risk and benefit information on preferences for wild and farmed salmon and swordfish, three species targeted by consumer guidance. The analysis applies an experimental auction with seafood consumers informed by a Bayesian risk-learning model. The model provides a systematic way to disentangle effects on seafood demand, for example, by evaluating whether changes in demand for different species are due to information content or source. Using this approach, we test the effect of guidance provided by four different public and private groups in the United States. Difference-in-difference tests find no impact of health benefit information regardless of source or message, but find multiple effects of health risk information that vary across different types of guidance. These findings suggest that current guidance does not improve consumers' ability to balance health risks and benefits. We also identify potential avenues to improve the efficacy of this guidance.","[Uchida, Hirotsugu] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Environm & Nat Resource Econ, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Roheim, Cathy A.] Univ Idaho, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Johnston, Robert J.] Clark Univ, George Perkins March Inst, Worcester, MA 01610 USA; [Johnston, Robert J.] Clark Univ, Dept Econ, Worcester, MA 01610 USA",University of Rhode Island; Idaho; University of Idaho; Clark University; Clark University,"Uchida, H (通讯作者)，Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Environm & Nat Resource Econ, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",huchida@uri.edu,"Uchida, Hirotsugu/AAD-2401-2019","Uchida, Hirotsugu/0000-0003-3675-806X; Johnston, Robert/0000-0001-7523-2701",Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grant from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2009-04125]; Rhode Island Agricultural Experiment Station (AES) [5448],Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grant from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture; Rhode Island Agricultural Experiment Station (AES),"This project was supported by Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grant no. 2009-04125 from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, and the Rhode Island Agricultural Experiment Station (AES #5448).

To empirically test the effects of access to information from these items on efficiency in agriculture, we formulate a stochastic frontier model augmented with a technical efficiency model that controls for an index capturing farmers' 'ability to access information'. The index is constructed with a 2-parameter item response theory (IRT) model based on farmers' access to the electrical items. Using six rounds of panel data on small-scale farmers in Uganda, we find empirical evidence of a significant and positive relationship between farmer ability to access information and farm efficiency. There is also evidence that the size of these effects is larger for more literate hence better educated farmers. Greater access to information also appears to be associated with increased variance of (in) efficiency and output although the form of the increased variances is underpinned by low risk of lower efficiency and output realisations and high likelihood of higher efficiency and output realisations. Our findings imply that access to limited quantities of electricity needed to power these electrical items can have positive farm efficiency effects, and hence the importance of off-grid electricity (e.g. standalone solar panels) for small-scale farmers in typically isolated communities in developing countries.","[Abdul-Salam, Yakubu] James Hutton Inst, Social Econ & Geog Sci Grp, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Phimister, Euan] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Business, Aberdeen Ctr Res Energy Econ & Finance, Aberdeen, Scotland",James Hutton Institute; University of Aberdeen,"Abdul-Salam, Y (通讯作者)，James Hutton Inst, Social Econ & Geog Sci Grp, Aberdeen, Scotland.",yakubu.abdul-salam@hutton.ac.uk,,"Phimister, Euan/0000-0002-6483-0113; ABDUL-SALAM, YAKUBU/0000-0002-5784-4576",University of Aberdeen; Henderson Economics Research Fund; Macaulay Development Trust; James Hutton Institute,University of Aberdeen; Henderson Economics Research Fund; Macaulay Development Trust; James Hutton Institute,The first author would like to acknowledge the University of Aberdeen and the Henderson Economics Research Fund for funding his PhD studies in the period 2011-2014 which formed the basis for the research presented in this paper.

Oftentimes, the technologies are then scaled up with minimal evaluation under real-world conditions. Yet, the interim step between agronomic trials and large-scale promotion is crucial to generate evidence on the social and economic impact of technologies that is both internally valid and generalizable. The article focuses on a participatory action research program in Malawi designed to test and identify scalable technology options to intensify the smallholder sector and contribute to poverty reduction and food and nutrition security. We examine the socioeconomic characteristics of farmers testing technologies and find evidence of systematic targeting of better-endowed farmers. After controlling for observable differences using matching and a doubly robust estimator, we find evidence of early positive effects on maize yield and harvest value, although placebo tests suggest possible selection on unobservables. We note that attention should be given to program design and household characterization to better define and improve targeting criteria, technology selection, and external validity.","[Haile, Beliyou; Azzarri, Carlo; Roberts, Cleo; Spielman, David J.] Int Food Policy Res Inst, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Haile, B (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",b.haile@cgiar.org,,"Azzarri, Carlo/0000-0002-0345-1304",United States Agency for International Development,United States Agency for International Development(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"This study is a collaborative work between Africa Research in Sustainable Intensification for the Next Generation (Africa RISING) research program (funded by the United States Agency for International Development) and the CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM).

While many new futures contracts do not develop into high-volume traders, interest from DDG cash market participants indicated that this contract could be successful. Prompted by the unexpected lack of trading activity in this new futures market, we empirically revisit the question of what factors contribute to a futures contract's success and extend the literature by investigating the roles of market participants and the significance of supporting futures markets. Estimation results indicate that the market participant type-hedger or speculator-affects futures contract trade volume. More importantly, we find that the viability of new futures contracts for commodities that are jointly produced with other commodities is impacted by hedgers' trade volume of the related futures contract. These results provide important additions into the portfolio of indicators used by commodity exchanges to more cost-effectively evaluate new futures contract products.","[Bekkerman, Anton] Montana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Econ, 205 Linfield Hall,POB 59717-2920, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Tejeda, Hernan A.] Utah State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, 4835 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA",Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University,"Bekkerman, A (通讯作者)，Montana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Econ, 205 Linfield Hall,POB 59717-2920, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",anton.bekkerman@montana.edu,"Tejeda, Hernan/ITV-7770-2023",,"National Institute of Food and Agriculture, US Department of Agriculture, Hatch Multi-state project [1003338]","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, US Department of Agriculture, Hatch Multi-state project","The authors would like to thank Awudu Abdulai, three anonymous reviewers, and seminar participants at Montana State University and Utah State University for suggestions that improved this work.

It should also be considered that economic accessibility to food depends mainly on food prices in developing countries. Vision 2050 requires proper planning at the national level to ensure that targets are met in the coming years. This study was conducted to analyse the impact of macroeconomic policy decisions on domestic food production and food inflation in Pakistan. A simultaneous equations model, estimated using the generalized method of moments (GMM) with annual data from 1963-1964 to 2013-2014, was developed. Simulation analyses were conducted by using the model to analyse the impact of monetary policy, fiscal policy and energy price policy; policy recommendations are also given. A significant increase in public expenditure for the development of infrastructure and the lowering of energy prices would significantly improve the availability and accessibility parameters of food security in Pakistan. The recent fall in energy prices will also be advantageous for both the availability as well as economic accessibility to food. Tight monetary policy for a limited time period may be helpful to control food inflation, but may also exert some minor adverse effects on food production. Moreover, monetary policy decisions must be taken while considering all sectors of the economy. The results of the study provide some important guidelines for national food security policy that may help in realising the UN's Vision 2050.","[Akbar, Muhammad] Int Islamic Univ Islamabad, Dept Math & Stat, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Jabbar, Abdul] Int Islamic Univ Islamabad, Int Inst Islamic Econ, Islamabad, Pakistan","International Islamic University, Pakistan; International Islamic University, Pakistan","Akbar, M (通讯作者)，Int Islamic Univ Islamabad, Dept Math & Stat, Islamabad, Pakistan.",mmakbr@gmail.com,"Akbar, Muhammad/ABD-8463-2021; Jabbar, Abdul/JQW-3721-2023; Jabbar, Abdul/JON-7556-2023",,,,,,46,7,7,1,10,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - The study's data are drawn from a household survey conducted in rural China. Multivariate analysis examines the impacts of large income and expenditure shocks on food expenditures. Findings - The impacts of large positive income shocks on food expenditure are moderate. However, households reduce their per capita food expenditures within a range of about 25-30 percent after suffering large negative shocks. The greatest impact is found for shocks where expenditures more than double, followed by the impact of shocks where income declines by more than half. Moreover, food expenditures among low-income households are much more sensitive to large negative income and expenditure shocks. The paper concludes with policy implications. Originality/value - This is the first Chinese study to empirically examine the impacts of different income and expenditure shocks on household food expenditures. The results have important implications for smoothing households' food consumption after they suffer from shocks.","[Cui, Qi; Huang, Jikun] Peking Univ, Sch Adv Agr Sci, China Ctr Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Cui, Qi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China","Peking University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Huang, JK (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Sch Adv Agr Sci, China Ctr Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jkhuang.ccap@pku.edu.cn,,"Cui, Qi/0000-0002-3704-8257",,,,,25,9,12,1,31,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

This paper provides a novel approach to understanding how the healthfulness of NSLP participants' entree selections varies across socioeconomic and demographic groups. Unlike previous studies that rely on dietary recalls, we use a mixed logit model to examine students' entree choices in a school cafeteria. We estimate the likelihood that an entree is selected from the available lunch choices as a function of the entree's nutrients (fat, carbohydrate, protein, and sodium) and entree's taste profile characteristics (e. g., Mexican, Pizza-like), as well as the student's socio-economic and demographic characteristics. Using these estimates, we examine how changing the nutritional content of an offering impacts the probability of selecting each of the offerings. Free lunch recipients are more likely to choose entrees higher in fat but lower in sodium than other students. Full-price lunch recipients are the most responsive to changes in nutritional content of the offerings and are most likely to respond to changes in the nutritional content of the offered entrees by substituting a lunch brought from home for the school-purchased lunch. Replacing less healthy menu items with popular but healthier items reduces the selection of total calories, calories from fat, and sodium by approximately 4%, 18%, and 8%, respectively, over the study period. The new guidelines should be effective at improving the nutrition of school-age children, and potentially reducing childhood obesity, provided NSLP participation does not decline appreciably.","[Peckham, Janet G.] US FDA, Off Commissioner, Rockville, MD 20857 USA; [Kropp, Jaclyn D.] Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Mroz, Thomas A.] Georgia State Univ, Dept Econ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Mroz, Thomas A.] Fed Reserve Bank Atlanta, Atlanta, GA USA; [Haley-Zitlin, Vivian] Clemson Univ, Food Nutr & Packaging Sci Dept, Clemson, SC 29631 USA; [Granberg, Ellen M.] Clemson Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Clemson, SC 29631 USA; [Hawthorne, Nicole] Putnam Cty Sch Dist Florida, Sch Food Serv, Palatka, FL USA",US Food & Drug Administration (FDA); State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Atlanta; Clemson University; Clemson University,"Peckham, JG (通讯作者)，US FDA, Off Commissioner, Rockville, MD 20857 USA.",,"Granberg, Ellen/J-7393-2015; Peckham, Janet G/N-1005-2017",,"College of Business and Behavioral Science, Clemson University; Institute of Food and Agricultural Science, University of Florida; USDA Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service [5337]","College of Business and Behavioral Science, Clemson University; Institute of Food and Agricultural Science, University of Florida(University of Florida); USDA Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture)","Janet G.

Design/methodology/approach - An equilibrium displacement model is constructed to analyze the interactions between meat consumption and vegetable oil market through the development of livestock sector modernization. Parameters derived from the 2006 to 2009 data are first used to produce the counterfactual growth rate of the non-soybean vegetable oil to validate the model. Then the authors use the second set of parameters derived from the 2010 to 2013 data to forecast the changes in the vegetable oil market in China. Findings - Soybean oil, as a co-product of soybean processing, tends to crowd out other vegetable oils. In particular, the authors find that the market for non-soybean vegetable oils may shrink as long as the rapid industrialization pace above 10 percent within China's livestock sector continues. Although their production takes up only 8.5 percent of all agricultural lands in China, oil crops remain as important cash crops for farmers contributing over 10 percent to the overall farm income in some provinces. The authors' analysis suggests that stakeholders in these regions should closely monitor the structural changes within the livestock sector and consider the information for crop selection. Originality/value - The authors' analysis contributes to the literature on China's meat demand by highlighting its implications for other agricultural markets involved in the food system.","[Xiong, Bo] Calif Dept Social Serv, Dept Social Serv, Sacramento, CA USA; [Yi, Fujin; Li, Yaling] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing Agricultural University,"Yi, FJ (通讯作者)，Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",fujinyi@njau.edu.cn,,,"National Science Foundation of China [71673137, 71303115, 71333008]; Nanjing Agricultural University [SKCX2015004]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD); China Center for Food Security Studies at Nanjing Agricultural University; Jiangsu Rural Development and Land Policy Research Institute; Jiangsu Agriculture Modernization Decision Consulting Center",National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Nanjing Agricultural University; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD); China Center for Food Security Studies at Nanjing Agricultural University; Jiangsu Rural Development and Land Policy Research Institute; Jiangsu Agriculture Modernization Decision Consulting Center,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support by National Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos 71673137, 71303115, 71333008), Nanjing Agricultural University (Grant No SKCX2015004), Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD), China Center for Food Security Studies at Nanjing Agricultural University, Jiangsu Rural Development and Land Policy Research Institute, and Jiangsu Agriculture Modernization Decision Consulting Center.

Rice producers are paid based on both the quantity and quality of rice. Therefore, we implement a cluster-specific fixed-effects model based on location and year to identify the contributions of the UofA breeding program for both paddy yields (quantity) and head rice yields (quality attribute) over time. Additionally, the estimated increased yield was imputed into the RiceFlow trade model to estimate price and export effects. Including spillover benefits from UofA varieties, we find that on average U.S. rice producers gain 30.9 million USD annually. The expansion of U.S. long grain rice exports facilitated by the UofA is estimated to be 53,000 milled metric tons annually, which is enough to lower rice prices by over 1% in low-income countries such as Haiti, Panama, and Nicaragua. Overall, the public breeding program at the UofA contributes to (1) positive genetic gains, (2) additional revenue in the Mid-South, and (3) increased trade between the U.S. and rice-consuming countries.","[Shew, Aaron Michael] Univ Arkansas, Environm Dynam Program, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Durand-Morat, Alvaro; Nalley, Lawton Lanier] Univ Arkansas, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Moldenhauer, Karen Ann-Kuenzel] Univ Arkansas, Dept Crop Soil & Environm Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Shew, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas, Environm Dynam Program, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",amshew@email.uark.edu,"Nalley, Lawton/AAN-7643-2021","Shew, Aaron/0000-0003-3788-7891",National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program [DGE-1450079]; University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture,National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture,This work was supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program [Grant No. DGE-1450079] and the University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture.,,62,4,7,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Given minimal changes in adoption of relatively expensive inputs, we attribute these gains to improved cultivation methods that require low upfront monetary investment.

Household-level data were collected from irrigated and rainfed agro-ecosystems. In each ecosystem, the geographical information on residential and farm-plot neighborhood structures was recorded to compare household-level spatial dependency among four types of neighborhoods. A Bayesian stochastic frontier approach that integrates spatial dependency was used to address the effects of neighborhood structures on farmers' performance. Incorporating the spatial dimension into the neighborhood structures allowed for identification of the relationships between spatial dependency and technical efficiency through comparison with nonspatial models. The neighborhood structure at the residence and plot levels were defined with a spatial weight matrix where cut-off distances ranged from 100 to 1,000 m. We found that spatial dependency exists at the residential and plot levels and is stronger for irrigated farms than rainfed farms. We also found that technical inefficiency levels decrease as spatial effects are more taken into account. Because the spatial effects increase with a shorter network distance, the decreasing technical inefficiency implies that the unobserved inefficiencies can be explained better by considering small networks of relatively close farmers over large networks of distant farmers.","[Pede, Valerien O.; McKinley, Justin] IRRI, DAPO Box 7777, Manila 1301, Philippines; [Areal, Francisco J.] Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, POB 237, Reading RG6 6AR, Berks, England; [Singbo, Alphonse] Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, BP 320, Bamako, Mali; [McKinley, Justin] Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Kajisa, Kei] Aoyama Gakuin Univ, 4-4-25 Shibuya, Tokyo, Japan",CGIAR; International Rice Research Institute (IRRI); University of Reading; CGIAR; International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid-Tropics (ICRISAT); Monash University; Aoyama Gakuin University,"Pede, VO (通讯作者)，IRRI, DAPO Box 7777, Manila 1301, Philippines.",v.pede@irri.org,"McKinley, Justin/AAU-1130-2020; Areal, Francisco/HPD-8333-2023; Areal, F.

In commodity markets, speculative behaviors by stockholders tend to reduce price volatility, but this is not the case in certain agricultural markets, where speculation by farmers regarding decisions to sell or store grain is subject to liquidity constraints and heterogeneous price expectations. Like stockholders, most farmers sell grain if they expect a price drop in the near future, but unlike stockholders, they are not necessarily able to purchase grain if they expect a price increase in the next period. Heterogeneous price expectations can also lead to suboptimal storage decisions, further increasing price volatility. For these reasons, the storage management behavior of farmers often fails to mitigate price drops in the way that speculation by stockholders does. We merge historical data on maize prices and household storage collected in Burkina Faso in order to build a dynamic panel over the 2005-2012 period. We show that carryover from one season to the next is associated with unexpected price drops during the preceding lean season and that carryover is associated with more frequent unexpected price drops following the subsequent post-harvest season.","[d'Hotel, Elodie Maitre; Le Cotty, Tristan] CIRAD, Paris, France",CIRAD,"d'Hôtel, EM (通讯作者)，CIRAD, Paris, France.",elodie.maitredhotel@cirad.fr,,,,,,,34,8,8,2,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

There is, however, relatively limited research devoted to examining the determinants and economic outcomes of the two food safety assurance certifications. The major intents of this study are to analyse the determinants of the farm household's adoption decisions of the organic and/or traceability certifications, and to investigate the economic consequences of different modes of adoption. It is found that while the log-odds of rice farmers' choice of organic certification over the choice of none of the certifications decreases significantly with age, the educational level is positively associated with the adoption of traceability certification. The results suggest the significance of the Straybird Program, One Hundred Young Farmers Counselling Program and The Farmers' Academy in promoting the adoption of food safety assurance certification. Estimated average treatment effect after correcting for the self-selection problem indicates that the adoption of the traceability certifications leads to a better economic outcome for the Fuli rice farmers, compared with the adoption of organic or both certifications. This result thereby suggests that higher food safety assurance does not necessarily bring higher returns.","[Jiang, Wun-Ji] Chung Hua Inst Econ Res, Taiwan WTO & RTA Ctr, Taipei, Taiwan; [Luh, Yir-Hueih] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Luh, YH (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Taipei, Taiwan.",yirhueihluh@ntu.edu.tw,,,National Science Council in Taiwan [104-2410-H-002-017],"National Science Council in Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","Supported by the National Science Council in Taiwan, Grant No. 104-2410-H-002-017.",,26,7,7,1,10,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

These changes affected not only the structure, but also the value, volume, unit prices and competitiveness. The presented paper provides the basic overview of the individual significant changes. The main goal of the paper is to specify changes in the area of the Czech agrarian foreign trade competitiveness. This competitiveness is analysed not only in relation to global markets, but it is also analysed in relation to different groups of countries. Differences in competiveness are analysed in relation to the European Union (EU 28), the Commonwealth of Independent Countries, other European countries, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) members, and developing countries. In addition, competitiveness is also analysed in two specific dimensions. The agricultural market represents a very specific entity. However, the global merchandise trade is becoming more and more liberalized internationally and the regional agricultural markets are still being affected by a significant protectionism. The individual countries and certain clusters of countries are applying an intensive agricultural market protection. The result of these policies is a distortion of the agricultural trade. This distortion is also affecting the individual countries mutual competitiveness. While one country could be competitive in relation to one partner, in relation to other partner, the competitiveness could be limited. The paper clarifies and analyses the differences that exist in the competitiveness of the Czech agrarian trade in relation to the above mentioned groups of countries. The analysis is conducted utilizing the symmetric revealed comparative advantage index and the Lafay index, the Trade Balance Index and the product mapping. The Czech agrarian trade territorial structure has become more concentrated, the commodity structure became more diversified. Czech trade is quite competitive especially in relation to the European countries, the competitiveness in relation to other territories is limited. The significant weakness of the Czech agrarian trade is its low ability to generate added value.","[Smutka, Lubos; Maitah, Mansoor; Svatos, Miroslav] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Smutka, L (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",smutka@pef.czu.cz,"Maitah, Mansoor/G-7556-2014; Svatos, Miroslav/H-4459-2018; Smutka, Lubos/K-6401-2015","Maitah, Mansoor/0000-0003-2797-3155; Smutka, Lubos/0000-0001-5385-1333","Grant Agency of the Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague [20171024]","Grant Agency of the Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague","Supported by the Grant Agency of the Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague, Grant No. 20171024 - Analyza komoditni struktury ceskeho agrarniho zahranicniho obchodu.",,28,20,20,3,17,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors use secondary data on policies and trends over the past 40 years for preschool, primary/junior high school, and high school. Findings - The trends over the past 40 years in all areas of rural schooling have been continually upward and strong. While only a low share of rural children attended preschool in the 1980s, by 2014 more than 90 percent of rural children were attending. The biggest achievement in compulsory education is that the rise in the number of primary students that finish grade 6 and matriculate to junior high school. There also was a steep rise of those going to and completing high school. While the successes in upscaling rural education are absolutely unprecedented, there are still challenges. Research limitations/implications - This is descriptive analysis and there is not causal link established between policies and rural schooling outcomes. Practical implications - The authors illustrate one of the most rapid rises of rural education in history and match the achievements up with the policy efforts of the government. The authors also explore policy priorities that will be needed in the coming years to raise the quality of schooling. Originality/value - This is the first paper that documents both the policies and the empirical trends of the success that China has created in building rural education from preschool to high school during the first 40 years of reform (1978-2018). The paper also documents - drawing on the literature and the own research - the achievements and challenges that China still face in the coming years, including issues of gender, urbanization, early childhood education and health and nutrition of students.","[Yue, Ai; Tang, Bin; Shi, Yaojiang; Tang, Jingjing; Shang, Guanminjia] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Ctr Expt Econ Educ, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Medina, Alexis] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Rozelle, Scott] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Shaanxi Normal University; Stanford University; Stanford University,"Rozelle, S (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",rozelle@stanford.edu,"Tang, Bin/U-6005-2017","Tang, Bin/0000-0002-2890-2482",111 project [B16031]; National Science Foundation of China [71703083]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2017CBY017],"111 project(Ministry of Education, China - 111 Project); National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)",The authors acknowledge financial assistance from the 111 project (Grant No. B16031) and the National Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71703083) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. 2017CBY017).,,147,30,33,18,137,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Among other hypotheses explaining the phenomenon stands the dual value of goods including a risk premium in early transactions. We consider that asymmetric bidder groups (primary processors, fishmongers, supermarket buyers) and seasonal landings may also affect the daily price pattern. On the basis of stylized facts and several panel data models, this hypothesis is tested on a Redundant French fish market of homogenous goods (live Nephrops norvegicus) when the time effects (high and low seasons, weekday effect) affecting the demand and supply conditions are taken into consideration. All models support the evidence of a daily declining pattern, but not to the same extent for all days and seasons, and all categories of buyers. Our results also show an earlier and steeper decline on periods of lower supply (or higher demand), supporting the theoretical hypothesis of risk-averse behaviors of bidders, especially fishmongers with respect to primary processors and supermarkets.","[Salladarre, Frederic] Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, LEMNA, IUT,CREM, Campus Beaulieu,Ave Gen Leclerc,CS 44202, F-35042 Rennes, France; [Salladarre, Frederic; Guillotreau, Patrice; Ollivier, Pierrick] Univ Nantes, LEMNA, Inst Econ & Management Nantes IAE, Chem Cens Tertre,BP 52231, F-44322 Nantes 3, France; [Loisel, Patrice] INRA, UMR MISTEA 0729, 2 Pl P Viala, F-34060 Montpellier, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Rennes; Nantes Universite; INRAE,"Salladarré, F (通讯作者)，Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, LEMNA, IUT,CREM, Campus Beaulieu,Ave Gen Leclerc,CS 44202, F-35042 Rennes, France.;Salladarré, F (通讯作者)，Univ Nantes, LEMNA, Inst Econ & Management Nantes IAE, Chem Cens Tertre,BP 52231, F-44322 Nantes 3, France.",frederic.salladarre@univ-rennes1.fr,"Guillotreau, Patrice/AAL-7482-2020","Guillotreau, Patrice/0000-0002-3083-1230",Coselmar research project - Regional Council of Pays de la Loire,Coselmar research project - Regional Council of Pays de la Loire,We thank the editor and two anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments and suggestions on the manuscript.

The study finds that in 2014, varieties developed by the World Vegetable Center accounted for 50% of tomato and 98% of African eggplant commercial seed production in East and Southern Africa. For Tanzania alone, investment in crop improvement generated economic gains of US$ 255 million for tomato and US$ 5 million for African eggplant up to 2014. The internal rate of return is 26% for tomato and 12% for African eggplant, though we project the latter to increase to 26% by 2024 as the variety was released only in 2007.

Even if these findings are robust, the public policy implications of expanding the Berkeley soda tax policy to a national level are complicated by selection effects inherent in the populations of both voters and consumers. We find that consumption responses related to the tax interact nontrivially with consumer heterogeneity. Some of these responses directly counter the public policy goals of a soda tax. For example, high-consuming households are less price sensitive and therefore less responsive to price changes following a tax. Further, reactance among high-consuming populations led to increases in soda consumption immediately following the passage of the tax, partially mitigating reductions in soda consumption.","[Debnam, Jakina] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Debnam, J (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",jrd294@cornell.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [DGE-1144153]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1357478] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","Jakina Debnam is a Ph.D. Candidate at the Charles H.

Mostly, the more droughts farms experienced, the worse was their financial performance relative to farms within the same quantile of farm performance. Despite the incidence of drought, by the end of the decade, almost all the farm businesses were wealthier from increasing their farm size and becoming more crop dominant. Unexpectedly, consecutive years of drought had a significant positive effect on the operating profit per hectare and retained profit per hectare of farms in a majority of their respective quantiles. Many farms that experienced consecutive drought were forced to make structural changes, shifting away from livestock production towards additional cropping. These structural changes boosted farm performance over the decade. The incidence of drought affected some measures of farm performance differently whilst others were affected similarly. Understanding these metrics of farm performance and the structural changes underway in an agricultural region helps form a more complete view of drought impacts.","[Kingwell, Ross S.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia; [Kingwell, Ross S.] Australian Export Grains Innovat Ctr, S Perth, WA 6151, Australia; [Xayavong, Vilaphonh] Dept Agr & Food, S Perth, WA 6151, Australia",University of Western Australia; Government of Western Australia; Department of Agriculture & Food - Western Australia,"Kingwell, RS (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia.",ross.kingwell@agric.wa.gov.au,"kingwell, ross/AAK-2952-2021; Kingwell, Ross/AAU-9315-2020","Kingwell, Ross/0000-0003-0324-9488",,,,,37,11,11,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Both metrics are adjusted to internalize the social and environmental externalities of food production, and to account for the sustainability effects of stages along agri-food supply chains.

The error covariance matrix allows for heteroscedasticity and auto-correlations. Results suggest that the USDA forecasts are inefficient, providing strong evidence that the USDA is conservative in forecasting the ending stocks. Unforecastable shocks are heteroscedastic, and idiosyncratic residuals are small.

Spatial heterogeneity in costs, benefits, or connectivity often interact with intertemporal change in contexts such as fisheries management, water allocation, invasive species control, and land use change, making spatially-or temporally-uniform polices less likely to be efficient. In this article, we examine how climate change is likely to enhance the need to incorporate spatial-dynamic approaches to address natural resource challenges. We focus our discussion on rural areas, which are typically highly dependent on natural resources and particularly vulnerable to climate change. Following a brief review of existing spatial-dynamic models in natural resource economics and the insights derived from them, we describe how climate change can bring new spatial or temporal aspects to resource management problems, or exacerbate existing resource challenges that are best characterized as spatial-dynamic processes. We conclude with three case studies that highlight how integrating resource and regional economics through spatial-dynamic modeling may improve the analysis of climate change impacts in rural areas, considering the effects on rangeland management, groundwater policy, and land use management in floodplains and coastal areas.","[Epanchin-Niell, Rebecca; Kuwayama, Yusuke; Walls, Margaret] Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Resources for the Future,"Kuwayama, Y (通讯作者)，Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",kuwayama@rff.org,,"Walls, Margaret/0000-0002-6256-0973; Epanchin-Niell, Rebecca/0000-0002-1454-5453",,,,,121,4,4,1,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Design/methodology/approach - A cross-sectional survey data of some 600 smallholder rubber farmers in Xishuangbanna in Southwest China is employed. This paper develops a general conceptual framework that incorporates a subjective risk item into a model of farmers' land use choices, thereby developing four econometric models to estimate the role of risk perceptions, and applies instrumental variables to control for the endogeneity of risk perceptions. Findings - The results demonstrate that risk perceptions play an important role in smallholders' decision-making regarding land use strategies to address potential risks in rubber farming. Smallholders with higher risk perceptions specialize in rubber farming less often and are more likely to diversify their land use, thereby contributing to local environmental conservation in terms of agrobiodiversity. The land use choices of smallholder rubber farmers are also associated with ethnicity, household wealth, off-farm employment, land tenure status, altitude and rubber farming experience. Originality/value - This study contributes to a better understanding of the implications of farmers' risk perceptions and shows entry points for improving the sustainability of rubber-based land use systems.","[Min, Shi; Huang, Jikun] Peking Univ, Sch Adv Agr Sci, China Ctr Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Waibel, Hermann] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Dev & Agr Econ, Hannover, Germany",Peking University; Leibniz University Hannover,"Waibel, H (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Dev & Agr Econ, Hannover, Germany.",waibel@ifgb.uni-hannover.de,,,"Bundesministerium fur Wissenschaft, Technologie und Forschung (BMBF) [FKZ: 01LL0919]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71333013]","Bundesministerium fur Wissenschaft, Technologie und Forschung (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This study has been conducted in the framework of the Sino-German SURUMER Project, funded by the Bundesministerium fur Wissenschaft, Technologie und Forschung (BMBF), FKZ: 01LL0919.

Despite increased government investment in water resource protection and management, there is still an absence of academic studies that are able to document what path the investment has taken and whether it has had any tangible impact. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the impact of drinking water investment on drinking water in China. Design/methodology/approach - The authors make use of nationally representative data from 2005 and 2012 to measure the impact of drinking water investment among 2,028 rural households in 101 villages across five provinces. Both ordinary least squares regression and probit regression are used to analyze the correlates and the impact of drinking water investment. Findings - The authors demonstrate that water quality was likely a significant problem in 2004 but that China's investment into drinking water appears to have resulted in initial improvements during the study period. The authors show that the most significant change came about in terms of hardware: villages that received more drinking water investment now have more piped tap water and more access to water treatment infrastructure (disinfecting and filtering facilities). High rates of rural resident satisfaction with drinking water suggest the effects of drinking water investment are being felt at the village level. Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge, this is the first empirical study on drinking water investment over time in rural China using nationally representative data.","[Yue, Ai; Shi, Yaojiang; Luo, Renfu; Zhang, Linxiu] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Ctr Expt Econ Educ, Xian, Peoples R China; [Luo, Renfu] Peking Univ, Sch Adv Agr Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Linxiu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Johnson, Natalie] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, REAP, Stanford, CA USA; [Rozelle, Scott] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, Stanford, CA USA; [Zhao, Qiran] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China","Shaanxi Normal University; Peking University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Stanford University; Stanford University; China Agricultural University","Luo, RF (通讯作者)，Shaanxi Normal Univ, Ctr Expt Econ Educ, Xian, Peoples R China.",luorf.ccap@pku.edu.cn,"zhao, qiran/GSI-5490-2022; ZHANG, LIN/GYD-9123-2022; Zhang, Lin/HZH-4842-2023","Zhao, Qiran/0000-0003-1526-2057","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71110107028, 71033003, 71403205]; haanxi Science and Technology Research and Development Project [2012KR2-05]; Ford Foundation",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); haanxi Science and Technology Research and Development Project; Ford Foundation,"The authors acknowledge the financial assistance of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos 71110107028, 71033003 and 71403205), Shaanxi Science and Technology Research and Development Project (Grant No. 2012KR2-05), and the Ford Foundation.",,24,3,6,6,60,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

We apply a nonhypothetical experimental auction to elicit consumers' willingness to pay for each rice grade and identify the impact of the provision of additional grading information on product valuation. We then use contingent and inferred valuations to obtain consumers' valuation of a mandatory rice-grading system without the no test option. We find that Korean consumers are willing to pay an additional premium for each rice grade and that rice-grading information is the most important factor that differentiates the rice products.

We also show the impact of the outcome variables by risk preference of smallholders. Using farm-level data and endogenous switching regression methods, this study presents three key findings. First, the perception of weather and pest risk, access to irrigation facilities, extension visits, and access to institutional credit are the main drivers of CF adoption. Second, CF adoption increases food security and varies with the revealed risk preference of smallholders, and risk-seeking smallholders tend to gain higher food security. Third, regardless of revealed risk preferences, smallholders who did not adopt CF benefit from adoption by reducing their labor requirements, with no significant losses in yield.","[Mishra, Ashok K.] Arizona State Univ, Kemper & Ethel Marley Fdn, Morrison Sch Agribusiness, WP Carey Sch Business, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA; [Kumar, Anjani; Joshi, Pramod K.] IFPRI South Asia, New Delhi, India; [D'Souza, Alwin] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ USA",Arizona State University; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Mishra, AK (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Kemper & Ethel Marley Fdn, Morrison Sch Agribusiness, WP Carey Sch Business, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA.",ashok.k.mishra@asu.edu,"Kumar, Anjani/AGO-6128-2022; Kumar, Anjani/AAP-3673-2020; Dsouza, Alwin/AAM-1870-2020; Dsouza, Alwin/J-6922-2019","Dsouza, Alwin/0000-0003-3461-9736; Dsouza, Alwin/0000-0003-3461-9736",Untied States Agency for International Development (USAID) through the Policy Reform Initiative Project (PRIP) in Nepal,Untied States Agency for International Development (USAID) through the Policy Reform Initiative Project (PRIP) in Nepal(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"We are grateful to the Untied States Agency for International Development (USAID) for extending financial support to conduct this study through the Policy Reform Initiative Project (PRIP) in Nepal.

This paper analyses the farm level impacts of the recently introduced row planting technology in teff production in Ethiopia. Using a randomised controlled trial, we show that row planting significantly increases the total labour requirement and allocation but not teff yields, resulting in a substantial drop in labour productivity.

The institutional arrangement of hog insurance in China offers a unique opportunity to investigate the farmer's behavior of under-reporting the actual number of finished hogs on one hand, and the insurer's efficiency in determining the actual numbers on the other. Using data on 444 hog operators synchronized from farm production survey and insurance records, results showed that farmers report on average 11.5% fewer hogs to the insurance company. The level of under-reporting is positively associated with the size of operation. Farmers with longer farming experience and more conservative risk attitude report more accurately. The under-report behavior is also partially attributed to a farmer's limited capacity of accurate estimation. Due to information barrier, the insurance company is only able to recover 18.6% of the under-report at the indemnity payment stage. Results are robust after controlling for potential sample selection problems. It is suggested that technical supports, public programs and premium incentive designs in repeated insurance should be considered to promote more accurate reports.","[Zhang, Yuehua] Zhejiang Univ, Ctr Social Welf & Publ Governance, 866 Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yuehua] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, 866 Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Cao, Ying] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Epidemiol & Environm Hlth, 268 Farber Hall, Buffalo, NY 14214 USA; [Wang, H.

Our results show that income growth in Indonesia is associated with demand patterns that are more resource intensive. By 2007, per capita requirements of fossil fuel, land and water increased by 42.7 per cent (3.13MJ), 44.9 per cent (1.24m(2)) and 50.4 per cent (2.1kL), respectively, relative to 1997.

We find that income generally has a greater effect on border market price support than on domestic price support. Moreover, the difference between these types of support is greater for net importers than for net exporters and has increased with the URAA or WTO accession. Holding other variables constant, the wheat support level of China, driven mainly by border market price support, is projected to rise with future income growth. Meanwhile, Japan is projected to maintain its high level of support, while the US and EU are projected to maintain their lower levels of support. These results are relevant in the context of multilateral trade negotiations, arguing against a narrow focus on past or current policy profiles and for long-run analyses that might mistakenly rest on the inconsistent assumptions of constant agricultural policies against the backdrop of rising incomes.","[Zhao, Jing; Thompson, Wyatt] Univ Missouri, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Miller, J.

S. agriculture. Using data from the Ogallala-High Plains Aquifer region of Kansas, we find that water extraction moderately increases after adopting Low Energy Precise Application (LEPA) irrigation, and this rebound effect is in general higher for farmers with larger water rights. About half of the LEPA's rebound effects arise because adopters tend to irrigate more land and grow more water-intensive crops, with the remaining half attributable to more intensive irrigation. Farmers with greater water rights use more water, with two-thirds of the effects arising from irrigating larger land areas, and one-third of the effects attributable to more intensive irrigation. A 10% reduction of water rights will reduce water use by 5% in the long run, and if the reduction targets the majority of the water rights, which lie between 100 and 500 AF, LEPA's rebound effect decreases by 15.4%. Finally, we find that farmers have an incentive to apply a small amount of water in order to preserve their water rights, but the associated water waste is insignificant.","[Li, Haoyang] Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Li, Haoyang; Zhao, Jinhua] Michigan State Univ, Environm Sci & Policy Program, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Zhao, Jinhua] Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University; Michigan State University; Michigan State University,"Zhao, JH (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Environm Sci & Policy Program, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.;Zhao, JH (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",jzhao@msu.edu,"Li, Haoyang/HSH-2215-2023; Zhao, Jinhua/GYV-4433-2022","Li, Haoyang/0000-0001-9543-1767;",NSF WSC [1039180]; USDA NIFA [2015:68007-23133]; USDA NIFA Hatch project [MICL02362]; Directorate For Geosciences; Division Of Earth Sciences [1039180] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,NSF WSC; USDA NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); USDA NIFA Hatch project; Directorate For Geosciences; Division Of Earth Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"Haoyang Li is a PhD candidate in the Department of Economics and the Environmental Science and Policy Program, Michigan State University.

Research has suggested that agri-environmental instruments targeted based on specific economic or environmental characteristics can improve policy performance. Using a case study approach, we evaluate the relative performance of different mechanisms to target subsidized water retention pond BMPs to reduce phosphorus (P) runoff in an agriculture dominated subwatershed within the Lake Winnipeg watershed in southern Manitoba. The water retention pond BMPs were targeted based on estimated establishment costs (cost targeting), total phosphorus removal from surface water (benefit targeting), and pond-specific benefit-cost ratios. The targeting was simulated using predictions of retention pond-specific P removal from an adapted hydrology model and site-specific pond construction and land opportunity costs assembled in a geographic information system database. Targeting of water retention pond BMPs has an impact on the cost effectiveness of the policy delivery with benefit-cost targeting being the most cost-effective approach. Water retention ponds providing higher P removal at lower cost were smaller in size and on land previously used for the production of lower value crops.","[Kelly, Kaitlin E.; Belcher, Ken] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A8, Canada; [Khakbazan, Mohammad] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Brandon, MB R7A 5Y3, Canada",University of Saskatchewan; Agriculture & Agri Food Canada,"Belcher, K (通讯作者)，Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A8, Canada.",ken.belcher@usask.ca,,,Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada,Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada(Agriculture & Agri Food Canada),"The authors would like to acknowledge and thank Jason Vanrobaeys, Patsy Michiels, and Marcos Cordeiro of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada for their hydrological modeling and GIS mapping contributions to this research project and to Bradly Weir of the Saskatchewan Forest Service for his technical support on the GIS mapping component of this project.

In a framed field experiment with Mexican maize farmers, we investigate whether bundling hybrid seed with an insurance scheme can increase its adoption, while also controlling for risk aversion. We test insurance schemes with different levels of risk coverage and premium subsidies and find that (1) all schemes significantly increase the degree of adoption of the higher yielding seed, (2) partial insurance schemes perform worse than full insurance, (3) weather index insurance with geographical basis risk performs no worse than indemnity insurance, and (4) premium subsidies significantly increase the adoption effect of indemnity insurance, but not that of index insurance.","[Freudenreich, Hanna; Musshoff, Oliver] Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Freudenreich, H (通讯作者)，Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany.",hanna.freudenreich@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Freudenreich, Hanna/R-9547-2019; Mußhoff, Oliver/AAZ-1868-2021","Mußhoff, Oliver/0000-0002-3746-623X; Freudenreich, Hanna/0000-0003-2255-7996",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG); International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT),Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT)(CGIAR),"This study was financed by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) within the research project 'GlobalFood-Transformation of Global Agri-Food Systems'.

Farm efficiency was analysed by the member-state and by the type of farming and was based on the calculation of Sharpe and Treynor ratios. Systemic risk was expressed by standard deviation in order to estimate the share of systemic risk in the total risk. The change in Sharpe ratios was assessed to determine the impact of subsidies on EU farm efficiency. The results of the risk-adjusted return analysis reveal that farms in the EU-15 were more efficient than farms in the EU-12 in 2004-2013, possibly due to being more experienced in risk management. Nevertheless, the EU-15 did not undertake a bigger share of systemic risk when compared to the EU-12 farms. The impact of financial support on the efficiency of the EU-12 farms was also not stronger when compared to the EU-15 farms.","[Alekneviciene, Vilija; Stareviciute, Birute] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Inst Econ Accounting & Finance, Kaunas, Lithuania; [Alekneviciute, Egle] Vytautas Magnus Univ, Dept Finance, Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University; Vytautas Magnus University,"Alekneviciene, V (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Inst Econ Accounting & Finance, Kaunas, Lithuania.",vilija.alekneviciene@asu.lt,,"Alekneviciene, Vilija/0000-0002-6501-8792",,,,,31,5,6,2,18,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

This trend reflects changes in the consumption patterns, which have been deeply influenced by the increased sensitivity concerning social and environmental issues. In this sense, several studies, with different methodological approaches, have investigated consumers' willingness to pay and its determinants for products with different sustainability labels. To systematise the obtained results, this paper offers a review of the studies that used experimental economics in studying consumer preferences for sustainable food and agricultural products. The 41 studies included in the review were selected on the basis of the pre-identified criterion according to the systematic review approach. Albeit discordant, the results show that a large share of consumers is willing to pay a premium price for products with eco-friendly and organic certifications. Animal welfare, 'local' production, or social certification appear to have a lower influence on consumer choice of purchasing. Additional information is able to modify consumer expectations and consequentially their willingness to pay, depending on the individual's responsibility and awareness.","[Cecchini, Lucio; Torquati, Biancamaria; Chiorri, Massimo] Univ Perugia, Perugia, Italy",University of Perugia,"Cecchini, L (通讯作者)，Univ Perugia, Perugia, Italy.",luciocecchini89@gmail.com,,,,,,,74,37,38,7,53,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Here, we attempt to show that characterisation of the entire amount of subsidies as political rent is unjustified in the light of the definition of political rent as formulated in the rent-seeking theory. Political rents in agriculture diverge from the definition, since the resources devoted to rent-seeking partly serve to produce public goods - that part cannot be regarded as wastage. Furthermore, if market imperfections cause rents to be captured by other entities (the treadmill theory), then it is even more true that these benefits are not exclusive. However, it is hard to find any attempts to measure the value of political rents. Thus, a novel methodology is proposed for valuing these items, with the aim of calculating the pure political rent, based on an input-output (I-O) Leontief approach adopting matrices for representative farms according to EUFADN typology and on a decomposition of the Hicks-Moorsteen TFP index for the period 2007-2012 for four countries: Slovakia, France, Austria and Poland.","[Czyzewski, Bazyli] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Dept Educ & Personnel Dev, Poznan, Poland; [Matuszczak, Anna] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Dept Macroecon & Agr Econ, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business; Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Czyzewski, B (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Dept Educ & Personnel Dev, Poznan, Poland.",bazylicz@interia.pl,"Czyżewski, Bazyli/Y-4679-2019","Matuszczak, Anna/0000-0002-5045-5447; Czyzewski, Bazyli/0000-0002-6324-2723","National Science Centre in Poland [OPUS 6 UMO-2013/11/B/HS4/00572, 51104-84]","National Science Centre in Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)","Supported by the National Science Centre in Poland, allocated on the basis of the decision: OPUS 6 UMO-2013/11/B/HS4/00572, No. 51104-84 Political rents in the European Union's agriculture - comparative analysis basing on the UE27.",,25,6,6,1,24,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach Using household survey data collected from five provinces of China in 2010, this paper assesses farmer's attitudes toward land titling and examines the potential effects of land titling on rural land transferring and labor migration. Findings Rural residential land titling has significant effects on farmers' attitudes toward land transferring and their migration intention. Farmers who have more non-agricultural development opportunities are more likely to welcome land titling. The titling of rural residential land could provide secure property rights for farmers, and thus stimulate them to trade, mortgage their rural residential property, and migrate to urban areas. Research limitations/implications Land titling in rural China will probably affect rural land transferring and encourage rural labor migrate to urban, and thus promote rural development. Originality/value This paper investigates farmers' attitudes and behavior toward land titling, and examines its potential effects on rural land transferring and labor migration, based on national survey data.

In this study, a Keynesian-style model is specified to deduce hypotheses about how increased foreign direct investment (FDI) aimed at Mongolia's mining sector affects its agricultural sector. A key finding is that while econometric results suggest the increased FDI strengthened Mongolia's currency, its adverse effect on Mongolia's trade-sensitive agricultural sector is not sufficiently strong to cause the sector to decline. Although Dutch disease was not detected, the posited mechanism clearly is important. Specifically, when currency strengthening is ignored the reduced-form elasticity of agricultural value-added with respect to FDI is 2.7 times larger than when currency strengthening is taken into account (0.103 vs. 0.038). Also, FDI-induced currency strengthening causes the Keynesian multiplier Y/Gto drop from 2.40 to 2.00 and the FDI multiplier Y/FDI to drop from 3.05 to 1.89.","[Ge, Wei; Kinnucan, Henry W.] Auburn Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Ge, W (通讯作者)，Auburn Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",wzg0015@tigermail.auburn.edu,"li, jian/IAQ-2794-2023; Kinnucan, Henry W./A-5808-2008","Kinnucan, Henry/0000-0002-0577-2224","Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station, Auburn University; NSF [1523628]; Directorate For Geosciences; ICER [1523628] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station, Auburn University; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Directorate For Geosciences; ICER(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO))","An earlier version of this article was presented at the Trans-disciplinary Research Conference: Building Resilience of Mongolian Rangelands held June 9-10, 2015 in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.

The semi-subsistence CLS are characterized by a high degree of biophysical and economic heterogeneity and a complex, diversified production system involving a combination of subsistence and cash crops with livestock. We investigated the potential for interventions proposed by the Government of Kenya to meet the SDGs by 2030. The analysis uses an integrated modeling approach designed to deal with the key features of these systems. A strategy that stimulates rural development, increases farm size to a sustainable level, and reduces distortions and inefficiencies in input and output markets could lead to a sustainable development pathway and achieve the SDGs for rural households dependent on CLS.","[Valdivia, Roberto O.; Antle, John M.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Ballard Extens Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Stoorvogel, Jetse J.] Wageningen Univ, Soil Geog & Landscape Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands",Oregon State University; Wageningen University & Research,"Valdivia, RO (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Ballard Extens Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",roberto.valdivia@oregonstate.edu,"Valdivia, Roberto/R-1755-2017; Stoorvogel, Jetse/A-8690-2013","Valdivia, Roberto/0000-0002-0002-848X; Stoorvogel, Jetse/0000-0003-4297-122X",,,,,48,13,13,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Farmers' expectations of government disaster aid and overconfidence (optimism bias) regarding their risk prevent farmers from purchasing full insurance under actuarially fair rates. Considering this conclusion, government prefers to subsidize farmers' purchases of insurance ex ante rather than solely relying on disaster aid ex post. The resulting subsidy rate depends on the political environment, the degree of systemic risk, the distribution of farmers' risk preferences, and the nature and distribution of farmers' risk perceptions.","[Bulut, Harun] Natl Crop Insurance Serv, Overland Pk, KS 66210 USA",,"Bulut, H (通讯作者)，Natl Crop Insurance Serv, Overland Pk, KS 66210 USA.",,"Bulut, Harun/AAF-7432-2021",,"National Crop Insurance Services (NCIS), Overland Park, Kansas","National Crop Insurance Services (NCIS), Overland Park, Kansas","The author acknowledges useful comments from Keith J.

The results show a significant willingness to pay for services such as drought mitigation, water quality and the environment and maintenance of rural lifestyles and rice landscapes. The iterative procedure developed to fully analyze the incidence of attribute nonattendance (ANA) improved the model fit when compared with a multinomial logit model or an ANA model with potentially only one attribute ignored at a time (ANA-1). Moreover, the inferred probability of the class of respondents having attended all attributes was 45%, compared to 9% with ANA-1 model. However, it also suggests that 55% of the respondents made their choices by considering only two of the five attributes. Finally, this research also suggests that failing to consider ANA does not change the public ranking of scenarios contrasted by the services they would provide but would overestimate the WTP for these scenarios.","[Jourdain, Damien] CIRAD, UMR G EAU, Pathum Thani 12120, Thailand; [Jourdain, Damien] CIRAD, UMR G EAU, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Jourdain, Damien; Vivithkeyoonvong, Somsak] Asian Inst Technol, Pathum Thani 12120, Thailand; [Vivithkeyoonvong, Somsak] Bur Water Management & Hydrol, Royal Irrigat Dept, Bangkok 10300, Thailand",CIRAD; AgroParisTech; CIRAD; Asian Institute of Technology,"Jourdain, D (通讯作者)，CIRAD, UMR G EAU, Pathum Thani 12120, Thailand.;Jourdain, D (通讯作者)，Asian Inst Technol, Pathum Thani 12120, Thailand.",damien.jourdain@cirad.fr,"Jourdain, Damien/AAG-4446-2019","Jourdain, Damien/0000-0001-8707-5221",,,,,43,11,11,4,68,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

The study builds on survey data from Sumatra, Indonesia. Treatment-effects and endogenous switching regression models suggest that smallholder households benefit from oil palm adoption on average. Part of the benefit stems from the fact that oil palm requires less labor than rubber, the main alternative crop. This allows oil palm adopters to allocate more labor to off-farm activities and/or to expand their farmland. For households with a low land-to-labor ratio, rubber is typically a more lucrative crop than oil palm. Depending on various social and institutional factors, households' access to land, labor, and capital varies, contributing to impact heterogeneity. Welfare gains associated with oil palm are more pronounced among households that have formal land titles and access to additional land to expand their farm size during the process of adoption.","[Krishna, Vijesh; Qaim, Matin] Univ Goettingen, Pl Goettinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Euler, Michael] Deutsch Evaluierungsinst Entwicklungszusammenarbe, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Siregar, Hermanto] Bogor Agr Univ, Kampus IPB Darmaga, Bogor 16680, Indonesia",University of Gottingen; Bogor Agricultural University,"Krishna, V (通讯作者)，Univ Goettingen, Pl Goettinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",vkrishn@uni-goettingen.de,"Siregar, Hermanto/GPP-6687-2022; Qaim, Matin/P-4489-2016; Krishna, Vijesh/AAD-3431-2022","Qaim, Matin/0000-0003-4143-0763; Krishna, Vijesh/0000-0003-2191-4736; Siregar, Hermanto/0000-0003-0913-6820; Euler, Michael/0000-0003-3697-8177",German Research Foundation (DFG); German-Indonesian Collaborative Research Center [CRC990],German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); German-Indonesian Collaborative Research Center,"This study was financially supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG) and is part of the German-Indonesian Collaborative Research Center CRC990: Ecological and Socioeconomic Functions of Tropical Lowland Rainforest Transformation Systems (Sumatra, Indonesia).

To evaluate these options, we construct and numerically simulate a structural dynamic stochastic model of a representative cocoa processor who maximizes the present value of current and expected future profits, given prevailing market conditions and cocoa pricing policies. Our results indicate that, given current processing capacity, the Ghana Cocoa Board would have to offer a 92% discount to processors on main-crop beans in order to achieve the industrial goal of locally processing 40% of annual production. This would cause light-crop beans used in processing to be completely displaced by main-crop beans carried over as inventory. It would also increase mean processor revenues by 167%, but cause the Ghana Cocoa Board to operate at a significant deficit, implying that the stated goal could only be achieved through massive government subsidies.","[Mulangu, Francis M.] African Ctr Econ Transformat, Dept Res, Castle Rd,Ridge PMB CT4, Cantonments Accra, Ghana; [Miranda, Mario J.] Ohio State Univ, Agr Environm & Dev Econ Dept, 2120 Fyffe Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Maiga, Eugenie W.

We contribute by exploring the factors influencing how satisfied farmers are with their quality of life. We find that farm income, subjective perceptions relating to the adequacy of household income, debt, health and personal characteristics such as age and relationship status are significantly associated with farmers' self-reported life satisfaction. While significantly associated with farm income, farm structural variables such as farm size, farm type and the presence of a farm successor were not found to be significantly related with life satisfaction. Our results also suggest that farmers who are more risk averse enjoy significantly lower levels of both life satisfaction and farm income than their more risk seeking or risk neutral counterparts. We suggest that, in the same way that risk aversion inhibits farmers from making choices that could lead to an increase in their income, it may also constrain farmers ( and the wider public at large) from engaging in certain types of behaviours that could lead to an increase in their self-reported quality of life. Finally, we find that while farm income is significantly related to self-reported life satisfaction, the direct correlation between these variables is weak, suggesting that farmer life satisfaction can be distinct from business success.","[Howley, Peter] Univ York, Dept Environm, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Dillon, Emma; Heanue, Kevin; Meredith, David] TEAGASC, Rural Econ Dev Programme, Galway, Ireland",University of York - UK; Teagasc,"Howley, P (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Environm, York, N Yorkshire, England.",peter.how-ley@york.ac.uk,"; Meredith, David/D-2276-2011","Dillon, Emma Jane/0000-0002-3712-9575; Howley, Peter/0000-0002-3385-629X; Meredith, David/0000-0002-9211-0869","Offaly Local Development Company (OLDC), Ireland","Offaly Local Development Company (OLDC), Ireland","Funding for this work was provided by Offaly Local Development Company (OLDC), Ireland.

An appropriate border measure is shown to depend on competition in aluminum production, as well as the basis for assessing trade neutrality of a border measure. If neutrality is based on market volume, carbon leakage is prevented, but competitiveness cannot be maintained. If neutrality is based on market share, competitiveness can be maintained and there is negative carbon leakage. In either case, users of aluminum incur deadweight losses from the combination of climate policy and border measures. The key policy implication of the analysis is that appropriately designed border measures for climate policy may break the link between competitiveness and carbon leakage, but their design is important in ensuring that they are not protectionist.","[Sheldon, Ian] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Agr Mkt Trade & Policy, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [McCorriston, Steve] Univ Exeter, Dept Econ, Agr Econ, Exeter, Devon, England",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of Exeter,"Sheldon, I (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Agr Mkt Trade & Policy, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",sheldon.1@osu.edu,"郭, 青霞/GZH-2618-2022",,,,,,28,1,1,2,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

First, we use the Balassa index to assess the revealed comparative advantage of LA countries. We find that LA countries have a revealed comparative advantage in GMO industries relative to the world, and that intra-regional trade in these industries is modest relative to external trade. Second, we estimate the Gravity model to examine the effects of importers' GMO policies on Argentina and Brazil's bilateral exports of soybeans and maize. We find that strong GMO policies in importers have a negative effect on Argentina's bilateral exports of soybeans (an industry and country with historically high GMO content). Further, we find that past GMO policies are a strong determinant of Argentina's future bilateral exports, and that the negative trade effects of strong GMO policies are increasing over time. In contrast, we find a weaker relationship between the GMO policies of importers and Brazil's bilateral exports (consistent with Brazil's more recent increases in GMO content). These findings for Argentina and Brazil provide a benchmark for other developing countries that are looking for guidance on servicing trading partners with diverse GMO policies.","[Smith, Pamela J.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Katovich, Erik S.] Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Econ, Sao Paulo, Brazil",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Universidade Estadual de Campinas,"Smith, PJ (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",psmith@umn.edu,,"Katovich, Erik/0000-0001-9974-2992",,,,,53,10,13,1,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

A recursive bubble-testing procedure is used to detect and date-stamp bubble periods in corn, soybean, and wheat markets. Granger causality tests are used to investigate the lead-lag dynamics between index-trader positions and weekly returns (price changes).

This article evaluates whether valid welfare estimates can emerge from this practice. We begin with a theoretical model demonstrating conditions under which stated preference scenarios that include intermediate outcomes will elicit welfare estimates identical to those from parallel scenarios that include associated final outcomes (i.e., convergent validity will hold). The model demonstrates that a necessary condition for convergent validity is the ability of respondents to correctly predict biophysical production functions linking intermediate to final outcomes. Hypotheses from the theoretical model are then evaluated empirically using an application of choice experiments to migratory fish restoration in the U.S. state of Rhode Island. Empirical results are mixed but generally reject convergent validity; welfare estimates are not robust to the use of an intermediate outcome in lieu of a related final outcome in stated preference scenarios, as predicted by theory. Results of the analysis suggest that greater attention should be given to the reliability of welfare estimation when final outcomes cannot be quantified.","[Johnston, Robert J.] Clark Univ, George Perkins Marsh Inst, Worcester, MA 01610 USA; [Johnston, Robert J.] Clark Univ, Dept Econ, Worcester, MA 01610 USA; [Schultz, Eric T.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT USA; [Segerson, Kathleen] Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, Storrs, CT USA; [Besedin, Elena Y.] Abt Associates Inc, Environm & Resources Div, Cambridge, MA USA; [Ramachandran, Mahesh] Cape Cod Commiss, Cape Cod, MA USA",Clark University; Clark University; University of Connecticut; University of Connecticut; ABT Associates,"Johnston, RJ (通讯作者)，Clark Univ, George Perkins Marsh Inst, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.;Johnston, RJ (通讯作者)，Clark Univ, Dept Econ, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.",rjohnston@clarku.edu,,,"EPA STAR Grants [RD 83242001, 83242002]",EPA STAR Grants,Robert Johnston is the Director of the George Perkins Marsh Institute and a professor in the Department of Economics at Clark University.

The methodology of the paper is based on a comparative analysis of the structure of commodities of chain stores in the Czech Republic in terms of consumer demand and its change over time. An example of this model behaviour of firms may be the competition between two supermarket chains Billa and Kaufland in the market with private label products (e.g. pork meat). Results of the analysis of the Sweezy model imply that the change in company costs due to higher prices of inputs does not affect product prices and this is the reason behind the rigidity of prices in the oligopolistic markets in the Sweezy model.,"[Svoboda, Roman; Kopecka, Lenka] Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Management, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Svoboda, R (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Management, Prague, Czech Republic.",svobodar@pef.czu.cz,"Svoboda, Roman/G-3320-2017; Kopecka, Lenka/J-2617-2017","Kopecka, Lenka/0000-0002-4781-7259",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague [20141023],Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,Supported by the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague (Project No. 20141023 - The Validation of the Sweezy model of Price Competition in Oligopolistic Markets with Private Label Food).,,19,1,1,1,7,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The analysis at the provincial level mainly focuses on the similarities and differences in the performance of the agricultural support policies between the primary grain-producing areas and the secondary grain-producing areas; at the agricultural commodity level, 17 representative Chinese agricultural commodities are selected and their performance compared. The results are then used to proffer suggestions for the future agricultural support policy optimization in China. The paper found that 50% of the provinces were DEA-efficient, in general, during the study period due to the low overall province-level scale efficiency. The performance values of the secondary grain-producing areas were significantly lower than those of the primary grain-producing areas due to the overall low scale and technical efficiency values. These results show that the support policies for agricultural commodities in China altogether require a further improvement, mainly due to the low technical efficiency of agricultural commodities.","[Tang, Xiaolin; Wang, Jieqiong; Zhang, Biao; Zhang, Lingxian] China Agr Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University,"Zhang, LX (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhanglx@cau.edu.cn,,"Zhang, Biao/0000-0001-7053-8066",National Social Science Foundation of China [14AJY019],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),Supported from the National Social Science Foundation of China (grant No. 14AJY019).,,26,6,6,3,21,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Specifically, the authors explore the effect of China's agricultural domestic support on its agricultural and food market by also considering the impact of incomplete price transmission. Design/methodology/approach - The authors extend the standard Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) modelling framework. First, the authors incorporate incomplete price transmission into the GTAP model by generating tariff-equivalent price transmission elasticities. Second, the authors improve the current representation of China's agricultural domestic support in the GTAP model and the underlying database by considering the production requirements and the trade-distorting effect of different policy instruments. Running a set of simulations, the authors examine first how the incorporation of incomplete price transmission affects the model's results and second how increased agricultural domestic support affects China's agricultural and food market accounting for incomplete price transmission. Findings - Considering incomplete price transmission mitigates the domestic price increases as responses to high international agricultural prices, which also lead to an increase in China's trade deficit and prohibits net food sellers from receiving high prices. In the long term, an increase in China's agricultural domestic support to its World Trade Organisation de minimis commitment level would increase domestic agricultural production and reduce its demand pressure on the international market. Originality/value - This paper contributes to the literature by examining the impact of increased agricultural domestic support on the domestic market while innovatively accounting for incomplete food price transmission. The authors combine econometric estimated price transmission elasticities and an extended GTAP framework to underscore the importance of enhancing the model's ability in accounting for incomplete price transmission when analysing the impact of agricultural policies.","[Yang, Fan] Bayer Business Serv GmbH, Cologne, Germany; [Urban, Kirsten; Brockmeier, Martina] Univ Hohenheim, Stuttgart, Germany; [Bekkers, Eddy; Francois, Joseph] World Trade Inst, Bern, Switzerland",Bayer AG; University Hohenheim,"Yang, F (通讯作者)，Bayer Business Serv GmbH, Cologne, Germany.",f.yang@hotmail.com,"Francois, Joseph/B-6108-2017","Francois, Joseph/0000-0002-4686-7780; Boysen-Urban, Kirsten/0000-0001-7892-4324",,,,,50,8,8,2,35,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - The data used in this study were collected from 952 urban consumers in 2013 in 15 provinces. The ordinal logit model was chosen to identify the determinants in the consumers' subjective knowledge and acceptance of GM foods. Findings - Results show that the consumers' awareness of GM foods, biotech knowledge, and subjective knowledge improved significantly, while the acceptance rate toward GM foods declined considerably from 2002 to 2013. Moreover, the consumers' subjective knowledge of GM foods had a significantly negative impact on their acceptance rate of GM foods. Finally, the media coverage with the event of Golden rice in 2012 as a proxy helped consumers in shaping their negative perceptions toward GM foods, suggesting that the media coverage was one of major factors in leading to the low acceptance rate of GM foods in urban China. Originality/value - The findings of previous studies conducted in the early 2000s might not reflect current Chinese consumer attitudes because the public opinion toward GM foods in modern China has considerably changed. This study thus filled in the void by updating estimates on consumer attitudes toward GM foods and by underlining the factors that have led to the changes in consumer attitudes, using a mass survey covering Chinese urban consumers in 15 provinces in 2013.","[Zheng, Zhihao] China Agr Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Gao, Yang; Zhang, Yijing] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Henneberry, Shida] Oklahoma State Univ, Oklahoma City, OK USA",China Agricultural University; China Agricultural University; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University Center for Health Sciences,"Zheng, ZH (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhihao.zheng@cau.edu.cn,"GAO, Yang/HMO-8142-2023; Gao, Yang/M-9866-2013; wu, jun/ISB-8607-2023","Gao, Yang/0000-0002-1069-2157;",GM rice project of the University of Arkansas; Chinese Universities Scientific Fund [2012QT026],GM rice project of the University of Arkansas; Chinese Universities Scientific Fund,"This study was partially funded by the GM rice project of the University of Arkansas and the Chinese Universities Scientific Fund No. 2012QT026.

Despite this, relatively little research has analyzed nutrition differences across rural and urban populations, or across gradients of rural remoteness. In this article, we study these differences in sub-Saharan Africa by linking spatial data on travel times to urban centers with 20,000 or more people as our measure of remoteness to Demographic Health Survey data covering 74,398 children from 10,900 communities in 23 countries. We find that children in rural communities have much worse linear growth and dietary outcomes than urban children, but that children in more remote rural communities face only a small nutritional penalty compared to children from less remote communities. Moreover, the harmful effects of remoteness and rural living largely disappear once we control for education, wealth, and social/infrastructural services. This implies that the key nutritional disadvantages faced by rural populations stem chiefly from social and economic poverty. Combating these problems requires a combination of innovative cost-effective mechanisms for extending basic services to isolated rural communities and facilitating welfare-enhancing migration to urban areas.","[Headey, Derek] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Poverty Hlth & Nutr Div, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Stifel, David] Lafayette Coll, Dept Econ, Easton, PA 18042 USA; [You, Liangzhi; Guo, Zhe] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Environm & Prod Technol Div, Washington, DC 20036 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Lafayette College; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Stifel, D (通讯作者)，Lafayette Coll, Dept Econ, Easton, PA 18042 USA.",stifeld@lafayette.edu,"wang, xiaoqiang/JMT-2783-2023; WANG, YANG/JFA-8821-2023","You, Liangzhi/0000-0001-7930-8814",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation through Advancing Research on Nutrition and Agriculture (ARENA),Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation through Advancing Research on Nutrition and Agriculture (ARENA),The authors would like to thank four anonymous reviewers for very helpful comments and suggestions.

In this paper we analyze the evolution of food retail by building a store choice equilibrium model and providing an illustrated discussion. The patterns in retail in any given time and place of different types of stores (such as traditional shops, supermarkets, and online e-commerce) depend on two main factors. The first are consumers' characteristics such as income, tastes, and travel costs of going to different stores and/or shipping costs if purchasing online. The second are the stores' cost structures, which include item costs from upstream producers, the costs of procurement supply chains (beyond the cost of the item) for perishable items, and the costs of in-store storage. We show under what conditions in equilibrium the different retail types exist and which can become dominant, and what types of goods (dry packaged foods versus perishables) are distributed by what type of retailers.","[Lu, Liang] Univ Idaho, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Reardon, Thomas] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Idaho; University of Idaho; Michigan State University,"Lu, L (通讯作者)，Univ Idaho, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Moscow, ID 83843 USA.",llu@uidaho.edu,"Lu, Liang/AAK-1069-2021",,,,,,36,36,38,7,108,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

These are regions where economic despair seems to have taken hold for generations and which face numerous other impediments to economic prosperity, such as opioid abuse. Better understanding these linkages can lead to policy solutions to help the most disadvantaged places break the cycle of economic despair. Using county-level data, we begin by estimating a series of models that allow us to understand the drivers of local labor force participation. We also consider how these drivers may differ between rural and urban areas. We then analyze how levels of participation in the labor force are related to other measures of economic distress. We find that there is significant variation in the drivers of rural and urban labor force participation; however, much of the variation can be explained by known factors. Yet, our results also suggest that there remains some portion of the lower levels of labor force participation in West Virginia and Appalachia that cannot be explained by other factors. Since it appears that labor force participation is important to explaining higher levels of employment growth in rural areas, for persistently distressed regions, finding ways to increase labor force participation may be a critical step toward increasing economic prosperity.","[Stephens, Heather M.] West Virginia Univ, Resource Econ & Management, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Deskins, John] West Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA",West Virginia University; West Virginia University,"Stephens, HM (通讯作者)，West Virginia Univ, Resource Econ & Management, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",heather.stephens@mail.wvu.edu,,"Stephens, Heather/0000-0003-3472-216X",,,,,42,8,13,1,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

We use a randomised controlled trial bogus pipeline experiment, established during a typical cash-flow analysis of a bank for small businesses in the Philippines. The bogus pipeline approach is commonly applied in social science and aims to increase the rate of truth telling by informing participants that answers will be verified by a lie detector. The experimental data, which include 243 observations of credit clients that are mainly from the agricultural and food value chain, served to identify asymmetric information. Additionally, debtors' repayment behaviour for approved loans was observed by the bank. Our results indicate that loan applicants of the treatment group report lower incomes, an effect which is most pronounced in lower income quantile. Our analyses also reveal higher loan delinquencies in the control group.","[Roemer, Ulf; Musshoff, Oliver; Weber, Ron] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany; [Turvey, Calum G.] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY USA; [Weber, Ron] Cornell Univ, KfW Dev Bank, Ithaca, NY USA",University of Gottingen; Cornell University; Cornell University,"Römer, U (通讯作者)，Georg August Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany.",uroemer@uni-goettingen.de,"Baldissera, Annalisa/AHD-6334-2022; Mußhoff, Oliver/AAZ-1868-2021","Mußhoff, Oliver/0000-0002-3746-623X",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG),Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"Ulf is also with Calum Turvey at the Charles H.

The multitude of indicators available raises the question which aspects of food security are captured by the respective indicator. In our analysis, we first assess the relation between the dimensions of food security and households' socioeconomic characteristics. Second, we examine whether household indicators detect undernutrition in children. Finally, we investigate the role of individual-specific characteristics for child undernutrition. The analysis is based on a novel data set of 1,200 rural households from Cambodia and Lao PDR, which combines household- and individual-level data. We capture household food security by three indicators including a dietary diversity score, a consumption behavior measure, and an experiential measure. Individual nutrition status is measured via anthropometric indicators. Our results show that different household-level indicators capture fundamentally different aspects of food security. Moreover, household food security fails to explain stunting for children under five. Dietary diversity indicators, however, explain underweight in children to a small extent. We call for more research on intrahousehold allocation of food and stress the implications of our research for the design and targeting of food and nutrition support programs.","[Buehler, Dorothee; Hartje, Rebecca; Grote, Ulrike] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Environm Econ & World Trade, Fac Econ & Management, Konigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover,"Bühler, D (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Environm Econ & World Trade, Fac Econ & Management, Konigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",buehler@iuw.uni-hannover.de,"Bühler, Dorothee/T-1130-2019","Grote, Ulrike/0000-0002-9073-6294",,,,,77,8,8,1,51,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Using the framework of variable profit functions and household level data, we study econometrically the wage impacts on crop agriculture. Rising wages are associated with decreasing crop output, other things being equal. Crop prices would need to increase by 80% in the short run to offset the effect of an agricultural wage increase, or by 140% in the short run to offset rural non-farm wage increases as well. However, because non-land farm assets respond positively to the non-farm wage, in the medium term this increase is reduced to 74%. During the period of 1999/00-2007/08, growth in non-land farm assets, the labour force, education and technology has easily compensated for the wage increase, and probably also for the accelerating wage growth. Focusing on growing these shifter variables is a much better policy option than raising prices that would come at the expense of consumers or taxpayers.","[Binswanger, Hans P.] Univ Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa; [Singh, Sudhir K.] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA",University of Pretoria; The World Bank,"Singh, SK (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",ssingh12@worldbank.org,"singh, sudhir/HNS-9950-2023","singh, sudhir/0000-0001-5267-665X",,,,,39,11,11,3,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

Since these subsidies are tied to land, the question arises as to who benefits from them when farmers are not the landowners. While theoretical models commonly predict that most of the payments transfer to land prices, empirical findings show that this incidence is low instead. Approaching the issue from the perspective of spatial competition, this paper produces results consistent with empirical evidence. Incidence varies with the competitiveness of the market, ranging from perfect subsidy transfer under specific conditions to low or zero incidence for most of the cases considered.","[Graubner, Marten] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ IAMO, Halle, Saale, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO),"Graubner, M (通讯作者)，Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ IAMO, Halle, Saale, Germany.",graubner@iamo.de,", IAMO/G-2328-2012; Change, Structural/W-8306-2019","Change, Structural/0000-0002-2459-4646; Graubner, Marten/0000-0002-3096-0702",German Research Foundation (DFG) [GR-4415/2-1],German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"Financial support by the German Research Foundation (DFG, Project reference no.

Our findings are obtained from an innovative two-stage econometric procedure that combines a bivariate ordered probit model with an endogeneity-corrected ordinary least square regression model. The results show that farmers are jointly making decisions to use farm machines and to work off the farm and that these two household activities affect maize yields and agrochemical expenses in different ways. We show that farm machinery use significantly increases both maize yields and agrochemical expenses, while off-farm employment significantly decreases agrochemical expenses. Our findings highlight the importance of additional machinery use in increasing farm production; the need to account for possible endogeneity in estimation; and the statistical significance of key household characteristics (gender, education, and household size) on overall farm production.","[Ma, Wanglin; Renwick, Alan] Lincoln Univ, Dept Global Value Chains & Trade, Fac Agribusiness & Commerce, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Grafton, Quentin] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",Lincoln University - New Zealand; Australian National University,"Ma, WL (通讯作者)，Lincoln Univ, Dept Global Value Chains & Trade, Fac Agribusiness & Commerce, Christchurch, New Zealand.",wanglin.ma@lincoln.ac.nz,"Ma, Wanglin/M-7744-2019; Grafton, Quentin/AAS-2316-2021; Renwick, Alan/AAS-6588-2021","Ma, Wanglin/0000-0001-7847-8459; Grafton, Quentin/0000-0002-0048-9083; Renwick, Alan/0000-0002-4756-5709",Faculty of Agribusiness and Commerce at Lincoln University [INT5056],Faculty of Agribusiness and Commerce at Lincoln University,The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the Faculty of Agribusiness and Commerce at Lincoln University (Seed Fund Project INT5056).

Design/methodology/approach - The paper builds the analytical clue of institutional target institutional heritage - policy effort - realistic dilemma - future direction and review and forecast the Chinese farmland institutional reform. Findings - The farmland institution is an important issue with Chinese characteristics. Over the last four decades, the farmland institutional reform in China has focused on stabilizing the land property rights and promote the farmland transfer. As the study indicates, the promotion of farmland transfer has not effectively improved the scale economy of agriculture and stabilizing land property rights by titling may restrain the development of farmland transfer market because farmland transfer is of special market logic. Originality/value - It depends on the revitalization of farmland management rights to resolve the transaction constraint of personal property and its endowment effect in farmland transfer. And, classifying the land management property to involve farmers into the economy of division can be reference for the reform of traditional agriculture worldwide.","[Luo, Bilang] South China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",South China Agricultural University,"Luo, BL (通讯作者)，South China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",luobl@scau.edu.cn,,,"key project of National Natural Science Foundation of China: Research on Rural Land and Relevant Element Market Cultivation and Reform [71333004]; key policy research project of National Natural Science Foundation of China: Farmland Titling: Realistic Background, Policy Objective and Effect Evaluation [71742003]","key project of National Natural Science Foundation of China: Research on Rural Land and Relevant Element Market Cultivation and Reform; key policy research project of National Natural Science Foundation of China: Farmland Titling: Realistic Background, Policy Objective and Effect Evaluation","This paper is sponsored by the key project of National Natural Science Foundation of China: Research on Rural Land and Relevant Element Market Cultivation and Reform (Grant No. 71333004) and by the key policy research project of National Natural Science Foundation of China: Farmland Titling: Realistic Background, Policy Objective and Effect Evaluation (Grant No. 71742003).",,48,71,72,10,84,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

The results show that shadow prices differ significantly between producers. Moreover, the price is not stable over time. Significant differences can be seen in shadow prices for the greenhouse gas emissions among the researched group of farmers with respect to the degree of intensification. Most noticeably, the higher the intensification, the higher the shadow price. However, no evidence for a significant relationship between the greenhouse gas prices and technical efficiency was found, and not even the development of the greenhouse gas prices and technical efficiency suggested any common patterns.","[Zakova Kroupova, Zdenka; Cechura, Lukas; Havlikova, Michaela; Halova, Pavlina; Maly, Michal] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Zakova Kroupova, Z (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",kroupovaz@pef.czu.cz,"Havlikova, Michaela/H-5272-2018; Malý, Michal/H-6171-2018; Kroupova, Zdenka Zakova/AAO-8608-2021; Cechura, Lukas/H-6694-2018; Halova, Pavlina/H-6831-2018","Malý, Michal/0000-0001-7382-1895; Kroupova, Zdenka Zakova/0000-0001-5834-3338; Cechura, Lukas/0000-0003-2727-1874; Halova, Pavlina/0000-0003-2236-3227",NAZV [QJ1530286],NAZV,Pieces of knowledge introduced in this paper resulted from the solution of the research project QJ1530286 Optimization of the subsidy system for agricultural producers with regard to the production of public goods financed by the NAZV within the research program: Complex sustainable systems in agriculture 2012-2018 KUS.,,28,6,6,2,24,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

However, it also represents a major departure from previous legislation by introducing multiple program options among which producers had the ability to choose. While allowing producers to have choices creates flexibility, the design of the program required producers to consider potential outcomes for crop prices and production levels in future periods when making their decisions. Experience over the first two years of program implementation suggests that while programs are working as designed, not all producers are fully satisfied with their enrollment decisions. This will lead to proposals for further modification to programs, and to questions about whether program choice should be a component of the next Farm Bill.","[Taylor, Mykel R.; Tonsor, Glynn T.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Paulson, Nicholas D.; Ellison, Brenna; Coppess, Jonathan; Schnitkey, Gary D.] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",Kansas State University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Paulson, ND (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",npaulson@illinois.edu,,"Ellison, Brenna/0000-0002-4042-0056",,,,,20,6,7,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

Although most local and regional procurement occurs through hard tendering processes open to large-scale firms and farms, there is growing interest in identifying how and whether to procure from smallholder farmer organizations (FOs). To date, little is known about the drivers of successful contracting with FOs. We utilize data from the United Nations World Food Programme Purchase for Progress pilot in three East African countries to predict defaults on contracts. We examine four possible explanations: country contexts, FO characteristics, prior experience with contracts, and contract modalities and their relationship to local spot market prices. The single most important predictor of default is the increase in market prices between contract approval and delivery. Yet, although increases in market prices are linked to increases in default, this relationship is decreasing in contract size, indicating search costs associated with breaking contracts. Our findings yield both generalizable and context-specific insights about whetherand whenprocuring from smallholder farmers can be successfully integrated into the food assistance toolkit.","[Upton, Joanna] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Lentz, Erin] Univ Texas Austin, Lyndon B Johnson Sch Publ Affairs, Austin, TX 78712 USA",Cornell University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Upton, J (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",jbu3@cornell.edu,,"Lentz, Erin/0000-0001-9934-9496",,,,,57,5,5,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Changes in grain harvests, transport and grain handling technologies and costs; changes in farming systems, crop yields and harvesting capacity; investments in roads and on-farm storage and economies of size in grain receival infrastructure are shown in combination to affect the size of grain catchments in major grain-growing regions of Australia over the last 30years. The size of grain catchments that minimise growers' costs of road transport of their harvested grain and their receival point charges in various time periods are determined. Differently shaped grain catchments are considered. The main finding is that the size of grain catchments that minimise farmers' grain transport, off-farm storage and handling costs since the mid-1980s has consistently increased, principally due to lessening real costs of road transport, more on-farm storage and economies of size in grain receival, despite higher grain yields and a greater intensity of cropping. These findings are consistent with the observed reduction in the number of receival sites in many grain-growing regions of Australia. Site rationalisation is less evident in states where the receival network is owned and operated by a grower cooperative.","[Kingwell, Ross] Australian Export Grains Innovat Ctr, Nedlands, WA, Australia; [Kingwell, Ross] Univ Western Australia, Nedlands, WA, Australia",University of Western Australia,"Kingwell, R (通讯作者)，Australian Export Grains Innovat Ctr, Nedlands, WA, Australia.;Kingwell, R (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Nedlands, WA, Australia.",ross.kingwell@agric.wa.gov.au,"Kingwell, Ross/AAU-9315-2020; kingwell, ross/AAK-2952-2021","Kingwell, Ross/0000-0003-0324-9488;",,,,,38,3,3,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

These concerns underpin the sustainability criteria governing access to European biofuel markets. However, it is unclear if producing biofuels in low-income countries does exacerbate poverty and food insecurity, and moreover, whether the sustainability criteria should apply to all agricultural exports entering European markets. We develop an integrated modeling framework to simultaneously assess the economic and environmental impacts of producing biofuels in Malawi. We incorporate the effects of land use change on crop water use, and the opportunity costs of using scarce resources for biofuels instead of other crops. We find that biofuel production reduces poverty and food insecurity by raising household incomes. Irrigated outgrower schemes, rather than estate farms, lead to better economic outcomes, fewer emissions, and similar water requirements. Nevertheless, to gain access to European markets, Malawi would need to reduce emissions from ethanol plants. We find that biofuels' economic and emissions outcomes are generally preferable to tobacco or soybeans. We conclude that the sustainability criteria encourage more sustainable biofuel production in countries like Malawi, but are perhaps overly biased against biofuels since other export crops raise similar concerns about food security and environmental impacts.","[Schuenemann, Franziska; Zeller, Manfred] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Agr Sci Trop, Stuttgart, Germany; [Thurlow, James] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",University Hohenheim; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Schuenemann, F (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Inst Agr Sci Trop, Stuttgart, Germany.",franziska.schuenemann@uni-hohenheim.de,"Thurlow, James/JQW-4545-2023","Schuenemann, Franziska/0000-0002-1311-0570","German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development; United States Agency for International Development; CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM); CGIAR","German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development; United States Agency for International Development(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM)(CGIAR); CGIAR(CGIAR)","This study was funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (research project Policies and Institutions for Achieving the Virtuous Food-Energy-Water Nexus in Sub-Saharan Africa); the United States Agency for International Development via its support of IFPRI's Malawi Strategy Support Program; and the CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM), which is led by IFPRI and funded by the CGIAR Fund Donors.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents an overview of recent changes in the global context for food security and nutrition, and synthesizes research findings on major issues that arise in an urbanizing world. Based on its findings, the authors present policy recommendations and areas for future research for food security and nutrition. Findings - Urbanization is linked with dietary changes to more energy-dense diets, and, the triple burden of malnutrition is increasing, particularly in rapidly urbanizing developing countries. Rural-urban linkages are key to improving food security and nutrition in both rural and urban areas, and traditional agricultural value chains linking farms to cities are undergoing a quiet revolution. Governance to enhance food security in the context of rapid urbanization faces various challenges in the institutional, administrative, and political realms, especially for the informal economy in developing countries. To address the unique challenges of urbanization, policies will need to create enabling environments, promote efficient and inclusive value chains, improve governance, and promote tailored programs. Research gaps that need to be filled include better, updated, and disaggregated data on food security and nutrition, as well as an enhanced understanding of enabling environments. Originality/value - The paper highlights the increasingly relevant issue of rapid urbanization, especially in developing countries, for food security and nutrition, and synthesizes recent research in this area.","[Fan, Shenggen; Cho, Emily EunYoung; Rue, Christopher] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Fan, SG (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",s.fan@cgiar.org,,,,,,,20,9,9,4,40,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

We employ household consumption data and include the indirect effect of price responses to estimate the welfare loss. Our findings suggest that the estimated welfare effect can be misleading if household responses to rice consumption and production are ignored. This study further supports the hypothesis that the poor are the main victims of such a shock. Our examination also indicates that a higher rice price may increase or decrease the poverty head-count ratio, depending on the choice of the poverty line, but worsens the country's poverty situation when it is measured by the per capita consumption gap. Our analysis reveals that the government can play a central role to prevent and mitigate such shocks, particularly in the medium to long run. On the methodological side, we observe that consumption provides a more consistent outcome across different methods of analysis than household income.","[Hasan, Syed A.] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University,"Hasan, SA (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",syed.hasan@anu.edu.au,"Hasan, Syed Abul/S-5065-2019","Hasan, Syed Abul/0000-0002-7439-9400",,,,,36,7,7,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

The implantation of the developed working methodology has obtained a relevant improvement in the coordination and management of the spare parts.

Using case studies, policy developments in the key Asian countries of China, India and Japan are also scrutinized to determine the extent to which they enable or obstruct biotech's potential. Design/methodology/approach - The authors first examine some key challenges facing the agriculture and agri-food sector and the potential role biotech can play in addressing them. These challenges include feeding the world's growing population, improving nutrition worldwide, dealing with allergen risks, reducing nutrient and chemical loading in watersheds, addressing water scarcity issues, and reducing waste in the food system. The authors then turn their attention to the agri-biotech systems in three Asian giants, including China's centralized governance approach, India's central-local policy and regulations, and Japan's pragmatic and evidence-based regulatory framework. Findings - Each nation has evolved its own system of governance based on the different challenges facing the society, the recognized potential of different biotech interventions, and citizens' collective perceptions regarding both the potential and the risks that biotech innovations embody. Systems that are less evidence-based appear to be more discretionary and therefore are less predictable in their outcomes. This increases risks to prospective exporting firms and importing firms, driving up system costs and effectively serving as barriers to entry and to trade. It also dampens and distorts entrepreneurial and innovation incentives. Research limitations/implications - From the review and observations the authors then discuss ways and means of establishing priorities through a risk assessment framework in which key risks are enumerated and assessed in terms of their likelihoods and their conceivable consequences. Such an approach would allow challenges to be met with a degree of foresight and adaptability. Practical implications - The sometimes disjointed, sometimes strategic use of biotech regulations have fragmented markets and created fiefdoms which undermine the potential of novel technologies to address the challenges facing society. Social implications - For illustrative purposes, the authors touch on land and water governance, regulatory and institutional bottlenecks and reforms and the potential for agri-biotech to play an elevated role if vested interests and obstructions can be overcome. Originality/value - This study draws on research and literature from several disciplines. It also includes discussions relating to bureaucratic and administrative behavior which erodes the extent to which markets can be contested. This results in balkanized markets and non-cooperative behavior that undermines and distorts incentives for entrepreneurial effort and innovation. That such behavior takes place in markets and disciplines that are fundamental to assuring food security, nutrition and health, as well as good governance of scarce water and land resources is of considerable concern.","[Ma, Jen; Dang, Hugh] Ottawa United Learning Acad, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Gilmour, Brad] Mouralea Trade Agr & Resource Consulting, Ottawa, ON, Canada",,"Ma, J (通讯作者)，Ottawa United Learning Acad, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",tncr.special@gmail.com,"Ma, Jen/ABE-2559-2020",,,,,,38,4,4,1,26,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

A rich set of techniques exists for identifying optimal choices when that uncertainty is assumed to be understood and irreducible. Standard optimization approaches, however, cannot address situations in which reducible uncertainty applies to either system behavior or environmental states. The adaptive management literature overcomes this limitation with tools for optimal learning, but has been limited to highly simplified models with state and action spaces that are discrete and small. We overcome this problem by using a recently developed extension of the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework to allow for learning about a continuous state. We illustrate this methodology by exploring optimal control of bovine tuberculosis in New Zealand cattle. Disease testing-the control variable-serves to identify herds for treatment and provides information on prevalence, which is both imperfectly observed and subject to change due to controllable and uncontrollable factors. We find substantial efficiency losses from both ignoring learning (standard stochastic optimization) and from simplifying system dynamics (to facilitate a typical, simple learning model), though the latter effect dominates in our setting. We also find that under an adaptive management approach, simplifying dynamics can lead to a belief trap in which information gathering ceases, beliefs become increasingly inaccurate, and losses abound.","[Maclachlan, Matthew J.] ERS, USDA, Washington, DC 20024 USA; [Fackler, Paul L.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC USA; [Fackler, Paul L.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Appl Ecol, Raleigh, NC USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); North Carolina State University; North Carolina State University,"Maclachlan, MJ (通讯作者)，ERS, USDA, Washington, DC 20024 USA.",matthew.maclachlan@ers.usda.gov,,,National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) at the National Institutes of Health [1R01GM100471-01]; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences [1414374] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) at the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)); Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"Matthew J.

Results reveal that consumers have the highest willingness to pay (WTP) for an organic label from the United States. Traceability information regarding milk production was preferred the most. Consumers prefer IMF originated from the United States and New Zealand over China. Consumer heterogeneity was revealed through a latent class model. Compared to price-sensitive consumers, certification-inclined consumers had significantly higher WTP for organic labels. Origin-preferred consumers displayed higher WTP for IMF produced in the United States and New Zealand, and concerned consumers had higher WTP for all food safety informational attributes.

The success of the government's liberalisation policies in terms of market efficiency is investigated by examining the transmission of both positive and negative price changes for Robusta coffee between export and farmgate prices. We used a threshold vector error correction model and high-frequency daily data. The primary result here is that of a symmetric price transmission between export and farm-level prices. This result holds when tested with weekly price data, derived from the daily data. Farmgate prices respond faster to decreases than increases in export prices when the long-run deviation exceeds a certain threshold. These price changes are transmitted within several days. This research also confirms the importance of transaction costs, and other price frictions mostly ignored in prior analyses for coffee.","[Mai, Thang Chien; Shakur, Shamim; Cassells, Sue] Massey Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Private Bag 11 222, Palmerston North 4442, New Zealand",Massey University,"Mai, TC (通讯作者)，Massey Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Private Bag 11 222, Palmerston North 4442, New Zealand.",maichienthang91@gmail.com,,"Cassells, Susan/0000-0003-2477-8151",,,,,32,6,7,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Our results suggest that diet measured as calories, fat, protein, and diversity of food consumption has a statistically significant effect on life satisfaction levels of the Russian population. In addition, living in a region with higher per capita income increases population's life satisfaction. While living in a rural area, having health problems, and having young children affect individual life satisfaction in Russia in a negative and statistically significantly way. Life satisfaction is also positively correlated with education and income, and negatively with unemployment. Better understanding of the drivers of life satisfaction and more generally of subjective well-being in Russia can assist in the government decision-making processes, including the allocation of scarce resources and the design of public health policies.","[Huffman, Sonya K.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Rizov, Marian] Univ Lincoln, Dept Accountancy Finance & Econ, Lincoln, England",Iowa State University; University of Lincoln,"Huffman, SK (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",skostova@iastate.edu,,"Rizov, Marian/0000-0002-8895-1980",,,,,57,3,3,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

One particular feature has been a marked shift in the input intensity' of dairy farming systems through increased use of supplementary feed. These changes have generated debate about the impact of dairy farm intensity on the performance of farm businesses and the competitiveness of the New Zealand dairy sector. Using a novel econometric approach, we assess statistically the impact of three types of dairy farming systems on milk production and financial performance, using farm business data provided by DairyBase((R)). Our empirical results show that higher input systems perform significantly better physically than lower input systems, but not financially. The disaggregated analysis suggests that the average treatment effects differ by region and performance quantiles.","[Ma, Wanglin; Renwick, Alan; Bicknell, Kathryn] Lincoln Univ, Dept Global Value Chains & Trade, Fac Agribusiness & Commerce, Christchurch, New Zealand",Lincoln University - New Zealand,"Renwick, A (通讯作者)，Lincoln Univ, Dept Global Value Chains & Trade, Fac Agribusiness & Commerce, Christchurch, New Zealand.",Alan.Renwick@lincoln.ac.az,"Renwick, Alan/AAS-6588-2021; Ma, Wanglin/M-7744-2019","Ma, Wanglin/0000-0001-7847-8459",New Zealand dairy farmers through DairyNZ; Ministry for Primary Industries in the Transforming the Dairy Value Chain Primary Growth Partnership programme,New Zealand dairy farmers through DairyNZ; Ministry for Primary Industries in the Transforming the Dairy Value Chain Primary Growth Partnership programme,"This research is one of a series of analyses in the Marginal Imperative Project funded by New Zealand dairy farmers through DairyNZ and the Ministry for Primary Industries in the Transforming the Dairy Value Chain Primary Growth Partnership programme.

Using a regression analysis, we identify operator, operation, and regional characteristics associated with higher income volatility, providing information that could improve targeting of risk-mitigating programs. We find that farm income volatility has declined for farms specializing in program crops in recent decades, supporting the hypothesis that the expansion of the federal crop insurance program helped reduce farm income risk.","[Key, Nigel; Prager, Daniel L.; Burns, Christopher B.] USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20250 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Key, N (通讯作者)，USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20250 USA.",nkey@ers.usda.gov,,,,,,,25,12,13,1,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

Rural America is often characterized as a uniform, distressed place where agriculture dominates. In fact, rural America is diverse, with many regions doing well economically. In some areas, labor-saving technologies have reduced the workforce in manufacturing and resource-dependent industries. However, integration with urban areas has weakened the economic divide between urban and some rural areas, while natural amenities have boosted the fortunes of others. There is also evidence that homegrown enterprises can support growth even in the most remote, distressed regions. To support economic growth, policies should recognize the unique features of each place or region and balance the farm sector with the larger nonfarm rural economy. Economists are well-positioned to provide research-based evidence of what works, as well as rigorous evaluation of new polices.","[Goetz, Stephan J.] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Goetz, Stephan J.] Northeast Reg Ctr Rural Dev, University Pk, PA USA; [Partridge, Mark D.] Ohio State Univ, Rural Urban Policy, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Partridge, Mark D.] Jinan Univ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Partridge, Mark D.] Gran Sasso Sci Inst, Laquila, Italy; [Stephens, Heather M.] West Virginia Univ, Morgantown, WV USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Jinan University; Gran Sasso Science Institute (GSSI); West Virginia University,"Partridge, MD (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Rural Urban Policy, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.;Partridge, MD (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;Partridge, MD (通讯作者)，Gran Sasso Sci Inst, Laquila, Italy.",partridge.27@osu.edu,"Pereira, Fernanda/AID-4926-2022","Stephens, Heather/0000-0003-3472-216X; Goetz, Stephan/0000-0003-4529-552X",,,,,77,45,63,4,50,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

Design/methodology/approach Built on a TPB framework, it was examined how perceived behavioural control (PBC), behavioural goal (BG), behavioural attitude (BA) and subjective norm (SN) influenced farmers' intention to comply with pesticide application standards. Data of 986 farmers from five major agricultural provinces in China were collected following a stratified random sampling method. Structural equation modelling was employed for hypothesis testing and analysis. Findings The results showed that PBC, BG, behavioural attitude and SN had positive impacts on farmers' intention in abiding by the standards. Among them in determining farmers' intention towards compliance with pesticide application standards, farmers' PBC was found to be the most influential factor, while SN was the least influential factor. Originality/value The results indicated that the traditional TPB constructs had significant correlations with farmers' intention to comply with pesticide standards, demonstrating the applicability of the TPB in the understanding of farmers' decision-making in a developing country context. It is suggested that psychological factors should be taken into consideration in studying farmers' decision-making.","[Wang, Jianhua] Jiangnan Univ, Sch Business, Food Safety Res Base Jiangsu Prov, Wuxi, Peoples R China; [Chu, May] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Govt & Publ Adm, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Deng, Yuan Yuan] Jiangnan Univ, Sch Business, Wuxi, Peoples R China; [Lam, Honming] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Life Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Tang, Jianjun] Gibson Inst Land Food & Environm, Ctr Publ Hlth, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland",Jiangnan University; Chinese University of Hong Kong; Jiangnan University; Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Wang, JH (通讯作者)，Jiangnan Univ, Sch Business, Food Safety Res Base Jiangsu Prov, Wuxi, Peoples R China.",wiwth_99@163.com,"Chu, May/V-8483-2017; Jianjun, Tang/AAF-6942-2019; wang, jian/HRB-9588-2023; Lam, Hon-Ming/A-9866-2008","Chu, May/0000-0003-4878-8186; Jianjun, Tang/0000-0002-6994-2093; Lam, Hon-Ming/0000-0002-6673-8740",,,,,82,26,26,5,58,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

This paper investigates the role of local irrigation infrastructure in improving farmers' ability to respond to drought and its effectiveness in mitigating the drought risk in rice production in China. The analysis relies on a moment-based specification of the stochastic production function, capturing mean, variance and skewness effects. Using household survey data from 86 villages in five provinces, we jointly estimate farmers' adaptive irrigation decisions and their effects on rice yield and production risk. Our econometric analyses show that irrigation infrastructure in villages contributes to enhancing farmers' irrigation capacity in adapting to drought, and increased irrigation leads to a significant increase in mean yield and a reduction in exposure to risk as well as downside risk in rice production. The paper concludes with policy implications.","[Wang, Yangjie] Cent South Univ, Resource Conserving & Environm Friendly Soc, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yangjie] Cent South Univ, Sch Business, Ecol Civilizat Collaborat Innovat Ctr Hunan Prov, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Huang, Jikun; Wang, Jinxia] Peking Univ, China Ctr Agr Policy, Sch Adv Agr Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Findlay, Christopher] Univ Adelaide, Fac Profess, Adelaide, SA, Australia",Central South University; Central South University; Peking University; University of Adelaide,"Huang, JK (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, China Ctr Agr Policy, Sch Adv Agr Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jkhuang.ccap@pku.edu.cn,"wei, xiao/ISB-6027-2023; jiang, lei/IWE-1124-2023",,"Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research [ADP/2010/070, ADP/2011/039]; National Natural Sciences Foundation of China [71333013, 71503276]; Ministry of Science and Technology [2012CB955700]; International Development Research Center [107093-001]",Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research; National Natural Sciences Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government); International Development Research Center(International Development Research Centre - IDRC),"This work was funded by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ADP/2010/070, ADP/2011/039), the National Natural Sciences Foundation of China (71333013, 71503276), the Ministry of Science and Technology (2012CB955700) and the International Development Research Center (107093-001).

This paper investigates the potential effectiveness of BCAP in stimulating biomass production. We find that the effectiveness of BCAP is significantly affected by program design, farmers' risk and time preferences, credit availability, and biomass prices. The impact of a budget-constrained BCAP on incentivizing biomass production is much larger under a program design that enrolls land with the largest incremental biomass production per BCAP payment dollar (IBP-Max design) than under a design that enrolls land with the lowest cost of production (COP-Min design). The effectiveness of BCAP in inducing biomass production is highest when farmers are credit constrained, have a high degree of risk aversion, and a high rate of time preference under the IBP-Max design. The mix of feedstocks induced by the BCAP also varies as the biomass price increases; at low prices much of the biomass induced is from crop residues, while at high prices it is from perennial energy crops. The additional biomass production induced by the BCAP ranges from 0.1% to 62% of total biomass production without BCAP under the IBP-Max design, and from 0.1% to 3% under the COP-Min design. However, the volume of biomass production induced by BCAP is small even in the credit constrained, high-risk aversion, and high discount rate scenario (2.7 million metric tons annually) due to the limited program budget of $125 million BCAP budget under the 2014 Farm Bill.","[Miao, Ruiqing] Auburn Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Khanna, Madhu] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Khanna, M (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",khanna1@illinois.edu,,"Miao, Ruiqing/0000-0003-2936-6105","Energy Biosciences Institute, University of California, Berkeley; NIFA/USDA [2014-68006-21872]; NIFA [688355, 2014-68006-21872] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER","Energy Biosciences Institute, University of California, Berkeley(University of California System); NIFA/USDA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture)","Funding for this research from the Energy Biosciences Institute, University of California, Berkeley and NIFA/USDA (2014-68006-21872) is gratefully acknowledged.

In biological production processes, environmental shocks can lead to a stock-out when the harvest transitions to a new stock (year class) with a different marginal value. The result in the market is a temporary price spike, or bubble, bounded by the marginal value of the new stock. We highlight this phenomenon in a cohort, or year class, biological production setting. Each year class in the model is a finite non-renewable capital stock, and capital theory is used to solve for the stochastic dynamic competitive equilibrium. The model is parameterized to be representative of the Norwegian salmon aquaculture industry. Results suggest that the model can replicate much of the observed patterns in price, harvest, and capital stock dynamics, including the infrequent occurrence of extremely high prices in the market.","[Asche, Frank] Univ Florida, Inst Sustainable Food Syst, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Asche, Frank; Oglend, Atle] Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ, Stavanger, Norway; [Kleppe, Tore Selland] Univ Stavanger, Dept Math & Nat Sci, Stavanger, Norway",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Universitetet i Stavanger; Universitetet i Stavanger,"Oglend, A (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ, Stavanger, Norway.",atle.oglend@uis.no,"Asche, Frank/AAG-9920-2020","Asche, Frank/0000-0002-1540-9728",Norwegian Research Council; Norwegian Seafood Research Fund,Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway); Norwegian Seafood Research Fund,"Frank Asche is a professor at both the Institute for Sustainable Food Systems, University of Florida, and the University of Stavanger, Department of Industrial Economics, Stavanger, Norway.

However, improper lawn fertilizer applications can cause adverse environmental consequences, such as excessive chemical runoff into adjoining watersheds leading to water contamination. Currently, the importance of eco-friendly fertilizers to homeowners has not been assessed. This study uses a discrete choice experiment to test whether eco-friendly fertilizer attributes influence homeowners' preferences for sustainable landscape management. The findings show that eco-friendly fertilizer attributes positively influence homeowners' preferences and willingness to pay, supporting the premise that the promotion of eco-friendly fertilizer features could improve local ecosystems through increased adaptation. Furthermore, this study tests whether certain fertilizer attributes influence homeowners' preferences in states with and without fertilizer restrictions. Since the regulatory environment affects homeowners' preferences for sustainable landscaping, this study compares the results between regulated and unregulated states. The findings reveal that homeowners are more likely to use and are willing to pay higher premiums for sustainable fertilizers in states with residential fertilization regulations. This suggests that with strict fertilizer ordinances, homeowners are more geared toward eco-friendly landscaping options and that related educational programs should be made available.","[Khachatryan, Hayk] Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, 2725 S Binion Rd, Apopka, FL 32703 USA; [Suh, Dong Hee] Korea Univ, Coll Life Sci & Biotechnol, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea; [Zhou, Guzhen] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, 168 East Shuanggang Rd, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Dukes, Michael] Univ Florida, Dept Agr & Biol Engn, 205 Frazier Rogers Hall,POB 110570, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Korea University; Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Khachatryan, H (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, 2725 S Binion Rd, Apopka, FL 32703 USA.",hayk@ufl.edu; dhsuh@korea.ac.kr; zhouguzhen@jxufe.edu.cn; mddukes@ufl.edu,"Khachatryan, Hayk/GLQ-6541-2022","Khachatryan, Hayk/0000-0003-2387-3624; Suh, Dong Hee/0000-0002-6154-3864",Center for Landscape Conservation and Ecology at the University of Florida,Center for Landscape Conservation and Ecology at the University of Florida,This research was supported by the Center for Landscape Conservation and Ecology at the University of Florida.,,97,15,18,4,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

However, the effectiveness of Bt toxin, which depends on many technical constraints, is heterogeneous. In Pakistan, the diffusion of Bt cotton occurred despite a weak regulatory system and without seed quality control; whether or not many varieties sold as Bt are in fact Bt is also questionable. We utilise nationally representative sample data to test the effects of Bt cotton use on productivity. Unlike previous studies, we invoke several indicators of Bt identity: variety name, official approval status, farmer belief, laboratory tests of Bt presence in plant tissue, and biophysical assays measuring Bt effectiveness. Only farmer belief affects cotton productivity in the standard production model, which does not treat Bt appropriately as damage-abating. In the damage control framework, all Bt indicators reduce damage from pests. Biophysical indicators have the largest effect and official approval has the weakest. Findings have implications for impact measurement. For policy-makers, they suggest the need, on ethical and productivity grounds, to improve variety information and monitor variety integrity closer to point of sale.","[Smale, Melinda] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Spielman, David J.; Zambrano, Patricia; Zaidi, Fatima] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Nazli, Hina] Pakistan Strategy Support Programme, Islamabad, Pakistan",Michigan State University; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Smale, M (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",ms-male@msu.edu,,,"IFPRI's Pakistan Strategy Support Program; US Agency for International Development; CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets","IFPRI's Pakistan Strategy Support Program; US Agency for International Development(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets","This work was supported by IFPRI's Pakistan Strategy Support Program with funding from the US Agency for International Development; and by the CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets.

Based on the theory of social interactions, it was hypothesised that the probability of participating in the programme would increase with (i) the ease of implementing programme attributes on the farm, (ii) perceived use values such as increased milk yield, and (iii) stated levels of non-use existence values derived from improved animal welfare conditions and extrinsically motivated non-use values from enhanced prestige among relevant peer groups. It was found that non-use existence values were negatively related to programme acceptance because relatively high personal standards may not be in line with the programme design and may make the programme seem unnecessary.

The results indicate that increasing biogas density is associated with a significant rise in the rental rates of arable land only in regions with high livestock densities.

Listing a species as endangered is costly but increases the flow of social benefits and reduces the likelihood of extinction. If the species recovers sufficiently, additional costs can be incurred to subsequently delist the species. By treating listing and delisting as a pair of linked investment options, we provide an alternative to current practice for listing and delisting decisions that maximizes the return from public conservation investments. Under this alternative framework, we show that economic considerations may actually afford greater protection for at-risk species if these decisions are initiated early.

These shared interests and feedback effects in the natural environment are increasingly recognized as important economic and political issues, and necessitate a new framework for better understanding them. This article asks why such a framework does not exist and why it should be developed. It then presents such a framework by integrating regional, urban, and environmental economic insights. The framework focuses on the interactive location decisions of firms and households and centripetal forces for concentration and centrifugal forces for decentralization. The article captures the economic and environmental consequences of rural-urban relocation and feedback effects through changes in agglomeration economies, congestion costs, natural and social amenities, and the location of economic opportunities. Results show that some feedback effects reinforce the initial forces, but others weaken them. We present two examples to demonstrate the application of the framework. The first focuses on how agglomeration economies affect the effectiveness of environmental regulation and illustrates the benefits of incorporating regional and urban economic insights into environmental policy analysis. The second example focuses on how conservation policy can create localized amenities that help resource-rich regions avoid the natural resource curse and illustrates how concepts and perspectives from resource and environmental economics can improve our understanding of regional and rural issues.","[Wu, JunJie; Weber, Bruce A.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Partridge, Mark D.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Oregon State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Wu, JJ (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",junjie.wu@oregonstate.edu,,,,,,,97,15,17,3,84,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

I estimate the demand for security in water rights through their capitalization in agricultural property markets in the Yakima River Basin, a major watershed in Washington State. All water rights are satisfied in an average year, so the relative value of secure property rights is a function of water supply volatility and the costs of droughts are predominantly born by those with weak rights. In aggregate, security in water rights does not capitalize into property values at the irrigation district level; however, there is heterogeneity in the premiumfor secure water rights. The lack of a premiumfor district-level water security is robust to a variety of econometric methods to account for correlated district unobservables, and the null result produces an economically significant upper bound on the value to water security for the district. The ability for farmers to adapt to water supply volatility, as well as expectations about water markets and government infrastructure investment, are leading explanations for the lack of an aggregate premium. These explanations are supported by the pattern of heterogeneity in the water security premium.","[Brent, Daniel A.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Econ, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Brent, DA (通讯作者)，Louisiana State Univ, Dept Econ, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",dbrent@lsu.edu,,"Brent, Daniel/0000-0002-7088-8629",Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [R24 HD042828],Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),"Daniel A.

The aim of this paper was to determine whether Slovak legislation concerning land fragmentation is effective and prevents this phenomenon. We compare the Slovak legislation with the legislations of other countries, and, further, we describe the existing situation with respect to land fragmentation in the individual regions of the country according to the requirements of Slovak legal regulations.

Due to the increasing interest of consumers in food safety, direct marketing of farm products to consumers in the local farmers' markets has become very popular. Compared to traditional farm marketing channels, relatively little is known about the use of direct-to-consumer marketing strategies by farmers. This paper aims to provide a more comprehensive picture of farmers' choices among available farm marketing channels using the case study of Taiwan. Using a population-based survey of 5600 family farms in Taiwan in 2014, in this study we quantify the extent to which demographic characteristics of farm operators, farm production and family conditions may influence the decision of farms to sell farm products to the government, wholesale markets, and in direct-to-consumer sales. We develop a trivariate probit model, and our results indicate that education level and engagement in the off-farm labour market of farm operators, the number of household members, farm size, land ownership, and the type of farm are the key factors in determining farmers' choice of marketing channels. The findings of this study may have important implications for the design of more effective farm marketing programs by agricultural authorities.","[Liao, Pei-An] Shih Hsin Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chang, Hung-Hao] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Taipei, Taiwan; [He, Junlin] Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Econ, Fuzhou, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Saeliw, Kannika] Chiang Mai Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Dev, Chiang Mai, Thailand",Shih Hsin University; National Taiwan University; Fujian Agriculture & Forestry University; Chiang Mai University,"He, JL (通讯作者)，Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Econ, Fuzhou, Fujian, Peoples R China.;Saeliw, K (通讯作者)，Chiang Mai Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Dev, Chiang Mai, Thailand.",anna165423@163.com; kannika.saeliw@cmu.ac.th,,,,,,,28,6,6,3,24,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Using traditional valuation methods to appraise long-term land management outcomes ignores the full impact of irreversible or delayed decisions. We employ a variant of the real options decision process to examine uncertainties around climatic effects on macadamia growers and the explicit decision to adapt via cultivar replacement. We examine the trade-offs between the timing of the decision to replace macadamia cultivars by considering both the value of flexibility as well as the value of new information that can be used to resolve uncertainty. We compare the relative responses that generate the most value for growers across four geographical locations. We show that simple switching decisions using traditional valuation methods are found to be suboptimal and initiate poor decisions, potentially undermining adaptation efforts. As the rate of orchard degradation increases, the need to transition to higher-yielding cultivars becomes greater, especially for Hawaii, California and Australia where gross margins are leaner. Investment decisions are thus highly dependent on both local conditions and the economic structure of existing production systems.","[West, Jason] Univ Queensland, Fac Sci, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Gatton, Qld 4343, Australia",University of Queensland,"West, J (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Fac Sci, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Gatton, Qld 4343, Australia.",jason.west@uq.edu.au,,"West, Jason/0000-0003-3271-3155",,,,,37,1,1,1,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

In this paper, we test two potential reasons for unsustainable management practices, myopia and salience, with each explaining why resource managers may exhibit impatience in harvest decisions. Myopia is associated with decision makers placing lower weight on future outcomes than would be implied by their pure time preference. Salience is associated with overweighting of consumption now', implying inconsistency in time preferences. To test for these effects on renewable resource management, an incentivised, dynamic field experiment was carried out with rangeland grazing enterprise owners in north-eastern Australia that related management choices with uncertain rainfall events to both profits and land condition over time. Results demonstrate that respondents exhibiting myopia/salience in their choices tended to achieve lower cumulative scores in the experiment, as well as lower land conditions on their properties as measured with remote sensing data. Our results explain why there may be persistent optimisation failures by resource owners that reduce both profits and environmental outcomes.","[Gregg, Daniel] Univ Adelaide, Ctr Global Food & Resources, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Rolfe, John] Cent Queensland Univ, Rockhampton, Qld, Australia",University of Adelaide; Central Queensland University,"Gregg, D (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Ctr Global Food & Resources, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",daniel.gregg@adelaide.edu.au,"Rolfe, John/O-2945-2017","Rolfe, John/0000-0001-7659-7040; Gregg, Daniel/0000-0002-2308-0790",,,,,34,2,2,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Recent developments in risk and risk preference analyses have raised questions on conventional approaches to estimating risk preferences. This study proposes an estimation procedure that employs a seminonparametric estimator to estimate the density function of risk without imposing distributional assumptions, as well as a numerical integration method to construct closed-form expressions of conditional moment conditions for efficient estimation. The method achieves a substantial efficiency improvement relative to the conventional GMM approach in Monte Carlo simulations. The proposed approach is general and applies to the estimation of behavioral choice models under risk, or models that require expectation operations and closed-form equations for estimation.","[Wu, Feng; Guan, Zhengfei] Univ Florida, Gulf Coast Res & Educ Ctr, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Guan, Zhengfei] Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Guan, ZF (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Gulf Coast Res & Educ Ctr, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.;Guan, ZF (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",guanz@ufl.edu,,,,,,,26,5,6,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Large-scale vaccination is the most effective intervention to control virus spread. Compared to command-and-control approaches, voluntary vaccination approaches can be effective at lower costs, provided that farmers are willing to participate. We use a discrete choice experiment to estimate the preferences for vaccination scheme attributes, accounting for preference heterogeneity via an integrated choice and latent variable approach. In designing livestock disease control schemes, it is often argued that governments should use financial, incentive-based policy instruments to compensate farmers for externalities, assuming they act in rational self-interest. Our results suggest that in addition to economic motives, farmers can have intrinsic or social motives to invest in livestock disease control. Implications for the effectiveness of providing subsidy or information to motivate voluntary participation are discussed.","[Sok, Jaap] Wageningen Univ, Dept Social Sci, Business Econ, Wageningen, Netherlands; [van der Lans, Ivo A.; Hogeveen, Henk; Lansink, Alfons G.

Further, there is little research on how environmental discount rates differ from monetary rates. We use experimental methods to determine how individuals discount monetary and environmental goods.

Combining cross-sectional data from a household survey with 11-year longitudinal data on export market transactions, we explain the hazards of dropping out of a high-value export chain. We apply a multispell cox duration model that allows us to consider multiple entries and exits from the supply chain. We also provide evidence on the welfare impacts associated with participation. The results suggest that small-scale farmers' exit from the export sector is accelerated by high transaction risks experienced in the past. While we find no particular evidence for the exclusion of small-scale farmers from the export sector, we do find that poorer households and female-headed households tend to drop out faster, especially as long as the sector is still prospering. Finally, when considering welfare effects, we do not find evidence that participation translates into tangible benefits for broccoli farmers. We discuss some measures that could help improve the long-term sustainability of smallholder integration in high-value chains.","[Granja, Cristina Romero; Wollni, Meike] Univ Gottingen, Res Training Grp GlobalFood, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Wollni, M (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Res Training Grp GlobalFood, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",mwollni1@gwdg.de,,"Wollni, Meike/0000-0002-8460-7840",German Research Foundation (DFG),German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),The financial support of the German Research Foundation (DFG) is gratefully acknowledged.,,31,16,18,5,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

We review this literature and provide suggestions for future research directions. We suggest examining the distribution of food insecurity within households, the impact of the food distribution system on food insecurity, the coping mechanisms of low-income food secure families, food insecurity among American Indians, the effects of charitable food assistance, the causal relationship between food insecurity and health outcomes, the declining age gradient in food insecurity among Seniors, the effects of labor force participation and the Great Recession on food insecurity, and the long-term consequences of food insecurity. In addition, the impact of two recent policy recommendations on food insecurity - the minimum wage and the Affordable Care - Act should be considered.","[Gundersen, Craig] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Agr Strategy, Chicago, IL 60680 USA; [Ziliak, James P.] Univ Kentucky, Dept Econ, Microecon, Lexington, KY 40506 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; University of Kentucky,"Gundersen, C (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Agr Strategy, Chicago, IL 60680 USA.",cggunder@illinois.edu,,,"USDA, National Institute of Food and Agriculture [ILLU-470-331]","USDA, National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA))","Craig Gundersen is the Soybean Industry Endowed Professor in Agricultural Strategy, Department of Agricultural and Consumer Economics, University of Illinois.

Using an integrated modeling framework, we simultaneously evaluate the returns to irrigation arising from both economic and biophysical impact channels to understand what determines the profitability of irrigation in Malawi. Our results confirm that the returns to irrigation cannot cover the costs in Malawi. While labor-intensive irrigation expansion leads to unfavorable structural change in the short-run, the profitability hinges on low irrigated yields that fall far from expectations due to insufficient input use and crop management techniques. On the other hand, we find that the nonmonetary benefits of irrigation regarding higher food security, lower poverty, and reduced vulnerability to climate change make investments in irrigation worthwhile to improve the livelihoods of smallholders.","[Schuenemann, Franziska] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Thurlow, James; Robertson, Richard] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Meyer, Stefan] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Rodrigues, Joao] Univ Minnesota, Fac Econ, Minneapolis, MN USA",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Monash University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Schuenemann, F (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany.",franziska.schuenemann@ifw-kiel.de,"Thurlow, James/JQW-4545-2023","Schuenemann, Franziska/0000-0002-1311-0570",German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ); United States Agency for International Development (USAID),German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ); United States Agency for International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),We gratefully acknowledge funding by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) for the CGIAR research project entitled Policies and Institutions for Achieving the Virtuous Food-Energy-Water Nexus in Sub-Saharan Africa and by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) via its support of IFPRI's Malawi Strategy Support Program (MaSSP).,,38,8,11,3,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Implications for the political economy of agricultural protection,AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Political economy of agriculture; Agricultural protectionism; Agricultural trade,POLICIES; TRADE; PREFERENCES; INSIGHTS; WTO,"The persistence of agricultural protectionism throughout the world is intriguing given the widely recognized benefits of free trade. The political economy literature over the last decades has considered groups' interest, politicians' preferences, and their interactions within domestic politics as the primary forces driving agricultural protection. Yet, a growing body of studies suggests that it would be judicious to weigh in consumers' or taxpayers' perspectives in deciphering the nature of agricultural protection. This study examines U.S. citizens' preferences about government intervention in agriculture and trade. Results show that they are in strong support of agricultural protection and their perceptions of national food security, family farms, environmental sustainability, and multifunctionality of agriculture play a significant role in shaping their support/opposition toward government intervention. The conventional political economy literature theorizes that consumers or taxpayers would oppose public policies that increase their tax burden; however, in the case of the farm sector, they have little incentive to voice their objections given the costs of farm programs are spread across a large number of consumers and taxpayers. U.S. citizens' support for government involvement in agriculture as reported in this and other prior studies does not lend support for such political economy explanation.","[Moon, Wanki] Southern Illinois Univ, Dept Agribusiness Econ, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Pino, Gabriel] Univ Talca, Fac Econ & Negocios, 2 Norte 685, Talca, Chile",Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University; Universidad de Talca,"Moon, W (通讯作者)，Southern Illinois Univ, Dept Agribusiness Econ, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA.",wmoon@siu.edu,,,,,,,45,10,11,0,48,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

A two-stage least squares (2SLS) multivariate Tobit regression model with random effects was applied. We find that impacts of drinking water conditions on off-farm labour supply may be greater for women than men but depends on the specific family role or family structure. A strong within-gender effect exists in households. For example, daughters are not sensitive to water access nor water quality, but householder's spouses are sensitive to water access, and daughters-in-law are sensitive to water quality. Our findings suggest that infrastructure development in improved access to safe water has contributed positively to reductions in traditional gender biases, evening the playing field between daughters, daughters-in-law, mothers and mothers-in-law. We also find that water the infrastructure program may actually encourage off-farm labour mobility, reducing the supply of agricultural labour and the share of household labour on the farm. Thus, a broader approach to water policy should also include public investment in achieving greater labour efficiency and productivity.","[Zhou, Li] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Turvey, Calum G.] Cornell Univ, Dept Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY USA",Nanjing Agricultural University; Cornell University,"Zhou, L (通讯作者)，Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",zhouli@njau.edu.cn,,"ZHOU, LI/0000-0001-8942-1976","Chinese National Social Science Foundation [13ZD160]; 'Qing Lan Project' - 'Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD)', 'China Center for Food Security Studies, Nanjing Agricultural University' in China","Chinese National Social Science Foundation; 'Qing Lan Project' - 'Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD)', 'China Center for Food Security Studies, Nanjing Agricultural University' in China","The work was supported by the Chinese National Social Science Foundation (project number: 13&ZD160) and the 'Qing Lan Project', 'A Project Funded by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD)', 'China Center for Food Security Studies, Nanjing Agricultural University' in China.",,25,4,4,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

In this article we investigate the effect of the food environment on the likelihood of adult Italians consuming five or more daily portions of FV, and on the probability of consuming more portions of FV. We combine individual-level data on adult Italians' lifestyle with regional food retail structure measures. To correct for the endogeneity of the food environment, we use an identification strategy based on aggregate drivers of food stores' location, and on the regional political climate affecting retail liberalization reforms. The results show that increased access affects positively the probability of consuming the daily-recommended amounts of FV, as well as the probability of consuming more portions of FV.

We pay particular attention to the rhetoric surrounding greater involvement of private insurance, the lack of rhetoric regarding the use of crown corporations, and issues of subsidization. We conclude with policy recommendations favoring commodity-specific revenue versus whole-farm net margin insurance, a possible reduction in subsidy levels, and a call to reconsider the role of crown corporations.

This contributed to the smallness and homogeneity of Quebec dairy farms relative to dairy farms in Western Canada. In Quebec, most dairy farms still rely on the tie-stall milking system, while dairy farms in Western provinces are larger and use larger-scale, lower-cost technologies. Regulations on Quebec's quota exchange have slowed down the pace at which a farm can acquire production quota, exacerbating the effects of input lumpiness, on dairy farm efficiency. Low trading on the production exchange severely constrains production adjustments, making, scale, allocative, and technical inefficiencies more persistent and investment in herd expansion unprofitable.","[Larue, Bruno] Univ Laval, CREATE, Int Agrifood Trade, Quebec City, PQ G1V0A6, Canada; [Singbo, Alphonse] Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, BP 320, Bamako, Mali; [Pouliot, Sebastien] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Laval University; CGIAR; International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid-Tropics (ICRISAT); Iowa State University,"Larue, B (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, CREATE, Int Agrifood Trade, Quebec City, PQ G1V0A6, Canada.",bruno.larue@eac.ulaval.ca; alphonsesingbo@gmail.com; pouliot@iastate.edu,,"Singbo, Alphonse/0000-0002-7605-3737",FQRSC-equipe de recherche; Canada Research Chair program,FQRSC-equipe de recherche; Canada Research Chair program(Canada Research Chairs),The authors wish to thank two anonymous reviewers and the editors for insightful comments and suggestions.

In this paper, we examine the effects of risk attitudes and social interactions on the willingness to pay (WTP) for genotyping animals for susceptibility to a chronic mastitis trait. We use contingent valuation with double bounded dichotomous choice questions to elicit producers' WTP. The estimated mean WTP for genotyping is approximately $50 per animal. Compared to the current market prices of commercially available comprehensive genotyping services, this estimate suggests a significant market potential for genotyping to be bundled with economically important disease traits. We also find evidence that both risk attitudes and social interactions have strong effects on the WTP for genotyping. Farmers with higher risk tolerance are willing to pay more for genotyping service. For dairy farmers with more concern about mastitis, risk tolerance has no significant effect on the WTP, while social interactions have a significant effect on the WTP. We also find a strong interaction effect between risk tolerance and social interactions. The findings encourage interest in questions about how risk attitudes, social networks, and their interactions shape the adoption of and the WTP for a novel agricultural technology.","[Hailu, Getu; Cao, Ying; Yu, Xi] Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, JD MacLachlan Bldg, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University of Guelph,"Hailu, GT (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, JD MacLachlan Bldg, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",ghailu@uoguelph.ca; ycao01@uoguelph.ca; yux0720@gmail.com,,"Cao, Ying/0000-0002-5907-8959; Hailu, Getu/0000-0003-1257-5939","Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) - University of Guelph Partnership [200222]; Genome Canada","Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) - University of Guelph Partnership; Genome Canada(Genome Canada)","The authors are grateful to the Dairy Farmers of Ontario (DFO) for helping with the survey of dairy producers.

Market designers use uncertainty trade ratios to address imperfect substitution between these commodities. Guidance from government agencies and other entities recommends large ratios that penalize trades for nonpoint abatement, and extant programs universally implement this guidance. Previous research has shown that the standard guidance is based on an inappropriate framing of the risk effects of substituting nonpoint for point source pollution abatement, and has demonstrated that the trade ratios should be set to encourage or discourage substitution, depending on whether the substitution is risk-reducing or risk-increasing. However, the Pigouvian pricing approach used to develop this result obscures the underlying economic calculus because it does not recognize or characterize the tradeoffs between abatement costs savings and environmental risk that must be considered in an economic evaluation of alternative ratios, and that would be key to explaining why ratios recommended by economic analysis would be preferred to received wisdom. We develop a new approach that explicitly identifies and characterizes the tradeoffs associated with the choice of ratio. The approach is examined both in first-best settings where trade ratios and initial permit allocations are jointly determined, and in second-best settings where permit allocations are taken as given. We provide a numerical analysis of trading in the Susquehanna River Basin in Pennsylvania to illustrate theory. We find theoretical and numerical support suggesting that smaller ratios may be optimal.","[Horan, Richard D.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Shortle, James S.] Penn State Univ, Environm & Nat Resources Inst, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Michigan State University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Horan, RD (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",,,,AgBioResearch at Michigan State University; Penn State Agricultural Experiment Station; Penn State Environment and Natural Resources Institute; USEPA [83556801],AgBioResearch at Michigan State University; Penn State Agricultural Experiment Station; Penn State Environment and Natural Resources Institute; USEPA(United States Environmental Protection Agency),"Richard D.

The aim of this paper is to establish a theoretical foundation for household food waste, and based on this theory, to determine the social-optimal food-waste (disposal) tax, along with a government incentive. The theory unravels the interrelation between social food insecurity and external environmental costs, which is not generally considered by households when they waste food.

While some factors are identical for both the EU and the Czech Republic, other effects can only be evaluated at the European or international scale, and still others can be evaluated only at the national scale. The only factor found in this study to be significantly associated with the agricultural holding size on the European scale was the wheat production. On the Czech national scale, land consolidation, unemployment rate, and soil fertility were significantly associated with the agricultural holding size. The study found that in the Czech Republic, the number of farms was increasing, while at the same time the agricultural holding sizes were decreasing.

The performance measurements of listed companies contain important information for forecasting the trends of agricultural production and yield. The paper studied and considered much of the literature on the performance measurement of organizations to look for relative variables and the optimal methodology. The study used panel data from 2011-2014, which collected the listed annual companies' statements. The aim of the study was to employ the Slacks Based Measure context-dependent Data Envelopment Analysis (SBM context-dependent DEA) for evaluating the efficiency in Decision Making Units (DMUs). The SBM context-dependent DEA was used to measure the performance of listed companies by employing attractiveness and progress scores. The results showed that when a listed company has a higher attractiveness and lower progress score, it has a better performance than its competitors and does not need to improve its efficiency. Therefore, the empirical results of the study can help farmers and governments to realize the trends of agricultural productivity and also help the listed companies to understand the characteristics of their competitors, leading to improvements in their organizations.","[Pongpanich, Rapee; Maichum, Kamonthip] Natl Pingtung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Trop Agr & Int Cooperat, Pingtung, Taiwan; [Peng, Ke-Chung] Natl Pingtung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Agribusiness Management, Pingtung, Taiwan",National Pingtung University Science & Technology; National Pingtung University Science & Technology,"Peng, KC (通讯作者)，Natl Pingtung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Agribusiness Management, Pingtung, Taiwan.",kchung@mail.npust.edu.tw,"Phongparnich, Rapee/Q-1970-2017; Phongparnich, Rapee/AAB-5266-2019","Phongparnich, Rapee/0000-0001-5004-6822",,,,,29,3,3,0,16,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Both grew in the 1920s, but only because of government support. Once that support was removed in the late 1940s, production plateaued and exports diminished: only two per cent of wine production was exported during 1975-1985. Yet over the next two decades, Australia's wine production quadrupled and the share exported rose to two-thirds - before falling somewhat in the next 10 years. This paper explains why it took so long for Australia's production and competitive advantage in wine to emerge, why it took off spectacularly after the mid-1980s and why it fell in the 10 years to 2016. It concludes that despite the recent downturn in the industry's fortunes, the country's international competitiveness is now firmly established and commensurate with its ideal wine-growing climate, notwithstanding the likelihood of further boom-slump cycles in the decades ahead.","[Anderson, Kym] Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Anderson, Kym] Australian Natl Univ, Arndt Corden Dept Econ, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia",University of Adelaide; Australian National University,"Anderson, K (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Adelaide, SA, Australia.;Anderson, K (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Arndt Corden Dept Econ, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia.",kym.anderson@adelaide.edu.au,"Anderson, Kym/G-7292-2012","Anderson, Kym/0000-0002-1472-3352",,,,,25,8,8,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

This includes bundling' issues in agricultural pollution management, where a change in management action or farming systems generates multiple improvements, such as reductions in more than one pollutant. In this study, we conceptualise and compare two different approaches to analysing cost-effectiveness when varying bundles of benefits are generated for a single project investment. Each approach requires data to be transformed in some way to allow the analysis to proceed. The index approach requires the transformation on the benefits side so that the effects of multiple pollutant changes can be combined into a measure for each project which can then be compared to costs. By comparison, the disaggregation approach requires the transformation on the costs side where costs for each project have to be apportioned across the different pollutants involved. The paper provides novel insights with an application to agricultural water quality improvements into the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, demonstrating that while both approaches are effective in prioritising projects by cost-effectiveness, the disaggregation approach provides more insightful results and values that may be relevant for use as upper value guidelines in future project selection.","[Rolfe, John; Windle, Jill] CQUniversity, Sch Business & Law, Rockhampton, Qld, Australia; [McCosker, Kevin; Northey, Adam] Queensland Dept Agr & Fisheries, Rockhampton, Qld, Australia",Central Queensland University,"Rolfe, J (通讯作者)，CQUniversity, Sch Business & Law, Rockhampton, Qld, Australia.",j.rolfe@cqu.edu.au,"Rolfe, John/O-2945-2017","Rolfe, John/0000-0001-7659-7040",,,,,43,10,10,2,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

The product under consideration is kenkey made with nutritious maize, biofortified with vitamin A, which gives it a distinct orange color, in contrast to the white and yellow varieties that are traditionally consumed. We use an experiment consisting of 14 treatment arms, conducted in rural Ghana. Our estimation strategy explicitly accounts for the censored (typically at the market price) nature of the bids in the auctions, and the apparently lexicographic choices of several individuals in the CE. We find no evidence of economically meaningful (defined by the minimum currency unit of five pesewas) differences in WTP (although they may be statistically significant) across elicitation mechanisms, or by participation fee, a result that is in contrast to that found in much of the literature. A secondary finding is that the provision of nutrition information positively and significantly affects the marginal WTP for the new maize.","[Banerji, A.; Meenakshi, J.

On both sides of the border, when large crops have exceeded the short-term capacity of grain export channels to move the crop, export basis has increased and reduced producer prices. In locations not subject to barge competition, US grain freight rates are higher than Canadian rates and are bid up further during periods of congestion.

Yet no one has looked at the opportunity cost of and the various trade-offs involved in participating in contract farming. I look at the relationship between participation in contract farming and income from (i) livestock, (ii) labor markets, (iii) nonfarm businesses, and (iv) agricultural sources other than livestock and contract farming and (v) unearned income. Using data from Madagascar, I find that participation in contract farming is associated with a 79% decrease in how much income per capita the average household derives from labor markets and a 47% decrease in how much income per capita it derives from nonfarm businesses, but also with a 51% increase in how much income per capita the average household derives from agricultural sources other than livestock and contract farming, possibly due to technological spillovers. Thus, even though contract farming has been shown to improve welfare in multiple ways in this context, it looks as though those gains come at the cost of an agricultural involution on the part of participating households, who seem to turn away from non-agricultural activities. This has important implications for structural transformation narratives.","[Bellemare, Marc F.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, 1994 Buford Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Bellemare, MF (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, 1994 Buford Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",mbellema@umn.edu,"Bellemare, Marc F./HCH-3192-2022",,National Institute of Food and Agriculture [MIN-14-061],National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),I am grateful to the National Institute of Food and Agriculture for funding this work through grant MIN-14-061-Smallholder Participation in Agricultural Value Chains: Evidence from Madagascar.

While pecuniary economic incentives are the standard prescription for open-access market failures arising from such resources, non-pecuniary behavioral approaches (e.g., nudges) are also effective in some cases. Yet non-pecuniary instruments have not previously been evaluated for managing pesticide resistance. I empirically evaluate the performance of such an intervention to manage pest resistance to genetically engineered Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) corn. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency permits sale of Bt seed conditional on seed producers compelling customers to plant mandated levels of non-Bt refuge to delay the evolution of Bt resistance. Because of compliance challenges, the Bt seed producer Monsanto piloted a social marketing program to promote refuge in 17 North Carolina counties in 2013-2014. Using 2013-2016 sales data, I use difference-in-differences, fractional regression, discrete changes-in-changes, and matched differences econometric models to identify the average treatment effect of the program on refuge planting. Results suggest that if it had covered all corn growers in North Carolina, the intervention would have led the average grower to plant between 2.6% (preferred estimate) and 5.8% more refuge in 2014 compared to the counterfactual. The program increased by at least 12% the average probability of planting any refuge in 2014. I find little evidence that effects of the program persisted in subsequent years after cessation, nor that the program increased compliance with mandated refuge thresholds. Informed by behavioral economics research on other environmental and resource policies, I discuss the implications of these findings for pesticide resistance management.","[Brown, Zachary S.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ ARE, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",North Carolina State University,"Brown, ZS (通讯作者)，North Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ ARE, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",zack_brown@ncsu.edu,,"Brown, Zachary/0000-0003-1301-4420",USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture HATCH project [NC02520]; NCSU Genetic Engineering Society Center; NCSU Center for Environmental and Natural Resource Economics and Policy,USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture HATCH project; NCSU Genetic Engineering Society Center; NCSU Center for Environmental and Natural Resource Economics and Policy,"Zachary S.

The conceptual model posits substitution relations between water stress metrics and soil quality, as well as a soil-conditioned threshold water stress level beyond which soil cannot buffer crop yields. The model implies that yield-yield dependence should vary as growing conditions vary. In comparison with intermediate growing conditions, yield-yield dependence should strengthen when growing conditions are either very good or very poor. County yield data strongly support substitution between soil and benign water availability levels, but complementarity between soil and beneficial heat variables. Our estimated model provides qualified support for the hypothesis that better land is more resilient to water stress. We estimate a pseudo-copula that nests the Gaussian copula, finding strong evidence of left tail dependence among yields. Our formal model and empirical findings corroborate others' concerns about the appropriateness of current USDA rate-setting methodologies, which posit constant state-conditional rank correlations, implicitly assumed by use of the Gaussian copula. An application to aggregate crop yield rate setting suggests that current methods underprice area yield and whole farm premiums. Applying our empirical model to medium-range weather projections under a climate change scenario for the Northern Great Plains, we infer that systemic yield correlations will increase in future years.","[Du, Xiaodong] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Hennessy, David A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, Food & Agr Policy, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Feng, Hongli] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Arora, Gaurav] Indraprastha Inst Informat Technol, Social Sci Div, Delhi, India",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Michigan State University; Michigan State University; Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi,"Hennessy, DA (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, Food & Agr Policy, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",hennes64@msu.edu,"Feng, Hongli/A-1662-2013","Feng, Hongli/0000-0001-7553-8145; Arora, Gaurav/0000-0002-8072-2382",,,,,43,6,7,3,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Facing fiscal constraints and growing enrolments, school systems in developing countries often supplement their teaching staff by hiring contract teachers. However, there is limited evidence on how the effectiveness of these teachers compares to that of civil service teachers. We use a dataset from rural primary schools in western China to estimate the causal effect of contract teachers on student achievement and find that gains in student scores on standardised examinations in mathematics and Chinese are less in classes taught by contract teachers than in classes taught by civil service teachers. The results demonstrate that China's education system needs to focus on producing high-quality teachers to improve the quality of schooling in its rural education system. The findings imply that educators in developing countries should not only seek to hire increasingly more civil service teachers in rural schools, but they should also identify ways of improving the quality of contract teachers. If efforts to improve teaching can succeed, rural students can learn more, earn higher incomes and contribute more to the productivity of the overall economy.","[Lei, Wang; Li, Mengjie] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Int Business Sch, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Siqi; Sun, Yonglei] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Ctr Expt Econ Educ, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Sylvia, Sean] Univ N Carolina, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Yang, Enyan] Renmin Univ China, Postdoctoral Sci Res Workstat, Postal Savings Bank China, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yang, Enyan] Renmin Univ China, Ctr Postdoctoral Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Linxiu] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ma, Guangrong] Renmin Univ China, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Mo, Di; Rozelle, Scott] Stanford Univ, Rural Educ Act Project, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Shaanxi Normal University; Shaanxi Normal University; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; Renmin University of China; Renmin University of China; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Renmin University of China; Stanford University","Zhang, LX (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.",lxzhang.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn,"ZHANG, LIN/GYD-9123-2022; Zhang, Lin/HZH-4842-2023; li, mengjie/GRS-3931-2022",,111 Project; Ministry of Education of the P.R.

All of these issues have economic dimensions, including appraising damages and the value of effects reducing actions, as well as the formulation of efficient policies.

In this article, I use a laboratory experiment to examine the role of two mechanisms in incentivizing spatially-coordinated land uses under the Agglomeration Bonus scheme on a geographical landscape resembling a local circular network. The first mechanism is pecuniary in format and varies the payoffs associated with coordination, while the second is a non-pecuniary mechanism that varies the amount of information participants have about the land use choices of other participants, specifically of those from another community. The payoff variation is implemented as a within-subject treatment and the information treatment in a between-subject format. The results indicate that the coordination rates are higher if payments associated with coordination are higher. Also, having information about outcomes of the Agglomeration Bonus scheme from another community improves spatial coordination rates in both communities.","[Banerjee, Simanti] Univ Nebraska, Dept Agr Econ, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA",University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Banerjee, S (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska, Dept Agr Econ, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.",simanti.banerjee@unl.edu,,"Banerjee, Simanti/0000-0002-6352-5440",University of Nebraska-Lincoln,University of Nebraska-Lincoln,"This research has been funded by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

Design/methodology/approach An equilibrium displacement model of livestock products is combined with an inventory relation proposed by Rucker et al. (1984) to deduce hypothesis about the effects of expected price and feed costs, weather, and supply and demand shifters on herd size. Dynamics are incorporated using the partial adjustment and adaptive expectations models originally proposed by Nerlove (1956). The hypotheses are tested using both the structural equations implied by the model, and the reduced form. Findings Results suggest livestock inventories in IMAR in general are more responsive to weather conditions than to economic conditions. This is especially true for cattle and sheep, where isolated 1 percent changes in weather variables, namely precipitation and radiation, were found to have a much larger effect on inventory than isolated 1 percent changes in expected price and forage costs. The effects of the weather variables, moreover, were found to be different for goats than for cattle and sheep, with goat numbers decreasing with improvements in weather, and cattle and sheep numbers increasing. This suggests herders respond to poor weather in part by substituting goats for cattle and/or sheep. Price was found to have a negative effect on cattle inventory, and no effect on sheep and goat inventory. Forage costs were found to have a positive effect on cattle and sheep inventories, and no effect on goat inventory. These results suggest policies to protect grassland by controlling inventory levels must be designed carefully if they are to be effective. Originality/value The paper makes a methodological contribution in that the livestock inventory relation proposed by Rucker et al. (1984) is extended to include supply and demand shifters for livestock products in a partial-equilibrium setting where the industry in question is a net exporter of livestock products. The paper makes an empirical contribution in that additional evidence is provided on the role that price plays in inventory behavior.","[Ge, Wei] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Ge, Wei; Kinnucan, Henry] Auburn Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",Nanjing Agricultural University; Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Ge, W (通讯作者)，Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",wzg0015@auburn.edu,"li, jian/IAQ-2794-2023; Kinnucan, Henry W./A-5808-2008","Kinnucan, Henry/0000-0002-0577-2224",,,,,18,3,4,0,22,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

From an innovation point of view food industry is seen as a slow one, which is lagging behind the technology pushed possibilities, but sometimes behind the customers' desires and requirements as well. In our research, we determine why the food companies in Hungary do not engage in innovation activities and if they do so, what are the main drivers of their innovation performance? We use the Community Innovation Survey (CIS 2012a) data and employ double hurdle estimation because of the nature of the innovation distribution, This method also helps in overcoming the selection bias problem, which necessarily occurs in this situation.

Farmers' land property right could be used as collateral to deal with moral hazard and adverse selection issues. The purpose of this paper is to document the effects of the RLPRMLP on households' income using a unique data set from 1,279 households' survey in Western China during 2012-2014. Design/methodology/approach At the first stage, the authors evaluate the impacts of RLPRMLP on households' income to get the benchmark results when the authors control household's observed and unobserved characteristics. To address the potential endogeneity issue resulting from the self-selection of farmers into the rural financial market, the authors apply the treatment effect model to identify the csusal effects of the innovative loan approach on a household's income. Findings The empirical results favor the belief that participating in the RLPRMLP helps the households improve their total income (at least by 20.2 percent) and income per capita. This income-improving channel is only through agricultural sector, rather than through non-agricultural sector which potentially helps to deal with the inequality issue within poor regions. The results are robust when the authors control households' characteristics, including observed and unobserved, and solve the endogeneity issue. Participating in the RLPRMLP could encourage farmers to invest more in the agricultural sector and increase agricultural productivity, which is the main mechanism of the income-improving effect of the RLPRMLP. Originality/value The innovative mortgage loan program provides a new channel for farmers to get loan. Land property right reform is being currently applied in rural China. Testing the effectiveness of combining land property right and microfinance loan method is necessary for the government policy making and development of rural areas. The findings are striking. The income improvement mechanism mainly works through agricultural sector, potentially because of the reform of land property, contributing to the increase of marginal product of land, i.e., the increase of agricultural productivity. These could help the development of microfinance theory, and the innovative loan method could be applied to other developing countries.","[Yang, Xi; Luo, Jianchao] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Yang, Xi] Hubei Univ Chinese Med, Sch Management, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Yan, Wenshou] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Business Adm, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China",Northwest A&F University - China; Hubei University of Chinese Medicine; Zhongnan University of Economics & Law,"Yan, WS (通讯作者)，Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Business Adm, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",yanwenshou_850812@126.com,"Yan, Wu/JYO-9522-2024",,,,,,37,6,7,5,45,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Our results suggest that after adoption, there was a 21% increase in forest cover within subdivisions relative to the amount without the regulation. The heterogeneous effects of this regulation suggest that on average, forest cover increased for parcels with lower levels of existing forest cover. However, parcels with the highest levels of forest cover continue to have significant decreases in forest cover, despite the regulation, thereby resulting in fragmentation in regions with the most intact forest cover.","[Newburn, David A.] Univ Maryland, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Ferris, Jeffrey S.] Amazon, Seattle, WA USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Amazon.com,"Newburn, DA (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",dnewburn@umd.edu,"Newburn, David A/C-9182-2014",,"National Science Foundation Coastal Science, Engineering, and Education for Sustainability Program [1426819]; National Science Foundation Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Program [DEB-1027188]; Division Of Earth Sciences; Directorate For Geosciences [1426819] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation Coastal Science, Engineering, and Education for Sustainability Program; National Science Foundation Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Program(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); Division Of Earth Sciences; Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO))","David Newburn is an assistant professor in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at the University of Maryland.

Composting and other food waste recycling technologies that divert food waste from landfills mitigate the environmental damages of food waste disposal and have grown in popularity. We explore whether consumer knowledge that the environmental damage created by their food waste will be mitigated by recycling technologies undermines personal food waste reduction behavior. Subjects in a dining situation are randomly assigned whether or not they receive information about the negative effects of landfilling food waste and whether they are told that uneaten food from the study will be composted or landfilled. We find that providing information about the negative effects of food waste in landfills significantly reduces the total amount of solid food waste created when compared to a control situation that features neither a food waste reduction nor a food waste recycling policy. However, if subjects are also informed that food waste from the study will be composted, the amount of solid food waste generated is significantly greater than if only the food waste reduction policy were implemented. This suggests a crowding out effect or informational rebound effect in which promoting policies that mitigate the environmental damages of food waste may unintentionally undermine policies meant to encourage individual consumer food waste reduction. We discuss key policy implications as well as several limitations of our experimental setting and analysis.","[Qi, Danyi; Roe, Brian E.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Qi, DY (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",qi.163@osu.edu,"Carvalho, Raquel/GYJ-7447-2022; Roe, Brian E/A-7386-2009",,"Department of Agricultural, Environmental and Development Economics, Ohio State University; Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center, Ohio State University","Department of Agricultural, Environmental and Development Economics, Ohio State University; Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center, Ohio State University(Ohio State University)","Danyi Qi is a graduate research associate and Brian E.

The coffee sector is a prime example, where sustainability certification could improve livelihoods for poor smallholders. However, as individual production volumes are low, smallholder farmers need to cooperate in certification as a group, which makes impact assessment more complicated. Previous empirical studies, reporting premia of up to 30%, have neglected the costs associated with group certification. We explore the issue using an agent-based simulation of coffee producer organisations in Uganda, including the certification-related costs for farmers. Our results suggest that certification can have a small positive impact on participating households. But the added value of certification is substantially lower than the price premium, because of certification costs. Increasing both the membership of the producer groups and their deliveries of certified coffee are necessary to improve the rewards of certification.","[Latynskiy, Evgeny; Berger, Thomas] Univ Hohenheim, Hans Ruthenberg Inst, Stuttgart, Germany",University Hohenheim,"Berger, T (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Hans Ruthenberg Inst, Stuttgart, Germany.",thomas.berger@uni-hohenheim.de,,"Berger, Thomas/0000-0003-3316-9614",,,,,52,25,26,2,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

We use a choice experiment for olive farmers' preferences for agri-environmental scheme participation in southern Spain. Our two main objectives are: first, to identify and discuss a range of possible motives for protest responses that emerge in a WTA context; second, we analyse the impact on WTA estimates of censoring serial non-participation linked to protest or high compensation requirements (very high takers). Using a random parameter logit model in WTA space, we find that the inclusion or exclusion of serial non-participants in the analysis can have a significant impact on marginal and total WTA estimates. Based on the findings, the paper makes recommendations on how to reduce the incidence of protest responses through survey design, regarding the identification of protesters as opposed to very high takers, and regarding the treatment of both groups of respondents for WTA estimation.","[Villanueva, Anastasio J.] Univ Cordoba UCO, Dept Agr Econ, Cordoba, Spain; [Glenk, Klaus] Scotlands Rural Coll SRUC, Land Econ Environm & Soc Grp, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Rodriguez-Entrena, Macario] Inst Agr & Fisheries Res & Training IFAPA, Dept Agr Econ, Cordoba, Spain; [Rodriguez-Entrena, Macario] UCO, Cordoba, Spain",Universidad de Cordoba; Scotland's Rural College,"Villanueva, AJ (通讯作者)，Univ Cordoba UCO, Dept Agr Econ, Cordoba, Spain.",ajvillanueva@uco.es,"Rodriguez-Entrena, Macario/C-4959-2017; Villanueva, Anastasio J./G-7475-2016; Villanueva, Anastasio J./AEG-0644-2022; Glenk, Klaus/B-8743-2014","Rodriguez-Entrena, Macario/0000-0002-9339-439X; Villanueva, Anastasio J./0000-0002-1384-8372; Glenk, Klaus/0000-0002-2472-0235",Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness (MINECO); National Institute for Agricultural and Food Research and Technology (INIA); European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the project SUSTANOLEA [P10-AGR-5892]; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the project MERCAOLI [RTA2013-00032-00-00]; Andalusian Institute of Agricultural Research and Training (IFAPA); European Social Fund (ESF) within the Operative Program of Andalusia; Scottish Government Rural Affairs; Environment Portfolio Strategic Research Programmes,Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness (MINECO); National Institute for Agricultural and Food Research and Technology (INIA)(Instituto de Investigacion Agropecuaria (INIA)); European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the project SUSTANOLEA(European Union (EU)); European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the project MERCAOLI(European Union (EU)); Andalusian Institute of Agricultural Research and Training (IFAPA); European Social Fund (ESF) within the Operative Program of Andalusia; Scottish Government Rural Affairs; Environment Portfolio Strategic Research Programmes,"This research is co-financed by the Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness (MINECO), the National Institute for Agricultural and Food Research and Technology (INIA) and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the projects SUSTANOLEA (P10-AGR-5892) and MERCAOLI (RTA2013-00032-00-00).

Unlike simple tariffs, both measures contain non-linear effects and binding conditions that make their treatment in modeling trade liberalization challenging. In addition, the coexistence of these measures carries important interactive effects that restrict trade. This study investigates these joint effects by developing a conceptual framework that considers different partial liberalization scenarios. Our framework points to three cases that may arise: (a) binding tariff-rate quota, nonprohibitive sanitary and phytosanitary measure; (b) non-binding tariff-rate quota, non-prohibitive sanitary and phytosanitary measure; and (c) non-binding tariff-rate quota, prohibitive sanitary and phytosanitary measure. We then use a Computable General Equilibrium model to examine partial trade liberalization scenarios for these cases, using the ongoing Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership negotiations as our motivation. Our simulations provide a more nuanced analysis of complex trade liberalization and demonstrate the importance of modeling the interplay between these different types of barriers.","[Beckman, Jayson; Arita, Shawn] USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20024 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Beckman, J (通讯作者)，USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20024 USA.",JBeckman@ers.usda.gov,,,,,,,35,24,25,1,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

The shadow prices reflect the trade-off between fertiliser nitrogen and symbiotic nitrogen required to achieve a given quantity of output. Our results reveal considerable technical inefficiency in the production system. The estimated shadow prices vary across farms and are, on average, higher than the reference price for commercial nitrogen.

It also proposes an empirical procedure to trace out the efficiency-equity frontier, where the program is Pareto optimal in the sense that it cannot be improved upon to achieve either higher efficiency or distributional equity without compromising the other. We apply the procedure to the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), the largest PES program in U.S. history, to analyze (a) whether it is possible to improve both the efficiency and the distributional equity of the program, and (b) what the choice made by CRP administrators implies about the political-economic balance. Results reveal that (a) CRP administrators forfeited about 9% of efficiency for an 18%-23% improvement in distributional equity, depending on the equity indicator used, in the eighteenth signup of the CRP; (b) reducing the maximum allowable rental rate for all contracts would improve efficiency at the cost of distributional equity; (c) reducing the maximum county enrollment cap would reduce efficiency without generating much improvement in distributional equity; and (d) the CRP targeting criterion could be redesigned to achieve both higher efficiency and higher distributional equity.","[Wu, Junjie; Yu, Jialing] Oregon State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Oregon State University,"Wu, JJ (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",,,,"U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2012-70002-19388]; NIFA [2012-70002-19388, 578682] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture; NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),"JunJie Wu is a professor and the Emery N.

Using an index of IP protection for plant varieties, we study the effect of stronger intellectual property rights (IPRs) on cereal yields and two different types of cereals: Open-pollinated (wheat) and hybrid (maize). We found that the strengthening of IPRs has a positive effect on productivity of cereals for high- and low-income countries. However, we found no significant effect for middle-income countries. In addition, we found that becoming a member of the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights negatively affects cereal yields. Finally, we found evidence of the existence of nonlinearities in the effect of IPRs on agricultural yields, which confirms a threshold effect of IPRs that also varies for countries of different income level. The findings support the hypothesis that country specificities are important in determining the effect of IPRs and imply that there is no unique system that fits all.","[Campi, Mercedes] Univ Buenos Aires, CONICET, Inst Interdisciplinario Econ Polit Bueno Aires II, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",University of Buenos Aires; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"Campi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Buenos Aires, CONICET, Inst Interdisciplinario Econ Polit Bueno Aires II, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",mercedes.campi@fce.uba.ar,"Campi, Mercedes/U-9158-2019","Campi, Mercedes/0000-0002-2310-7180",,,,,48,7,8,4,51,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

The empirical framework includes econometric models that predict land conversion and crop choices at the parcel level based on expectation and variance of crop revenues, land quality, climate conditions, and physical characteristics at each site. The predictions are then combined with site-specific environmental production functions to determine the effect of revenue insurance on nitrate runoff and leaching, soil water and wind erosion, and carbon sequestration. Results suggest that federal crop insurance has, on average, a small effect on conversions of non-cropland to cropland, and somewhat more significant impacts on crop choice and crop rotation. These changes in cropping systems have, on average, small impacts on agricultural pollution.","[Claassen, Roger] Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [Langpap, Christian; Wu, JunJie] Oregon State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Oregon State University,"Claassen, R (通讯作者)，Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC 20250 USA.",claassen@ers.usda.gov,,"Langpap, Christian/0000-0002-6583-6402","U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2012-70002-19388]; NIFA [2012-70002-19388, 578682] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture; NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),"This article is based upon work supported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture under Award No. 2012-70002-19388.

Financial globalisation, also referred to as financial integration or openness, is understood as an increase in global ties and interdependences caused by capital flows. Potentially, globalisation can bring a lot of benefits, which are manifested in an acceleration of economic growth and decreased fluctuation in consumption, which should further improve the level of overall prosperity.

The authors pay special attention to the effect of potential income differential on this participation. Design/methodology/approach - The data used in this study come from a household survey conducted in Hubei Province. The authors estimate participation equation and income equation, respectively, then introduce potential income differential simulated in participation equation to examine its effect on non-farm participation. Findings - Potential income differential serves as the major pull factor that favors non-farm participation. Education, proximity to a city and specialized commercial farming are crucial in helping rural households to participate in non-farm production; while the land shortage or the labor surplus act as the push factor in non-farm participation. Better quality of land reduces the household's propensity to participate in non-farm activities. Moreover, the income gap between households that participate in non-farm activities and pure farmers is mainly determined by the differences in household characteristics. Originality/value - The authors use the method of switching regression and structural probit to examine the impact of potential income differential on non-farm participation, and simulate the response of the participation probability to the change of potential income differential. The authors also analyze the sources of income gap between non-farm and farm households using Oaxaca decomposition.","[Liu, Yuanxiang] Wuhan Univ, Acad Dev, Wuhan, Peoples R China",Wuhan University,"Liu, YX (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ, Acad Dev, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",ango234@163.com,"zhu, zhu/JDN-0159-2023",,,,,,58,13,15,1,33,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - This study uses a survey featuring a discrete choice experiment and policy simulation. Findings - Overall, crop insurance has positive values to farmers, although preference is heterogeneous based on socioeconomic characteristics and risk position. Policy simulation confirms the roles of liability in strengthening insurance participants' welfare and premium subsidy in encouraging participation. Introducing one more product into the market can accommodate farmers' diverse needs and lead to increases in both aggregated social welfare and participation while maintaining the current level of government expense in subsidy -a potential Pareto improvement. Research limitations/implications - Methodology employed is not the most novel in the choice experiment literature as many of the advances in choice experiment design could not be applied due to the actual condition in rural China and Chinese farmers' capability in understanding the experiment. Practical implications - The results indicate that the current single-product market structure using low liability with high premium subsidies cannot accommodate the diverse needs among farmers. Providing more varieties of liability-subsidy combinations, e.g. a high liability with low premium subsidy insurance product, can substantially improve participants' welfare with little impact to the probability of participation. Originality/value - The authors believe that this is one of the very few studies that that analyze farmers' preferences and willingness to pay for the attributes of crop insurance products. It also shows how crop insurance product design can build upon farmers' choices to achieve a potential Pareto improvement in aggregated social welfare in the context of a fast-developing crop insurance market.","[Ye, Tao; Wang, Ming; Liu, Yangbin; Shi, Peijun] Beijing Normal Univ, Acad Disaster Reduct & Emergency Management, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Hu, Wuyang] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Beijing Normal University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Ye, T (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Acad Disaster Reduct & Emergency Management, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China.",yetao@bnu.edu.cn,,"Shi, Peijun/0000-0002-2968-7331",National Social Science Foundation [16CJY081],National Social Science Foundation,Financial support from National Social Science Foundation under Grant 16CJY081 is highly appreciated.,,53,14,16,7,52,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

The study is based on fundamentalist analysis, where the observed growth is relative to the capital invested because of its use for the generation of future cash flows. As a proxy for the tax cost with ICMS, the variation of the percentage of the tax on the operating income between the observed periods was used, being controlled by the effects of the variation of the revenue, the reinvestment rate, the return on equity and the indebtedness. The results validated the structural model of the research, evidencing the negative influence of the tax cost with the ICMS on the growth of the companies, by affecting the decision making of investment in environments of economic recession and increase of taxes, raising the need to broaden the debate on The Brazilian fiscal policies and their fundamental role in the country's economic development.","[de Almeida Lima, Lauro Vinicio; Martins, Orleans Silva; Machado, Marcia Reis] Univ Fed Paraiba, Cidade Univ,Campus 1, BR-58059900 Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil",Universidade Federal da Paraiba,"Lima, LVD (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Paraiba, Cidade Univ,Campus 1, BR-58059900 Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil.",lvinicio2@gmail.com; orleansmartins@yahoo.com.br; marciareism@hotmail.com,"Martins, Orleans Silva/C-2709-2013; Lima, Lauro/AAA-8533-2021","Martins, Orleans Silva/0000-0002-4966-0347; Machado, Marcia/0000-0003-4081-6058",,,,,39,0,0,0,4,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,OCT-DEC,2017,13.0,4,,,,,300,321,,,,,,22,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,GB6BN,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000429152700016,0

However, aspects concerning the risks and uncertainties in which Brazilian beef cattle farming is involved should be considered, since the other investment options are considered as having greater security and stability.","[da Silva Lemos, Rosane Aparecida] Univ Caxias Sul, Ciencias Contabeis, PPGA, Rua Francisco Getulio Vargas 1130,Cidade Univ, BR-95070560 Caxias Do Sul, RS, Brazil; [Pegorini, Marco Andre] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Econ, Curso Ciencias Contabeis, Rua Francisco Getulio Vargas 1130,Cidade Univ, BR-95070560 Caxias Do Sul, RS, Brazil; [Ventura da Motta, Marta Elisete] Univ Caxias Sul, Ciencias Contabeis, Rua Francisco Getulio Vargas 1130,Cidade Univ, BR-95070560 Caxias Do Sul, RS, Brazil; [Camargo, Maria Emilia] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Engn Prod, PPGA, Rua Francisco Getulio Vargas 1130,Cidade Univ, BR-95070560 Caxias Do Sul, RS, Brazil; [Fernandes, Alice Munz] Univ Caxias do Sul, Ciencias Contabeis, Ave Bento Goncalves 7712,Cidade Univ, BR-91540000 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",Universidade de Caxias do Sul; Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC); Universidade de Caxias do Sul; Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC); Universidade de Caxias do Sul,"Lemos, RAD (通讯作者)，Univ Caxias Sul, Ciencias Contabeis, PPGA, Rua Francisco Getulio Vargas 1130,Cidade Univ, BR-95070560 Caxias Do Sul, RS, Brazil.",rosaneasl@hotmail.COM; mapegori@ucs.br; mevmotta@ucs.br; mariaemiliappga@gmail.com; alicemunz@gmail.com,"Camargo, Maria Emilia/G-2466-2012; Fernandes, Alice Munz/H-4746-2016","Camargo, Maria Emilia/0000-0002-3800-2832; Fernandes, Alice Munz/0000-0003-3023-605X",,,,,46,1,1,0,2,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JUL-SEP,2018,14.0,3,,,,,83,100,,,,,,18,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,GY6CQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448673300006,0

The economic analysis was performed by comparing the revenue obtained in productive activity and costs. The greatest amount invested was in the system of cultivating Piata (R$ 52,494.80), justified by the greater difficulty in implementing this pasture. In both seasons the higher costs were on the cvs. Palisade and Massai due to higher stocking rate.

The author adopted the following methodological procedures in this study: descriptive, bibliographical, field and case study. The selected Dark House configuration meets the requirements of being poultry houses with high use of electricity and with the best profitability among the other types adopted in Brazil. Primary data collection took place in the aviary through daily visits aimed to monitor energy data, record photos, videos, and interviews with managers. It concludes that the main contribution of photovoltaic systems is not only a reduction of the financial expenses for the poultry producer. Another factor was the reduction of the impact to the electricity grid and consequent reduction of consumption of non-renewable natural resources. In this context, the incentive to solar photovoltaic technology deserves attention and needs to be explored in order to reduce excessive waste of natural resources, contributing to reduce the need to import energy. One should also consider the lower pollution that renewable energies cause compared to nonrenewable energies. Therefore, this application becomes feasible, in order to contribute continuously to the environment in question and to the society.","[Arcaro, Luana; Marcelino, Jorge Antonio; Bristot, Vilson Menegon; Guimaraes Filho, Leopoldo Pedro] Univ Extremo Sul Catarinense, Av Univ 1105, BR-88806000 Criciuma, SC, Brazil; [Marcelino, Jorge Antonio] Univ Extremo Sul Catarinense, Engn Econom & Prod, Criciuma, SC, Brazil; [Yamaguchi, Cristina Keiko] Univ Planalto Catarinense, Rua Dr Jorge Bleyer 667, BR-88508618 Lages, SC, Brazil; [Yamaguchi, Cristina Keiko] Univ Alto Vale Rio Peixe, Rua Dr Jorge Bleyer,667,Conta Dinheiro, BR-88508618 Lages, SC, Brazil",Universidade do Extremo Sul Catarinense; Universidade do Extremo Sul Catarinense; Universidade do Planalto Catarinense,"Marcelino, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Extremo Sul Catarinense, Av Univ 1105, BR-88806000 Criciuma, SC, Brazil.;Marcelino, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Extremo Sul Catarinense, Engn Econom & Prod, Criciuma, SC, Brazil.",jam@unesc.net; vilson.bristat@unesc.net; lpg@unesc.net; criskyamaguchi@gmail.com,"Yamaguchi, Cristina Keiko/ABI-5507-2020","Yamaguchi, Cristina Keiko/0000-0001-7073-4307",,,,,29,1,1,0,4,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,OCT-DEC,2018,14.0,4,,,,,53,79,,,,,,27,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,HF6HQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000454336800004,0

According to model estimations, sunflower price was effected only to prices of previous years and 0.1885 years were needed so that the change in sunflower prices could have a significant and considerable effect on sunflower production. Although supports on sunflower farming increased in last years, it still doesn't meet domestic consumption. The price of sunflower is not alone encouraging tools for increasing the amount of production. Currently, Turkey is a net importer and seems to be continue in the near future in sunflower production.

Generally speaking, the consensus between these researchers suggests that studies and methodologies related to Financial Accounting receive a greater emphasis, while a lesser share is allotted to those focused on Managerial and Cost topics. Moreover, despite the importance of Cost Accounting as a field of research, it remains apparent that the same is often not reflected in the space allotted to it in leading Accounting Journals. Thus, this paper aims to identify and document in the Accounting Journals present at the ISI Web of Science base of Thomson Reuters Scientific, if specific cost papers are published and associate them with the 7 (seven) thematic areas defined by the main Brazilian Congress of the area, the Brazilian Congress of Costs (CBC). Toward this end, a total of 4,587 articles published over seven years (2010-2016) were surveyed which lead to the identification of 711 (15%) studies on topics related to Cost Accounting, though just 59 (1%) of these fit within the CBC's research fields. These results indicate that the Cost Accounting topic of foremost importance during the years under analysis is cost behavior, with studies covering a range of matters including regulation, corporate governance, differences between countries and industries, demand and risk, projections, conservatism, and managerial decision-making. Further, these findings in some ways corroborate the view held by managerial accounting researchers in that priority is given in the leading international Accounting journals to works on other topics.","[Dias Maragno, Lucas Martins; de Carvalho, Alessanderson Jaco; Minatti Ferreira, Denize Demarche; Borba, Jose Alonso] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Campus Univ, BR-88040900 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC),"Maragno, LMD (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Campus Univ, BR-88040900 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.",lucasmaragno@hotmail.com; alessanderson.carvalho@hotmail.com; denize.minatti@ufsc.br; j.alonso@ufsc.br,,"Jaco de Carvalho, Alessanderson/0000-0003-2160-4017",,,,,86,0,0,3,23,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JUL-SEP,2017,13.0,3,,,,,254,286,,,,,,33,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,FQ0BO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418014600014,0

Therefore, the positive impact of accounting conservatism on the credit availability of agricultural companies is stronger than the impact of accounting conservatism on the credit availability of non-agricultural ones. The empirical results are robust when we eliminate the outliers of dependent variable or control the heteroscedasticity of regression.","[Li, Bin; Liu, Yang] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Sch Econ & Management, 15 Bei San Huan Dong Lu, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Yang, David C.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Shidler Coll Business, 2404 Maile Way, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Xu, Xuegao] Jiangsu Prov Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Econ & Dev, 50 Zhong Ling St, Nanjing 210014, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Beijing University of Chemical Technology; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences,"Xu, XG (通讯作者)，Jiangsu Prov Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Econ & Dev, 50 Zhong Ling St, Nanjing 210014, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",libin@mail.buct.edu.cn; 531547328@qq.com; yangd@hawaii.edu; xuxuegaoxxg@163.com,"Li, Bin/ADE-2602-2022","Li, Bin/0000-0002-7813-6691",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71361140369]; Social Science Foundation of Beijing [15JGC145]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [BUCTRC201512]; State Scholarship Fund (CSC) [201606885042],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Social Science Foundation of Beijing; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); State Scholarship Fund (CSC),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71361140369), the Social Science Foundation of Beijing (Grant No. 15JGC145), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. BUCTRC201512) and the State Scholarship Fund (CSC No. 201606885042).",,39,2,2,2,13,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JUL-SEP,2017,13.0,3,,,,,44,61,,,,,,18,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,FQ0BO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418014600004,0

A possible alternative to the treatment of this waste is the implantation of tubular biodigesters for the generation of electric energy from the pig residues, which also generates byproducts such as biogas and generating carbon credits. The paper analyzed the economic viability of such types of projects based on a case study of the Piglandia Farm, located in MG, Brazil. Based on the main indicators of viability, such as net present value and internal rate of return, the project of implementation of biodigester was found to be highly viable. Aiming to incorporate risk in this type of study, it was performed a Monte Carlo simulation using the @Risk Software to improve decision making under risky conditions. The results indicate that even under conditions of risk, the project remained viable. As a suggestion of Policy, projects of this nature should be stimulated by public agencies and banks of development, for in addition to contributing to the maintenance of natural resources, if well dimensioned, they can be highly profitable to the investors.","[Cirino, Jader Fernandes; Pache de Faria, Leonardo Viana] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Econ, Ave Purdue S-N,Campus Univ, BR-36570900 Vicosa, MG, Brazil; [Marques Ferreira, Marco Aurelio] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Adm & Contabilidade, Ave Purdue S-N,Campus Univ, BR-36570900 Vicosa, MG, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Vicosa; Universidade Federal de Vicosa,"Cirino, JF (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Econ, Ave Purdue S-N,Campus Univ, BR-36570900 Vicosa, MG, Brazil.",jader.cirino@ufv.br; marcoaurelio@ufv.br; leonardo.pache@ufv.br,"Ferreira, Marco A.M/A-7026-2013",,,,,,34,2,2,1,21,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,APR,2017,13.0,,,,SI,,155,182,,,,,,28,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,FB4DZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406093000008,0

Structured interviews were used to collect data from 43 members and 65 non-members of the DCBA by random sampling. The members had higher socio-economic status compared to the non-members in terms of farmers' personal characteristics and farm structure. Some of these factors affected the sustainability of innovations which were measured as the Innovation Sustainability Index (ISI) and calculated by multiplying the number of innovations with their years of adoption. Thus, partial correlation coefficient between ISI and some variables (controlled by the DCBA membership) was calculated. The result showed that the years of formal education, agricultural information score, agricultural income, milk yield, size of feed crops and number of European breeds were positively correlated with ISI. Positive association between ISI and higher socio-economic status emphasizes the importance of DCBA membership in adopting and sustaining innovations.","[Demiryurek, Kursat; Abaci, Nur Ilkay] Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, TR-55139 Samsun, Turkey; [Abaci, Samet Hasan; Atasever, Sava; Erdem, Huseyin] Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Anim Sci, TR-55139 Samsun, Turkey",Ondokuz Mayis University; Ondokuz Mayis University,"Abaci, NI (通讯作者)，Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, TR-55139 Samsun, Turkey.",kursatd@omu.edu.tr; ilkay.sonmez@omu.edu.tr; samet.abaci@omu.edu.tr; satasev@omu.edu.tr; hserdem@omu.edu.tr,"Abaci, Samet Hasan/GPX-7921-2022; Demiryurek, Kursat/AAD-5711-2022; Atasever, Savaş/IYJ-1316-2023","Abaci, Samet Hasan/0000-0002-1341-4056; Demiryurek, Kursat/0000-0002-6193-9957;",,,,,21,0,0,0,8,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,APR-JUN,2017,13.0,2,,,,,35,44,,,,,,10,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,FP1NU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417381200004,0

More and more companies focus on the performance of the supply chain instead of their own performance. Relatively short agricultural products shelf life leads to low profit. According to the characteristics of the online agricultural products logistics, the way how to control inventory cost and transportation cost in order to increase profits has become a serious and urgently solved problem. In order to solve the shortage of the practical application of the VMI mode under online shopping environment, the paper makes the combination of the VMI and 3PL. Firstly, the inventory routing model of a three-level distribution system with a vendor, a third party logistics company and multiple geographically dispersed retailers based on VMI-3PL and fixed partition policies is built.

Before analyzing the competitiveness, the production and trade performance of the fruit products had been investigated. The growth in fruit production provides the foundation of export. The trade volume of export and import expanded greatly during the time period. China had been in the state of trade surplus for fruit products in the last seventeen years. The Revealed Asymmetric Comparative Advantage (RSCA) index was used to analyze the competitiveness of fruit products in different levels. The result showed that most of the fruit products experienced revealed comparative disadvantages in the global market. As the time passing by, the competitiveness of the fruit products became worse and worse. The results of the stability test found that the level of the comparative advantage of the fruit products had been away from the level of the initial time.

The bulk of the data were collected from randomly selected 133 farms and cluster analysis was performed to select similar farms. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) was used to estimate efficiency scores. Opportunity cost of conversion was calculated by comparing the net revenue of eco-friendly farming system and conventional one. Research results showed that the mean technical, allocative and cost efficiencies of participant farms were lower than non-participant ones. The opportunity cost of conversion eco-friendly farming and environmental subsidies paid by government were (sic)468,98 and (sic)500,87 per hectare, respectively, indicated that subsidies met the loss sourced from conversion in the research area. It was clear based on research findings that farmers would increase their technical competence, if they improved their skills via participating training and extension programs. Since the opportunity cost of the conversion was the main drivers of farmers' satisfaction from eco-friendly farming system, increasing the number of participants and continuing this support policy for environmental protection considering the balance between loss and subsidy may increase the succeed to protect of human health, soil and water resource protection.","[Yildirim, Cagatay; Ceyhan, Vedat; Turkten, Hatice] Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Fac Agr, TR-55139 Samsun, Turkey; [Atis, Ela; Salali, H.

The main aim of the research is to identify the opportunity and efficiency of replacing cereals with energy crops by a multilevel approach. In this context, gross margins, profit, cost per unit, variable and material costs and profit margin are calculated for energy crops and compared with equivalent outputs from grain production: corn, wheat, and barley. The results indicate that energy crops are more efficient than grain crops in cultivation and generating revenues which influence the agricultural paradigm shifting under these conditions. Threshold prices and yields are calculated for underpinning the decision of replacing grains with energy crops. The research is designed as a framework in helping farmers in decision making process regarding the choices on the structure of production, assuming that they will switch to energy crops only if expected returns from the energy crops are higher than returns from growing conventional crops.","[Andrei, Jean] Petr Gas Univ Ploiesti, Fac Econ Sci, B Dul Bucuresti 39, Ploiesti, Prahova, Romania; [Andreea, Ion Raluca] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Agrifood & Environm Econ, 6 Piata Romana, Bucharest 010374, Romania",Oil & Gas University of Ploiesti; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Andrei, J (通讯作者)，Petr Gas Univ Ploiesti, Fac Econ Sci, B Dul Bucuresti 39, Ploiesti, Prahova, Romania.",andrei_jeanvasile@yahoo.com; raluca.ion@eam.ase.ro,"Ion, Raluca Andreea/B-6327-2016; Jean-Vasile, Andrei/A-5270-2011","Jean-Vasile, Andrei/0000-0002-8332-6537",,,,,38,6,6,0,5,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JUL-SEP,2018,14.0,3,,,,,61,82,,,,,,22,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,GY6CQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448673300005,0

This study expands the literature when analyzing whether the IFRS adoption provided a reduction on the cost of debt in private firms from the Brazilian sugarcane industry. For that, Fixed-Effects regressions was used through a unique, hand-collected, database of 31 private firms from 1998 to 2015. The results obtained, after robustness checks and control for firm financial characteristics, indicates that after the IFRS adoption, the cost of debt increased significantly, contradicting therefore the theoretical assumptions indicated previously by studies with listed companies. Thus, the evidence suggests that the effects of adopting the international standards may be more restricted to public companies, as well as in countries with greater enforcement. Therefore, this article contributes to the literature by providing a detailed investigation of the IFRS adoption for private firms in an agroindustry sector.","[Silva Manoel, Aviner Augusto; Augusto Eca, Jai Paulo] Univ Sao Paulo, FEA RP, Fac Econ Adm & Contabilidade Ribeirao Preto, Programa Controladoria & Contabilidade, Av Bandeirantes,3900 FEA RP, BR-14040905 Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil; [da Costa Moraes, Marcelo Botelho] Univ Sao Paulo, FEA RP, Fac Econ Adm & Contabilidade Ribeirao Preto, Dept Contabilidade, Av Bandeirantes 3900,FEA RP Bloco C2 Sala 39, BR-14040905 Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil; [Rezende, Amaury Jose] Univ Sao Paulo, FEA RP, Fac Econ Adm & Contabilidade Ribeirao Preto, Dept Contabilidade, Av Bandeirantes,3900 FEA RP Bloco C1 Sala 03, BR-14040905 Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Manoel, AAS (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, FEA RP, Fac Econ Adm & Contabilidade Ribeirao Preto, Programa Controladoria & Contabilidade, Av Bandeirantes,3900 FEA RP, BR-14040905 Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.",aviner@usp.br; mbotelho@usp.br; joaopauloeca@usp.br; amauryi@usp.br,"rezende, amaury José/C-8270-2011; Eca, J.

Reducing greenhouse gas emissions and carbon sequestration generate credits that can be traded through financial returns. In view of this, the following problem arose: Can carbon credits stimulate change in the agricultural production model so that there is a reduction in emissions and an increase in carbon sequestration in rural areas? In addition to the financial return for the commercialization of credits, low-carbon agriculture can make use of indirect benefits such as subsidized interest financing lines and access to more demanding markets. The methodology used was the exploratory and bibliographical research by obtaining data on carbon credits and gas emissions. From this, an analysis was developed applying the qualitative and quantitative approach, measuring the financial value of the carbon credits generated in agriculture. Through these analyzes, it was possible to conclude that the socio-environmental actions resulting from the agricultural activity produce carbon credits that can be commercialized by the farmer.","[Andrade, Marcos; Besen, Fabiola Graciele; de Araujo, Tercio Vieira] Unioeste Univ Estadual Oeste Parana, Desenvolvimento Rural Sustentavel UNIOESTE, Av Tarquinio Joslin dos Santos 1300, BR-85870650 Foz Do Iguacu, PR, Brazil; [Feiden, Armin] Unioeste Univ Estadual Oeste Parana, UNESP, Agron, Rua Pernambuco 1777, BR-85960000 Marechal Candido Rodondo, PR, Brazil; [Zonin, Wilson Joao] Unioeste Univ Estadual Oeste Parana, Meio Ambiente & Desenvolvimento UFPR, Rua Pernambuco 1777, BR-85960000 Marechal Candido Rodondo, PR, Brazil",Universidade Estadual do Oeste do Parana; Universidade Estadual do Oeste do Parana; Universidade Estadual Paulista; Universidade Estadual do Oeste do Parana,"Andrade, M (通讯作者)，Unioeste Univ Estadual Oeste Parana, Desenvolvimento Rural Sustentavel UNIOESTE, Av Tarquinio Joslin dos Santos 1300, BR-85870650 Foz Do Iguacu, PR, Brazil.",marcos.consultor@hotmail.com; armin.feiden@gmail.com; wzonin@yahoo.com.br; fabiolagracielebesen@gmail.com; professortercio@hotmail.com,,,,,,,39,0,0,1,18,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JUL-SEP,2018,14.0,3,,,,,191,213,,,,,,23,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,GY6CQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448673300011,0

The production price of corn is changing every year and depends on the corn yields and input costs. Being familiar with the correlation between production price and cash price provides the forecast of corn price according to the forecast of the production price trends. The accurate forecast in price trends enables agricultural producers to sell their products at the right time, corn purchasers to purchase at the best prices, speculators on commodity exchanges to make high profits, etc. Furthermore, the results in corn production expressed in a relative relationship, i.e. the ratio between the production costs and incomes during one production year are shown in the presented analyses, avoiding on that way the inflation effects, which would otherwise be a significant element in 20 years study. Farmers can use the analyses in comparing their results in the production of corn with the USA average and thereby they can determine their competitiveness. The conducted analyses is showing that a production price has a high impact on the market price creation, so according to the work results, by bringing closer market prices to variable costs of production per product units, a further decline in price meets the resistance caused by unwillingness of farmers to sell a product by a price close to achieved variable costs, but they prefer to store a product and postpone sale and thereby reduce supply and prevent further decline of prices. In case that prices increase significantly over the production cost, farmers make profit and supply of cereals grows and slows down further increase in prices. There was determined high correlation between operating costs per bushel and price (USD dollars per bushel at harvest), as well as total costs per bushel and price (USD dollars per bushel at harvest), regarding that an indicator of operating cost per bushel and price (USD dollars per bushel at harvest) has a higher degree of correlation and lower variability.","[Kovacevic, Vlado; Jelocnik, Marko; Subic, Jonel] Inst Agr Econ, Volgina St 15, Belgrade 11060, Serbia; [Zekic, Vladislav; Milic, Dragan] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Agr, Dositeja Obradoviea Sq 8, Novi Sad, Serbia; [Zubovic, Jovan] Inst Econ Sci, Zmaj Jovina St 12, Belgrade 11000, Serbia",University of Novi Sad; Institute of Economic Sciences,"Milic, D (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Fac Agr, Dositeja Obradoviea Sq 8, Novi Sad, Serbia.",kovacevic_vlado@yahoo.com; marko_j@iep.bg.ac.rs; jonel_@iep.bg.ac.rs; zekic@polj.uns.ac.rs; mdragan@polj.uns.ac.rs; jovan.zubovic@iep.bg.ac.rs,"Jelocnik, Marko/AAK-5535-2021; Kovcevic, Vlado/ABA-6353-2020; Zubović, Jovan/L-6011-2019","Jelocnik, Marko/0000-0003-4875-1789; Zubović, Jovan/0000-0002-1717-2066; Kovacevic, Vlado/0000-0002-2902-6496; Subic, Jonel/0000-0003-1342-1325","Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia [III 46006, 179015]","Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia","Paper is a part of project III 46006 and 179015, funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia, for the project period 2011-2017.

Estimation of the influence of independent variables on the profitability in agricultural industries was realized by panel data technique. The results show that the profitability determinants of agricultural enterprises in Hungary and Romania are the same. In these countries, the profitability of agricultural enterprises are positively affected by leverage, quick ratio, growth, and lagged profitability. Furthermore, size and fixed assets to total assets ratios are negatively related to the profitability in these countries. On the other side, significant profitability determinants in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina have only positive influence. In both of these countries, the profitability of agricultural enterprises are affected positively by quick ratio, lagged profitability and growth, while in Bosnia and Herzegovina, one more determinant, leverage, is significant.

This methodology consists of collection of technical parameters, production costs and other economic information by expert panels with value chain agents. Variables are obtained through consensus among panel participants considering the typical farm approach (TFA). All collected data are presented to producers in order to improve comprehension about their performance. A benefit of this methodology includes highly reliable data because information is provided by a representative sample of producers that confirm it in a consensus process. Moreover, data collection costs are low in comparison to individual interviews or survey methods. Continuous updating of inputs prices and the high level of participation of producers are other assets of this method. Despite its effectiveness the method presents some challenges including: (a) the heterogeneity of producer profiles and consequent difficulty in standardizing data, (b) the logistic requirements related to organization of meetings, and (c) mobilization of producers and other panel participants in order to assure their representative presence in the meeting.","[Pedroza Filho, Manoel Xavier; Oeda Rodrigues, Ana Paula; Rezende, Fabricio Pereira; Valladao Flores, Roberto Manolio; Pizarro Munoz, Andrea Elena; Barroso, Renata Melon] Embrapa Pesca & Aquicultura, Prolongamento Ave NS 10,Cruzamento Com Ave LO 18, BR-77008900 Palmas, TO, Brazil",Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA),"Pedroza, MX (通讯作者)，Embrapa Pesca & Aquicultura, Prolongamento Ave NS 10,Cruzamento Com Ave LO 18, BR-77008900 Palmas, TO, Brazil.",manoel.pedroza@embrapa.br; anapaula.rodrigues@embrapa.br; fabricio.rezende@embrapa.br; roberto.valladao@embrapa.br; andrea.munoz@embrapa.br; renata.barroso@embrapa.br,"Pedroza, Manoel/ABA-5762-2020; Muñoz, Ana/JCN-6031-2023; Muñoz, Andrea/GVS-8174-2022","Melon Barroso Bertolini, Renata/0000-0002-3859-9253",,,,,30,1,2,0,3,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JAN-MAR,2017,13.0,1,,,,,294,314,,,,,,21,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,ET6CP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000400378600012,0

A qualitative methodology was followed, based on a normative analysis and a literature review of scientific articles on the subject. We found that several authors defend the application of the cost criterion in the measurement of these assets, given the difficulties of calculating fair value in the absence of active markets for certain assets. However, current Portuguese accounting standardization presents fair value (net of selling costs) as a criterion to be applied in the measurement of this type of elements, with cost being a criterion to be applied only exceptionally, in the case of biological assets whose fair value cannot be reliably determinable. Regarding the cost management of agricultural activity, we conclude that, due to the lack of knowledge and / or training and the difficulty of its application, taking into account the risk and uncertainty of this activity, many agricultural managers do not make an adequate management of the costs.","[Rodrigues Quesado, Patricia] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Ciencias Econ & Empresariais, Santiago De Compostela, Spain; [Rodrigues Quesado, Patricia; Ribeiro da Silva, Maria de Lurdes; Catarino Rua, Susana] Inst Politecn Cavado & Ave, Escola Super Gestao, P-4750810 Barcelos, Portugal; [Ribeiro da Silva, Maria de Lurdes; Catarino Rua, Susana] Univ Vigo, Ciencias Econ & Empresariais, Vigo, Spain",Universidade de Santiago de Compostela; Instituto Politecnico do Cavado e do Ave - IPCA; Universidade de Vigo,"Quesado, PR (通讯作者)，Univ Santiago de Compostela, Ciencias Econ & Empresariais, Santiago De Compostela, Spain.;Quesado, PR (通讯作者)，Inst Politecn Cavado & Ave, Escola Super Gestao, P-4750810 Barcelos, Portugal.",pquesado@ipca.pt; Isilva@ipca.pt; srua@ipca.pt,"Quesado, Patrícia Rodrigues/AAD-1543-2021","Quesado, Patricia/0000-0002-3537-2483",,,,,41,3,4,4,19,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,OCT-DEC,2018,14.0,4,,,,,241,258,,,,,,18,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,HF6HQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000454336800012,0

In order to find the explanatory variables of efficiency, the econometric model Tobit was used. The results showed an average efficiency of 80% among the producers. As for the inefficient properties, 64% obtained increasing returns, being able to expand the production obtained.

The data was retrieved from 462 buffalo breeders via face to face survey from Samsun, istanbul, Diyarbakir, Mus, Tokat, Afyonkarahisar and Bitlis provinces of Turkey for 2014 production season, where buffalo husbandry is a prominent agricultural activity. The analysis of profitability was made to evaluate technical efficiency of buffalo husbandry and direct field-based supporting schemes. The significant fields that policymakers should focus on were determined prior to determination of factors affecting producers' attitudes towards buffalo husbandry. These are producers' awareness and level of satisfaction, use of technology, supporting policies, marketing operations, producer organisations, local leadership, and income sustainability, the field of operation and level of technical knowledge. The positive and statistically significant relationship was determined between supporting policies factor reflecting producer attitudes and relative profitability. Accordingly, it was understood that appreciation in supports to the sector appeared to affect profitability positively. Another significant finding was the existing positive relationships between profitability and lactation period (months), amount of concentrated feed (kg/buffalo), productive information level of the breeder, existing buffalo stock and indebtedness situation of the breeder. The geographic variation of buffalo husbandry demonstrated that breeding and market conditions are essential and there are significant relationships between buffalo husbandry and producer organisations as well as development level of marketing organisations.","[Akpinar, Metin Goksel; Tascioglu, Yavuz] Akdeniz Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Fac Agr, Antalya, Turkey; [Gul, Mevlut; Karli, Bahri; Bozkurt, Yalcin] Suleyman Demirel Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Fac Agr, TR-32260 Isparta, Turkey; [Gul, Mevlut; Karli, Bahri; Bozkurt, Yalcin] Suleyman Demirel Univ, Dept Anim Sci, Fac Agr, TR-32260 Isparta, Turkey",Akdeniz University; Suleyman Demirel University; Suleyman Demirel University,"Akpinar, MG (通讯作者)，Akdeniz Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Fac Agr, Antalya, Turkey.",mgoksel@akdeniz.edu.tr; mevlutgul@sdu.edu.tr; ytascioglu@akdeniz.edu.tr; bahriikarli@sdu.edu.tr; yalcinbozkurt@sdu.edu.tr,"Taşcıoğlu, Yavuz/C-6967-2016; Gül, Mevlüt/J-1711-2014","Taşcıoğlu, Yavuz/0000-0002-8989-3145; Gül, Mevlüt/0000-0002-0147-7228",TUBITAK [1130309],TUBITAK(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)),This study was a part of our research project.

Results of the study reveal that peach farmers displayed much variability in technical efficiency ranging from 64% to 95% with a mean technical efficiency of 81%, which suggested a substantial 19% of potential output can be recovered by removing inefficiency. For an agriculture based country like Pakistan, this gain could help increase income and ensure a better livelihood for the farmers. The results suggest that farmers' age, experience, education, membership, cellphone usage, livestock ownership, credit access, extension services, the role of non-government organization and soil quality perception have a positive influence on technical efficiency. In contrast, off-farm income, household size, price volatility perception, natural disaster risk perception, and weather shocks awareness have a negative influence on technical efficiency. Hence, the study proposed that technical efficiency of peach farmers can be increased by an appropriate choice of input combinations, improving the present level of inefficiency determinants and elimination of errors in the production process through efficient management practices.","[Ullah, Arif; Zheng, Shaofeng] Northwest Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Econ & Management, 3 Taicheng Rd, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Khan, Dilawar] Kohat Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Kohat 26000, Khyber Pakhtunk, Pakistan",Northwest A&F University - China; Kohat University of Science & Technology,"Zheng, SF (通讯作者)，Northwest Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Econ & Management, 3 Taicheng Rd, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",arifecon@yahoo.com; dilawarmkd@yahoo.com; zsfeng@nwafu.edu.cn,"Ullah, Arif/S-6044-2019; Khan, Dilawar/K-3683-2019","Ullah, Arif/0000-0002-6920-3848;",Northwest AAMP;F University of China [Z109021414],Northwest AAMP;F University of China,The research was funded by study on effectiveness and operational mechanism based on self-organizational control of regional fruit quality.

Six meetings were held with the farmers, in which it was possible to identify that the main problems faced are directly related to lack of family succession and inexistence of financial control of costs. As an intervention, was proposed a cost control for each activity developed on the farm and, from this control, possible alternatives for the farm management were identified. Among them, the grain cultivation presented a higher financial return, allowing its continuation.

The main material of this study consists of primary data obtained through survey method from 170 farms, which either implement or do not implement the good agricultural practices, in citrus cultivating in Adana. According to the findings, unit production costs are higher in farms implementing GAP. Accordingly, the relative profitability values are higher compared to the farms which implement GAP. The relative profit in GAP implementing farms involved in lemon cultivating is 1.15 while it is 1.22 in farms which do not implement GAP; and it is 1.19 in mandarin cultivating farms which do and do not implement GAP. It was found out that the citrus cultivating was profitable in both forms of cultivating. The reasons why profitability is higher in farms which do not implement GAP are productivity, sales price and additional costs of implementing GAP.

The model is the result of a study of soybean producers in organic and conventional production systems. Both technical and cost efficiency are higher for organic producers (0.95 and 0.77, respectively) than for conventional farmers (0.69 and 0.41, respectively). Tobit models have identified additional sources of technical and cost inefficiency. Factors as farm size, production system, share of family labour, share of rented land, land fragmentation affect technical and cost efficiency. Level of education of farm managers, soil analysis and seed type have a statistically significant impact on technical efficiency, while participation in the project affects cost efficiency. In addition, the increased demand for non GMO conventional and organic soybean, primarily from EU countries, represents the development potential of the soybean producers in Serbia.","[Rade, Popovic; Kleut, Zana; Dokic, Danilo] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ Subot, Segedinski Put 9-11, Subotica, Serbia",University of Novi Sad,"Rade, P (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ Subot, Segedinski Put 9-11, Subotica, Serbia.",ponovicr@ef.uns.ac.rs; zana.kieut@ef.uns.ac.rs; danilo.djokic@ef.uns.ac.rs,"Đokić, Danilo/ADB-1486-2022; Jurjević, Žana/AAD-5030-2020","Đokić, Danilo/0000-0002-7962-4910; Jurjevic, Zana/0000-0002-3809-7923; Popovic, Rade/0000-0002-0879-1340",German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development; Donau Soja organization,German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development; Donau Soja organization,"The authors are grateful to German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, Donau Soja organization and all lead executing agencies in the project, for their support.

A survey was undertaken covering 181 enterprises identified using the stratified sampling method. The phenomenon of sustainable income was defined in order to determine the economic sustainability of agricultural enterprises. The study results, based on the average, suggest that sustainable income can be achieved without public support. However, the level of sustainable income differs by enterprise size group. It was observed that enterprises in the first and second groups (0-50 da, 51-150 da) are not economically sustainable despite public support. However, some enterprises that have applied intensive farming and livestock production did achieve a sustainable income level. Rural industry must be promoted and demand created, to ensure economic sustainability and prevent socio-economic problems by including livestock production activities, utilizing economies of scale, raising awareness of organizational behavior, developing products suitable for the region's ecology and economic structure with contract production and dissemination of alternative income-generating production activities.","[Arisoy, Hasan; Bayramoglu, Zeki; Karakayaci, Zuhal; Oguz, Cennet] Selcuk Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, TR-42075 Selcuklu Konya, Turkey",Selcuk University,"Arisoy, H (通讯作者)，Selcuk Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, TR-42075 Selcuklu Konya, Turkey.",arisoy@selcuk.edu.tr,"Bayramoglu, Zeki/AAS-5972-2021; ARISOY, HASAN/CAF-1214-2022; OGUZ, Cennet/ADY-2531-2022; Karakayaci, Zuhal/ABK-9499-2022","Bayramoglu, Zeki/0000-0003-3258-3848; ARISOY, HASAN/0000-0002-5956-6055; OGUZ, Cennet/0000-0001-7846-4866; Karakayaci, Zuhal/0000-0003-2933-5608",Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey [113K455],Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)),The data for this study were obtained from the project (113K455) under the name of The Effect of Agricultural Support on the Economic Sustainability of Agricultural Enterprises in Turkey: The Case of Konya Province supported by The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey.,,65,1,1,0,15,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JUL-SEP,2017,13.0,3,,,,,233,253,,,,,,21,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,FQ0BO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418014600013,0

As LED is a new technology, there is a shortage of results regarding the economic feasibility of a LED lighting system in broiler chicken production especially considering that the price of this light source is yet high. Therefore, this research aimed to analyze the economic feasibility if LED lighting in broiler chicken production. A case study was carried out comparing the energy consumption of two dark houses systems being one with FCL lighting, and the other using LED lighting. Both houses had the same structural characteristics and production capability. The following indicators were calculated using deterministic investments analysis: Reduction in Lamp Price (TRPL), Net Present Value (NPV), Annual Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Profitability Index (IL), and Profitability Rate (TR). The cash flows and the initial cost of the project using LED lamps were evaluated, and their indicators were found. The results suggest the unfeasibility of implementing LED lighting in dark house considering the current LED lamp values. If the cost of this input is reduced by approximately 35%, LED lighting might be a feasible alternative in the production of broiler chickens, as the results indicate that the use of the light emitting diode saved 72% of kWh, when compared to the use of the CFL.","[da Rosa, Carolina Obregao; da Costa, Jaqueline Severino] UFGD, Fac Ciencias Contaveis Econ & Adm, FACE, Rod Dourados Itahum,Km 12, BR-79804970 Dourados, MS, Brazil; [Garcia, Rodrigo Garofallo; Naas, Irenilza de Alencar] UFGD, FCA, Rod Dourados Itahum,Km 12, BR-79804970 Dourados, MS, Brazil; [da Silva Lima, Nilsa Duarte] Univ Estadual Campinas UNICAMP, FEAGRI, Fac Engn Agr, Ave Candido Rondon 501, BR-13083875 Campinas, SP, Brazil",Universidade Federal da Grande Dourados; Universidade Federal da Grande Dourados; Universidade Estadual de Campinas,"da Rosa, CO (通讯作者)，UFGD, Fac Ciencias Contaveis Econ & Adm, FACE, Rod Dourados Itahum,Km 12, BR-79804970 Dourados, MS, Brazil.",carolinaobregao@ufgd.edu.br; rodrigogarcia@ufgd.edu.br; jaquelinecosta@ufgd.edu.br; irenilza@gmail.com; nilsa.lima@feagri.unicamp.br,"Nääs, Irenilza/L-1807-2019; Garcia, Rodrigo Garofallo/C-7846-2015; Lima, Nilsa Duarte da Silva/R-4860-2016; da Costa, Jaqueline Severino/AAR-4461-2020","Nääs, Irenilza/0000-0003-0663-9377; Garcia, Rodrigo Garofallo/0000-0002-4978-9386; Lima, Nilsa Duarte da Silva/0000-0002-1284-7810; Costa, Jaqueline Severino da/0000-0002-8822-4687",,,,,25,3,3,0,7,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,APR,2017,13.0,,,,SI,,2,19,,,,,,18,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,FB4DZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406093000002,0

Located in the East Mediterranean zone of the country's south, the Hatay province has succeeded in being one of the leading cities of Turkey with regards to the production and trade as a result of the consideration it has given on the establishment of new olive groves in recent years. According to the TSI data, Hatay province supplies 6.83% of oil olive production area and 8,98% of the olive oil production. The share of the total farmland in the province of olive fields is 19%. According to 2016 data, whereas in terms of olive oil support 72 million TL is paid to the manufacturers in Turkey, the nationwide share of the Hatay province is 11,23%. As of the same year, within the variation support in the province in 2016, the share of the support for olive oil has been 4,36%. Olives and olive oil trade have brought a distinct vitality in the economy of the province. According to 2014 data, 11,74% out of Turkey's total olive and olive oil export has been achieved in Hatay province. In this study, the economic analysis of olive oil production has been made in irriguous and dry conditions in Hatay province. In the study, according to the 2016 data, while gross profit in oil olive produced in irriguous conditions is 711,30 ETL/da, this value is estimated as 593,32 TL/da in dry conditions. In the study, it has been determined that the supports given for the oil olive production has a significant role on both increasing the gross profit and decreasing the product costs. Whereas the gross profit value showed an increase of 21,40% in enterprises producing oil olive in dry conditions in the province of Hatay when variance support and fuel-fertilizer support were added, this increase was able to reach a level of 22,35% in irriguous conditions. In the condition where the other supports (when organic production is favoured instead of good farming practices -rehabilitation of traditional olive gardens and biological -biotechnical combat supports), given by the MFAL, are added to these supports, it is could be seen that the the increase in gross profit values provided by the oil olive production in irriguous and dry conditions could reach the level 50%. In order to increase the level of income of the producers in the research area; it is needed that the use of modern cultivation techniques should be concentrated and manufacturers should continually be supported financially in this way, new varieties should be developed which will adopt easily to the province conditions that will indicate at a higher level of reaction to especially irrigation and fertilizer inputs and province specific kinds of olives should be protected.","[Semerci, Arif] Canakkale Onsekiz Mart Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Fac Agr, POB 17100, Canakkale, Turkey",Canakkale Onsekiz Mart University,"Semerci, A (通讯作者)，Canakkale Onsekiz Mart Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Fac Agr, POB 17100, Canakkale, Turkey.",arifsemerci69@gmail.com,"Semerci, Arif/HTL-3968-2023","Semerci, Arif/0000-0003-0893-3748",MFAL Hatay Provincial Directorate; Hatay Olive Culture Research Institute Directorate,MFAL Hatay Provincial Directorate; Hatay Olive Culture Research Institute Directorate,This study has been prepared with the support provided by MFAL Hatay Provincial Directorate and Hatay Olive Culture Research Institute Directorate.,,31,3,3,0,4,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,APR-JUN,2018,14.0,2,,,,,237,259,,,,,,23,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,GI7YN,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000434718700013,0

The data collected from 60 Business Incubations in India and PLS has been used for thorough analysis for the proposed model with relating Agri-business CSFs with Business performance. The results of Structural Equation modeling highlight that the outcome of business performance varies significantly with Facilities, Networking, and Services. Managerial Skills mediate between Assessment and Business Incubation performance. MI: Clear and Unambiguous mission has also emerged as significant CSF influencing BI performance in agri-business. Entry and Exit policy has a lower path coefficient, but it is significant.

The methodology used in the research is characterized as comparative case studies, descriptive in nature and qualitative data approach. The study of the cases occurred in three rural farms that produce milk, located in the west of Santa Catarina, one in the traditional management system (pasture in the form of pickets / grazing), one in the free stall system and another in the system Of semi containment (compost barn). Data collection took place from June to July 2017, with the completion of spreadsheets, containing data on fixed assets, sales revenue, production costs and productivity. From the analysis of the data, it was verified that the system free stall provides a slight margin of profit in the liter of milk produced, to the detriment of the other chains. It is worth noting that the quantity of milk produced by both the stall and compost barn system does not currently determine a difference in the quoted chains of a higher intake per liter, which may be due to the fact that production is not at its maximum capacity. It is concluded that the free stall management system provides a better economic result for dairy activity, but with a higher production structure than the other properties analyzed in this research.","[Dalchiavon, Ariberto] Univ Comunitaria Reg Chapeco SC, Rua Sao Joao Batista,82 D, Chapeco, SC, Brazil; [Heberle, Eder Luiz] Univ Comunitaria Reg Chapeco SC, Rua Matriz 555, Itapiranga, SC, Brazil; [Bracht Fank, Denise Rose] Univ Comunitaria Reg Chapeco SC, Rua Carlos Kummer 111, Itapiranga, SC, Brazil; [Zanin, Antonio] Univ Comunitaria Reg Chapeco SC, Rua Eurico Gaspar Dutra,859E, Chapeco, SC, Brazil; [Wernk, Rodney] Univ Comunitaria Reg Chapeco SC, Av Senador Atilio Fontana,591-E, Chapeco, SC, Brazil",,"Dalchiavon, A (通讯作者)，Univ Comunitaria Reg Chapeco SC, Rua Sao Joao Batista,82 D, Chapeco, SC, Brazil.",ariberto@unochapecu.edu.br; eder.heberle@unochapeco.edu.br; denisefank@unochapeco.edu.br; zanin@unochapeco.edu.br; rodneywernke1@hotmail.com,"Zanin, Antonio/GYJ-7908-2022; Wernke, Rodney/AAI-1038-2021","Wernke, Rodney/0000-0001-5163-5004",,,,,29,3,3,0,1,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JUL-SEP,2018,14.0,3,,,,,147,168,,,,,,22,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,GY6CQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448673300009,0

The extensive system yielded the lowest gross profit, of US$ 37,359, followed by the semi-intensive system with US$ 78,464, and the intensive system with US$ 150,880. The net present value (NPV) was higher in the intensive system US$ 1,277,593 and smaller in extensive system US$ 347,803 as well as the internal rate of return (IRR) and other financial analysis, pointing out the existing increment between systems. The economic efficiency determined through the sensitivity analysis showed that extensive systems require a revenue growth of up to 5.48% annually, whereas intensive requires a rate of 1.85%. The costs to renovation and maintaining pastures generated high monetary values, though due to the profitability for in each system. This indicates that the systems can pay for such activities while also generating a profit. However, the financial risk is presented to the most extensive producers, a fact that may explain the difficulties to improve the production rates of the Brazilian beef cattle.","[Gaspar, Alberto de Oliveira; de Paula, Leandro Arruda] Univ Fed Mato Grosso do Sul, Fac Med Vet & Zootecnia, Anim Sci, Felinto Muller 2443, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil; [Brumatti, Ricardo Carneiro; Dias, Alexandre Menezes] Univ Fed Mato Grosso do Sul, Fac Med Vet & Zootecnia, Zootecnia, Felinto Muller 2443, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul; Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul,"Brumatti, RC (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Mato Grosso do Sul, Fac Med Vet & Zootecnia, Zootecnia, Felinto Muller 2443, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil.",albertogaspar_@hotmail.com; rbrumatti@gmail.com; leandroap5@hotmail.com; alexandre.menezes@ufms.br,"Dias, Alexandre Menezes/H-9460-2016; Brumatti, Ricardo/GRO-3616-2022; Carneiro Brumatti, Ricardo/L-8014-2013","Dias, Alexandre Menezes/0000-0003-4267-9421; Gaspar, Alberto/0000-0003-1234-5586; Carneiro Brumatti, Ricardo/0000-0002-4031-320X","Foundation to Support the Development of Education, Science and Technology of the State of Mato Grosso do Sul (FUNDECT) through the Call FUNDECT/CAPES - Master's degree in Mato Grosso do sul (Chamada FUNDECT/CAPES - Mestrado em Mato Grosso do Sul) [02/2014]","Foundation to Support the Development of Education, Science and Technology of the State of Mato Grosso do Sul (FUNDECT) through the Call FUNDECT/CAPES - Master's degree in Mato Grosso do sul (Chamada FUNDECT/CAPES - Mestrado em Mato Grosso do Sul)(Fundacao de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento do Ensino Ciencia e Tecnologia do Estado de Mato Grosso do Sul (FUNDECT MS))","We want to thank the Foundation to Support the Development of Education, Science and Technology of the State of Mato Grosso do Sul (FUNDECT) for the scholarship granted through the Call FUNDECT/CAPES No. 02/2014 - Master's degree in Mato Grosso do sul (Chamada FUNDECT/CAPES no 02/2014 - Mestrado em Mato Grosso do Sul).",,30,3,3,0,5,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JAN-MAR,2018,14.0,1,,,,,74,98,,,,,,25,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,GG9WJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000433051500005,0

The aim of this study is to build the methodological framework for recording costs for manufactured crop production with a long development cycle as a result of deep and comprehensive study of these costs objectification. It is concluded that it is necessary to recognize the continuous, irreversible biological process of growing a particular agricultural crop as an integral fact of business operation of an economic entity. In this connection, it is proposed to create and use reserves of direct costs for manufacturing crop products, starting from the month of seed sowing until the last month of intensive harvesting.

First, the text recovers the meaning of the terms neo-colonialism, imperialism, post colonialism and decoloniality and, second, presents the Post-Colonialist Critical Theory and the Decolonial Epistemology/Movement in the context of the post-positivist qualitative research traditions. The discussion of potential contributions to Accounting begins by pointing out some studies that used decolonialism in management and administration. Following this review, we present some papers associated to decolonialism in Accounting, highlighting contributions already recognized by the national and, mainly, international scholars. The paper presents the results of a search on Capes/MEC Periodicals Website carried out in the first half of 2016, to highlight the opportunity for the inclusion of the decolonial perspective in accounting studies in Brazil. The results indicated only two studies published in national journals and, in contrast, 63 papers in international journals. Besides showing that there is room for research of this nature in Brazil, the results show the journals more sensitive to these perspectives. Finally, the discussion aims to contribute to raising awareness about potential limitations, criticisms, and controversies. It acknowledges the relevance of decolonialism for the development of alternative research that, even when focusing in already known objects, take advantage of the lenses of defamiliarization or untying for the construction of relevant knowledge in Accounting in Brazil.","[Sauerbronn, Fernanda Filgueiras] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, EBAPE FGV, Av Pasteur 250, BR-22290902 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Ayres, Rosangela Mesquita; Lourenco, Rosenery Loureiro] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, PPGCC UFRJ, Av Pasteur 250, BR-22290902 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; Getulio Vargas Foundation; Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,"Sauerbronn, FF (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, EBAPE FGV, Av Pasteur 250, BR-22290902 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.",fernanda.sauerbronn@gmail.com; ayres.rosangela@gmail.com; roseneryll@gmail.com,"Ayres, Rosangela M/F-6762-2018; FILGUEIRAS SAUERBRONN, FERNANDA/J-5427-2014","FILGUEIRAS SAUERBRONN, FERNANDA/0000-0002-7932-2314",,,,,56,3,4,1,11,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JUL-SEP,2017,13.0,3,,,,,120,148,,,,,,29,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,FQ0BO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418014600008,0

Data envelopment analysis was used to estimate the technical efficiency of dairy farming. The cost and profitability of dairy farming was estimated using partial budgeting analysis. The average technical efficiency of the inefficient farms was 0.80 which indicates that the inefficient farms could reduce their average input use by 20%. The average costs of milk production per liter in the efficient and inefficient farms were $0.24 and $0.32, respectively. Feed and labor costs in the efficient and inefficient farms accounted for 65.3% and 68% of the total cost, respectively. While the average profit per liter for the efficient farms was $0.06, it was only $0.01 for the inefficient farms. The inefficient farms could sustain their economic viabilities with the government's livestock supports. The government should facilitate the farmers in achieving efficient use of resources in dairy farming and the link between efficiency and economic sustainability should be recognized as a matter of policy priority.","[Bozoglu, Mehmet; Topuz, Bakiye Kilic] Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, Samsun, Turkey; [Saglam, Ozge] Bafra Milk Producers Union, Samsun, Turkey",Ondokuz Mayis University,"Bozoglu, M (通讯作者)，Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, Samsun, Turkey.",mehmetbo@omu.edu.tr; ozgesaglam55@gmail.com; bakiye.kilic@omu.edu.tr,"KilicTopuz, Bakiye/AGH-1857-2022; Topuz, Bakiye Kilic/AAA-2541-2020","KilicTopuz, Bakiye/0000-0002-3607-4306; Topuz, Bakiye Kilic/0000-0002-3607-4306",,,,,48,7,7,0,15,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,APR-JUN,2017,13.0,2,,,,,295,316,,,,,,22,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,FP1NU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417381200016,0

For each group it was collected technical, commercial and financial data from the last summers seasons 2010/11, 2011/12 and 2012/13. The methodology to collection primary data, like costs and revenues, is the Panel, which involves getting a group of producers that represents a typical farm in the region. There was collected the farm Inventory as well as the value of the investments to produce, the operational and total costs of production and the average yield from each season. In the end, costs were faced with the revenue. From these data it was possible to evaluate and compare the profitability of small and large scale production. In general, it was observed that in the accumulated of this three summer harvest, the revenue obtained in both production scales was sufficient to pay the operational and total costs of production. However, the large tomato area allowed better reduction in fixed costs, like administrative and wage compensation for services provided. In the balance of this three seasons, the total cost of production, per hectare, of the small scale was 8.2% higher than the large scale. The research ends by recommending that the small scale producers seek arrangements, such as associations, which enables them to share machines and the infrastructure. Thereby, these producers would also have typical benefits from larger scale farms, such as economy in total cost of production. It is believed that the breakdown of the cost worksheet that was present in this study, as well as the profitability indicators calculated also contributes to other studies that approach, for example, the risks in tomato crops.","[Pagliuca, Larissa Gui; Bernardes Deleo, Joao Paulo; Boteon, Margarete] Escola Super Agr Luiz de Queiroz Esalq USP, Dept Econ Adm & Sociol, Ave Padua Dias,11,CP 132, BR-13418900 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; [Mueller, Siegfried] Epagri, Estacao Expt Cacador, Rua Henrique Cruz Garcia,26,Apt 501, BR-8950000 Cacador, SC, Brazil; [Valmorbida, Janice] Epagri, Estacao Expt Cacador, Rua Abilio Franco,1500,Cx Postal 591, BR-8950000 Cacador, SC, Brazil",,"Pagliuca, LG (通讯作者)，Escola Super Agr Luiz de Queiroz Esalq USP, Dept Econ Adm & Sociol, Ave Padua Dias,11,CP 132, BR-13418900 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil.",larigpagliuca@gmail.com; jpbdeleo@cepea.org.br; maboteon@usp.br; simueller02@gmail.com; janicevalmorbida@epagri.sc.gov.br,"pagliuca, larissa/JFJ-4893-2023; Boteon, Margarete/P-3271-2019","Boteon, Margarete/0000-0001-9231-0943; Pagliuca, Larissa/0009-0000-0805-8045",,,,,24,3,3,0,3,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,APR,2017,13.0,,,,SI,,227,243,,,,,,17,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,FB4DZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406093000011,0

(2) The cost of rainwater harvesting through concrete dams increased from 1.340 riyals/m(3) at a 5% discount rate to 3.694 riyals/m(3) at a 15% discount rate. (3) A 10% change in the amount of water, agricultural labor, or chemical fertilizers leads to a corresponding change in sorghum production of 3.9%, 2.5%, or 1.9%, respectively. (4) The marginal return on water in sorghum production was similar to 326.12 SR/thousand m(3) in Jazan in 2015. (5) Rainwater is not economically efficient for sorghum production because the harvesting cost outweighs its marginal productivity.

The comparative results indicate the overall agricultural production efficiency of China is greater than Pakistan; although agricultural production of Pakistan increasing but China have efficient agricultural production because it strongly depends on technology therefore for more efficient agricultural production; Pakistan need to apply new agricultural technology.","[Wagan, Shoaib Ahmed; Memon, Qurat Ul Am] Anhui Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Dept Reg Rural Dev, Hefei 230036, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Dong Chunyu; Luan Jingdong] Anhui Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Hefei 230036, Anhui, Peoples R China",Anhui Agricultural University; Anhui Agricultural University,"Luan, JD (通讯作者)，Anhui Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Hefei 230036, Anhui, Peoples R China.",waganshoaib@yahoo.com; anymemon15@yahoo.com; dongcy@126.com; luanjingdong@ahau.edu.cn,"Wagan, Dr. Shoaib Ahmed/ABD-4809-2021",,,,,,46,15,15,1,23,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JUL-SEP,2018,14.0,3,,,,,169,190,,,,,,22,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,GY6CQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448673300010,0

Data were obtained by conducting a questionnaire with 100 beef cattle farms selected by stratified random sampling method. Beef cattle farms were divided into three groups according to initial weights and were analyzed accordingly. Average daily gain, carcass weight and dressing increased with increasing initial weight. It was found that with increasing initial weight, cost of 1 kg liveweight and carcass decreased, 1 kg liveweight gain increased. Production cost and net profit increased with increasing initial weight. Production cost for light, medium, and heavy groups were 2 054.71, 2 208.64 and 2 354.40 TL, respectively, whereas net profit was -78.59 TL, 36.83 TL and 197.77 TL, respectively.

Many studies, especially in the Anglo-Saxons states shows that the firms with greater female participation on their boards exhibit lower earnings management, which is explain as the results of psychologically differences between males and females which has different ethical sensitivity for consequence. This study conducted on Serbian agriculture companies listed at Belgrade Stock Exchange suggests that there is insignificant negative linear relationship between number of women in the board and earnings management. This finding are supported with the studies which indicate that the reasons for earnings management should be found in different factors, like cultural and political factors or religious attitude or age of the members of the boards not on the gender differences itself.","[Pavlovic, Vladan] Univ Pristina, Fac Econ, Accounting, Kolaginska 156, Kosovska Mitrovica 38220, Serbia; [Knezevic, Goranka] Singidunum Univ, Fac Business, Accounting, Danijelova 32, Belgrade 11000, Serbia; [Bojicic, Radica] Univ Pristina, Fac Econ, Kolaginska 156, Kosovska Mitrovica 38220, Serbia",Universiteti i Prishtines; Universiteti i Prishtines,"Pavlovic, V (通讯作者)，Univ Pristina, Fac Econ, Accounting, Kolaginska 156, Kosovska Mitrovica 38220, Serbia.",vladan.pavlovic@pr.ac.rs; gknezevic@singidunum.ac.rs; radica.bojicic@pr.ac.rs,"Bojičić, Radica/ABN-6261-2022; Knežević, Goranka/ABI-2953-2020; Pavlovic, Vladan/O-9246-2019","Bojičić, Radica/0000-0002-4192-5646; Knežević, Goranka/0000-0003-3642-7682; Pavlovic, Vladan/0000-0002-2228-7095","Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development, Republic of Serbia [179001]","Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development, Republic of Serbia","This paper was performed as part of Project No. 179001 funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development, Republic of Serbia.",,66,7,7,0,14,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,APR-JUN,2018,14.0,2,,,,,340,363,,,,,,24,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,GI7YN,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000434718700017,0

The model of competitiveness used was the Diamante with the purpose of evaluating the four factors developed by Porter (1990). For the treatment and analysis of the data the weights were attributed according to the original studies of Moon and Lee (2004). The results indicate that in the Factor Conditions and Related and Supporting Sectors, Brazil performs better than Uruguay in the year 2015.

After the 2008 crisis, many mills were shut down. However, this type of business once again attracted the investors interest and became profitable in view of the possibility of electric energy cogeneration. The energy generated by the sugarcane bagasse yields a much greater value to the mills and creates a complex and uncertain situation that the traditional techniques of economic valuation, based on simple discounted cash flow, cannot captured properly. This paper presents a dynamic model under uncertainty conditions, where simulations are done in discrete time using recombined binomial trees. Commodities prices are modeled through a mean-reverting process and the risk neutral methodology is used. The results indicate an economic advantage for the mills with ethanol and sugar production flexibility. Furthermore, the economic feasibility of cogenerated energy in the mills make them, simultaneously economic and ecological advantageous assets.","[Samanez, Carlos Patricio] Pontificia Univ Catolica Rio de Janeiro PUC Rio, Dept Engn Ind, Rua Marques de Sao Vicente 225,L950, BR-22451900 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Samanez, Carlos Patricio] Univ Estadual Rio de Janeiro UERJ, Fac Econ, Rua Marques de Sao Vicente 225,L950, BR-22451900 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Ferreira, Leo da Rocha; Lucena Aiube, Fernando Antonio] Univ Estado Rio De Janeiro, Fac Ciencias Econ, Rua Sao Francisco Xavier 524,Bloco B,8 Andar, BR-20550013 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Castro, Javier Gutierrez] Univ Tecnol Fed Parana UTFPR, Campus Ponta Grossa,Ave Monteiro Lobato,Bloco P, BR-84016210 Ponta Grossa, PR, Brazil; [de Souza, Fabio Simone] Ctr Fed Educ Tecnol Celso Suckow da Fonseca CEFET, Ave Maracana 229,Bloco E,1 Andar, BR-20271110 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil",Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro; Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro; Universidade Tecnologica Federal do Parana; Centro Federal de Educacao Tecnologica Celso Suckow da Fonseca (CEFET-RJ),"Samanez, CP (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Rio de Janeiro PUC Rio, Dept Engn Ind, Rua Marques de Sao Vicente 225,L950, BR-22451900 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.;Samanez, CP (通讯作者)，Univ Estadual Rio de Janeiro UERJ, Fac Econ, Rua Marques de Sao Vicente 225,L950, BR-22451900 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.",cps@puc-rio.br; leorocha@uerj.br; jgutierrezcastro@gmail.com; fabio.simone.souza@gmail.com; faiube@gmail.com,"Aiube, Fernando Antonio Lucena/I-2644-2012; Castro, Javier Gutiérrez/B-3975-2015","Aiube, Fernando/0000-0003-3627-3484",,,,,27,0,0,0,2,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,APR,2017,13.0,,,,SI,,71,95,,,,,,25,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,FB4DZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406093000005,0

As the selection criteria was considered farms that achieved the best results in some global indicators. The selected farms were called according to the production extract, the average productivity per lactating cow and the economic implications of the farms. The results to intensification factors of land use were 0.5 animal/ha and average of 4.8 L/ha/day to Farm A, from 0.99 animal/ha and 10.2 L/ha/day to Farm B and 0.65 animal/ha and 12 L/ha/day to Farm C.

Thus, the article aims to (i) provide management tools for agribusiness (ii) provide an assessment of the use of resources and (iii) contribute to the economic and financial development of agribusiness. To do so, classic cost management, cash flow and shared resources tools are combined to form a model. As research results, it has been found that resource sharing provides cost savings, increased profitability and cash flow balance. The application of management tools presents the performance of an integrated crop-livestock system that produces five products.

Freight and the operations related to the distribution of the harvest have an effect on the production costs and the amount of sawed, harvested and sold grain. This research study aimed at obtaining a mixed integer linear programming model and applying it in a malted-barley supply chain in Mexico. The model design a distribution network with minimal freight costs, considering variables like penalties/incentives, crop yields and costs of collecting points. This model allows identifying better scenarios that could be configured according to the agricultural contract that prevails in this chain. The results obtained in three possible scenarios showed through variations in the supply, demand and penalties / incentives the convenience of distributing 50% of the harvest obtained to each of the two malts with minimum costs between 329,210 and 598, 231 USD.","[Granillo-Macias, Rafael] Univ Popular Autonoma Estado Puebla, Sci, Puebla, Mexico; [Granillo-Macias, Rafael] Univ Autonoma Estado Hidalgo, Pachuca, Mexico; [Olivares-Benitez, Elias] Univ Panamer, Engn, Campus Guadalajara, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Luis Martinez-Flores, Jose; Omar Caballero-Morales, Santiago] Univ Popular Autonoma Estado Puebla, Engn, Puebla, Mexico",Universidad Popular Autonoma del Estado de Puebla; Universidad Autonoma del Estado de Hidalgo; Universidad Panamericana - Ciudad de Mexico; Universidad Popular Autonoma del Estado de Puebla,"Granillo-Macías, R (通讯作者)，Univ Popular Autonoma Estado Puebla, Sci, Puebla, Mexico.;Granillo-Macías, R (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Estado Hidalgo, Pachuca, Mexico.",rafael.granillo@upaep.edu.mx; eolivaresb@up.edu.mx; joseluis.martinez01@upaep.mx; santiagoomar.caballero@upaep.mx,"GRANILLO-MACIAS, RAFAEL/N-5128-2018; GRANILLO MACIAS, RAFAEL/E-6165-2019; Olivares-Benitez, Elias/R-7075-2018","GRANILLO MACIAS, RAFAEL/0000-0002-1015-667X; Olivares-Benitez, Elias/0000-0001-7943-3869",,,,,26,3,3,0,11,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JAN-MAR,2018,14.0,1,,,,,164,183,,,,,,20,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,GG9WJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000433051500009,0

The analysis was conducted on the basis of the sample survey comprising farms classified according to their economic conditions - LFA (Less Favoured Areas). The profitability of farms is poor with frequent slumps into deficit. These fluctuations are caused by the dependency of profit on external conditions. An average farm operating in other LFA seems to be the most vulnerable in this respect. Dependency on subsidies is showed most markedly in the mountain LFA. In NON LFA, on the other hand, the influence of other external factors, notably weather and high price volatility, is most notably manifested. The long-term decline in workers is the main cause of the growth of labour productivity. An important trend is the growth in the land rent, which has doubled over the last five years. The share of rented land still constitutes the majority of the utilised land.","[Lososova, Jana; Zdenek, Radek; Kopta, Daniel] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Accounting & Finances, Studentska 13, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice,"Lososová, J (通讯作者)，Univ South Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Accounting & Finances, Studentska 13, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic.",lososova@ef.jcu.cz; zdenek@ef.jcu.cz; kopta@ef.jcu.cz,"Kopta, Daniel/AAG-2730-2019; ZDENĚK, Radek/D-6217-2016; Lososová, Jana/D-6237-2016","Kopta, Daniel/0000-0002-6122-6332; ZDENĚK, Radek/0000-0001-6945-6485; Lososová, Jana/0000-0001-9610-1436","Research Program of Faculty of Economics, University of South Bohemia [IGS01C1]","Research Program of Faculty of Economics, University of South Bohemia","The article is a result of Research Program of Faculty of Economics, University of South Bohemia No. IGS01C1.",,37,11,11,0,2,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,APR-JUN,2017,13.0,2,,,,,88,109,,,,,,22,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,FP1NU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417381200007,0

The 462 farmers selected for interview were chosen by the stratified random sampling method. The data collection method was face-to-face interviews with the farmers using a questionnaire during the 2014 production season. The characteristics of the buffalo farmer, the capital structure, production costs of the buffalo activity, gross production value, gross profit, absolute profit, relative profit and some financial ratios were calculated in the analyses. Buffalo farming is a profitable production activity, but profitability differs depending on the operating scale. Buffalo breeding generally involves an extensive production system. Buffalo breeding can be improved by further work towards the betterment of the native buffalo breed, new market opportunities, effective cooperation with producer organisations and enhancing the farmer's financial knowledge. However, it can be suggested that the activity will continue in regions close to the city centres that have the appropriate ecosystems.","[Gul, Mevlut; Karli, Bahri] Isparta Univ Appl Sci, Dept Agr Econ, Fac Agr Sci & Technol, TR-32260 Isparta, Turkey; [Akpinar, Metin Goksel; Tascioglu, Yavuz] Akdeniz Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Fac Agr, Antalya, Turkey; [Bozkurt, Yalcin] Isparta Univ Appl Sci, Dept Anim Sci, Fac Agr Sci & Technol, TR-32260 Isparta, Turkey",Isparta University of Applied Sciences; Akdeniz University; Isparta University of Applied Sciences,"Gül, M (通讯作者)，Isparta Univ Appl Sci, Dept Agr Econ, Fac Agr Sci & Technol, TR-32260 Isparta, Turkey.",mevlutgul@isparta.edu.tr; mgoksel@akdeniz.edu.tr; ytascioglu@akdeniz.edu.tr; bahrikarli@isparta.edu.tr; yalcinbozkurt@isparta.edu.tr,"Gül, Mevlüt/J-1711-2014; Taşcıoğlu, Yavuz/C-6967-2016","Gül, Mevlüt/0000-0002-0147-7228; Taşcıoğlu, Yavuz/0000-0002-8989-3145",TUBITAK [1130309],TUBITAK(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)),This study was a part of our research project (Project number: 1130309).

However, through the data collected from milk producers, it was possible to identify that controlling is perceived as very important for decision making, according to literature, while its practical use has been little avowed. When these results are analyzed from the Slack's Matrix (SLACK, 2002), the controlling tools and attributes studied are in a worrisome situation for the matrix standards, indicating the need for urgent action to improve this situation.","[Ramos Dumer, Miguel Carlos; da Silva Junior, Annor; de Souza, Ariana Marchezi; Gobbi, Beatriz Christo] Univ Fed Espirito Santo, Ave Fernando Ferrari 514, BR-29075910 Vitoria, ES, Brazil; [Basso Favero da Silva, Alcinete Aparecida] Fac DOCTUM, Rod Jones dos Santos Neves 3535, BR-29215002 Guarapari, ES, Brazil; [de Mendonca, Mark Miranda] Ctr Univ Projecao, Area Especial,5&6,Setor C Norte, BR-71917720 Taguatinga, DF, Brazil; [Gomes, Jarbas Barros] FUCAPE Business Sch, Ave Fernando Ferrari 1358, BR-29075505 Vitoria, ES, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Espirito Santo; FUCAPE Business School,"Dumer, MCR (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Espirito Santo, Ave Fernando Ferrari 514, BR-29075910 Vitoria, ES, Brazil.",prof.migueldumer@gmail.com; annorsj@gmail.com; alcinetefavero@hotmail.com; arianamds@yahoo.com.br; admbeatriz@gmail.com; mark.miranda@uol.com.br; contato@jarbasgomes.com.br,,,,,,,41,2,2,0,4,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,OCT-DEC,2018,14.0,4,,,,,127,148,,,,,,22,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,HF6HQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000454336800007,0

The primary data of the study were obtained from 136 agricultural enterprises by using the Simple Random Sampling Method. Income per unit area was 922 TL/da, and with subsidies this number could increase at a level of 44% (408 TL/da more). The cost per kg was found as 2,0 TL in small enterprises, and 2,03 TL in large enterprises. The highest cost element was energy (regardless of ground rent). Energy usage per unit was found as 170 TL.According to the economic process results of cotton production excluding the subsidies; the gross profit was 135,79 TL/decare, the net profit was -151,57 TL/ decare, and the relative profit was 0,86 TL. Including the subsidies; the gross profit was 543,76 TL/ decare, the net profit was 256,40 TL/ decare, and the relative profit was 1,24 TL. This result proves that cotton producers' profits consist of subsidies. According to the research results, in order to continue cotton production in the research area; concrete steps should be taken to decrease energy costs used for irrigation, producer organizations should be more active about helping producers with obtaining input and marketing their products, and subsidy unit prices should be allocated at the same level as developed countries.","[Semerci, Arif; Celik, Ahmet Duran] Mustafa Kemal Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, Econ, POB 31034, Antakya, Hatay, Turkey",Mustafa Kemal University,"Semerci, A (通讯作者)，Mustafa Kemal Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, Econ, POB 31034, Antakya, Hatay, Turkey.",arifsemerci69@gmail.com; ahmetdurancelik01@hotmail.com,"celik, Ahmet/IAP-5710-2023; Semerci, Arif/HTL-3968-2023","Semerci, Arif/0000-0003-0893-3748",,,,,24,5,5,3,10,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JAN-MAR,2018,14.0,1,,,,,2,21,,,,,,20,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,GG9WJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000433051500002,0

The study revealed average net profit of 2,385.31 US dollars per farm in a period of three months, BCR of 4.08 and BEP of 106.41 Kgs. The study revealed that mushroom production is a profitable enterprise. The problems faced by farmers were ranked from the most pressing problem to the least pressing problem in this order; Low market prices per kilogram of mushroom, scarcity of cotton during some seasons, poor quality mushroom spawn supplied to farmers by breeders, inadequate extension and advisory services, unfavorable (high) temperatures, less capital to expand their businesses, termites, snails, fungus and infections, perishability nature of mushroom and difficulty in obtaining water were the most observed problems. The suggested solutions were organizing farmers into groups or cooperatives in order to negotiate for better markets locally and abroad together with the help of government, promoting input producers like cotton farmers and spawn breeders to produce high quality mushroom spawn in adequate quantity and on time, re-equipping local extension workers with knowledge regarding mushroom production, providing water all over the country to ensure adequate production of mushroom during hot seasons and researchers to carry out more research to find out other suitable inputs other than relying on only cotton.","[Mayanja, Ibrahim; Tipi, Tolga] Uludag Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Fac Agr, Gorukle, Turkey",Uludag University,"Mayanja, I (通讯作者)，Uludag Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Fac Agr, Gorukle, Turkey.",ibrahimmayanja@gmail.com; ttipi@uludag.edu.tr,"Tipi, Tolga/A-8407-2019","Tipi, Tolga/0000-0002-1090-3639",,,,,15,0,0,1,6,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,OCT-DEC,2018,14.0,4,,,,,80,97,,,,,,18,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,HF6HQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000454336800005,0

The biomass of woody residues that becomes available after the forest harvest of stands of Pinus radiata D. Don is a potentially important source of biomass for bioenergy in Chile. Questions remain whether the removal of a fraction of this material would constitute a sustainable forestry practice and in what types of soils, given the potential impact on soil nutrient cycling and other functions of the ecosystem. The aims of this study were to determine the amount of residues left in the stand which can be operationally extracted with mechanized equipment, characterize them physically and to determine the costs of the recovery tasks and transport to processing centers. It is estimated that in average, the biomass of harvest residues potentially available as raw material in the site is between 12.1 and 33.9 Mg ha(-1). The chipping of residues with grinder or hammer knife rotor equipment that grind the material by an impact against an internal anvil generates 10 % of the material with a particle size less than 3 mm. Thus, the average cost of harvest residues placed on arrival was USD 10.81 loose m(-3) that, according to the change at the time of the study represents CL$ 6,686 loose m(-3). This figure becomes attractive respect to other values paid by the companies for the supply of biofuel chips. Based on these estimations it can be pointed out that the use of harvest residues as feedstock in energy plants is cost-competitive.","[Acuna, Eduardo; Cancino, Jorge; Rubilar, Rafael; Silva, Luis] Univ Concepcion, Fac Ciencias Forestales, Victoria 631, Concepcion, Chile",Universidad de Concepcion,"Acuña, E (通讯作者)，Univ Concepcion, Fac Ciencias Forestales, Victoria 631, Concepcion, Chile.",edacuna@udec.cl; jcancino@udec.cl; edacuna@udec.cl; luis.silvaparra@masisa.com,"Rubilar, Rafael/AAG-7105-2019; Acuña, Eduardo/H-1849-2016","Rubilar, Rafael/0000-0002-4929-7613; Acuña, Eduardo/0000-0002-3029-6805",,,,,23,8,8,0,6,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JAN-MAR,2017,13.0,1,,,,,442,463,,,,,,22,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,ET6CP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000400378600019,0

The problems range from structural issues of the country, such as excessive tax burden, lack of skilled labor and poor infrastructure, to specifics problems of this sector such as acquisition cost of raw material (robusta coffee) in the domestic market. A way out to this hindrance would be the opening for acquisition of robust coffee in foreign markets, prevented activity nowadays due the existence of phytosanitary barriers. Thus, the present study aims to analyze the financial viability of robusta coffee imports from Vietnam via drawback mechanism. Specifically, it is intend to compare the prices of the imported coffee with the national coffee, simulating deterministic and random scenarios, trying to infer more competitive to some of them.

The stable growth of agriculture directly affects the economic and social stability and the healthy development in China. For this reason, DEA is applied to comprehensively evaluate the overall efficiency (technical efficiency*scale efficiency) of the agricultural production inputs (agricultural chemical fertilizer, agricultural machinery power, agricultural labor, and agricultural acreage) in China, according to the 2014 agricultural production data of 31 provinces, to further analyze the factors in the low agricultural production technical efficiency. The empirical results show that the agricultural production inputs exist in relative technical efficiency, but are lack of scale efficiency.

Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) was used oriented to inputs to quantify the efficiency of the regions. The output used in DEA model is the amount of cane produced in each region, and inputs were the costs with mechanization, workmanship, supplies, leasing, administrative costs, land and capital remuneration. The results show that the traditional Center-South region is the most technically efficient, and four of the five harvests obtained maximum efficiency (efficiency score equals one). The issue of technical and scale efficiency was presented only in Northeast during the 2011/2012 season. Other harvests in Northeast and the crops of traditional South-Central region have shown problems only with scale. On average, scale efficiency was 65%, and pure efficiency, 99%, demonstrating that although the costs may decrease 1%, the biggest problem of the regions is the amount that will be produced.","[Pereira, Nevison Amorim] Univ Fed Uberlandia DIFIN UFU, Ave Joao Naves de Avila 2121,Bloco 3P, BR-38408100 Uberlandia, MG, Brazil; [Tavares, Marcelo] Univ Fed Uberlandia, Fac Matemat, Ave Joao Naves de Avila 2121, BR-38408100 Uberlandia, MG, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Uberlandia,"Pereira, NA (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Uberlandia DIFIN UFU, Ave Joao Naves de Avila 2121,Bloco 3P, BR-38408100 Uberlandia, MG, Brazil.",nevisonpm@yahoo.com.br; mtavares@ufu.br,,,,,,,56,7,7,0,11,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,APR,2017,13.0,,,,SI,,37,70,,,,,,34,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,FB4DZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406093000004,0

In relation to the labor market, the results point out the need for professionals with basic accounting knowledge, notions of agriculture and livestock and their forms of exploitation, taxation, tax planning and above all, who is a dynamic and multidisciplinary professional, who wants to learn and who is questioner.","[Salvador, Priscila Duarte] Univ Fed Rio Grande FURG, Ciencias Contabeis, Av Italia,Km 8 S-N,Pavilhao 4,Campus Carreiros, BR-96203000 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil; [de Gomes, Debora Gomes; Capuano Cruz, Ana Paula] Univ Fed Rio Grande FURG, PPGCont, Av Italia,Km 8 S-N,Pavilhao 4,Campus Carreiros, BR-96203000 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil; [da Silva, Gabriela Dias] Univ Fed Rio Grande FURG, Av Italia,Km 8 S-N,Pavilhao 4,Campus Carreiros, BR-96203000 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio Grande; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande,"Salvador, PD (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rio Grande FURG, Ciencias Contabeis, Av Italia,Km 8 S-N,Pavilhao 4,Campus Carreiros, BR-96203000 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil.",priscila.momento@gmail.com; debora_furg@yahoo.com.br; anapaulacapuanocruz@hotmail.com; gabi.dias85@gmail.com,"Salvador, Priscila Duarte/AGN-9578-2022; da Silva, Gabriela Dias/X-1372-2019","Salvador, Priscila Duarte/0000-0003-3491-1972;",,,,,22,0,0,0,4,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JUL-SEP,2018,14.0,3,,,,,351,372,,,,,,22,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,GY6CQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448673300019,0

Many researchers have been puzzled with the fact that having more female appointed in the board of directors and managerial positions has positive effect on firm's profitability. In this paper we try to proof the importance of having female members appointed at the board of directors of Serbian agriculture companies listed at Belgrade Stock Exchange. We emphasize agriculture companies because in Serbia this industry is considered to be male dominated. Linear model of regression suggests that there is weak positive linear relationship between number of women in the board and ROA and ROS. The findings of this research have important implications for the managers of agricultural companies. Although, the relationship between profitability ratios (ROA and ROS) is weak, gender diversification can be positive signal for the investors of the company emphasizing the fact that having women in the board means better decision making process, different attitude toward risk and more diversified skills used.","[Knezevic, Goranka] Singidunum Univ, Accounting, Fac Business, Danijelova 32, Belgrade 11000, Serbia; [Pavlovic, Vladan] Univ Pristina, Fac Econ, Accounting, Kolasinska 156, Kosovska Mitrov 38220, Serbia; [Bojicic, Radica] Univ Pristina, Fac Econ, Math, Kolasinska 156, Kosovska Mitrov 38220, Serbia",Universiteti i Prishtines; Universiteti i Prishtines,"Knezevic, G (通讯作者)，Singidunum Univ, Accounting, Fac Business, Danijelova 32, Belgrade 11000, Serbia.",gknezevic@singidunum.ac.rs; vladan.pavlovic@pr.ac.rs; radica.bojicic@pr.ac.rs,"Knežević, Goranka/ABI-2953-2020; Pavlovic, Vladan/O-9246-2019; Bojičić, Radica/ABN-6261-2022","Knežević, Goranka/0000-0003-3642-7682; Pavlovic, Vladan/0000-0002-2228-7095; Bojičić, Radica/0000-0002-4192-5646","Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development, Republic of Serbia [179001]","Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development, Republic of Serbia","This paper was performed as part of Project No. 179001 funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development, Republic of Serbia.",,20,11,11,1,13,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JUL-SEP,2017,13.0,3,,,,,2,20,,,,,,19,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,FQ0BO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418014600002,0

The given model can be efficiently implemented and provides the best information regarding the short-term and long-term recoverability of receivables. The main purpose of emergence of this paper is to shed light on the increasingly significant role played by Markov models in the overall receivables management, as the dominant factor of success of the overall business policy of the enterprise. The turbulence and uncertainty of the environment demand that enterprises efficiently and rationally manage receivables, cash, liabilities and investments, which represent the decisive factor in achieving and maintaining the financial result, profitability and liquidity as the essential determinants of solvency as the long-term objective of operation of any successful enterprise. This is especially prominent due to their arrangement relationship in the function of survival and subsequent growth and development of enterprises. As an element of the balance sheet, receivables exist in different forms, representing the transitional financial form and an essential form of balance sheet and overall financial and business policy of an enterprise. The paper will illustrate the basic characteristic determinants of receivables, point to the specific features of the Markov model, and illustrate its implementation and existence through a specific practical example, pointing to the benefits of its incorporation in contemporary enterprises.","[Saponja, Ljiljana Dmitrovic; Sijan, Goran] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ Subotica, Segedinski Put 9-11, Subotica, Serbia; [Gravorac, Sasa] Directorate Construct Subotica, Trg Republ 16, Subotica, Serbia",University of Novi Sad,"Gravorac, S (通讯作者)，Directorate Construct Subotica, Trg Republ 16, Subotica, Serbia.",ljiljanad@ef.uns.ac.rs; gsijan@ef.uns.ac.rs; sasagravorac@gmail.com,,,,,,,2,0,0,1,2,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,APR,2017,13.0,,,,SI,,408,419,,,,,,12,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,FB4DZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406093000020,0

However, following the changes of societies and markets, current basic level farmers' associationsare facing strict challenges and operation transformation on the supply and marketing businesses. It is necessary to introduce new business management models into the operation so as to enhance the overall business performance. The operation of supply and marketing businesses therefore should be established based on good customer relationship by better understanding customer needs, analyzing the need information, providing appropriate services and products, and actively concerning about customers' after sale responses to adjust and improve farmers' associations' services and products. To combine expert opinions, reduce input costs, and avoid fuzziness in the interview process, Modified Delphi Method is utilized for screening input and output factors. Basic-level farmers' associations in Yunlin County, which is named the agricultural capital, is studied. The research results are summarized as followings. One DMU in the basic-level farmers' associations shows strong efficiency, revealing the better relative efficiency. Three DMUs, with marginal inefficiency, present the relative efficiency between 0.9 and 1, revealing the relative efficiency being easily enhanced. Six DMUs, with obvious inefficiency, appear the efficiency lower than 0.9. The DEA evaluation results reveal that many basic-level farmers' associations in Yunlin County do not achieve the scale efficiency. In this case, the input for basic-level Farmers' associations' introduction of customer relationship management, in Yunlin County, should be re-considered and re-adjusted in order to enhance the competitiveness. Finally, suggestions based on the results are proposed, expecting to analyze farmers' relevant information and understand current situations and dilemmas of local agriculture production and marketing by the introduction of customer relationship management to provide farmers' associations with opportunities and directions for future transformation.","[Hu, Ridong; Shieh, Chich-Jen] Huaqiao Univ, Inst Quantitat Econ, 668 Jimei Ave, Xiamen 361021, Peoples R China; [Lin, Mingyu] Huaqiao Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, 269 Chenghua North Rd, Quanzhou 362021, Fujian, Peoples R China",Huaqiao University; Huaqiao University,"Shieh, CJ (通讯作者)，Huaqiao Univ, Inst Quantitat Econ, 668 Jimei Ave, Xiamen 361021, Peoples R China.",j_rdhu@hqu.edu.cn; charleshieh@hqu.edu.cn,,,National Cultural Masters; Four in a batch Talents,National Cultural Masters; Four in a batch Talents,The Project is supported by National Cultural Masters and Four in a batch Talents Funded by Self-selected,,21,1,1,1,15,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,APR-JUN,2018,14.0,2,,,,,411,421,,,,,,11,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,GI7YN,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000434718700020,0

Empirical inefficiency model has been developed. Total 110 randomly selected mango growers were personally interviewed by well-designed questionnaire. Results of maximum likelihood shows, 99 percent variation from potential yield level was attributed by technical inefficiency. In result of Cobb Douglas function, the average efficiency level of mango growers was 0.60. It implies that still mango growers have opportunity of reducing the inputs usage by 40 percent without compromising the mango yield. The age of respondents, age of orchard, orchard size and intercropping were contributing in inefficiency of mango growers. On other hand Schooling years, family size, orchard experience, owned power source and access to extension were significantly reducing the inefficiency level. The efficient farmers' social profile was much better than moderate and inefficient farmers. The technical efficiency can be increased by providing the better understanding of mango growing technology through extension services in the study area.","[ul Haq, Shamsheer; Shahbaz, Pomi; Boz, Ismet; Yildirim, Cagatay] Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Fac Agr, TR-55139 Samsun, Turkey; [Murtaza, M.

In this framework, I investigate the global implications of further development of the European Union (EU) program of preferential temporary visas for the highly skilled immigrants and compare them to the effects of income tax allowances for medium-term, college-educated, foreign workers. The two counterfactuals indicate a significant rise in the yearly inflows and total stocks of college-educated immigrants into the EU. The outcomes of the former policy are driven by a visa-substitution effect within the group of current migrants, while the latter scenario results in an increase in the pool of international migrants. Both policies induce a destination-substitution effect: losses of skilled migrants by non-EU states, which is reinforced by multilateral resistance to migration that is micro-founded in the model.","[Burzynski, Michal] Luxembourg Inst Socioecon Res LISER, Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg",,"Burzynski, M (通讯作者)，CREA Univ Luxembourg, 162A Ave Faiencerie, L-1511 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.",michal.burzynski@uni.lu,,"Burzynski, Michal/0000-0002-3937-0645",,,,,62,5,5,1,20,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",2054-0892,2054-0906,,J DEMOGR ECON,J.Demogr.

The main aim of the present study was to make comparisons among owners of sole electric car, both electric and conventional cars, and sole conventional car for demographic characteristics, travel mode use, psychological factors and knowledge related to electric car use in a Norwegian sample of car drivers. In addition, factors that predict type of car/s (electric, conventional or both electric and conventional) owned by the drivers were investigated. An online survey, with a response rate of 11%, was used to collect data from 663 Norwegian car drivers including both electric and conventional car drivers. The MANCOVA results showed that the most substantial differences in the measured constructs were between the sole electric car owners and the sole conventional car owners, whereas there were fewer differences between those who only own an electric car and those who own both an electric and a conventional car. Compared to the conventional car owners, electric car owners were younger and had a higher education and income level, and they reported more car use and higher level of knowledge about electric cars. In addition, electric car owners agreed with the positive attributes of electric cars more and reported higher level of personal norm, ascription of responsibility and awareness of consequences related to effects of car use to the environment. Finally, multinomial logistic regression results showed that attributes of electric cars were the strongest group of variables that increased probability of electric car ownership.","[Simsekoglu, Ozlem] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Psychol, Trondheim, Norway; [Simsekoglu, Ozlem] Nord Univ, Business Sch, Traff Sect, Stjordal, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Nord University,"Simsekoglu, Ö (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Psychol, Trondheim, Norway.",osimsekoglu@gmail.com,,,Norwegian University of Science and Technology,Norwegian University of Science and Technology,This study was funded by a post-doctoral research project granted by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.,,26,41,43,25,116,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

The reality of connected trips and resulting constrained mode choices are captured through the HDDC framework that is suitable for fitting in an activity-based travel demand modelling system. Data from a web-based travel survey of the students of four universities in Toronto are used. The empirical model highlights the importance of capturing the dynamics in tour-based mode choices modelling. The dynamic model reveals that students' sensitivity to cost vary by trips of the day, while their sensitivity to travel time remains stable.

The Texas Transportation Institute estimated that in 2014 delays due to congestion caused an extra 7 billion extra hours in delay, leading to wasted fuel, increased environmental degradation, and high user costs. Previous studies have focused on the impacts to congestion via highway toll lanes and the income distributional effects of tolling. While tolling can be effective in reducing congestion levels, these tolls have been found to be at least as regressive as fuel taxes. Further, these studies do not investigate the impacts tolling has on rural households compared to urban households. This study presents a per-mile congestion tax as an alternative policy tool to congestion tolling. Using a Suits Index with the Oregon Households Activity Survey, we find a per-mile congestion charge to be progressive on income. This suggests that the administratively challenging toll revenue redistribution payments that would be necessary to make congestion tolling progressive would not be needed. At the same time, however, the Suits Index suggests that a per-mile congestion charge would be regressive with regards to rural households. Econometric models are estimated to further support and explain these outcomes. While rural households, in general, drive more during peak hours compared to urban households, we find that low-income rural households are less likely to drive during these periods than wealthier rural households.","[Ke, Yue] Purdue Univ, Lyles Sch Civil Engn, 2155 Hampton Hall,550 W Stadium Ave, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA; [Gkritza, Konstantina] Purdue Univ, Lyles Sch Civil Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University; Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Ke, Y (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Lyles Sch Civil Engn, 2155 Hampton Hall,550 W Stadium Ave, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA.",Ke10@purdue.edu,"Ke, Yue/HKW-0430-2023; Gkritza, Konstantina/B-3188-2011","Ke, Yue/0000-0002-6979-5433; Gkritza, Konstantina/0000-0002-6598-4771",,,,,46,3,6,0,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

We find very low survival rates for businesses that incurred physical damage, particularly for small firms and less-productive establishments. Conditional on survival, larger and more-productive businesses that rebuilt their operations hired more workers than their smaller and less-productive counterparts. Auxiliary evidence from the Survey of Business Owners suggests that the differential size effect is tied to the presence of financial constraints, pointing to a socially inefficient level of exits and to distortions of allocative efficiency in response to this negative shock.

Using Bass's model and Bemmaor's Gamma/Shifted Gompertz (G/SG) model, they found evidence of a left skew in the right-censored distributions of the times to adoption in three countries out of four. However, this conclusion relied on the skewness parameter of Bemmaor's model. We reanalyze the data, making use of three special cases of the G/SG as well as the full version. Extending the data set to six countries, we show that (i) fitting the four models to the data does not allow us to discriminate between models, but (ii) forecasting the subsequent adoptions provides a strong support of right skewness in the data set: each country (except France) shows a substantial mass of later adopters of mobile social networking following an initial embrace of the access.

The results show that the average CO2 intensity of new vehicles was reduced by about 7.5 g of CO2/km in the year of the implementation of the reform.

The triangulated database allows us to maximize match rates and provide validation for a large fraction of matches. In this paper, we describe the construction of the database and explore basic features of the data. We find patenting firms, particularly young patenting firms, disproportionally contribute jobs to the U.S. economy. We find that patenting is a relatively rare event among small firms but that most patenting firms are nevertheless small, and that patenting is not as rare an event for the youngest firms compared to the oldest firms. Although manufacturing firms are more likely to patent than firms in other sectors, we find that most patenting firms are in the services and wholesale sectors.

Because of this, transit networks evolve with the growth of the metropolis and this entails changes in the network's accessibility. This study aims to explore the changes in accessibility following major transit network expansions in the Gwangju metropolitan area. Accessibility based on time distance was calculated for three different transit provision stages. The global accessibility measure indicates that the construction of subway line 1 would improve the transit accessibility significantly, but that of subway line 2 would not have as much of an impact as the former. The spatial distribution of the changes in accessibility appear to convey a similar message. Further, we propose two local rank-based accessibility measures to capture the spatial variation in benefits derived over different stages. Our findings agree with neither the criticism of the current subway line 1, whose modal share has remained quite low since inception nor the expectations from the planned subway line 2. This may be due to the limitations of our definition of accessibility; however, one can also infer that the under-utilization of subway line 1 hindered the realization of the accessibility impacts.","[Kim, Hyun] Univ Tennessee, Dept Geog, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Lee, Keumsook] Sungshin Womens Univ, Dept Geog, Seoul 02844, South Korea; [Park, Jong Soo] Sungshin Womens Univ, Sch Informat Technol, Seoul 02844, South Korea; [Song, Yena] Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Geog, 77 Yongbong Ro, Gwangju 61186, South Korea",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; Sungshin Women's University; Sungshin Women's University; Chonnam National University,"Song, Y (通讯作者)，Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Geog, 77 Yongbong Ro, Gwangju 61186, South Korea.",hkim56@utk.edu; kslee@sungshin.ac.kr; jpark@sungshin.ac.kr; Y.Song@chonnam.ac.kr,"Song, Yena/GXW-1441-2022","Song, Yena/0000-0002-0861-1397",Chonnam National University [2015-0607],Chonnam National University,"This study was financially supported by Chonnam National University (grant reference 2015-0607).

Big data in public transportation has increasingly attracted the attention from both scientists and practitioners, resulting in an increasing number of scientific studies and practical applications in this field. However, compared to the scientific developments, we see that practical big data applications are relatively limited, and that these are applied with a relatively low pace. This indicates that big data has not been used to its full potential in practice yet, meaning that public transport passengers currently do not fully benefit from the opportunities big data offers in terms of public transport quality and attractiveness. Based on literature study and input gained from a qualitative expert session with scientists, public transport authorities, public transport operators and transport consultants together during the conference workshop, we come to the conclusion that the challenges to stimulate further and faster use of big data in practice are institutional rather than technical. This complexity results from required coordination and cooperation among public and private entities that are not always aligned. A framework has been proposed with four components to stimulate a further and faster adoption of big data in practice, directing to different stakeholders or relations between stakeholders: align technical ambitions of big data applications with their institutional environment; enable/ease the use of big data by PT authorities by developing common definitions, data standards and consolidation; incorporate the use of big data by PT operators in the contract between authority and operator; quantify and visualize the business value of big data for PT operators. We illustrate our framework by successful case studies in Chile, the Netherlands and Sweden.","[Yap, Menno] Delft Univ Technol, Delft, Netherlands; [Munizaga, Marcela] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile",Delft University of Technology; Universidad de Chile,"Munizaga, M (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile.",M.D.Yap@TUDelft.nl; mamuniza@ing.uchile.cl,"Munizaga, Marcela A/C-8958-2011","Munizaga, Marcela A./0000-0002-0485-5124; Yap, Menno/0000-0002-0508-6064",NWO as part of JPI Urban Europe ERA-NET CoFound Smart Cities and Communities initiative (TRANS-FORM project) [438.15.404/298]; Fondecyt Chile [1161589]; Complex Engineering Systems Institute Chile [CONICYT - PIA - FB0816],NWO as part of JPI Urban Europe ERA-NET CoFound Smart Cities and Communities initiative (TRANS-FORM project); Fondecyt Chile(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); Complex Engineering Systems Institute Chile,"We are indebted to all participants who contributed actively to the workshop discussions.

To address these issues, numerous studies propose and apply justice tests, which relate the effects of transport policies to prevailing socioeconomic deprivation. While the theoretical foundations of justice tests are well-established, there exists less agreement on methodological aspects and empirical specifications. In this paper, we propose a new criterion for evaluating the results of justice tests namely the correlation coefficient and explore its sensitivity to empirical assumptions by way of a case study of a major public transport investment. In comparison to other criteria identified in the literature, our proposed criterion appears to generate relatively stable results while being simple to calculate, interpret, and communicate.","[Adli, Saeid Nazari] Univ Auckland, Natl Inst Creat Arts & Ind, Sch Architecture & Planning, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [Donovan, Stuart] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Auckland; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Donovan, S (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",saeid.nazari-adli@auckldand.ac.nz; s.b.donovan@vu.nl,"Donovan, Stuart/AAV-8024-2020","Donovan, Stuart/0000-0002-9444-6390",,,,,82,13,14,2,21,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

To understand the impact of policies that are designed to affect competitive outcomes in hospital markets, it's important to understand whether the non-profit structure changes the behavior and competitive conduct of firms. Given the complexity of the product space within which hospitals operate, we focus on more easily interpreted decisions within the hospital market: entry and exit. Using comprehensive administrative data for the universe of California hospitals from 1980 to 2013, we document the observed entry and exit behavior. We estimate flexible exit policy functions and demonstrate a difference in behavior between for-profit and non-profit firms that exists after accounting for several observable characteristics of hospitals. We find differences in observed behavior: this is a finding that strongly suggests that there are differences in the underlying objective function of the various firms.","[Miller, Keaton S.; Wilson, Wesley W.] Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",University of Oregon,"Miller, KS (通讯作者)，Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",keatonm@uoregon.edu; wwilson@uoregon.edu,"Wilson, Wesley W/A-4256-2013",,,,,,32,4,6,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

While it is assumed that automated driving will have a significant impact on travel demand, the nature of this impact is not clear yet. Based on an online survey (N=3040), this study explores the expected consequences of automated driving in the Danish population. Participants were divided into three homogeneous segments based on attitudes towards automated and conventional car driving: Sceptics (38%); Indifferent stressed drivers (37%) and Enthusiasts (25%). The attitudinal segments differ in their socio-demographic profiles, current travel behaviour, interest in use-cases for self-driving cars, and anticipated changes of behaviour in a future with self-driving cars. People who are enthusiastic about self-driving cars are typically male, young, highly educated, and live in large urban areas, while Sceptics are older, car reliant and more often live in less densely populated areas. The indifferent group consists of more car reluctant people. The expected advantages of self-driving cars generally resemble the aspects highlighted in other studies, such as relief from driving tasks and the possibility of doing other things while travelling, with some variation between the three segments. Preferred future scenarios include car ownership rather than sharing solutions as well as residential relocation, which is considered by 22% of all participants as a consequence of the possibility of working in the car (13% of Sceptics; 28% of Enthusiasts). All in all, increased travel demand can be expected from an uptake of increasingly automated cars, which will be realised in the different segments with different speeds, depending on policies, business models, and proven functionality and safety.","[Nielsen, Thomas Alexander Sick] Danish Rd Directorate, Havnegade 27, DK-1058 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Haustein, Sonja] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Management Engn, Diplomvej 372, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark,"Haustein, S (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Management Engn, Diplomvej 372, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",tasn@vd.dk; sonh@dtu.dk,"Haustein, Sonja/AAE-8091-2021; Nielsen, Thomas Alexander Sick/F-1701-2016","Haustein, Sonja/0000-0001-5219-0115; Nielsen, Thomas Alexander Sick/0000-0002-6679-4515","Danish Ministry of Transport, Building, and Housing","Danish Ministry of Transport, Building, and Housing","The work was supported by the Danish Ministry of Transport, Building, and Housing.",,28,106,120,3,83,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

We present a unilateral care model under strict liability, in which the court cannot perfectly observe the amount of harm a tortfeasor has caused to a victim. However, the judge may appoint an expert to improve his chance of reaching a correct decision. In this context, we find that the likelihood of a victim filing a lawsuit decreases with the quality of the expert testimony and with the cost of the expertise procedure. The chances of filing increases with the non-monetary cost for the judge to appoint an expert. Moreover, we find that the effects of these parameters on the injurer's level of precaution are ambiguous. We also find that the injurer's level of care is suboptimal. Finally, we suggest some public policy recommendations in order to (1) increase the injurer's level of care and (2) reduce the expected cost of a trial in the event of an accident. We find that policy makers face a trade-off between these two objectives.","[Oytana, Yves; Chappe, Nathalie] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CRESE EA3190, F-25000 Besancon, France",Universite de Franche-Comte,"Oytana, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CRESE EA3190, F-25000 Besancon, France.",yves.oytana@univ-fcomte.fr,,,,,,,52,1,1,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Although our understanding of the role of transport on social interactions has recently increased, the dynamics of social activities still need further evidence. The objective of this paper is therefore to study the dynamics in social interaction frequency. Analyses are based on a sample of 139 respondents who were surveyed in 2008 and 2014 in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. The data collection instrument included a questionnaire and a two-day social interaction diary to collect data on face-to-face social interactions and social interactions mediated by communication technology. A path analysis model is estimated to predict the number of face-to-face and ICT-mediated social interactions in 2014 as a function of personal socio-demographic characteristics, mobility behavior and life cycle events experienced between 2008 and 2014 and the number of face-to-face and ICT-mediated social interactions in 2008. The results show path dependence effects for both face-to-face and ICT-mediated social interaction frequencies, suggesting that history can partly explain current behavior. Socio-demographics, mobility characteristics and life-cycle events also play a role in face-to-face social interaction frequency, whereas no effects of life-cycle events were found for ICT-mediated social interaction frequency.","[van den Berg, Pauline; Weijs-Perree, Minou; Arentze, Theo] Eindhoven Univ Technol, POB 513, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands",Eindhoven University of Technology,"van den Berg, P (通讯作者)，Eindhoven Univ Technol, POB 513, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands.",p.e.w.v.d.berg@tue.nl; m.weijs.perree@tue.nl; t.a.arentze@tue.nl,"Van+Den+Berg, Pauline/ACY-3551-2022","Weijs-Perree, Minou/0000-0001-6368-003X; van den Berg, Pauline/0000-0003-1712-5873",,,,,46,3,3,0,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

The Dominican Republic (DR) is used as case study as it provides a highly interesting context to analyse this issue. The majority of its immigrants come from neighbouring Haiti, and together the two countries share the island of Hispaniola. The analysis relies on a novel municipality panel dataset and an instrumental variable strategy to address the endogeneity of the location decisions of immigrants. I find robust evidence that higher immigrant concentration causes greater support for the right-wing political coalition that has traditionally been more opposed to immigration. At the same time, the popularity of the centre coalition is found to decline in localities characterised by a larger exposure to foreigners. Empirical evidence from election outcomes and opinion survey data suggests that citizenship, political competition and cultural identity considerations might be shaping individual attitudes towards immigrants in the DR.","[Jaupart, Pascal] Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, 120 Walton St, Oxford OX2 6GG, England; [Jaupart, Pascal] Univ Oxford, Ctr Study African Econ, 120 Walton St, Oxford OX2 6GG, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Jaupart, P (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, 120 Walton St, Oxford OX2 6GG, England.;Jaupart, P (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Ctr Study African Econ, 120 Walton St, Oxford OX2 6GG, England.",pascal.jaupart@bsg.ox.ac.uk,,,London School of Economics,London School of Economics,"I am indebted to Steve Gibbons and Olmo Silva for continued guidance and supervision.

In particular, given the availability of data and the period from the peak before the economic crisis and the lowest point in the crisis, we focus on the period around the boom 2007-2012. We find that inequality in terms of disposable income decreased over the period, with an increase in the redistributive effect of the tax-benefit system offsetting a rise in market income inequality. We utilise the Fields regression decomposition to understand the impact of demographic, labour market and other drivers. We find that the explanatory power of the Fields regressions fell over time, reflecting the asymmetric shock induced by the economic crisis. Labour market drivers had the largest impact on the level of income inequality over the period, accounting for 64 per cent of variability in 2007, but rising to 75 per cent in 2012. Educational attainment is positively associated with inequality. However, the effect greatly diminished between 2007 and 2012. Changes in the demographic structure and changes in the level and distribution of market incomes increased inequality. We also decomposed the change in inequality into price and quantity effects that result from a change in the return and composition respectively.","[O'Donoghue, Cathal] NUI Galway, Galway, Ireland; [Loughrey, Jason] TEAGASC, Carlow, Ireland; [Sologon, Denise M.] Luxembourg Inst Social & Econ Res, Luxembourg, Luxembourg",Teagasc,"Loughrey, J (通讯作者)，TEAGASC, Carlow, Ireland.",jason.loughrey@teagasc.ie,"O’Donoghue, Cathal/AAW-4109-2021","O’Donoghue, Cathal/0000-0003-3713-5366; Sologon, Denisa Maria/0000-0002-0309-5952",,,,,67,9,9,0,3,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

In other findings, we find interesting contrasts between the effects of government size and government quality, and between economic freedom and political freedom.","[Goel, Rajeev K.] Illinois State Univ, Normal, IL 61761 USA; [Goel, Rajeev K.] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Saunoris, James W.] Eastern Michigan Univ, Ypsilanti, MI 48197 USA",Illinois State University; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); Eastern Michigan University,"Goel, RK (通讯作者)，Illinois State Univ, Dept Econ, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",rkgoel@ilstu.edu,"Goel, Rajeev K/HPD-3780-2023","Saunoris, James/0000-0002-6304-3070; Goel, Rajeev/0000-0001-9580-3196",,,,,47,8,8,1,14,JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD,CHICHESTER,"THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND",0143-6570,1099-1468,,MANAG DECIS ECON,Manag.

Among them is valuing social costs resulting from climate change, which have complex time profiles. Long-term cost streams are normally capitalized at the prevailing social discount rate. Controversy attends whether that rate should decline through time. If so, capitalizing the social cost of carbon becomes more laborious. With declining rates, capitalized social cost of carbon fluxes is not only higher initially, compared with the capitalized cost at a fixed rate: the difference also rises through time. Thus in forestry evaluations declining rates have a double effect, raising the social cost of carbon in later time, and discounting this cost and other values less heavily. Discount protocols of the UK, France and Norway significantly alter forests' profitability. An ordinary Scots pine crop without carbon values is loss-making everywhere, whether constant or declining discount rates are used. This is also so with a constant rate and constant carbon price. Declining rates bring about profitability in the UK and France, even with constant carbon price. Using declining rates to price carbon and discount cash flows brings further increase, doubling profitability with the protocols of the UK and France, and bringing about profitability with the protocol of Norway. Hence full application of declining discount protocols is not just a theoretical refinement, but significant for practical results.

Furthermore, various studies found that ethical leadership impacts on supervisory trust, but in different contexts, and often with homogeneous or limited samples. The interactionist construct of person-organisational fit (P-O fit), consisting of a combination of supplementary fit (indirect fit or value congruence) and complementary fit (direct or person-job fit, as well as needs-supply fit), may however impact on the relationship between ethical leadership and supervisory trust. The unique permutations of these relationships are important not only for conceptualisation purposes, but also for intervention design to enhance the employees' trust in their supervisors; this would contribute to positive employee behaviour and attitudes. Aim: The purpose of this study was to determine whether a relationship exists between ethical leadership and supervisory trust, with possible mediation by P-O fit. Setting: The research was conducted among +/- 60 employees from each of 17 private sector and 4 public sector organisations in South Africa. Method: This study utilised a positivist methodology based on an empirical approach, while using a cross-sectional design and quantitative analysis. The sample is relatively representative (in terms of race, gender and the South African work force), as it consisted of 60 employees from each of the 21 South African organisations that participated in the study, with 1260 respondents in total. Results: Significant, positive relationships were found between ethical leadership, P-O fit and supervisory trust. Additionally, it was found that P-O fit partially mediates the relationship between ethical leadership and supervisory trust, confirming the proposed model. Conclusion: A strong, positive relationship exists between ethical leadership (consisting of morality and fairness, role clarification leadership and power-sharing leadership) and supervisory trust, which is partially mediated by P-O fit (consisting of supplementary fit and complementary fit).","[Grobler, Anton] Univ South Africa, Grad Sch Business Leadership, Pretoria, South Africa; [Holtzhausen, Maggie M.

In March 2013, the US Social Security Administration transitioned exclusively to electronic payments, representing a large shift in payment mode mandated at the federal level. This study identifies the size and characteristics of the population impacted by this shift, by linking administrative data on Social Security payments to a nationally representative survey on the use of bank accounts and financial services. We find that the majority of unbanked Social Security recipients took up electronic payments well before the March 2013 deadline. The mandate does not appear to have increased the use of bank accounts. Instead, recipients used electronic payment cards. However, the transition to electronic payments was slowest among the most financially vulnerable households, suggesting a focus on these households as payment methods continue to develop.","[Anderson, Drew M.] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Strand, Alexander] US Social Secur Adm, Woodlawn, MD USA; [Collins, J.

Using administrative data on firm subsidies in economically lagging regions of Great Britain, we contrast two alternative hypotheses. Economic geography models imply that firms at an industry's core can sustain higher tax burdens or require lower subsidies than firms in more remote locations. Conversely, political economy models predict firms at the industry's core to be more successful at lobbying government, particularly at the subnational level, thus obtaining more favourable fiscal treatment. Our evidence suggests that local government agencies structure subsidy offers to favour pre-existing employment in locally agglomerated industries, behaviour more in line with theories of policy capture than with economic geography models.

Efforts to assess discrimination empirically, however, are typically plagued by omitted variables, which leave any evidence of discrimination open to interpretation. We take a two-pronged approach to the problem. First, we analyze a dataset comprising discretionary mortgage fees collected by brokers working for a brokerage company. Mortgage brokers are intermediaries between lenders and borrowers; they neither approve loans nor share in the risk of default. Variables that measure risk should therefore have no effect on these discretionary fees, and indeed, we show that default risk as measured by credit scores have no effect on discretionary pricing. Second, we perform a formal sensitivity analysis that quantifies the impact of potentially omitted variables. Our results suggest that minority borrowers pay more on average for mortgages than non-minorities, and that this effect persists even in the presence of unmeasured confounders.","[Clarke, Kevin A.; Rothenberg, Lawrence S.] Univ Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627 USA",University of Rochester,"Clarke, KA (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Dept Polit Sci, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",kevin.clarke@rochester.edu; lawrence.rothenberg@rochester.edu,,"Clarke, Kevin/0000-0002-8818-5497",,,,,40,6,8,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1465-7252,1465-7260,,AM LAW ECON REV,Am.

The nature of banking has greatly evolved in the 21st century. Not only has the advent of technology made new products and services available, fierce competition among similar brands has also offered customers a wide variety of choices. This brings to the fore the importance of relationship building through Public relations and CSR. The study, therefore, examined the corporate social responsibility of FBN and GTBank over a period of six years. This paper adopted the methodological approach of reviewing the banks' published annual reports from 2010 to 2015. Statistical analysis was drawn up on the company's practice of corporate social responsibility which included spending on education and community development among others. The findings revealed that the First Bank of Nigeria spent more on CSR within the period studied while Guarantee Trust Bank had a higher percentage of yearly increase in spending. It was, nevertheless, discovered that both banks recorded significant cut in their spending from 2014.Consequently, it was recommended that banks should embrace CSR as a salient part of their existence and not as an activity to adopt when convenient.","[Amodu, Lanre; Oresanya, Toluwalope] Covenant Univ, Dept Mass Commun, Ota, Nigeria; [Azuh, Dominic] Covenant Univ, Dept Econ & Dev Studies, Ota, Nigeria; [Azuh, Akunna Ebere] Covenant Univ, Dept Estate Management, Ota, Nigeria",Covenant University; Covenant University; Covenant University,"Amodu, L (通讯作者)，Covenant Univ, Dept Mass Commun, Ota, Nigeria.",lanre.amodu@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; dominic.azuh@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; akunna.azuh@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; teaoresanya@gmail.com,"Azuh, Dominic E/O-1913-2013","Azuh, Dominic E/0000-0003-1678-0331","Covenant University, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria","Covenant University, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria","We like to acknowledge Covenant University, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria for sponsoring our participation in this conference.",,35,1,1,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,7585,7596,,,,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553208058,0

Main findings are that perception of social entrepreneurship in the Czech Republic is often narrowed down to issues of employment of handicapped or otherwise disadvantaged people. Most of social enterprises are registered in the capital city of Prague, South Moravia, Olomouc, and Moravia-Silesian region. Distribution of social enterprises in the Czech Republic is uneven and for instance in the Karlovy Vary region, social enterprises represented very poorly. Most social enterprises were founded between the years 2007 and 2013, focusing on business areas like gardening and cleaning services, food production, sales, and provision of accommodation and food services.

The research is aimed at discussing financial literacy of Croatian financial consumers and classifying them based on the level of financial literacy. The purpose is to investigate level of engagement in planning for retirement of financially literate and illiterate individuals. Furthermore, other characteristics of financially literate/illiterate consumers such as age, income, number of household members and level of education are also investigated. Clusters of financially (il)literate consumers are obtained using K-means approach. The conducted empirical analysis discloses that individuals with higher level of financial literacy are highly involved in retirement planning, are older, have a higher level of general education, and have higher income and lower number of household members. The findings of this research may serve as a foundation for development and improvement of national financial and retirement policy measures and for further development of both financial literacy and retirement planning programs.","[Barbic, Dajana; Palic, Irena; Lucic, Andrea] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Trg JF Kennedy 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Barbic, D (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Trg JF Kennedy 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",dbarbic@efzg.hr; ipalic@efzg.hr; alucic@efzg.hr,"BARBIĆ, DAJANA/H-7988-2018; Lucic, Andrea/C-4741-2018; Lučić, Andrea/ABA-9212-2021","Lučić, Andrea/0000-0002-3391-2503",Croatian Science Foundation: STatistical modelling for Response to crisis and EcoNomic GrowTH in Western Balkan countrieS (STRENGTHS),Croatian Science Foundation: STatistical modelling for Response to crisis and EcoNomic GrowTH in Western Balkan countrieS (STRENGTHS),This research is supported by Croatian Science Foundation: STatistical modelling for Response to crisis and EcoNomic GrowTH in Western Balkan countrieS (STRENGTHS).,,18,0,0,0,7,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,5199,5204,,,,,,6,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553206020,0

The applied classification of growing and fast-growing firms is based on microeconomic theory. Results exhibit that despite larger year-to-year fluctuations, firms with growth towards their long-term equilibrium contributed most to macroeconomic aggregates, i.e. employment, capital and sales, especially in times of economic prosperity. Firms with growth that shifts them closer to their short-term equilibrium proved to be more important primarily for assuring employment stability. Furthermore, we show that using single growth measures prevents us from identifying all growing firms and capturing the true contribution of particular growth groups of firms to studied macroeconomic aggregates.

Various factors contribute to this trend, such as increased capabilities, easier and more advantageous access to space services and innovation with regards to the toolkit for crisis management. At the same time, the usefulness of space systems is felt not just during the actual materialization of a risk or threat, but also in the pre and post-crisis phases.

The weights for attributes in such a model allow the tailoring of the model to specific company and industry. This topic is elaborated in the paper together with the usage of Likert scales as part of the Delphi method to validate the tool.Design/methodology/approach: Firstly, an analysis of existing models is presented, then the synthesis of the new tailored model is done. Findings: More than 77 maturity models exist up to date varying in approach, professionality, and recommended use. Based on the current consensus models shouldn't be used as one-fits-all and should be tailored for each industry or even company. This research follows this recommendation and presents a self-assessment tool to be part of such a model. The tailoring is done by selecting the attributes and assigning the weights.Research limitations/implications: Based on the search options defined and literature use some models might be unintentionally omitted. The tool has to be yet tested for its validity.Originality/value: As risk management is complex and problematic, maturity models provides companies with the ability to assess and diagnose their situation and set strategic goals in the field of risk management. A tailored maturity model can be used as the first indicator of company risk maturity.","[Cech, Marek; Januska, Martin; Faifr, Adam] Univ West Bohemia, Plzen, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Cech, M (通讯作者)，Univ West Bohemia, Plzen, Czech Republic.",marekc@kpm.zcu.cz; mjanuska@kpm.zcu.cz; faifr@kpm.zcu.cz,"Faifr, Adam/AAJ-5962-2021; Januska, Martin/I-9438-2016","Faifr, Adam/0000-0002-0740-8012; Januska, Martin/0000-0003-0943-3155",,,,,47,0,0,0,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,3262,3285,,,,,,24,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO7SQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000525490800039,0

We find that the entry of Big Tech platforms may transform the banking industry in radical ways: although it may possibly increase competition to the benefit of consumers in the short term, within a few years Big Tech companies may succeed in monopolizing the origination and distribution of loans to consumers and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), forcing traditional banks to become low cost manufacturers, which merely fund the loans intermediated by the Big Techs. This situation may harm competition, reduce consumer welfare, and bring about an increase in financial instability in the medium or long term. We analyze alternative policy responses aimed at maximizing the positive impact on consumer welfare of Big Tech entry while limiting the risk of monopolization as well as the potential adverse implications of such entry on market integrity and financial stability.","[de la Mano, Miguel; Padilla, Jorge] Compass Lexecon, Washington, DC 20004 USA; [Padilla, Jorge] Ctr Estudios Monetarios Financieros CEMFI, Madrid, Spain; [Padilla, Jorge] Barcelona Grad Sch Econ, Barcelona, Spain; [Padilla, Jorge] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"de la Mano, M (通讯作者)，Compass Lexecon, Washington, DC 20004 USA.",,"Padilla, Jorge/JFS-3911-2023",,,,,,77,20,22,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

The main research aim of this paper is to explore how design represents a business success trigger. This article examines the importance of four selected factors in the Czech Republic in 2014 and 2016 (design, quality, price, and reliability) in business success. Solutions were identified in two basic hypotheses (H1: Referring to the importance of design in relation to the success rate of the company, there is a difference between the companies conducting business in B2B and B2C markets; H2: Referring to the importance of design in relation to the success rate of the company, there is a difference among small, medium-sized, and large businesses) that were subject to statistical testing using chi-square and p-value. To evaluate results of the research, brief comparative analyses have been compiled. The conclusion builds on the authors' 2015 study and shows changes researched on the issue of business importance. Design represents a very important competitive factor that influences their final decision. On the contrary, the company size specification does not influence the perception of the importance of design in Czech companies. The results clearly indicate only a minor shift. The design factor as the presumed business success trigger still has a weaker position compared to the rest of the examined factors. Quality and reliability have the strongest importance. In addition, there was a slight decline in the importance of the product price factor.","[Kramolis, Jan] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Dept Econ, Zlin, Czech Republic; [Kotaskova, Anna] Paneuropean Univ Bratislava, Fac Econ & Business, Bratislava, Slovakia",Tomas Bata University Zlin; Pan-European University,"Kramolis, J (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Dept Econ, Zlin, Czech Republic.",kramolis@fame.utb.cz; anna.kotaskova@gmail.com,"Kramoliš, Jan/M-2492-2019; Azonnoudo, Seyido/ISU-7505-2023; Kramoliš, Jan/C-7481-2015; Kotaskova, Anna/AAD-8105-2019","Kramoliš, Jan/0000-0002-1687-8067; Kotaskova, Anna/0000-0002-6282-9899; Kotaskova, Anna/0000-0001-7185-6541",,,,,33,3,3,0,12,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The author analyses the current state in terms of methods for assessing risk and its components, and the systematisation of the basic factors affecting risk assessment. Particular attention is devoted to the analysis of normative and methodological documents dealing with the risk identification issue in the areas of application and use of information technologies in organisation. Elaboration of models for the practical assessment of IT risk, within a more broadly viewed concept of risk assessment for the needs of internal audit and economic analysis, was performed on the example of control self-assessment, whose theoretical foundations are currently still in the initial stage of formation, which contributes to the relevance of the topic and provides a basis for further research into the observed problem in perspective. The essential conclusions of this paper confirm the advantages and point to the necessity of integrating competencies in the area of information systems application in internal audit and business analysis.

The bank capital reform of 2005 which increased minimum equity capital to #25 billion from its previous value of #2 billion drastically changed the structure of banking business in Nigeria through mergers and acquisitions. The reform led to the emergence of 25 banks from the 89 that hitherto existed. Based on historical data on bank performance, this study was designed to determine if the reform significantly impacted the post-implementation performance of banks. Panel data from a sample of 5 banks for the period 1996-2016 was analyzed using the random effects model. The focus of the research was to determine if bank performance (represented as return on assets and return on equity) differed significantly between pre- and post-implementation periods. The result showed no significant difference in return on assets before and after the merger and acquisition exercise. However, with regard to return on equity, there was strong evidence that profit performance of banks differed between the periods.","[Okoye, Lawrence Uchenna; Omankhanlen, Alexander Ehimare; Ibileke, Esther] Covenant Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Ota, Nigeria; [Okoh, Johnson I.] Natl Open Univ Nigeria, Dept Financial Studies, Lagos, Nigeria",Covenant University,"Okoye, LU (通讯作者)，Covenant Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Ota, Nigeria.",lawrence.okoye@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; alexander.omankhanlen@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; okohjohnson1@gmail.com; esther.ibileke@stu.cu.edu.ng,"Omankhanlen, Alexandert Ehimare/HPG-9599-2023","OKOH, JOHNSON/0000-0001-6611-8560",,,,,28,0,0,0,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,7785,7795,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553208084,0

In particular, I investigate information obtained from transfermarkt.de, an online platform where a crowd of registered users assess the value of professional soccer players. I show that forecasts of international soccer results based on the crowd's valuations are more accurate than those based on standard predictors, such as the FIFA ranking and the ELO rating. When this improvement in forecasting performance is applied to betting strategies, it leads to sizable monetary gains. I further exploit information on the preferences of individual crowd members in order to investigate whether wishful thinking hampers the accuracy of crowd valuations, but fail to find evidence that such is the case.

The growth of registration of trademarks by residents of the country, legal entities or individuals, indicates a revival of industrial production due to investment in the economy and is associated with the growth of value added in industry.

The aim of the paper is to analyse the specific group of students who have left university in the past but returned in subsequent years and to identify main factors of their failure. Our paper uses data from the EUROSTUDENT VI as the main source - an international survey which was realized in the Czech Republic by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports. Dropout factors were identified using decision trees, the CART (Classification And Regression Tree) method. They showed that student's failure is influenced by student's gender, as well as by whether student is studying at his preferred university. Results of the analysis can help to identify a risky candidate or a student at the beginning of his studies and can be beneficial for both university policy at national level and for university staff and its faculties.","[Ptackova, Veronika; Mazouch, Petr; Fischer, Jakub] Vysoka Skola Ekon, Katedra Ekon Stat, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 3, Czech Republic",,"Ptácková, V (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Ekon, Katedra Ekon Stat, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 3, Czech Republic.",xptav00@vse.cz; mazouchp@vse.cz; fischerj@vse.cz,"Mazouch, Petr/AAO-1650-2021; Fischer, Jakub/J-7874-2012",,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE,PRAGUE 3,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2238-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,393,403,,,,,,11,Demography; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BO2QE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000507522000037,0

In our econometric model, the dependent variable is the entrepreneurial activity in its early stages, and as explanatory variables we included several indicators that define the institutional environment of a country. In addition, we investigate the effects of quality of governance institutions on creating new businesses, depending on the degree of development of economies. The results of our study highlight that the formation of new businesses in EU countries is significantly linked to the institutional environment. Moreover, the effects of institutional variables on the creation of new businesses are different, depending on the stage of economic development of the studied countries.

The Americans' fears that Beijing will seek to limit their role in the Asia-Pacific region seem to be justified Despite this, it is difficult to recognize China as a threat to regional or global security.","[Skulski, Przemyslaw] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Microecon, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Skulski, P (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Microecon, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",przemyslaw.skulski@ue.wroc.pl,,,,,,,39,2,2,0,4,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The reason for our research was the fact that we expect gradual generational exchange in families that started their activity after 1989. At the same time, we studied the motivation of students to start their own business on the basis of their previous activities. On a theoretical level, the contribution presents different approaches to defining family business in different countries and its different representation in selected economies. It presents new information about students' views on the possibilities to settle in family businesses in Slovakia and on new information about changes in motivation and student positions in setting up and managing their own businesses. Our research shows that students are more interested in gathering practical information about business services that are relevant to business, or even more about gaining employment in information and communication companies. Generation change is less important and interesting to them than acquiring skills and practical experience in family businesses involved in the cluster in Slovakia or abroad.","[Srovnalikova, Paulina; Kordos, Marcel; Haviernikova, Katarina] Alexander Dubcek Univ Trencin, Trencin, Slovakia",Alexander Dubcek University Trencin,"Srovnalíková, P (通讯作者)，Alexander Dubcek Univ Trencin, Trencin, Slovakia.",paulina.srovnalikova@tnuni.sk; marcel.kordos@tnuni.sk; katarina.haviernikova@tnuni.sk,"Havierniková, Katarína/P-1414-2019; Kordoš, Marcel/P-4568-2018","Havierniková, Katarína/0000-0002-9019-8684; Kordoš, Marcel/0000-0002-1833-7096",Slovak Ministry of Education's scientific grant VEGA: Risk management of SMEs in the context of clusters involvement activities in the Slovak Republic [1/0918/16],Slovak Ministry of Education's scientific grant VEGA: Risk management of SMEs in the context of clusters involvement activities in the Slovak Republic,This paper was supported by the Slovak Ministry of Education's scientific grant VEGA: Risk management of SMEs in the context of clusters involvement activities in the Slovak Republic.

In Portugal, the unequal distribution of medical professionals is justified by the fact that in the most favoured areas, there are more career opportunities, better infrastructures and equipment, better working conditions and supervision, more and better social facilities and better salary. The aim of this work was to identify professional reasons associated with the expectation of staying at the same workplace. It was selected a simple random sample of 594 physicians out of a total of 18,711 registered physicians in Northern Regional Section of the Order of Physicians (NRSOP), Portugal. Most physicians would like to stay at the same workplace due to: the prospect of training and working at the current location, the organizational level of the unit, the level of differentiation of the hospital/health centre, the availability to use the state-of-the-art medical and surgical technology, better rewards, the level of work differentiation in the unit/service, the possibility of reconciling public and private practice, good references of the current unit/working group, avoid unit/workgroup with bad references and the prospect of career progression. This study revealed that, for physicians, professional motivations/purposes have an influence on the expectations of staying or not at the same workplace. Therefore, the study recommends that policy makers should prioritize professional reasons when formulating and implementing measures to promote the fixing of medical professionals in order to achieve greater equity in access to health care.","[Veiga-Branco, Maria A.

In Canada, Winnipeg, the capital of the Province of Manitoba, went from a small hamlet located at the confluence of the Assiniboine and Red Rivers to become the third largest Canadian city at the turn of the century. I argue that the development of a real estate market and the organization of the local political institutions in Winnipeg were interconnected mechanisms that the emerging business elite used to obtain political and economic power during the years of city organization (1870-1885). The disputes over land ownership and the uncertain distribution of land titles among parties related by business and family ties showed how individuals exploited the weakness of the state to secure personal benefits. In this era, old settlers, newcomers, speculators, and business representatives of central Canada and British firms, acting alone or in partnership, attempted to obtain political control of a city in its making and to acquire power and economic benefits through the commodification of urban land.

Results: As the results of the study showed, the most serious problem in the development of Primorsky Krai was the population decline caused by a number of reasons presented in the article. The revealed tendency of population decline has a negative impact on the formation of socio-economic indicators, which significantly reduces the level of efficiency of the development of the region. Conclusions: Based on the conducted research, it can be concluded that despite the implementation of various activities aimed at improving the activities of the region, the migration outflow of the population does not stop, but continues to grow. This leads to arguments about the advisability of finalizing the current programs for the development of Primorsky Krai. The results of the research presented in the article can be useful for developing new and adjusting existing regional development programs, as well as for increasing the effectiveness of decisions taken in the field of state regulation of the economy.","[Zayarnaya, Irina Alexandrovna; Danilova, Ludmila Grigorevna] Higher Educ Financial Univ Affiliated Govt Russia, Fed State Budgetary Inst, Novorossiysk Branch, Dept Econ Finance & Management,Econ Sci, Novorossiysk, Russia; [Zayarnaya, Irina Alexandrovna; Vasilieva, Julia Viktorovna; Danilova, Ludmila Grigorevna] Higher Educ Financial Univ Affiliated Govt Russia, Fed State Budgetary Inst, Novorossiysk Branch, Dept Econ Finance & Management, Novorossiysk, Russia; [Seifieva, Elena Nikolaevna] Higher Educ Financial Univ Affiliated Govt Russia, Fed State Budgetary Inst, Novorossiysk Branch, Polit Sci, Novorossiysk, Russia; [Seifieva, Elena Nikolaevna] Higher Educ Financial Univ Affiliated Govt Russia, Fed State Budgetary Inst, Novorossiysk Branch, Novorossiysk, Russia; [Vasilieva, Julia Viktorovna] Higher Educ Financial Univ Affiliated Govt Russia, Fed State Budgetary Inst, Novorossiysk Branch, Econ Sci, Novorossiysk, Russia; [Vasilieva, Julia Viktorovna] Higher Educ Financial Univ Affiliated Govt Russia, Fed State Budgetary Inst, Novorossiysk Branch, Novorossiysk, Russia; [Voblaya, Irina Nikolaevna] Moscow Humanitarian & Econ Univ, Autonomous Nonprofit Org Higher Educ, Novorossiysk Inst Branch, Dept Int Relat & Linguist,Econ Sci, Novorossiysk, Russia; [Voblaya, Irina Nikolaevna] Moscow Humanitarian & Econ Univ, Autonomous Nonprofit Org Higher Educ, Novorossiysk Inst Branch, Dept Int Relat & Linguist, Novorossiysk, Russia",,"Zayarnaya, IA (通讯作者)，Higher Educ Financial Univ Affiliated Govt Russia, Fed State Budgetary Inst, Novorossiysk Branch, Dept Econ Finance & Management,Econ Sci, Novorossiysk, Russia.;Zayarnaya, IA (通讯作者)，Higher Educ Financial Univ Affiliated Govt Russia, Fed State Budgetary Inst, Novorossiysk Branch, Dept Econ Finance & Management, Novorossiysk, Russia.",,,"Voblaa, Irina/0000-0002-8432-4517",,,,,24,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,396,408,,,,,,13,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553200034,0

The literature, however, still lacks a precise rule for the parents to follow in splitting the equity shares of an EJV, although share distribution is critical to almost all aspects of the co-ownership relationship. In this study, we fill this literature gap by taking the Bayesian approach to draw a pricing-error rule on share distribution in EJVs. More specifically, we contend that equity participation by two firms in an EJV allows profit sharing to correct for the errors that they might commit in pricing their inputs to the EJV. For profit sharing to fully nullify such pricing errors, the shares of an EJV must be split between the parent firms in a percentage combination that matches the relative sizes of their pricing errors. Because pricing errors are observable only afterward, share distribution in EJVs resembles a Bayesian process, in which the partners keep updating their estimates on pricing errors to adjust share distribution to a percentage combination that could best nullify their pricing errors. Thus, the eventual outcome of share adjustment is EJV buyout, in that the partner whose pricing errors remain substantial buys out the shares of the other whose pricing errors have become tolerable.","[Chen, Shih-Fen S.; Pun, Hubert; Wang, Liang (Lucas)] Univ Western Ontario, Ivey Business Sch, London, ON N6G 0N1, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Chen, SFS (通讯作者)，Univ Western Ontario, Ivey Business Sch, London, ON N6G 0N1, Canada.",sfchen@ivey.uwo.ca,,"Wang, Lucas Liang/0000-0002-7818-2524",Social Sciences and Humanity Research Council [435-20150218],Social Sciences and Humanity Research Council,"Social Sciences and Humanity Research Council, Grant/Award Number: 435-20150218",,38,1,2,0,6,JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD,CHICHESTER,"THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND",0143-6570,1099-1468,,MANAG DECIS ECON,Manag.

A financial analysis is undertaken to identify the economic incentive and a Heckman econometric regression model is used to examine the determinants of tree planting. Our results show that tree planting is financially more profitable than leaving land abandoned. However, the decision and intensity of tree planting by rural households are affected by various factors representing household characteristics, farm endowment, bio-physical factors, social-institutional support, and the perception of farmers about forestland expropriation risk.

Additional channels, such as the discrimination on the labor market and a different productivity of regularized workers are discussed. The impact of a migration policy depends on the wage effects of the legalized/deported workers and their net fiscal contribution. The calibration of the model for the United States in 2014 allows to disentangle the channels at work. Overall, the impact of the two policies on natives' welfare is limited (between -0.1% and +0.15%). Retired agents benefit from an amnesty and are harmed by a deportation.

We also show that ideology plays stronger roles in jurisdictions where judges are selected via political appointments or partisan elections. Our findings suggest that ideology is an important component of judicial selection primarily when using ideology leads to expected benefits to politicians, when the jurisdiction's selection process allows ideology to be used, and when it concerns the most important courts.

We exploit shopping diary data to construct a novel and fine-grained measure of French consumers' payment preferences and match these with data from a nation-wide merchant survey. Controlling for (among other factors) cost, degree of competition, and customer characteristics, we find that the higher the probability that the average basket of a merchant is paid for by card in shops in the same sector and region, the higher the probability that the merchant will accept cards. In other words, we find that consumer preferences drive merchant card acceptance, which underpins the existence of network externalities on the merchant side of the payment card market.","[Bounie, David; Francois, Abel] Telecom ParisTech, Dept Econ & Social Sci ESS, Paris, France; [Francois, Abel] Lille 1 Univ Sci & Technol, LEM, Villeneuve Dascq, France; [Van Hove, Leo] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Appl Econ APEC, Brussels, Belgium",IMT - Institut Mines-Telecom; Institut Polytechnique de Paris; Universite de Lille; Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Bounie, D (通讯作者)，Telecom ParisTech, Dept Econ & Social Sci ESS, Paris, France.",david.bounie@telecom-paristech.fr; abel.francois@univ-lille1.fr; leo.van.hove@vub.ac.be,"Van Hove, Leo/Q-2129-2018","Van Hove, Leo/0000-0001-7546-7746",,,,,24,21,22,3,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

This constitutionalization of social rights has generally been met with approval from academics, human-rights activists, and policy makers. But despite this widespread support, there is hardly any evidence on whether the inclusion of rights in constitutions changes how governments provide social services to their citizens. We take up this question by studying the effect of adopting the constitutional rights to education and health care on government spending. Using a data set of 196 countries' constitutional rights and data from the World Development Indicators, we employ a variety of empirical tests to examine if the rights to education and health care are associated with increases in government spending.

The aim is to map each state of affairs onto a vector of individual utilities, and then to produce an ordering of these vectors that can be represented by a mathematical function assigning a real number to each. When this approach is used in intertemporal contexts, a central theoretical question concerns the rate of pure time preference, i.e. the evaluative weight to be applied to utility coming at different times. This article criticizes the standard philosophical account of pure time preference, arguing that it ascribes to economists a methodological commitment they need not accept. The article then evaluates three further objections to pure time preference, concluding that it might still be defensible under certain circumstances. I close by articulating a final argument that, if sound, would constitute a decisive objection to pure time preference as it currently figures in much intertemporal welfare economics.","[Kelleher, J.

Nowhere is this more true than with sex workers, who are either punished for their work or morally castigated for it. The criminal justice system's interventions into the sex trade, even when using programs based on restorative justice, fails to address the harms and conflicts women experience in the sex trade and street economy. A major reason restorative programs fail to serve women in the sex trade is because it remains tethered to the criminal justice system, which carries traditional punitive consequences. When women entrenched in these conflicts are given the space, support, and freedom, they are able to develop relationships and resolutions that better exemplify restorative values. This paper explores the limitations of the current relationship between restorative justice and the criminal justice system and then highlights how the relationships and resistance strategies of the Young Women's Empowerment Project demonstrated restorative justice praxis in the sex trade.","[Riley, Kristine] Vera Inst, Ctr Sentencing & Correct, New York, NY 10279 USA",,"Riley, K (通讯作者)，Vera Inst, Ctr Sentencing & Correct, New York, NY 10279 USA.",,,,,,,,63,1,4,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Our empirical tests on the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq 100 indices over long time series of more than 20 years of daily data indicate that an implied volatility based Value-at-Risk cannot beat, and tends to be outperformed by, a simple GJR-GARCH based Value-at-Risk. This finding is robust to the use of the likelihood ratio, the dynamic quantile test or a statistical loss function for evaluating the Value-at-Risk performance. The poor performance of the option based Value-at-Risk is due to the volatility risk premium embedded in implied volatilities. We apply both non-parametric and parametric adjustments to correct for the negative price of the volatility risk. However, although this adjustment is effective in reducing the bias, it still does not allow the implied volatility to outperform the historical volatility models. These results are in contrast to the volatility forecasting literature, which favors implied volatilities over the historical volatility model. We show that forecasting the volatility and forecasting a quantile of the return distribution are two different objectives. While the implied volatility is useful for the earlier objective function, it is not for the latter, due to the non-linear and regime changing dynamics of the volatility risk premium.

The results show that economic conditions matter for the predictive ability of the slope. In particular, inflation persistence emerges as a key variable that affects the predictive content of the slope. The slope tends to forecast the output growth better when inflation is highly persistent. (C) 2017 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The five major e-book publisher defendants (the Publishers) conspired because of their concern that Amazon's low prices would adversely affect physical book demand and prices and also create an Amazon retail monopoly under which Amazon would negotiate substantially lower wholesale e-book prices. The Publisher conspiracy successfully moved Amazon to an agency relationship and gained control over e-book retail pricing. The Publishers accomplished this by jointly threatening Amazon with windowing (delaying the release of new e-book titles), which imposed a significant potential cost on Amazon in the face of Apple's scheduled entry without windowing. Apple therefore economically facilitated the Publisher conspiracy solely through its entry, not through any of its iBookstore contract terms. Contrary to the court, the most favored nation (MFN) and maximum price terms in the Apple contracts had no effect in facilitating the Publisher conspiracy. In fact, if Apple had entered without these contract terms, e-book prices would have been substantially higher. Consequently, Apple's contracts should not have been evaluated under a per se standard.","[Klein, Benjamin] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Klein, B (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",bklein@compasslexecon.com,,,,,,,45,3,3,4,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

There may well also be asymmetries in population aging, which may generate international capital flows and have substantial impacts on relative unemployment rates. In this paper, we ask whether the combination of institutions, aging, and capital flows explains the rise in the unemployment gap between 1960 and 2010. To this end, we set up a two-region OLG model with search unemployment in which we introduce the historical and projected changes in labor-market institutions and demographics. We show that asymmetric institutional changes alone can reproduce a large part of the historical rise in the unemployment gap. However, this result no longer holds once we add asymmetric aging in closed economies.

This has been immediately a source of controversy between states. A fairer system would be based on quotas, where host countries share the burden according to appropriate criteria, but member states never reached a common agreement. In this paper we offer a vision of the European asylum system as a non-cooperative game where states compete to reduce their asylum burden. As the two different systems (Dublin-like or quotas) lead to different equilibriums, according to the Pareto criterion the preferred system is the one where all states are better able to achieve their national objectives. We examine the conditions under which a relocation system based on quotas may be preferable to the Dublin rules, and why greater consideration of the humanitarian aspects of asylum can favour its adoption and reinforce cohesion of the system.

By modelling inflation together with real activity, employment and wages at the sectoral level, we are able to disentangle the role of unit labour costs and profit margins as the fundamental determinants of price dynamics on the supply side. In out-of-sample forecast comparisons, the PVAR approach performs well against popular alternatives, especially at a short forecast horizon and relative to standard VAR forecasts based on aggregate economy-wide data. Over longer forecast horizons, the accuracy of the PVAR model tends to decline relative to that of the univariate alternatives, while it remains high relative to the aggregate VAR forecasts. We show that these findings are driven by the event of the Great Recession. Our qualitative results carry over to a multi-country extension of the PVAR approach.

However, especially in the service sector it is important how well a job is done, and employees must be incentivized to perform accordingly. Furthermore, many aspects regarding service quality cannot be verified and relational contracts have to be used to provide incentives. The present article shows that in this case, a minimum wage increases implemented effort, as well as the efficiency of an employment relationship. Hence, it can be explained why productivity and service quality went up after the introduction of the British National Minimum Wage, and that this might actually have caused a more efficient labor market. Furthermore, if workers have low bargaining power, a higher minimum wage also increases profits and consequently employment. Therefore, the present article presents a new perspective on reasons for why minimum wages often have no or only negligible negative employment effects","[Fahn, Matthias] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Fahn, M (通讯作者)，Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Munich, Germany.",,,,DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service),DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),"I want to thank Florian Englmaier, Jin Li, Niko Matouschek, Jeroen Swinkel, and Joel Watson, as well as two anonymous referees and participants at seminars at the University of Konstanz, the University of Munich, the 2011 EALE meeting in Cyprus and the 2015 UECE Lisbon meetings in Game Theory and Applications for helpful comments.

A critical assessment of accessibility objectives and indicators in metropolitan transportation plans,TRANSPORT POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Access to destinations; Performance indicators; Sustainable transportation; Paradigm shift,MOBILITY; TRANSIT,"Accessibility, the ease of reaching destinations, is increasingly seen as a complimentary and in some cases alternative to the mobility oriented planning paradigm, as it allows capturing the complex interactions between land use and transportation systems while providing a social perspective on transportation planning. However, although accessibility has been extensively researched in the last decades, it is still largely marginalized in transportation planning practice. Accordingly, the aim of this study is to critically assess how accessibility is incorporated into metropolitan transportation plans and translated into performance indicators around the world, to ultimately derive policy recommendations. This research assesses 32 recent metropolitan transport plans from North America, Europe, Australia and Asia with respect to their goals, objectives and performance indicators. The results suggest that there is a trend toward a greater integration of accessibility objectives in transport plans, yet few plans have accessibility-based indicators that can guide their decision-making processes. Our findings show that in order to foster accessibility-based approaches to transportation planning, plans need to have clearly defined accessibility goals with a distinction between accessibility and mobility. Furthermore, multi-criteria analysis approaches including accessibility indicators need to guide the decision-making process. This study contributes to a greater understanding of the challenges and successes associated with implementing accessibility in transport planning.","[Boisjoly, Genevieve; El-Geneidy, Ahmed M.] Sch Urban Planning McGill Univ, Suite 400,815 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, PQ 815, Canada",,"Boisjoly, G (通讯作者)，Sch Urban Planning McGill Univ, Suite 400,815 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, PQ 815, Canada.",genevieve.boisjoly@mail.mcgill.ca; ahmed.elgeneidy@mcgill.ca,"El-Geneidy, Ahmed/N-3904-2013","El-Geneidy, Ahmed/0000-0002-0942-4016; Boisjoly, Genevieve/0000-0001-5375-7750",Brookings Institution; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council,Brookings Institution; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"The authors want to thank Adie Tomer from Brookings Institution and Enrica Papa from the University of Westminter for their insights on accessibility planning.

It is the only road access to these resorts and is heavily traveled during the ski season. Professional avalanche forecasters monitor this road throughout the ski season in order to make road closure decisions in the face of avalanche danger. Forecasters at the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) avalanche guard station at Alta have maintained an extensive daily winter database on explanatory variables relating to avalanche prediction. Whether or not an avalanche crosses the road is modeled in this paper via Bayesian additive tree methods. Utilizing daily winter data from 1995 to 2011, results show that using Bayesian tree analysis outperforms traditional statistical methods in terms of realized misclassification costs that take into consideration asymmetric losses arising from two types of error. Closing the road when an avalanche does not occur is an error harmful to resort owners, and not closing the road when one does may result in injury or death.

One of the main justifications is the expected beneficial effect on road congestion. Stockholm introduced congestion pricing in 2006 and the effects on car and public transport demand were carefully monitored. The change in prices provides unique estimates on price-and cross-price elasticities. This paper uses these data to model how the optimal pricing, frequency, bus size and number of bus lanes for a corridor depends on the presence of congestion pricing for cars. Results show that the presence of road pricing makes the current subsidies for peak bus trips too high. However, the major welfare benefits of re-optimizing the current bus supply stem from a decrease in frequencies during the off-peak period and the use of larger buses.","[Borjesson, Maria; Proost, Stef] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Ctr Transport Studies, Stockholm, Sweden; [Fung, Chau Man; Proost, Stef] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Econ, Leuven, Belgium",Royal Institute of Technology; KU Leuven,"Börjesson, M (通讯作者)，KTH Royal Inst Technol, Ctr Transport Studies, Stockholm, Sweden.",maria.borjesson@abe.kth.se; chauman.fung@kuleuven.be; stef.proost@kuleuven.be,,"Borjesson, Maria/0000-0001-9235-0232; Proost, Stefaan/0000-0003-3731-4532",Sweden's Innovation Agency VINNOVA [2014-03587]; Vinnova [2014-03587] Funding Source: Vinnova,Sweden's Innovation Agency VINNOVA(Vinnova); Vinnova(Vinnova),"This research is funded by the Sweden's Innovation Agency VINNOVA, Project 2014-03587.",,30,37,37,1,16,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0122,2212-0130,,ECON TRANSP,Econ.

However, the increase of product variety, and multiple interfaces needed to deliver products have exposed them to vulnerability of variability. Thus, information on how fluid an intermodal freight transport solution is, becomes critical to private decision makers for knowing if supply chains are achieving their goals. Additionally, it is significant to public decision makers in determining if and where enhancements in infrastructure and/or in policy and regulations might improve economic development. Therefore, as a result of detailed analysis of the processes involved from a systems approach, this paper contributes to the body of knowledge by proposing a mathematical framework to model and forecast supply chain fluidity when using any intermodal freight transport combination. Its spatial and temporal flexibility lets expand the analysis to handle a wide range of intermodal paths. The proposed method contributes to demonstrate the key connection between improvements in supply chain performance and enhanced economic development. As a conclusion key issues for improving fluidity of intermodal freight flows are discussed, and future research is presented. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We first collate different indicators of knowledge production and diffusion in order to characterise the main feature of ENCs. In this respect, we contribute not only with an overview of potential knowledge interactions between EU and ENCs, but also suggest original ways to account for the different facets of knowledge diffusion. We use these indicators to assess the efficiency of ENC and EU in their use of knowledge resources, relying on data envelopment analysis (DEA). Contrary to the rare DEA studies in the field, inputs are both internal and external. The results show that, despite their weakness, ENCs may benefit from their orientation towards the EU for access to external knowledge, with some of them successfully turning their rare knowledge resources into knowledge creation and innovation.","[Autant-Bernard, Corinne; Chalaye, Sylvie] Univ Lyon, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Autant-Bernard, Corinne; Chalaye, Sylvie] CNRS, GATE Lyon St Etienne, F-69130 Ecully, France; [Autant-Bernard, Corinne; Chalaye, Sylvie] Univ Jean Monnet, F-42000 St Etienne, France; [Gagliardini, Elisa; Usai, Stefano] Univ Cagliari, CRENoS, Via San Giorgio 12, I-09124 Cagliari, Italy",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; University of Cagliari,"Autant-Bernard, C (通讯作者)，Univ Lyon, F-69007 Lyon, France.;Autant-Bernard, C (通讯作者)，CNRS, GATE Lyon St Etienne, F-69130 Ecully, France.;Autant-Bernard, C (通讯作者)，Univ Jean Monnet, F-42000 St Etienne, France.",autant@univ-st-etienne.fr; s.chalaye@laposte.net; elisa.gagliardini@crenos.unica.it; stefanousai@unica.it,"Usai, Stefano/GPK-7547-2022; Autant-Bernard, Corinne/JYC-0549-2024","Autant-Bernard, Corinne/0000-0003-3002-1948; Usai, Stefano/0000-0001-5619-1350",,,,,53,4,4,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

We argue that courts' delays in settling labor disputes affect the strictness of employment-protection legislation by increasing the expected firing costs. We exploit the variation in the length of labor trials across Italian judicial districts and the fact that the Italian legislation regarding firing prescribes different firing regimes for firms above the 15-employee threshold and provide evidence on the impact of courts' delays on job reallocation and firms' productivity. We show that in judicial districts with longer trials, the rate of job turnover is significantly lower. This occurs through lower rates of job destruction and, to a lesser extent, job creation. We also find a detrimental impact of courts' delays on the labor productivity of firms above the 15-employee threshold. The effect is stronger in sectors with higher flexibility requirements.","[Gianfreda, Giuseppina] Tuscia Univ, Viterbo, Italy; [Vallanti, Giovanna] LUISS Guido Carli, Rome, Italy",Tuscia University; Luiss Guido Carli University,"Gianfreda, G (通讯作者)，Tuscia Univ, Viterbo, Italy.",,,"Vallanti, Giovanna/0000-0001-6238-0094",,,,,57,16,16,0,3,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

It is also clear from the literature that not all knowledge has the same value. However, too often in economic geography and cognate fields we have been obsessed with counting knowledge inputs and outputs rather than assessing the quality of knowledge produced. In this article we measure the complexity of knowledge, we map the distribution and the evolution of knowledge complexity in US cities, and we explore how the spatial diffusion of knowledge is linked to complexity. Our knowledge complexity index rests on the bimodal network models of Hidalgo and Hausmann. Analysis is based on more than two million patent records from the US Patent and Trademark Office that identify the technological structure of US metropolitan areas in terms of the patent classes in which they are most active between 1975 and 2010. We find that knowledge complexity is unevenly distributed across the United States and that cities with the most complex technological structures are not necessarily those with the highest rates of patenting. Citation data indicate that more complex patents are less likely to be cited than less complex patents when citing and cited patents are located in different metropolitan areas.","[Balland, Pierre-Alexandre] Univ Utrecht, Dept Econ Geog, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands; [Balland, Pierre-Alexandre] Lund Univ, CIRCLE, POB 117S, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Rigby, David] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, 1255 Bunche Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",Utrecht University; Lund University; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Balland, PA (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Dept Econ Geog, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands.;Balland, PA (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, CIRCLE, POB 117S, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",p.balland@uu.nl; rigby@geog.ucla.edu,,"Balland, Pierre-Alexandre/0000-0003-2787-4376",,,,,96,210,252,42,211,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

This exchange rate rigidity is sometimes argued to worsen the trade balance by keeping the currency overvalued. However, there is no unambiguous evidence that currency depreciation/devaluation positively affects trade balance and leads towards the adjustment, even in the short-run. Therefore, we examine the effect of real effective exchange rate (hereafter REER) on trade balance in European transition economies over the period 2000-2015. By using fixed effect model for static and generalised method of moments for dynamic estimation, we find that there is an adverse effect of the REER on trade balance in European transition countries over the period 2000-2015. Namely, depreciation of REER deteriorates trade balance in European transition countries, which could be explained by high import dependence and low export capacity. This implies that policymakers in European transition countries should not use exchange rate policy to improve trade balance. This is important in the light of their accession towards European economic and monetary integration, implying that these countries should focus more on using fiscal, rather than monetary (and exchange rate), policy to adjust trade balance, which is one of the required real convergence towards the EU standards.","[Begovic, Selena; Kreso, Sead] Univ Sarajevo, Sch Econ & Business, Trg Oslobodjenja 1, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Sarajevo,"Begovic, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sarajevo, Sch Econ & Business, Trg Oslobodjenja 1, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia & Herceg.",selena.begovic@efsa.unsa.ba; sead.kreso@efsa.unsa.ba,,,,,,,22,10,11,1,3,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

The special pattern of Chinese OFDI has been a long-discussed topic over past ten years. Many scholars obtained Afferent results by using different indicators and different data. In this paper, we adopt an institutional-theory perspective and use resource-dependence theory to strengthen our understanding on Chinese OFDI. We try to take China's political influence into consideration to identify the mechanism of China's political influence to affect Chinese OFDI location. Summarizing the previous scholars' discussion, we distinguish two dimensions of China's political influence bilateral political relation and host country's dependence on China and use the detail indicators instead of simply divide host country into developed countries and developing countries. We assume that the special pattern of Chinese OFDI is mainly caused by China's different political influence on different countries. We test our hypotheses by using panel data consisting of a sample of 113 destination countries of Chinese OFDI from 2003 to 2015. We find strong support for the hypothesis that China's political influence on different countries is a key reason of the, special pattern of Chinese OFDI The strong political influence of China can promote OFDI directly. The subsample of developing countries indicates that the political relationship between China and host countries negatively mediates the effect of political risk on China's OFDI stock in those countries.","[Fan, Xing; Wang, Lei] Donghua Univ, Sch Business & Management, 1882 West Yanan Rd, Shanghai 200051, Peoples R China",Donghua University,"Wang, L (通讯作者)，Donghua Univ, Sch Business & Management, 1882 West Yanan Rd, Shanghai 200051, Peoples R China.",13636608916@hotmail.com; wanglei7296@dhu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71572032]; Shanghai Pujiang Program [16PJC003]; Donghua research program [2017405],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Pujiang Program(Shanghai Pujiang Program); Donghua research program,"We acknowledge the funding support by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.71572032), Shanghai Pujiang Program (No.16PJC003).Donghua research program (No. 2017405).",,51,0,0,4,46,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Additionally, in the context of single descriptive case study method, semi-structured interviews were conducted with two mentors being employed in the bank and nine research issues were investigated. The findings state that reverse mentoring has started to be perceived as a valuable tool to manage generational conflict. Besides, it allows mentees to gain insight about young generations, social media (the terminology, the range of different platforms and their impact), technological improvements and their effects on the banking industry. In addition to these positive outcomes, mentors benefit from reverse mentoring in terms of industry practices, leadership development, participation in decision-making, developing a network of executive-level contacts and observing problem-solving techniques from executives of different backgrounds. Despite the high level of power-distance in Turkey, it is anticipated that reverse mentoring applications will be used as a silver bullet in the near future of Turkish banking industry, due to the benefits it creates for organizations and participants.","[Gugercin, Utku] Adana Sci & Technol Univ, Adana, Turkey",Adana Alparslan Turkes Science & Technology University,"Gügerçin, U (通讯作者)，Adana Sci & Technol Univ, Adana, Turkey.",ugugercin@adanabtu.edu.tr,,,Adana Science and Technology University Coordinatorship of Scientific Research Projects [16113004],Adana Science and Technology University Coordinatorship of Scientific Research Projects,This paper is supported by Adana Science and Technology University Coordinatorship of Scientific Research Projects with project number 16113004.,,77,3,3,0,2,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",2286-1440,,,INT MANAGE CONF,,,2017,,,,,,,56,71,,,,,,16,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM6KT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000466917100007,0

Using data on 329 Chinese manufacturing SMEs, we find that the absorptive capacity of SMEs positively moderates the relationship between innovative marketing and innovation performance. However, the absorptive capacity of SMEs negatively moderates the relationship between imitation and minor modification and their innovation performance.

Both allow harvest workers, who work primarily on piece rates, to earn more money per input of time. These were unexpected findings in a larger study in which I examine how California's strawberry industry is responding to tighter regulatory restrictions for soil fumigants. Drawn from semi-structured interviews with strawberry growers and industry representatives, these data paint a picture of worker capriciousness in an industry in which loyalty has been a major form of labor control. In making the empirical case, I engage with the work of Wells, who wrote extensively about how industry structure and the natural characteristics of the strawberry had coalesced to discipline workers. Noting that her arguments revolved on conditions of labor surplus, I discuss recent changes in labor market conditions, brought about in part by the changed US border and immigration policy, that have given workers a modicum of leverage. Nevertheless, working conditions remain grueling and pay rates not substantially changed, suggesting that growers would prefer to tinker with the technological conditions of production than significantly alter prevailing wages. In noting workers' apparent effect on the material conditions in which they work, this article contributes to discussions in labor geography on worker agency in shaping economic landscapes at the same time it speaks to the broader constraints farmworkers face in agricultural labor markets.","[Guthman, Julie] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Div Social Sci, Community Studies Program, 1156 High St UCSC, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz,"Guthman, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Div Social Sci, Community Studies Program, 1156 High St UCSC, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",jguthman@ucsc.edu,,,"US National Science Foundation [1262064]; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1262064] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","This work was supported by the US National Science Foundation, [Award # 1262064.]",,55,26,35,1,31,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

Such problems are best addressed by grey prediction models such as Grey Verhulst Model (GVM). This paper resolves the incompatibility between GVM's estimation and prediction by taking its basic form equation as the basis of both. The resultant Basic Form-focused GVM (BFGVM) is also further developed to create Direct Non-equidistant BFGVM (DNBFGVM) and, in turn, DNBFGVM with Recursive simulation (DNBFGVMR). Experimental analyses comprise 19 socio-economic time series with an emphasis on Iranian population, a low-frequency non-equidistant time series with remarkable strategic importance. Promisingly, the proposed DNBFGVM and DNBFGVMR provide accurate in-sample and out-of-sample socio-economic forecasts, show highly significant improvements over the best traditional GVM, and offer cost-effective intelligent support of decision-making. Final results suggest future trends of studied socio-economic time series. Specifically, they reveal Iranian population to grow even slower than anticipated, demanding an urgent consideration of policy-makers.","[Hashem-Nazari, Mohammad; Esfahanipour, Akbar; Fatemi Ghomi, S.

Based on the previous published papers/works focused on the former Operational Programmes (OP) from 2007-2013 programming period as a starting point, this paper will translate their conclusions and update these under actual conditions for programmes and projects implementation. Romania has implemented in 2007-2015 two OP co-financed by ESF (Human Resource Development OP and Administrative Capacity Development OP). These OPs are now in the closing phase and actors involved in OPs and projects can draw some conclusions & lessons learned from risk management issues in order to avoid repeating it or to develop resiliency and recovering measurements. One of the main major issue in the 2007-2013 programming period was the lack of a scientific approach in risk management at the programmes and the projects levels since the beginning. Only in the last years were performed qualitative and quantitative analysis, with ongoing studies performed and thus the actual programming period could benefit from scientific inputs. Therefore the actors involved (ministries & agencies, beneficiaries) can access now academic studies and tools in order to perform a more suitable risk management.","[Linu, Andrei; Dumitrascu, Danut] Univ Lucian Blaga Sibiu, Sibiu, Romania",Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu,"Linu, A (通讯作者)，Univ Lucian Blaga Sibiu, Sibiu, Romania.",Andrei.linu@ulbs.ro; dan.dumitrascu@ulbsibiu.ro,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",2286-1440,,,INT MANAGE CONF,,,2017,,,,,,,107,119,,,,,,13,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM6KT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000466917100012,0

Ever since then, London has reigned as a leading global financial hub, despite not having behind it anything like the political or economic backing enjoyed by New York. This paper seeks to explain this phenomenon by building on Kindleberger's classic analysis of financial centres as international hubs that arise due to economic, geographic and infrastructural advantages, and more recent theories of specialized financial centres which suggest that financial centres deploy discriminatory business practices in order to compete with the scale economy-based centres. Our central claim is that London's continuing financial supremacy can be traced to the way that the opposing 'economic' and 'political' sets of criteria necessary for a financial centre are here inextricably fused together in a mutually reinforcing dynamic. Three case studies are used to support this claim: the market for international loans and deposits; the forex (FX) and over the counter (OTC) derivatives markets; and the area of asset and collateral management.","[Lysandrou, Photis] City Univ London, Dept Int Polit, City Univ Polit Econ Res Ctr CITYPERC, London, England; [Nesvetailova, Anastasia; Palan, Ronen] City Univ London, Dept Int Polit, London, England",City University London; City University London,"Lysandrou, P (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Dept Int Polit, City Univ Polit Econ Res Ctr CITYPERC, London, England.",photis.lysandrou.1@city.ac.uk; a.nesvetailova@city.ac.uk; ronen.palan.1@city.ac.uk,,,,,,,72,8,8,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Nowadays technology allows us to communicate anytime, anywhere across the globe and the fact that remote work is increasing is a sign that innovation does not only happen in a face-to-face environment, that people can be productive outside of an official office and that organizational culture does not suffer because employees use remote locations for job performance. When a company decides to establish flexible labour, a series of factors will play a critical role in the success or failure of that model. Once the respective model has been established, the company must ensure contiued performance and must be able to control the activities of its employees, irrespective of their remote location so that the quality of the services is not negatively impacted. The objective of this study is to determine the main dependencies between the corporate multinational framework and the sustainability of flexible workplaces whithin the services industry. The study is based upon specialized literature reviews related to flexible work arrangements deployed by multinational companies. A comparative analysis was conducted by the authors on several international companies from the services industry to assess key factors that impact remote work and its effect on the overall organizational performance.

Additionally, it also focuses on identifying evidence tending to apply Agile methods. The article is based on literature on the subject as well as reports on the HaMIS implementation. The literature review showed that the effectiveness of the projects by scrum is affected among others by time, coordinating a team and the resignation of excessive documentation. The analysis shows two main conclusions.

A methodology section describes the rationale for selecting the method of simulation as Monte Carlo, and also the main hypotheses, detailed scenarios and integrated characteristic variables. The scenario-making eventually shaped three options by combining criteria of stability/instability, nuanced by optimistic/ pessimistic type scenarios. The analysis of the variables described by a probability distribution was conducted statistically on several types of samples simulated by the Monte Carlo method, from 100 draws to 200; 300; 400; and finally 500 and 1,000 draws.

The theory of B2B marketing will be described from its beginnings, through the theory of exchange and behavioral marketing to industrial marketing and its current conception. We look at B2B marketing both globally and technically. The output should then be recommendations for current scientific research.","[Stroch, Filip] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Univ Nam 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Stroch, F (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Univ Nam 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic.",stroch@opf.slu.cz,,,Student grant competition project Acceptance of technology from the perspective of marketing tools [SGS/7/2017],Student grant competition project Acceptance of technology from the perspective of marketing tools,This paper was supported by the Student grant competition project SGS/7/2017: Acceptance of technology from the perspective of marketing tools.,,10,0,0,1,17,SILESIAN UNIV,KARVINA,"SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION, KARVINA, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-265-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,190,195,,,,,,6,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BQ3BQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000583813800018,0

These risks get transmitted to the agribusiness value chains to establish operational efficiency, in turn to make value chain financing risky and unsustainable. At a theoretical level it relates to the returns to scale trade framework (Krugman, Increasing returns and the theory of international trade, 1985) and the sustainability imperatives of businesses. This paper therefore suggests that there remains a close relation between sustainability environment and financing risks in a trickle down and trickle up frames. The format of organizations at the farm and value chain levels determines the financing risks. Community empowerment and integration of value chain partners proves to be much risk easing in financing the value chains. The community financial institutions (CFIs) potentially can be the ideal organizational format to sustain value chain financing in a risk free ambience through peer pressure and local networking across chain partners. The paper establishes that social, economic, and environmental sustainability will add to social development and therefore the risk levels in financing the farm economies and the value chains will reduce.","[Sundaresan, C.

We find that being an exporter, international technological cooperation, continuous R&D engagement, applying for patents, being a foreign subsidiary, and firm size are factors that positively affect the decision to offshore R&D. In addition, we find that a lack of financing is an obstacle relatively more important for independent firms than for firms that belong to business groups. For these latter, we also obtain that the factors that influence the decision to offshore R&D differ depending on whether the firm purchases the R&D services within the group or through the market: a higher degree of importance assigned to internal sources of information for innovation as compared to market sources increases (decreases) the probability of R&D offshoring only through the group (market).","[Tamayo, Mery Patricia] Univ EAFIT, Dept Econ, Medellin, Colombia; [Tamayo, Mery Patricia; Huergo, Elena] GRIPICO Univ Complutense Madrid, Madrid, Spain; [Huergo, Elena] Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac CC Econ & Empresariales, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ 1, Madrid, Spain",Universidad EAFIT; Complutense University of Madrid,"Huergo, E (通讯作者)，GRIPICO Univ Complutense Madrid, Madrid, Spain.;Huergo, E (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac CC Econ & Empresariales, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ 1, Madrid, Spain.",ehuergo@ccee.ucm.es,"Huergo, Elena/I-3781-2013","Huergo, Elena/0000-0001-7140-7551",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2014-52051-R]; Community of Madrid across [S2015HUM-3417]; European Social Fund,Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Community of Madrid across; European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)),This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [project ECO2014-52051-R]; Community of Madrid across [project S2015HUM-3417] (INNCOMCON-CM) cofunded by the European Social Fund.,,48,15,16,0,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Using geo-referenced data on agricultural and transport sectors as well as instrumental variables specification based on the Kruskal algorithm we analyze the direct and indirect impact of road infrastructure on the agricultural sector in the Andes of Peru. The Andes mountains endow Peru with a very high topographical diversity. The high topographical diversity is related to longer travel time, higher road construction and maintenance costs, and lower density of the surface transportation network, which limits access to markets. We find that increasing road density in rural districts reduces the farmer's travel time by up to 2.9 hours as well the proportion of households that require less than 24 hours to travel from home to the district by up to 6 percent. Moreover, an additional unit of road density increases the participation in markets by 39 percent and reduces the proportion of output used for self-consumption and as own input by 49 and 5 percent respectively. Interestingly, the diversification of agricultural production follows an inverted U-shaped indicating that farmers reduce diversification as they experience the comparative advantage brought by the increased road connectivity. Our results are robust to the inclusion of year and region fixed-effects, and to controls for geography (i.e. gradient and altitude), population (i.e. education level), and mining activity.","[Aguirre, Julio] Univ Pacifico, Dept Economics, Jr Sanchez Cerro 2050, Lima 15072, Peru; [Campana, Yohnny] Macroconsult SA, Ave Santa Cruz 830,Piso 2, Lima 15073, Peru; [Guerrero, Elmer] Univ San Andres, Dept Econ, Vito Dumas 284,B1644BID, Victoria, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [De La Torre Ugarte, Daniel] Univ Pacifico, Res Ctr, Nat Resources & Environm Econ Area, Jr Sanchez Cerro 2050, Lima 15072, Peru",Universidad del Pacifico Peru; Universidad del Pacifico Peru,"Aguirre, J (通讯作者)，Univ Pacifico, Dept Economics, Jr Sanchez Cerro 2050, Lima 15072, Peru.",aguirre_jc@up.edu.pe,,"Aguirre, Julio/0000-0003-4150-120X; De La Torre Ugarte, Daniel/0000-0002-3835-0458",Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); Economic and Social Research Consortium (CIES); Peruvian Ministry of Agriculture and Water (MINAGRI) [TCP/PER/3402],Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); Economic and Social Research Consortium (CIES); Peruvian Ministry of Agriculture and Water (MINAGRI),"We thank Martin Rossi, Hugo Fano, Richard Webb, Carlos Amat y Leon, Rosario Gomez, Pablo Lavado, Hector Maletta, and Ivan Rivera for their useful comments and suggestions.

Our methodology relies on network analysis to identify changes over time in HSR network accessibility measured by node degree, strength, closeness, and betweenness. We show that sub-networks connecting regional centres with second-tier cities are fast built. Once such sub-networks are mostly established, they are also connected with each other. Moreover, a simultaneous rather than a sequential schedule for multiple HSR segments is at place at any particular time. Finally, we show that the HSR network expands all the lower-elevation, more populous and prosperous regions. Although some clusters are critical politically, HSR network development is still mainly driven by economic factors, which is reflected from the fact that nodes in the more economically vibrant regions present a higher number of routes passing through and higher service quality (i.e., lower travel time). Finally, in order to illustrate the uniqueness of the Chinese HSR development pattern, we briefly discuss and compare the HSR development in other Asian markets, notably Taiwan, South Korea and Japan.","[Chen, Cheng] Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [D'Alfonso, Tiziana] Sapienza Univ Roma, Dept Comp Control & Management Engn, Rome, Italy; [Guo, Huanxiu] Nanjing Univ, Sch Environm, Ctr Environm Management & Policy Anal, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Changmin] Univ Manitoba, Asper Sch Business, Winnipeg, MB, Canada",University of British Columbia; Sapienza University Rome; Nanjing University; University of Manitoba,"D'Alfonso, T (通讯作者)，Sapienza Univ Roma, Dept Comp Control & Management Engn, Rome, Italy.",cheng.chen@sauder.ubc.ca; tiziana.dalfonso@uniroma1.it; hxguo@nau.edu.cn; Changmin.Jiang@umanitoba.ca,"Jiang, Changmin/AAD-7650-2020",,Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada [SSHRC 435-2017-0728],Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"We thank all participants to the workshop Long-distance passengers transport markel, planning innovation held by TRASPOL, Research Center on Transport Policy-Polytechnic of Milan, and to the 3rd Young Scholar's Conference on China Studies held by the Hong Kong Baptist University for valuable comments and suggestions on earlier versions of this paper.

As afforestation is an important contributor to New Zealand meeting net emission targets there is interest in forecasting the rate of afforestation, particularly how it will vary with the price of carbon in the ETS. Consequently a model is developed to estimate afforestation rate from the Land Expectation Value (LEV) of 'traditional' forestry (i.e., revenues only from log sales), the LEV from the carbon trading opportunity that the ETS creates, and land value. Initially the relationship between afforestation rate and A grade log price during the period 1988 and 2008 is considered. Then the relationship between afforestation rate and LEV is evaluated. Initially the period up to 2008 is considered to evaluate the impact of 'traditional' forest profitability on the afforestation rate. Then the period from 2009 to 2015 is included and the impact of carbon is introduced. Finally the cost of land is introduced into the model. The land affordability model developed allows the future afforestation rate to be forecast from carbon price, log price and land value.

We use a novel matched worker-firm dataset to estimate earnings losses associated with mass-layoff and closure events in Ireland. Using propensity score matching and difference-in-differences estimators, we find that in the year following displacement, workers who experience a mass-layoff incur losses of 77 per cent compared to losses of 46 per cent for those displaced following a closure, relative to earnings five periods prior to displacement. However, those who are re-employed immediately after displacement suffer much smaller losses of 36 per cent and 19 per cent in the mass-layoff and closure groups respectively.

For this purpose, an innovative dynamic panel threshold regression model (CS-ARDL) that allows control for cross-country heterogeneity, cross-sectional dependence, and feedback effects is employed to capture this non-linear relationship. The empirical results indicate that there exist threshold effects in the export upgrading-growth relationship. In particular, our findings suggest an inverted U-shaped relation between export sophistication and output growth. Below a critical level (1.3 for advanced countries and -0.7 for developing countries), more export complexity fosters economic growth. However, excessive export complexity might have adverse spillovers on long-term economic growth. Furthermore, we show that the effect of export sophistication on economic growth is asymmetric to advanced and developing countries when it is above and below the threshold level.","[Sami, Saafi; Ridha, Nouira] Monastir Univ, Monastir, Tunisia",Universite de Monastir,"Sami, S (通讯作者)，Monastir Univ, Monastir, Tunisia.",samisaafifsegm@gmail.com,,,,,,,51,4,4,0,5,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

This paper fills this gap by investigating whether the demand responses to income and price changes are asymmetric and hysteretic. To this end, we decompose both income and price into two- and three component series (one- and two-threshold cases). In the one-threshold case, demand effects for income are symmetric, but asymmetric for fuel price. The results of the two-threshold case show hysteretic effects for price but not for income. More specifically, the results reveal that small price changes do not significantly influence fuel demand for road transport, but substantial increases and cuts in price asymmetrically affect fuel demand, supporting the presence of an inaction band. These findings lead to the conclusion that income has linear demand effects, but demand effects for fuel price are nonlinear; therefore, disregarding nonlinearities in fuel price changes can be restrictive.","[Chi, Junwook] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Travel Ind Management, 2560 Campus Rd,George Hall 346, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Chi, J (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Travel Ind Management, 2560 Campus Rd,George Hall 346, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",jwchi@hawaii.edu,,"Chi, Junwook/0000-0002-8496-5285",,,,,28,2,2,0,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

Bikeshare as a feeder mode to metro helps solve the last mile problem. Thus, it is necessary to monitor and analyze metro-bikeshare transfer characteristics. The primary objective of this study is to derive a reproducible methodology that isolates bicycle-metro transfer trips using smart card data. Two recognition rules proposed are a maximum transfer time of 10 min and a maximum transfer distance of 300 m. To explore the general characteristics of metro-bikeshare transfer trips, transfer stations served at less than 30 transfer trips during three consecutive weeks were eliminated to ensure that a non-typical transfer pattern would not distort the results. The results show that more than 89% passengers recognized have less than 6 transfers in 3 weeks, indicating that most users integrate bikeshare with metro impromptu. Two transfer peaks on workdays are during 7:00-9:00 and 17:00-19:00, especially in suburban areas, while at weekends, transfers show quite even during 8:00-19:00. As to Return-Enter and Exit-Lease transfer modes, the time difference phenomenon does exist, which means that the transfer peak of Return-Entermode always happens one hour earlier than that of Exit-Lease. Furthermore, the demographic differences in metro-bikeshare usage pattern are revealed. Finally, policy implications are involved to improve the performance of metro-bikeshare integration for all kinds of people without creating inequality.","[Ma, Xinwei; Yang, Mingyuan; Jin, Yuchuan; Tan, Xu] Southeast Univ, Sch Transportat, Sipailou 2, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Ji, Yanjie] Southeast Univ, Jiangsu Key Lab Urban ITS, Jiangsu Prov Collaborat Innovat Ctr Modern Urban, Sch Transportat, Sipailou 2, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Southeast University - China; Southeast University - China,"Ji, YJ (通讯作者)，Southeast Univ, Jiangsu Key Lab Urban ITS, Jiangsu Prov Collaborat Innovat Ctr Modern Urban, Sch Transportat, Sipailou 2, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",230169206@seu.edu.cn; jiyanjie@seu.edu.cn; 213142464@seu.edu.cn; 213152881@seu.edu.cn; 213152400@seu.edu.cn,,,"Projects of International Cooperation and Exchange of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [51561135003]; Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China [51338003]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [SJCX17_0036]; Student Research Training Program of Southeast University [201710286093, 201721059, 201721013]",Projects of International Cooperation and Exchange of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Student Research Training Program of Southeast University,"The financial support from the Projects of International Cooperation and Exchange of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51561135003), the Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51338003), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. SJCX17_0036) and the Student Research Training Program of Southeast University (No. 201710286093, No. 201721059, No.201721013) are gratefully acknowledged.",,63,74,80,5,64,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

Duration is explained by transport service itself, along with other variables, and the issue of its composition is formulated as that of the elasticity of duration with respect to that service. The existence of the safety margin is established by the failure of a unit elasticity test and its role as offset to the uncertainty of transport service by findings of elasticity estimates smaller than unity. Estimation is made by Box-Cox models and their fitted values formally calculated for the first three moments of outcomes. These conditions met, we extract from best fitted trip durations the absolute and relative impacts of explanatory variables on their first three moments, notably marginal rates of substitution among these moments, assumed to reveal relative moment utility valuations. In particular, absolute impacts of service on duration moments modify the time profile distribution of trip demand and close the traffic demand model. The distinct elasticities of these moments with respect to service together imply that improvements in mean service lead to contractions in the time profile of demand and to fourth moment superpeaks of demand simultaneously consistent with large net improvements in lower-order moment utility. Differences in reliability preferences, demonstrated here for private car and public transit trips and for men and women, imply slightly different superpeaks in these four markets defined for the Greater Paris region, Ile-de-France, with home-based morning rush trips. Our approach is based on the assumption that preferences for distributions are moment dependent, i.e. characterized solely by their empirical moments, and that time moments of trips up to and including the fourth matter to utility. Transport project evaluation should not be concerned merely with Dupuit-like utility of new quantities at mean time cost, but also with Allais-inspired service reliability effects, including fast fill-ups of new highways and super-peaks on new or newly automated transit lines.","[Gaudry, Marc] Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Gaudry, Marc] Univ Montreal, AJD, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Universite de Montreal; Universite de Montreal,"Gaudry, M (通讯作者)，Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;Gaudry, M (通讯作者)，Univ Montreal, AJD, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",marc.gaudry@umontreal.ca,"Gaudry, Marc/AAH-3343-2019",,Societe du Grand Paris (SGP) [MAPA 2013-32],Societe du Grand Paris (SGP),"This first version of this paper, originally entitled The demand for journey duration and reliability: Paris Region work trips by mode and sex, 2010-2011, was presented by the author on March 11, 2016, at the Seminaire sur les methodes de prise en compte de la fiabilite des temps de transport dans les evaluations, of the Direction generale des infrastructures, des transports et de la mer (DGITM) in Paris.

To identify the causal impact of shareholder protection laws on firms' implied cost of capital, we exploit the staggered adoption across 23 US states of universal-demand laws, which place significant obstacles to derivative lawsuits and thus undermine shareholders' litigation rights. Using a sample of public US firms between 1985 and 2013, we find that weakened litigation rights for shareholders materially increase firms' implied cost of capital. We further show that the curtailing of shareholders' rights leads to a deterioration in information quality, increased risk-taking, and more severe insider expropriation, all of which contribute to heightened financing costs. Overall, our findings indicate that weakened litigation rights for shareholders lead them to face greater agency conflicts and higher market risk, which ultimately translates into higher required returns.","[Houston, Joel F.] Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Lin, Chen] Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Xie, Wensi] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University of Hong Kong; Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Houston, JF (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",,,,Seed Funding for Strategic Interdisciplinary Research at the University of Hong Kong; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71790601],Seed Funding for Strategic Interdisciplinary Research at the University of Hong Kong; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Lin acknowledges financial support from the Seed Funding for Strategic Interdisciplinary Research at the University of Hong Kong and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant 71790601).,,64,30,34,1,16,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

The model predicts that a relative performance prize scheme both increases the players' level of effort in certain conditions and decreases the performance differential between the winner and the loser in the contest. Empirically, I investigate these theoretical predictions by employing a natural experiment in the group-stage matches of the FIVB (Federation Internationale de Volleyball) World League and the FIVB World Grand Prix. The results indicate that the introduction of a relative performance prize scheme induces contest participants to intensify their efforts in certain conditions.

The ridership recovery and its spatial distribution appear, therefore, to be related to an acceleration of urban processes, i.e., gentrification, immigration, employment concentration in the CBD.","[Lascano Kezic, Marcelo E.] Univ Buenos Aires, Sch Railway Engn, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Durango-Cohen, Pablo Luis] Northwestern Univ, 2145 Sheridan Rd,A332, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",University of Buenos Aires; Northwestern University,"Kezic, MEL (通讯作者)，Univ Buenos Aires, Sch Railway Engn, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",mejlascano@yahoo.de; pdc@northwestern.edu,"Durango-Cohen, Pablo L/B-6939-2009",,,,,,44,1,1,0,3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

In this study, we estimate modal demand for individual elevator wheat shipments from the U.S. Northern Plains to export and domestic destinations between 2006 and 2013. We find a much higher rail dependence for shuttle elevators in comparison to non-shuttle elevators reflected by the relative size of modal demand elasticities. On the other hand, truck is more competitive for non-shuttle elevators. Shuttle shippers saved 24% in total transportation cost in 2013 in comparison to non-shuttle shippers, with savings in rail transportation costs alone of 22%. Our results support the idea that shippers receive better service and view rail more favorably after adopting shuttle facilities. Moreover, these service benefits may partially mitigate the disadvantages captive shippers (such as those in the Northern Plains) realize in comparison to shippers with more transport options.","[Ndembe, Elvis; Bitzan, John] North Dakota State Univ, Fargo, ND 58105 USA",North Dakota State University Fargo,"Ndembe, E (通讯作者)，North Dakota State Univ, Fargo, ND 58105 USA.",elvis.ndembe@ndsu.edu; john.bitzan@ndsu.edu,,,,,,,19,5,7,1,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

Through an examination of the ways in which labor regimes are constituted as a result of the articulation of local social relations and lead-firm pressure in GPNs, the article examines the limits of labor provisions in European Union trade policy seeking to ameliorate the worst consequences of trade liberalization and economic integration on working conditions. The article takes as its empirical focus the Moldovan clothing industry, the leading export-oriented manufacturing sector in the country. Trade liberalization has opened up a market space for EU lead firms to contract with Moldovan-based suppliers, but in seeking to regulate labor conditions in the process of trade liberalization, the mechanisms in place are not sufficient to deal with the consequences for workers' rights and working conditions. Indeed, when articulated with national state policy formulations seeking to liberalize labor markets and deregulate labor standards, the limits of what can be achieved via labor provisions are reached. The EU's trade policy formulation does not sufficiently take account of the structural causes of poor working conditions. Consequently, there is a mismatch between what the EU is trying to achieve and the core labor issues that structure social relations in, and labor regimes of, low-wage labor-intensive clothing export production for EU markets.","[Smith, Adrian] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Geog, London E1 4NS, England; [Barbu, Mirela; Campling, Liam] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, London E1 4NS, England; [Harrison, James] Univ Warwick, Sch Law, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Richardson, Ben] Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of London; Queen Mary University London; University of London; Queen Mary University London; University of Warwick; University of Warwick,"Smith, A (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Geog, London E1 4NS, England.",a.m.smith@qmul.ac.uk; m.barbu@qmul.ac.uk; l.campling@qmul.ac.uk; J.Harrison.3@warwick.ac.uk; B.J.Richardson@warwick.ac.uk,,,UK Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M009343/1]; ESRC [ES/M009343/1] Funding Source: UKRI,UK Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This article arises from research undertaken as part of a UK Economic and Social Research Council-funded project entitled Working Beyond the Border: European Union Trade Agreements and Labour Standards (award number: ES/M009343/1).

The analysis aims to build an early-warning model that is suitable for this type of bank. The results reveal non-monotonic effects of bank capital on the probability of failure. In contrast to distress models for for-profit banks, non-performing loans, profitability, liquidity, and management quality have a negligible predictive value. The findings also show that unreserved impaired loans have an important impact on the probability of bank distress. Moreover, the loan-loss ratio provision on substandard loans constitutes a suitable antibody against bank distress. Overall, the results are robust in terms of both the methodology (i.e., frequentist and Bayesian approaches) and the sample used (i.e., cooperative banks in Italy and euro-area countries).

We characterize equilibrium as separating or pooling, depending on the relative importance of type-I and type-II errors. Effects of plea bargaining on criminal incentives are examined in an extended model. Contrary to the widespread perception of being soft on crime by weakening deterrence, we show that plea bargaining unambiguously reduces crime. The benefit of improved informational efficiency more than offsets the crime-incentivizing effect of offering discounted sentences to defendants who plea bargain. Plea bargaining is therefore socially efficient whenever the risk of wrongfully convicting innocent defendants is sufficiently small. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The analysed taxes are progressive over most of the income distribution, but barely regressive if the highest and lowest incomes are included. However, the fraction of the population who suffer substantial welfare losses relative to income is much higher in lower income groups. We also study revenue recycling schemes; when these are included, the combined effect of tax and recycling is progressive.

However, recent developments have not been extensively studied. The major objective in this paper is to understand both positive and negative trends of evolution of organisational practices in Russian land passenger transport. The methodological approach is mixed and based on an analysis of legislation, market structure and contracting approaches. Studies of the largest cities, including the recent Moscow 'new model', are also performed in this paper. The overall structure of the study includes overviews of legislation, the performance of public operators, institutions in the private bus sector and the recent bus reform in Moscow.

The five pillars of road safety development were analyzed within three main layers of the road safety management system consisting of institutional management functions, interventions, and results. The main objective of this study is to introduce a ranking criterion that explains the success in each road safety pillar using the concepts of the managing by result and also to identify best practices within a set of developing countries, focusing on the archived results for Iran. A virtual performance indicator shown by 'S' was defined as the success score of each pillar in the decade of action for each country to achieve the targets of decreasing road fatalities. This virtual indicator as well as two other indicator classes (intervention outputs and final outcomes) go into an optimization problem using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach. It is concluded that the S value shows the quality weight of the actions taken in countries and could be a suitable numeric indicator for benchmarking the best practices. The success of Iran in advancing the interventions in two pillars of safer roads and mobility (safer infrastructure) and safer road users (enhanced enforcement) has been higher than the other activities. The actions needed to be taken in Iran include the development of vehicle safety, the structure of road safety management, and post-crash response in order of preference. This country requires to follow best practices in Turkey and Romania which were identified as benchmark countries for Iran.

This paper is the first incorporating leverage and momentum together. We show that low past returns (losers) forecast future negative abnormal returns only among stocks with high leverage levels, but not among stocks with low leverage levels. However, high past returns (winners) forecast future positive abnormal returns independently of leverage level. As a result, the negative relation between leverage and future abnormal returns is only observed among loser stocks, and the positive relation between past returns and future abnormal returns is only shown among non-low leverage stocks. Our results are important in achieving better investment strategies: buying winners' stocks (independently of their level of leverage) and short-selling losers' stocks with high leverage yield higher abnormal returns than strategies based on only one of these variables. Our two-dimensional strategy yields risk-adjusted abnormal returns of 15.66% per annum, whereas the single leverage or momentum strategies yield 7.70% and 7.96% per annum, respectively. The difference is nearly 8% and economically significant. If leverage is considered as proxy for default risk, our results, contrary to previous evidence, show that momentum profits are not exclusive of default stocks, and that momentum returns are not only driven by negative returns yielded by distress stocks.","[Forner, Carlos] Univ Alicante, Campus San Vicente del Raspeig, E-03080 Alicante, Spain; [Muradoglu, Yaz Guelnur] Queen Mary Univ London, London, England; [Sivaprasad, Sheeja] Univ Westminster, London, England",Universitat d'Alacant; University of London; Queen Mary University London; University of Westminster,"Forner, C (通讯作者)，Univ Alicante, Campus San Vicente del Raspeig, E-03080 Alicante, Spain.",carlos.forner@ua.es,"Muradoglu, Gulnur/HHM-5469-2022","Muradoglu, Gulnur/0000-0002-6392-6746; Forner, Carlos/0000-0002-0470-8802; Sivaprasad, Sheeja/0000-0002-0112-5636",,,,,50,3,3,2,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0277-6693,1099-131X,,J FORECASTING,J.

The particular complications that are involved in investigating these relationships in the health care sector may explain the dearth of research. We examine three invasive cardiac services: diagnostic angiography, percutaneous coronary interventions, and coronary artery bypass grafting. We document the relationship between the adoption by hospitals of these three invasive cardiac services and the characteristics of the hospitals, their markets, and the interactions among them, from 1997 to 2014. The results show that the probability of hospitals' adopting a new cardiac service depends on competition in two distinct ways: (1) hospitals are substantially more likely to adopt an invasive cardiac service if competitor hospitals also adopt new services; and (2) hospitals are less likely to adopt a new service if a larger fraction of the nearby population already has geographic access to the service at a nearby hospital. The first effect is stronger, leading to the net effect that hospitals duplicate rather than expand access to care. In addition, for-profit hospitals are considerably more likely to adopt these cardiac services than are either nonprofit or government-owned hospitals. Nonprofit hospitals in high-penetration, for-profit markets are also more likely to adopt them relative to other nonprofits. These results suggest that factors other than medical need-such as a medical arms race-partially explain technological adoption.","[Horwitz, Jill R.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, 385 Charles E Young Dr E, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Horwitz, Jill R.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Law, NBER, 385 Charles E Young Dr E, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Hsuan, Charleen] Penn State Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Adm, 604B Ford Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Nichols, Austin] Abt Associates Inc, 6130 Execut Blvd, Rockville, MD 20852 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; ABT Associates,"Horwitz, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, 385 Charles E Young Dr E, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.;Horwitz, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Law, NBER, 385 Charles E Young Dr E, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",horwitz@law.ucla.edu; chsuan@psu.edu; Austin_Nichols@abtassoc.com,,"Hsuan, Charleen/0000-0001-8720-2323",UCLA School of Law,UCLA School of Law,Funding was provided by UCLA School of Law.,,49,7,7,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

The election of Democratic governors results in higher levels of debt issuance, with an annual per capita increase of approximately $73-$147 in states that lack debt referenda requirements. In states with debt referenda requirements, the estimated per capita annual effect of a Democratic governor is approximately $23-$28. We find that governors are not able to circumvent debt referenda requirements by issuing debt through state authorities or local governments.","[Peskowitz, Zachary] Emory Univ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Sridharan, Suhas A.] Emory Univ, Goizueta Business Sch, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",Emory University; Emory University,"Sridharan, SA (通讯作者)，Emory Univ, Goizueta Business Sch, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",sridharan@emory.edu,"Sridharan, Suhas/AAU-6944-2021","Peskowitz, Zachary/0000-0001-8765-4573",,,,,47,1,1,2,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

The essence of this approach is in counting runs simulated from a multivariate distribution representing the probabilistic forecasts, which enters the negative inflation regime. The marginal distributions of forecasts are estimated using the series of past forecast errors, and the joint distribution is obtained by a multivariate copula approach. This technique is applied for estimating the probability of negative inflation in China and its expected duration, with the marginal distributions computed by fitting weighted skew-normal and two-piece normal distributions to autoregressive moving average ex post forecast errors and using the multivariate Student t copula.","[Charemza, Wojciech; Makarova, Svetlana] Vistula Univ, VCAS, Warsaw, Poland; [Makarova, Svetlana] UCL, SSES, London, England; [Wu, Yinkai] Anhui Prov Acad Social Sci, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China",Vistula University; University of London; University College London,"Makarova, S (通讯作者)，UCL, Sch Slavon & East European Studies, 16 Taviton St, London WC1H 0BW, England.",s.makarova@ucl.ac.uk,"Charemza, Wojciech/U-4463-2019","Charemza, Wojciech/0000-0002-4748-2655; Makarova, Svetlana/0000-0001-6601-2491",Opus 8 [2014/15/B/HS4/04263]; ESRC/ORA [RES-360-25-0003]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I009957/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/I009957/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Opus 8; ESRC/ORA; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Opus 8, Grant/Award Number: 2014/15/B/HS4/04263; ESRC/ORA, Grant/Award Number: RES-360-25-0003",,36,0,0,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0277-6693,1099-131X,,J FORECASTING,J.

We model three ways in which religion affects the demand for children - through norms, market wages, and childrearing costs. We estimate these effects using new panel data on church attendance and clergy employment for 13 European countries from 1960 to 2000, spanning the Second Vatican Council (1962-65). Using nuns per capita as a proxy for service provision, we estimate fertility effects on the order of 300 to 400 children per nun. Moreover, nuns outperform priests as a predictor of fertility, suggesting that changes in childrearing costs dominate changes in theology and norms. Reduced church attendance also predicts fertility decline, but only for Catholics, not for Protestants. Service provision and attendance complement each other, a finding consistent with club models of religion.","[Berman, Eli] Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Iannaccone, Laurence R.] Chapman Univ, Orange, CA USA; [Ragusa, Giuseppe] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Chapman University System; Chapman University; European Central Bank,"Ragusa, G (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany.",giuseppe.ragusa@ecb.europa.eu,,"Ragusa, Giuseppe/0000-0002-6964-6278","National Science Foundation through the National Bureau of Economic Research [0520188]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0520188] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation through the National Bureau of Economic Research; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We appreciate the comments of Alicia Adsera, Evelyn Lehrer, seminar participants at the NBER Labor Studies meetings, George Mason University, USC, UC Irvine, the Southern California Applied Economics workshop at UCLA, DukeNIH demographic meetings at UCLA, Brown, UCLA, the European Economic Association meetings, UC Santa Barbara, the Society of Labor Economics meetings, UC San Diego, Population Studies at Michigan, the Harris School, University College London, an ASSA session, and a session of the Association for the Study of Religion, Economics and Culture (ASREC).

Such biases are particularly acute when consumers commit to a long-term contract. This paper aims at assessing the consequences of projection bias and at defining when a legal intervention is relevant. In this perspective, we compare the situation of naive and sophisticated agents, both with and without regulation regarding contract duration and early termination fees. The demand side of the market consists either of sophisticated agents, who perfectly anticipate their future willingness to pay (WTP); or of naive consumers, who exhibit a projection bias. The supply side is a monopoly offering long- and short-term contracts. Our main contribution consists in showing that naive consumers are not always worse off than sophisticated agents. The key parameter is how willingness to pay varies over time. If consumers have an increasing WTP for a given service or product, naive agents can actually be better off than sophisticated ones. We argue that naivete protects consumers against a price increase. However, naivete also leads to less exchanges on the market, thus generating a deadweight loss. Hence, the overall effect of naivete on social welfare is ambiguous. As far as public policy is concerned, we conclude that regulating contract duration is only relevant in some circumstances, depending on the market characteristics and on the bias.","[Bienenstock, Sophie; Ropaul, Maiva] Univ Paris II Pantheon Assas, Ctr Rech Econ Droit, 12 Pl Pantheon, F-75005 Paris, France; [Bienenstock, Sophie] Univ Paris X Nanterre, EconomiX, 200 Ave Republ, F-92001 Nanterre, France; [Ropaul, Maiva] Univ Paris 05, LIRAES, 45 Rue St Peres, F-75270 Paris 06, France",Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas; Universite Paris Cite,"Bienenstock, S (通讯作者)，Univ Paris II Pantheon Assas, Ctr Rech Econ Droit, 12 Pl Pantheon, F-75005 Paris, France.;Bienenstock, S (通讯作者)，Univ Paris X Nanterre, EconomiX, 200 Ave Republ, F-92001 Nanterre, France.",sophie.bienenstock@gmail.com; maiva.ropaul@parisdescartes.fr,,,,,,,32,2,2,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

This study is significant given the inherent difficulties in modelling the substantial renewals element of infrastructure costs, as well as the need to account for the dynamics in renewals and maintenance. The dynamic model allows us to estimate equilibrium cost elasticities with respect to train usage, which are significantly larger than their static counterparts. Overall, this work highlights that dynamics in rail infrastructure costs are important to consider when setting track access charges with respect to the wear and tear caused by traffic. This is particularly important given several countries, for example France, Sweden and Switzerland, are now setting access charges at marginal costs based on econometric studies.","[Odolinski, Kristofer] Swedish Natl Rd & Transport Res Inst, Dept Transport Econ, Box 55685, S-10215 Stockholm, Sweden; [Wheat, Phill] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, 36-40 Univ Rd, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",VTI; University of Leeds,"Odolinski, K (通讯作者)，Swedish Natl Rd & Transport Res Inst, Dept Transport Econ, Box 55685, S-10215 Stockholm, Sweden.",kristofer.odolinski@vti.se; p.e.wheat@its.leeds.ac.uk,,,Swedish Transport Administration; European Commission Horizon2020 project NeTIRail-INFRA [636237]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/M023109/1]; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [636237] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/M023109/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/M023109/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Swedish Transport Administration; European Commission Horizon2020 project NeTIRail-INFRA(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"The authors are grateful to the Swedish Transport Administration, European Commission Horizon2020 project NeTIRail-INFRA (Grant number 636237) and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (Grant number EP/M023109/1) for funding this research.

J,"Gibbons, A",,,,"Gibbons, Andrea",,,The Five Refusals of White Supremacy,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND SOCIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM; RACE; GEOGRAPHIES; PRIVILEGE,"This article draws on the work of Charles Mills to posit white supremacy as a global political, economic, and cultural system. Resistance among people of color is, and has always been, widespread. The focus here, however, is on what Mills (1997: 18) describes as the epistemology of ignorance among whites themselves, serving to preserve a sense of self as decent in the face of privileges dependent upon obvious injustices against (nonwhite) others. Five themes are identified within a broad and multidisciplinary range of literature, described here as the five refusals of white supremacy. These are points at which white ignorance must be actively maintained in order to preserve both a sense of the self and of the wider structures of white privilege and dominance. There is a refusal of the humanity of the otherand a willingness to allow violence and exploitation to be inflicted. There is a refusal to listen to or acknowledge the experience of the otherresulting in marginalization and active silencing. There is a refusal not just to confront long and violent histories of white domination, but to recognize how these continue to shape injustice into the present. There is a refusal to share space, particularly residential space, with resulting segregated geographies that perpetuate inequality and insulate white ignorance. Finally there is a refusal to face structural causescapitalism as it has intertwined with white supremacy from its earliest beginnings. To undo one requires the undoing of the others. For each refusal there is a potential affirmation, presented here in the hope that each might provide an understanding of the breadth of work required to dismantle white supremacy and of the multiple points for intervention.(a","[Gibbons, Andrea] Univ Salford, Sustainable Housing & Urban Studies Unit, Salford, Lancs, England",University of Salford,"Gibbons, A (通讯作者)，Univ Salford, Sustainable Housing & Urban Studies Unit, Salford, Lancs, England.",a.r.gibbons1@salford.ac.uk,,,,,,,64,12,16,2,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

On May 14, 1954, the Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that separate and unequal education violated the Constitution because separate is inherently unequal. Many believed that this ruling, the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, 1968, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 would put an end to the unequal treatment of African Americans in the United States. However, inequalities still exist today because the ruling and the laws did not change the structures of the United States. Specifically, structural racism prevents African Americans from obtaining equal access to resources such as wealth, employment, income, and healthcare, resulting in racial disparities in health. Because racial disparities between African Americans and Caucasians are the most studied in the United States, this article will focus exclusively on how structural racism continues and causes racial inequalities between African Americans and Caucasians in wealth, employment, income, and healthcare, which lead to racial disparities in access to healthcare and health status.","[Yearby, Ruqaiijah] Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Law, Law, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Yearby, Ruqaiijah] Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Law, Inst Divers & Inclusiveness, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA",University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University; University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University,"Yearby, R (通讯作者)，Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Law, Law, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.;Yearby, R (通讯作者)，Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Law, Inst Divers & Inclusiveness, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",,,"Yearby, Ruqaiijah/0000-0002-2381-9401",,,,,92,150,208,5,46,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

The chosen case of study is Puerto Vallarta, a sun and beach international destination in Mexico. Puerto Vallarta contains, potentially, many of the key elements that are discussed in the literature on creative economy. Our methodological strategy identifies ethnographically types of knowledge that are associated with a standard typology of creative industries in a city. The model is evaluated by simulations of agents engaged in producing ideas based on these types of knowledge either collectively or individually. Among the main findings are the presence of elevated common knowledge' between creative agents (which can be an important constraint for rising creativity) and that mixed behaviour of knowledge production (collective and individual) can boost better the production of ideas in Puerto Vallarta. Finally, we claim that the proposed methodology can be extended to and implemented in other similar contexts.","[Valdivia, Marcos] Natl Univ Mexico UNAM, Reg Ctr Multidisciplinary Res, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Macip, Ricardo] Benemerita Univ Autonoma Puebla, Grad Program Sociocultural Anthropol, Puebla, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Benemerita Universidad Autonoma de Puebla,"Valdivia, M (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Mexico UNAM, Reg Ctr Multidisciplinary Res, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",marcosv@correo.crim.unam.mx; fmacip@gmail.com,"Valdivia, Marcos/AHA-2585-2022","Valdivia, Marcos/0000-0002-5119-6176","Direccion General de Asuntos del Personal Academico, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico [PAPIIT IN304214]; PASPA","Direccion General de Asuntos del Personal Academico, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico(Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico); PASPA","This research was possible thanks to the funding provided by Direccion General de Asuntos del Personal Academico, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, through the grants PAPIIT IN304214 and PASPA.",,45,1,1,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Our setup features observable (but possibly nonverifiable) product safety levels and firms subject to strict liability according to a parametric liability specification. Firms' expected liability payments depend on both product safety and price levels which critically influences the repercussions of shifting losses to firms. From a social standpoint, shifting some losses to firms is always beneficial.","[Baumann, Florian] Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany; [Friehe, Tim] Univ Marburg, Marburg, Germany; [Rasch, Alexander] Univ Duesseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany",University of Bonn; Philipps University Marburg,"Baumann, F (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Ctr Adv Studies Law & Econ CASTLE, Adenauerallee 42-42, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",fbaumann@uni-bonn.de,"Friehe, Tim/ABF-4676-2020","Friehe, Tim/0000-0002-9390-3537",,,,,34,10,10,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1465-7252,1465-7260,,AM LAW ECON REV,Am.

These ports connect with the domestic markets of the peninsula, especially with the logistics hub located in Madrid. The evolution of productivity is measured by the Malmquist productivity index using DBA (Data Envelopment Analysis) methodology. This analysis allows us to decompose total productivity in Technical Efficiency (EFFCH) and Technological Progress (TECH). It is concluded that the increase in container traffic is directly related to an increase in the Malmquist productivity index but to the influence of other variables that act as inputs.

Each contestant secretly decides how much effort to exert between the starting time and the deadline. At the deadline, the contestant who exerted most effort wins a prize, which consists of the endowment of the designer and collected interest. The contest has a unique Nash equilibrium. In the main model, the designer should announce the contest immediately with a short deadline to promote intense competition.

This is also true for South Africa where the 'South Africa Connect' policy was introduced in 2013. The question arises whether Internet access goes beyond meeting developmental goals to improving the subjective well-being of people. Furthermore, if the association between Internet access and subjective well-being vary between different race and age groups. Previous research was performed in developed countries at a national level or for specific small subsamples, like the elderly; however, this study contributes to the literature by analysing a substantial sample, at sub-national level, in a heterogeneous, unequal society, in a developing country. The benefit is that heterogeneities masked in studies at a national, macro level are highlighted in a study at a sub-national, micro level. This article investigated the relationship between subjective well-being and Internet access within a developing region with a heterogeneous, unequal society. The article used a data set representative of the Gauteng population, the economic centre of South Africa, which was collected in 2013 by the Gauteng City Region Observatory. To analyse the data, ordered probit, ordinary least square and instrumental variable regression techniques were used. The results show that Internet access is positively related to subjective well-being and this relationship holds across all race groups and all age groups, from 18 years to over 65 years of age. In addition, it seems that the stark inequalities between race groups present in South Africa are fading among younger generations. Based on the results, the 'South Africa Connect' policy, which aims to give Internet access to all people, including those in Gauteng, the region analysed, is supported, as it not only contributes to the development of the region but also to the life satisfaction of the citizens.","[Greyling, Talita] Univ Johannesburg, Sch Econ, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Johannesburg,"Greyling, T (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, Sch Econ, Johannesburg, South Africa.",talitag@uj.ac.za,"Greyling, Talita/AAC-7567-2022","Greyling, Talita/0000-0002-3777-7003",,,,,58,7,10,3,25,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The role of production costs,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Counterfeiting; Fines; Intellectual property rights; Social welfare,CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION,"A monopolist sells a luxury genuine product which can be illegally copied and sold by a competitive fringe of counterfeiters. Fines imposed on caught counterfeiters are pocketed by the genuine firm. We prove that if production costs are low, then the genuine manufacturer would lobbying for high penalties so that counterfeiters should be thrown out of the market. In this case, the presence of counterfeiters does not provide any benefit to the producer of the original product. Whenever the production cost is neither too high nor too low, the optimal fine guarantees a positive demand for the genuine product as well as for the fake; the genuine producer is better off than in a world without counterfeiters. If production costs are too high, the genuine firm has no more incentive to produce. Its remaining goal is to collect penalty money from counterfeiters. Again, the presence of counterfeiters provides a benefit to the genuine manufacturer. Finally, a comparison between full protection and null protection policies is performed.","[Di Liddo, Andrea] Univ Foggia, Dept Econ, Largo Papa Giovanni Paolo 2, I-71100 Foggia, Italy",University of Foggia,"Di Liddo, A (通讯作者)，Univ Foggia, Dept Econ, Largo Papa Giovanni Paolo 2, I-71100 Foggia, Italy.",andrea.diliddo@unifg.it,"DI LIDDO, ANDREA/C-5829-2018","DI LIDDO, ANDREA/0000-0002-6382-3827",,,,,18,4,4,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

In the raw data, inspectors new to inspected restaurants tend to report 27 percent more violations than repeat inspectors. After ruling out regulatory capture and endogenous rotation of inspectors as potential explanations, we find that the gap between new and repeat inspections is best explained by the following two effects: first, restaurants target compliance in response to the heterogeneous stringency and preferences of inspectors; second, inspectors pay greater attention in a first visit than in subsequent visits. After controlling for the heterogeneous criteria of inspectors, we find that a new inspector reports 13-18 percent more violations than noted in the second visit of the previous inspector, likely because of a higher level of attention. Counterfactual simulations highlight the importance of inspectors' training and rotation in regulatory outcomes.","[Jin, Ginger Zhe] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Lee, Jungmin] Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul, South Korea",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Seoul National University (SNU),"Jin, GZ (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",,"lee, jungmin/IXW-6580-2023",,Alfred P.

Though, it has been said that, countries that have accessed flow of foreign capital have done better than countries that have not in terms of improvement in per capita income and standard of living, countries that grew quicker has been those that were less reliant on inflow of foreign capital. The study examined the sub- regional analysis of inflow of FDI to the African regions as well as the impact that it has had on economic development of the region paying particular attention to the various degree of inflow to sub-regions. The study made use of pooled data from thirty-nine African countries within the period 1993 and 2012.The method of analysis utilized for the study was the fixed effect least-square dummy variable model, employed to estimate the impact of foreign direct investment on economic development considering a sub-regional analysis and highlighting the impact on sub-regions. The study finds that foreign direct investment is statistically significant in relation to economic development for sub-regions of African with lesser flows of fund. It is therefore recommended that the governments of host countries should consider closely the sectors that FDI flows into, also, they should discourage the displacement of domestic competitors, thereby giving room for economic activities to thrive domestically in such sectors such that dependence on external financial flows could be gradually reduced, resulting in gradual reduction in the gaps of savings, investment which characterizes the developing economies like Africa, thereby, aiding desired economic development.","[Adegboye, Folasade Bosede; Olokoyo, Felicia Omowunmi; Akinjare, Victoria Abosede; Mengot, Esangaya] Covenant Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Ota, Nigeria",Covenant University,"Adegboye, FB (通讯作者)，Covenant Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Ota, Nigeria.",folasade.adegboye@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; felicia.olokoyo@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; victoria.akinjare@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; Esangaya.mengot@covenantuniversity.edu.ng,,,Covenant University,Covenant University,Our acknowledgement goes to Covenant University for the sponsor of this research work.

Especially in areas close to national borders, these decisions could be linked to the question on which side of the border a venture should be located in order to realise country-specific comparative advantages that make the investment more profitable. Differences in profitability between countries are driven by manifold aspects, including specific cost or revenue structures, financing patterns and conditions, as well as taxation. The aim of this study is to identify the driving factors behind differences in profitability of Czech and German firms on the basis of a comparative analysis. In this article, a two-step variance analysis is conducted. The first step focuses on the operational differences in RoA between Czech and German ventures, which is based on deeper analyses of the asset turnover and the profit margin. In the second step, the differences in RoE are analysed, considering influences from national taxation, conditions and patterns of financing and operations of the ventures. A model-based cumulative variance analysis quantifies the impacts of these underlying drivers of profitability with a comparative focus. For this reason, the average measures of these drivers from 2002 to 2014 - the longest time series available for both countries - are extracted from the BACH database, which provides harmonised accounting information. This paper confirms the hypothesis that specific drivers of profitability differ significantly between the two countries in certain business sectors and would cause substantial differences in profitability. Due to the overlapping nature of these individual effects, they compensate each other to a great extent. The results provide useful benchmarks that a company's management can use to increase its profitability tackling specific comparative (dis-)advantages between the Czech Republic and Germany.","[Beyer, Dirk] Harz Univ Appl Sci, Dept Business Studies, Wernigerode, Germany; [Hinke, Jana] Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Plzen, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Beyer, D (通讯作者)，Harz Univ Appl Sci, Dept Business Studies, Wernigerode, Germany.",dbeyer@hs-harz.de; hinke@kfu.zcu.cz,"Hinke, Jana/C-7048-2016","Hinke, Jana/0000-0001-6767-1253",,,,,40,7,7,3,27,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The results of the research indicate a relatively strong and statistically significant negative association between labour compensation and debt as the sources of financing the aggregate consumption and investment expenditure of the household sector in the examined countries. These findings suggest that a substantial increase in household indebtedness experienced over the last decades by both developed and emerging economies around the world might be partially attributable to a strong downward pressure on wages inherent in competitive markets. Over the long run average labour compensation in the majority of the OECD countries has not been able to keep up with productivity growth. Simultaneously, the deregulation of the credit market and falling interest rates prior to the global financial crisis increased the availability of debt, allowing household aggregate demand to grow faster than labour compensation and to improve households' standard of living by substituting sluggish income growth with debt.","[Bolibok, Piotr] John Paul II Catholic Univ Lublin, Lublin, Poland; [Matras-Bolibok, Anna] Univ Life Sci Lublin, Lublin, Poland",Catholic University of Lublin; University of Life Sciences in Lublin,"Bolibok, P (通讯作者)，John Paul II Catholic Univ Lublin, Lublin, Poland.",piotr.bolibok@kul.pl; anna.matras@up.lublin.pl,"Bolibok, Piotr/ABC-6842-2021; Matras-Bolibok, Anna/ABG-9608-2021; Bolibok, Piotr Marek/ABC-6834-2021","Bolibok, Piotr/0000-0002-5649-181X; Bolibok, Piotr Marek/0000-0002-5649-181X",,,,,31,0,0,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,5183,5198,,,,,,16,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553206019,0

But if such cases occurred, this was mostly either age discrimination, or ddiscrimination on work experience grounds.","[Budanceva, Jelena; Titko, Jelena; Zarina, Vita] Univ Econ & Culture, Riga, Latvia",EKA University of Applied Sciences,"Budanceva, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ & Culture, Riga, Latvia.",jelena.budanceva@gmail.com; jelena.titko@eka.edu.lv; vita.zarina@gmail.com,"budanceva, jelena/JCE-7106-2023; Titko, Jelena/W-3824-2019","budanceva, jelena/0000-0002-5205-476X; Titko, Jelena/0000-0003-1333-0941",,,,,22,0,0,0,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,1304,1311,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553202033,0

Such a framework is useful for deriving all existing results with ease. In addition, it also provides insights into two forecast combination puzzles. Specifically, it investigates why a simple average of forecasts often outperforms forecasts from single models in terms of MSFEs, and why a more complicated weighting scheme does not always perform better than a simple average. In addition, this paper presents two new findings that are particularly relevant in practice. First, the MSFE of a forecast combination decreases as the number of models increases. Second, the conventional approach to the selection of optimal models, based on a simple comparison of MSFEs without further statistical testing, leads to a biased selection.

We answer this question through a laboratory experiment. We find that moral suasion increases the investors' trust. Monitoring also increases trust but only when the manager is not aware of the experimental identity of the monitor. The manager returns more to those investors who trust more but appropriates around 50% of the available resources. The trustworthiness of the manager is, however, unaffected by monitoring or moral suasion.

It examines the effect of terrorism on European destinations especially in the past two years of 2015 and 2016 when Europe started to be hit by the Islamic State terrorist attacks. The methods include a literature review of available sources on the research topic found in the world's acknowledged databases.

Some Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (hereafter SMEs) may set up wikis or other knowledge management systems (hereafter KMS) which can be free of charge and easy to do. However, many do not take full advantage of KM as they have tight resource constraints and do not have a formal system implementation process in place. Furthermore, they overlook the importance of organisational culture and treat it as a software installation, leading to KMS implementation failure. Here we explore topics related to KM and KMS in SME settings. We discuss characteristics of SMEs, exploring resource and staffing challenges faced. The concept of tacit and explicit knowledge country (e.g. Japan and US) preferences is noted. We explain different frameworks in KM, including the SECI model for the conversion between tacit and explicit knowledge, and introduce a result driven model aligning business needs with knowledge creation. Thematic analysis explains the main issues affecting SMEs when using KM. With NVivo qualitative analysis software, topics emerging from data collection grouped into themes, resulted in a network of relationships. We show organisational culture plays a crucial role with KM based on a culture of sharing knowledge and information. Trust is required, as people will not share knowledge if there is a threat of losing influence.

The paper tests the hypothesis that closing down a large heavy industry plant in a structurally affected region will increase the risk of morbidity of the population being laid off, which will secondarily lead to increased healthcare expenditures in the form of ambulatory treatment or hospitalisation. The quantification of this hypothesis is based on a unique non-public data set provided by Ceska prumyslova zdravotni pojistovna, a. s., the chief insurance company for employees of ArcelorMittal Ostrava, a. s. The data set contains information about 2,265 insured persons. After some necessary methodological modifi cations, the analysed data set contained 1,408 insured persons. The relationship between unemployment and health, expressed here as morbidity by cause, is estimated using relative risk indicators. The calculation of the risk rates uses the person-year concept. The analysis carried out showed that the unemployed show 11% higher morbidity than the employed. We observed an increase in the morbidity of the unemployed by 21% for tumour diseases, 11% for mental illnesses, 23% for diseases related to alcohol, and 27% for other diseases. The annual costs per insured person at a productive age in the period 2008-2013 were CZK 15,081 without a differentiation by status. We found a significant difference between the annual costs of treatment of employed (CZK 13,420 a year) and unemployed persons (CZK 17,635 a year). The difference of CZK 4,215 means that the costs of treating the unemployed are 31% higher than those for treating the employed, being higher than the relative increase in the risk of disease. The conclusions confirm findings of published international studies.","[Louda, Jiri; Vojacek, Ondrej] JE Purkyne Univ Usti Nad Labem, Fac Social & Econ Sci, Inst Econ & Environm Policy, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic; [Louda, Jiri] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Humanities, Dept Social & Cultural Ecol, Prague, Czech Republic; [Vojacek, Ondrej] Czech Tech Univ, Fac Mech Engn, Dept Management & Econ, Prague, Czech Republic; [Pechholdova, Marketa] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Demog, Prague, Czech Republic; [Bartak, Miroslav] JE Purkyne Univ Usti Nab Labem, Fac Social & Econ Sci, Dept Social Work, Usti Nab Labem, Czech Republic",University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne; Charles University Prague; Czech Technical University Prague; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Louda, J (通讯作者)，JE Purkyne Univ Usti Nad Labem, Fac Social & Econ Sci, Inst Econ & Environm Policy, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic.;Louda, J (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Humanities, Dept Social & Cultural Ecol, Prague, Czech Republic.",louda@ieep.cz; ondrej.vojacek@fs.cvut.cz; marketa.pechholdova@vse.cz; miroslav.bartak@ujep.cz,"Pechholdová, Markéta/AAG-7475-2020; Louda, Jiri/L-9756-2017; Bartak, Miroslav/N-9249-2017","Pechholdová, Markéta/0000-0003-3125-5017; Louda, Jiri/0000-0001-7194-3178; Bartak, Miroslav/0000-0002-7265-6514",,,,,63,0,1,0,7,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Some variables present criteria of nominal convergence as defined in Maastricht Treaty, while the rest of variables indicate the level of real convergence. Univariate analysis has indicated that the membership in the EU is significantly affected by GDP per capita, general government final consumption expenditure, final consumption expenditure, gross capital formation, gross national expenditure, and inflation. Following the univariate binary logistic analysis and separation of variables that affect the individual membership in the EU, a multivariate regression analysis was applied. Multivariate binary logistic regression confirmed significance of general government final consumption expenditure and gross capital formation. The analysis indicated the importance of selecting the timing of accession in terms of the achieved economic development, expressed through the selected macroeconomic indicators.

It is known that the specialization process is always compromised by aggressive factors, and as a result some taxons fail to self-identify as species, and the existing ones adapt to frequent environmental changes. As an example, the data show that in the past the Dniester River sheltered about 80 species of fish, however it currently includes only about 20 species, which implies the total disappearance of some fish species. This phenomenon is also remarked in the Prut River, due to the inefficient regulation of the water flows from the hydrotechnical constructions, the catastrophic climatic conditions in recent years and the anthropogenic phenomena. Also, the quantitative fishery extraction of fish biomass during the year's prohibition periods affected the structural-functional condition of ichthyogenesis. These activities harm not only ichthyofauna, but also some animals such as mammals, birds, crayfish, turtles affecting the entire food chain. In order to protect aquatic biological resources, the State Fisheries Service implements actions to combat poaching and fishing during the year's prohibition periods. These activities are monitored and presented annually in reports and regulated by law. Based on reports and official data issued by these institutions, it can be seen that fishery resources in the country's water basins continue to degrade considerably from one year to the next. Only the strict observance of the laws and normative acts adopted will create the conditions for sustainability and progress.","[Munteanu (Pila), Mihaela; Stanciu, Silvius] Dunarea de Jos Univ Galati, Galati, Romania",Dunarea De Jos University Galati,"Munteanu, M (通讯作者)，Dunarea de Jos Univ Galati, Galati, Romania.",mihaela_pila@yahoo.com; sstanciu@ugal.ro,"Pila, Mihaela M/AAM-1481-2020; STANCIU, SILVIUS/R-8246-2017","STANCIU, SILVIUS/0000-0001-7697-0968",,,,,9,3,3,0,4,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,4907,4912,,,,,,6,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553205098,0

In total, 172 questionnaires were collected, 92 by enterprises and 80 by graduates. Regarding to the results obtained, it is generally accepted that they are favourable from the point of view of the employer and the graduate. The organizational practice of recruiting graduates; both monthly remuneration and professional training are shown to be consensual regarding flexibilisation and precariousness. It should also be noted that both companies and graduates have stated a shortage of soft skills. It was verified that although there is already some proximity between the Polytechnic Institute of Braganca and the market labour, it can adopt: measures to improve and adapt education to the labour market; such as establishing connection and/or cooperation with companies in the region; the promotion of internships during undergraduate courses; regularly assess the adequacy of graduations to the labour market and encourage and promote the entrepreneurship.","[Paulo, Helena; Pais, Luis Santos] Polytech Inst Braganca, Braganca, Portugal; [Fernandes, Paula Odete] Polytech Inst Braganca, UNIAG, Braganca, Portugal",Instituto Politecnico de Braganca; Instituto Politecnico de Braganca,"Fernandes, PO (通讯作者)，Polytech Inst Braganca, UNIAG, Braganca, Portugal.",helena.paulo@ipb.pt; pof@ipb.pt; pais@ipb.pt,"Fernandes, Paula Odete/N-3804-2013; Fernandes, Pedro/HGF-1507-2022","Fernandes, Paula Odete/0000-0001-8714-4901; S.

A great number of exciting businesses now offer alternatives to traditional providers. The threat to their dominance is real, highlighted by the fact that three in four insurers believe their business is at risk of disruption from insurtech. 86% know they must innovate to remain competitive. Staying the same is not an option. Traditional providers, who offered all types of insurance, are being challenged by providers who cater for niche needs. Typical insurtech users are digitally-savvy consumers, so insurtech businesses are focusing on the retail segment, with 75% servicing this sector. As McKinsey says, for plugged-in cohorts, the use of 24/7 digital channels to receive an insurance quote or submit a claim is infinitely preferable to a branch visit. And these needs are being met by insurtech businesses delivering highly personalised, engaging, digital solutions. Excitingly, insurtech is embracing innovative new technologies, too. In time, AI and blockchain will offer peerless security and trust, making them even more compelling for a generation of users who have grown up using tech for everything from banking to transportation to dating.

As regards other components of wellbeing, they play a minor role in everyday communication.","[Shchekotin, Evgeny; Baryshev, Alexey; Mundrievskaya, Yulia] Tomsk State Univ, Tomsk, Russia; [Shchekotin, Evgeny] Novosibirsk State Univ Econ & Management, Novosibirsk, Russia",Tomsk State University; Novosibirsk State University of Economics & Management,"Shchekotin, E (通讯作者)，Tomsk State Univ, Tomsk, Russia.;Shchekotin, E (通讯作者)，Novosibirsk State Univ Econ & Management, Novosibirsk, Russia.",evgvik1978@mail.ru; barishevnp@mail.ru; plaitum356@gmail.com,"Shchekotin, Evgenii/AAZ-5396-2020; Shchekotin, Eugenii V/V-1449-2018","Shchekotin, Evgenii/0000-0001-7377-0645;",Tomsk State University [8.1.49.2018],Tomsk State University,This research was supported by grant No 8.1.49.2018 from 'The Tomsk State University competitiveness improvement programme'.,,36,1,1,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,2663,2672,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553203070,0
