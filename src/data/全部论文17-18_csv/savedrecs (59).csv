Within the physiotherapy market, firms participate in competitive bidding, prices are determined by the market, services are free at the point of use and firms are allowed to react to patient choice only by enhancing quality. Firm-level data (n=854) regarding quality and price were analysed. Using 2SLS estimation techniques, we analysed the relationship between quality and competition, and price and competition. Our study found that competition has a negative (yet weak) effect on quality. Prices on the other hand are not affected by competition. The result is likely caused by imperfect information, because it seems that the Social Insurance Institution of Finland has provided too little information for patients to make adequate choices about proper service providers. We argue that by publishing quality information, it is possible to ease the decision-making of patients and influence the quality strategies of firms active in the physiotherapy market. Moreover, we found that competition appeared as an exogenous variable in this study.

To capture all situations that can arise in continuous time models, it is necessary to consider stopping times as the starting dates of subgames. We generalize Fudenberg and Tirole's (Rev. Econom. Stud. 52, 383-401, 1985) mixed-strategy extensions to make them applicable to stochastic timing games and thereby provide a sound basis for subgame-perfect equilibria of preemption games. Sufficient conditions for equilibrium existence are presented, and examples illustrate their application as well as the fact that intuitive arguments can break down in the presence of stochastic processes with jumps.

However, these studies were forced to rely on cross-state variation in PE requirements to identify their impacts, raising concerns that estimated policy effects may be confounded by state-level unobservables. Using data from the State and National Youth Risk Behavior Surveys and exploiting recent changes in state high school PE laws, we re-examine the effect of PE requirements on body weight. Our estimates show that a one-semester increase in PE requirements is associated with a 10 to 13% increase in minutes per week spent physically active in PE classes, but with no change in net vigorous exercise and little change in youth body weight. We conclude that substitution of in-school for outside-of-school physical activity and small resultant net energy expenditures can explain the absence of body weight effects.

By using a consistent estimator of the error covariance matrix, we can take into account both cross-sectional correlations and heteroskedasticity. In the presence of cross-sectional correlations, the proposed estimator eliminates the cross-sectional correlation bias, and is more efficient than the existing methods. The rate of convergence is also improved. In addition, we find that when the statistical inference involves estimating a high-dimensional inverse covariance matrix, the minimax convergence rate on large covariance estimations is not sufficient for inferences. To address this issue, a new doubly weighted convergence result is developed. The proposed method is applied to the US divorce rate data. We find that our more efficient estimator identifies the significant effects of divorce-law reforms on the divorce rate, and provides tighter confidence intervals than existing methods. This provides a confirmation for the empirical findings of Wolfers (2006) under more general unobserved heterogeneity. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Completeness provides a useful way of obtaining nonparametric identification in various models including nonparametric regression models with instrumental variables, nonclassical measurement error models, and auction models, etc. However, the condition is quite abstract for empirical work and lacks a proper economic interpretation. We rely on known results regarding the Volterra equation to provide sufficient conditions for completeness conditions for densities with compact support. Our conditions include various smoothness assumptions and monotonously moving support assumptions on the kernel function of the operator.

As a result, the use of categorical data (such as self-reported health status) produces rankings that may be arbitrary and contingent to the numerical scale adopted. In this paper, we develop a method that overcomes this issue by providing conditions for which these rankings are invariant to the numerical scale chosen by the researcher. In doing so, we draw on the insight provided by Allison and Foster (2004) and extend their method to the dimension of socioeconomic inequality by exploiting the properties of rank-dependent indices such as Wagstaff (2002) achievement and extended concentration indices.

When reputational concerns are high, following the introduction or enhancement of public reporting, the less altruistic (bad) doctor mimics the more altruistic (good) doctor. Otherwise, either a separating or a semi-separating equilibrium arises: the bad doctor mimics the good doctor with probability less than one. Pay-for-performance incentive schemes are unlikely to induce crowding out, unless some dimensions of quality are unobservable.

Comparing with previous studies, our results are more precisely estimated due to the large sample size. Using administrative data sets, the problems arising from self-reported samples are also mitigated. Moreover, we are able to examine both singletons by controlling sibling fixed effects and twins by controlling twin fixed effects. Our results show that an infant's birth weight has positive influence on health and education. Our twin fixed-effects estimates confirm the finding of a long-lasting, but diminishing in the longer run, effects of birth weight.

Upcoding is defined as classifying patients in diagnosis-related groups codes associated with larger payments. The incentive for upcoding is not restricted to private providers of care. Conceptually, any patient classification system that is used for payment purposes may be vulnerable to this sort of strategic behaviour by providers. We document here that upcoding occurs in a National Health Service where public hospitals have their payment (budget) tied to the classification of treatment episodes. Using diagnosis-related groups data from Portugal, we found that the practice of upcoding has been used in the hospitals in a way leading to larger budgets (age of patients plays a key role). The effect is quantitatively small.

We propose the Multiplicative Error Model with volatility jumps (MEM-J) to describe and predict the probability and the size of these extreme events. Under the MEM-J, the conditional density of the realized measure is a countably infinite mixture of Gamma and Kappa distributions, with closed form conditional moments. We derive stationarity conditions and the asymptotic theory for the maximum likelihood estimation. Estimates of the volatility jump component confirm that the probability of jumps dramatically increases during the financial crises. The MEM-J improves over other models with fat tails.

Using product-specific nutritional information, we develop a new method of partitioning the product space into relevant nutritional clusters that define a set of nutritionally-bundled goods, which parsimoniously characterize consumer choice sets. We then estimate a large utility-derived demand system over this joint product-nutrient space that allows us to calculate price and expenditure elasticities. Using our structural demand estimates, we simulate the role of product taxes on soda, sugar sweetened beverages, packaged meals, and snacks, and nutrient taxes on fat, salt, and sugar. We find that a 20% nutrient tax has a significantly larger impact on nutrition than an equivalent product tax, due to the fact that these are broader-based taxes. However, the costs of these taxes in terms of consumer utility are only about 70 cents per household per day. A sugar tax in particular is a powerful tool to induce healthier nutritive bundles among consumers. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Trastuzumab (Herceptin (R)) is a monoclonal antibody directed against the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) for the treatment of breast cancer. Several trastuzumab biosimilars are currently in development. In 2015, trastuzumab was the drug with the highest financial consumption among all drugs in Croatia. This model estimates the 1-year budget impact of the introduction of biosimilar trastuzumab in Croatia. Methods A budget impact model, based on approvals for trastuzumab treatment in 2015, was developed for the introduction of biosimilars. Two biosimilar scenarios were developed: biosimilar scenario 1, based on all approvals in 2015, and biosimilar scenario 2, based on approvals after February 2015 and the reimbursement of the subcutaneous formulation of trastuzumab in Croatia. Only trastuzumab naive patients and drug-acquisition costs were used in the model. Uptake of biosimilar was assumed at 50 %. Scenarios were calculated with price discounts of 15, 25 and 35 %. The robustness of the model was tested by extensive sensitivity analyses. Results The projected drug cost savings from the introduction of biosimilar trastuzumab range from (sic)0.26 million (scenario 2, 15 % price discount) to (sic)0.69 million (scenario 1, 35 % price discount). If budget savings were reinvested to treat additional patients with trastuzumab, 14 (scenario 2, 15 % price discount) to 47 (scenario 1, 35 % price discount) additional patients could be treated. Sensitivity analyses showed that the incidence of breast cancer had the highest impact on the model, with a 10 % decrease in incidence leading to an 11.3 % decrease in projected savings. Conclusion The introduction of biosimilar trastuzumab could lead to significant drug cost savings in Croatia.","[Cesarec, August] Croatian Hlth Insurance Fund, Dept Hlth Serv Anal & Dev, Margaretska 3, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Likic, Robert] Univ Hosp Ctr Zagreb, Clin Pharmacol Unit, Dept Internal Med, Kispaticeva 12, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Likic, R (通讯作者)，Univ Hosp Ctr Zagreb, Clin Pharmacol Unit, Dept Internal Med, Kispaticeva 12, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",august.cesarec@hzzo.hr; robert.likic@mef.hr,"Likic, Robert/J-6401-2019","Likic, Robert/0000-0003-1413-4862; Cesarec, August/0000-0002-4587-0603",,,,,56,27,26,1,14,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

Patients' preferences with regard to these new treatments have not been investigated. Objectives: To assess preferences of patients with breast cancer and of healthy women regarding these new techniques, compared with conventional surgical treatments. Methods: Six hypothetical breast cancer treatment-outcome scenarios were developed: three standard surgical scenarios (mastectomy, mastectomy with immediate implant-based reconstruction, and breast-conserving therapy [BCT]) and three minimally invasive or noninvasive scenarios (radiofrequency ablation, magnetic resonance-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation, and single-dose ablative radiotherapy). Participants rated treatment outcome scenarios by visual analogue scale (VAS) and time trade-off (TTO). The Friedman and post hoc Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to test whether scores were significantly different from BCT. Results: Seventy-one patients with breast cancer and 50 healthy volunteers participated. Overall, BCT was rated the highest in terms of VAS (0.80) and TTO (0.90) scores. After stratification, BCT ranked the highest in most subgroups, with the exception of healthy individuals, who had given the highest score to ablative boost (VAS, 0.80; TTO, 0.88). Mastectomy with immediate reconstruction was the least preferred in most subgroups. Conclusions: This study showed no significant preference for minimally invasive treatment for breast cancer. Using hypothetical scenarios, breast cancer survivors attributed the highest scores to BCT, whereas healthy volunteers showed a slight preference for minimally invasive treatments.","[Knuttel, Floortje M.; van den Bosch, Maurice A.

We also address the potential endogeneity of mental illness using an approach proposed by Lewbel (2012) that relies on heteroscedastic covariance restrictions rather than questionable exclusion restrictions for identification. Data come from the US National Comorbidity Survey -Replication and the National Latino and Asian American Study. We find that mental illness adversely affects employment and labor force participation and also reduces the number of weeks worked and increases work absenteeism. To assist in the interpretation of findings, we simulate the labor market outcomes of individuals meeting diagnostic criteria for mental disorder if they had the same mental health symptom profile as individuals not meeting diagnostic criteria. We estimate potential gains in employment for 3.5 million individuals, and reduction in workplace costs of absenteeism of $21.6 billion due to the resultant improvement in mental health.

Objectives Our objective was to assess how cost-effectiveness estimates of HCV therapy can vary depending on assumptions regarding the potential impact of HCV therapy on non-hepatic mortality. Methods We adapted a state-transition model to include potential effects of HCV therapy on non-hepatic mortality. We assumed successful treatment could reduce non-hepatic mortality by as little as 0 % to as much as 100 %. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were computed comparing immediate treatment versus delayed treatment and comparing immediate treatment versus non-treatment. Results Comparing immediate treatment versus delayed treatment, when we included a 44 % reduction in non-hepatic mortality following successful HCV treatment, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained by HCV treatment fell by 76 % (from US$314,100 to US$76,900) for patients with no fibrosis and by 43 % (from US$62,500 to US$35,800) for patients with moderate fibrosis. Comparing immediate treatment versus non-treatment, assuming a 44 % reduction in non-hepatic mortality following successful HCV treatment, the incremental cost per QALY gained by HCV treatment fell by 64 % (from US$186,700 to US$67,300) for patients with no fibrosis and by 27 % (from US$35,000 to US$25,500) for patients with moderate fibrosis. Conclusion Including reductions in non-hepatic mortality from HCV treatment can have substantial effects on the estimated cost-effectiveness of treatment.","[Leidner, Andrew J.; Spradling, Philip R.; Holmberg, Scott D.] Centers Dis Control & Prevent, Div Viral Hepatitis, 1600 Clifton Rd,Mailstop G 37, Atlanta, GA 30333 USA; [Chesson, Harrell W.] Centers Dis Control & Prevent, Div Sexually Transmitted Dis Prevent, Atlanta, GA USA",Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA; Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA,"Leidner, AJ (通讯作者)，Centers Dis Control & Prevent, Div Viral Hepatitis, 1600 Clifton Rd,Mailstop G 37, Atlanta, GA 30333 USA.",aleidner@cdc.gov,"Chesson, Harrell/AHC-8004-2022",,"Division of Viral Hepatitis at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Centers for Disease Control Foundation; AbbVie; Abbott Laboratories; Genetech, a Member of the Roche Group; Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson Johnson; Vertex Pharmaceuticals","Division of Viral Hepatitis at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Centers for Disease Control Foundation; AbbVie(AbbVie); Abbott Laboratories(Abbott Laboratories); Genetech, a Member of the Roche Group; Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson Johnson; Vertex Pharmaceuticals(Vertex Pharmaceuticals)","Andrew Leidner, Harrell Chesson, Philip Spradling, and Scott Holmberg report no conflicts of interest.

In addition, the process of the growth of oligarchy has resulted in the resurgence of patrimonialism. It implies that both of the groups survive and establish military patrimonialism in reformation era. Both groups are two different entities competing in several matters, including the nationalization of PT Inalum. This study employs two main theoretical frames of oligarchy and patrimonialism. It argued that the competition between the two oligarchic groups reveals the resurgence, growth, and development of oligarchy after the initial emergence in the New Order. This study reveals that reformation has transformed patron-client relationship initially established in the New Order and later grown and strengthened in reformation era to become oligarchy. The oligarchy has resulted in competition for economic resources among oligarchic groups.","[Bathoro, Alim] Univ Indonesia, Univ Maritim Raja Ali Haji, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Kosandi, Meidi] Univ Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia",University of Indonesia; University of Indonesia,"Bathoro, A (通讯作者)，Univ Indonesia, Univ Maritim Raja Ali Haji, Jakarta, Indonesia.",albath71@gmail.com; mkosandi@yahoo.com,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-427-9,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2017,167.0,,,,,,199,207,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Political Science; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration; Government & Law,BJ6IT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426719600027,0

They'are growing force to the national development and globally by increasing contribution to the global economic and governance (Pricewaterhouse, 2015). In Indonesia, since the era of Old Order (1945-1966), New Order (1966-1998) to Reformasi (1998-current), SOEs have been inseparable instruments in the social and economic development (Mardjana, 1992). Beside their profit motive, SOEs have attributable social benefits for the purpose of public service. The larger the SOE sector, the larger government's direct influence over the public sector (Smith and Trebilcock, 2001). However, SOEs have been associated with major governance cases in Indonesia such as being rigid, bureaucratic and poor services in distributing service to the public and the performances were below average compared to their peers (Chang, 2007; Wicaksono, 2008; Hill, 2000). These circumstances have created a perception of how incompetent the government is in implementing policy (McLeod, 2005) and lead to the minimum aggregate of public value creation. In some SOEs considered a success story, the performance is merely limited to the business value creation rather than public value creation. SOEs reform existed to respond to the problem through variety of reform options and has been considered among critical reform beside beauracratic, decentralization and fiscal reform. The purpose of this paper is to investigate key determinants factors to improve SOEs' capacity in public value creation, specifically from SOEs reform agendas using predominatly several key concepts including of Public Value (Moore, 1995), TIMM (PWc, 2015), Public Sector Reform (Cayden, 1969;) and through the utilization of Soft Sytems Methodology as the action research approach.","[Nugraha, Ubaidillah] Univ Indonesia, Fac Adm Sci, Depok, Indonesia; [Nugraha, Ubaidillah] Univ Bina Nusantara, West Jakarta, Indonesia",University of Indonesia; Universitas Bina Nusantara,"Nugraha, U (通讯作者)，Univ Indonesia, Fac Adm Sci, Depok, Indonesia.;Nugraha, U (通讯作者)，Univ Bina Nusantara, West Jakarta, Indonesia.",ubaidillah.nugraha@ui.ac.id,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,3,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-427-9,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2017,167.0,,,,,,35,41,,,,,,7,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Political Science; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration; Government & Law,BJ6IT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426719600006,0

Views of the Public in the Netherlands,VALUE IN HEALTH,,,English,Article,,,,,,,HEALTH TECHNOLOGY-ASSESSMENT; DISCRETE-CHOICE EXPERIMENT; PEOPLES PREFERENCES; VALUING HEALTH; CARE; EQUITY; QALYS,"Objectives: Recent debates in the Netherlands on health care priority setting have focused on the relative value of gains generated by life extending medicines for people with a terminal illness, mostly new cancer drugs. These treatments are generally expensive, provide relatively small health gains, and therefore usually do not meet common cost per QALY thresholds. Nevertheless, these drugs may be provided under the assumption that there is public support for making a special case for treatments for people with a terminal illness. This study investigated the views of the public in the Netherlands on a range of equity and efficiency considerations relevant to priority setting and examines whether there is public support for making such a special case. Methods: Using Q methodology, three viewpoints on important principles for priority setting were identified. Data were collected through ranking exercises conducted by 46 members of the general public in the Netherlands, including 11 respondents with personal experience with cancer. Results: Viewpoint 1 emphasized that people have equal rights to healthcare and opposed priority setting on any ground. Viewpoint 2 emphasized that the care for terminal patients should at all times respect the patients' quality of life, which sometimes means refraining from invasive treatments. Viewpoint 3 had a strong focus on effective and efficient care and had no moral objection against priority setting under certain circumstances. Conclusions: Overall, we found little public support for the assumption that health gains in terminally ill patients are more valuable than those in other patients. This implies that the assumption that society is prepared to pay more for health gains in people who have only a short period of lifetime left does not correspond with societal preferences in the Netherlands.","[Wouters, Sofie; van Exel, Job; Brouwer, Werner B.

We included only economic evaluations concerning left atrial appendage closure devices. Data were extracted from articles by two authors working independently and using three analysis grids to measure the quality of economic evaluations [the British Medical Journal(BMJ) checklist, the hierarchy scale developed by Cooper et al. (J Health Serv Res Policy 10:245-50, 2005) and the Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) instrument].ResultsSeven economic evaluations met our inclusion criteria. All were published between 2013 and 2016. All were cost-utility analyses, and fully complied with the BMJ checklist. According to the hierarchy scale developed by Cooper et al., the quality of data used was heterogeneous. Finally, the mean score for the seven economic studies was 90/100 with the QHES instrument.ConclusionsDespite the recent development of left atrial appendage closure devices, most economic evaluations conducted here were well-designed studies. Furthermore, different tools used to assess the quality of these studies were complementary, but none gave a global vision of the quality of economic studies.","[Nedellec, Etienne; Pineau, Judith; Prognon, Patrice; Martelli, Nicolas] Georges Pompidou European Hosp, AP HP, Pharm Dept, 20 Rue Leblanc, F-75015 Paris, France; [Martelli, Nicolas] Univ Paris Saclay, Univ Paris Sud, EA 7358, GRADES, 5 Rue Jean Baptiste Clement, F-92290 Chatenay Malabry, France",Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Universite Paris Cite; Hopital Universitaire Europeen Georges-Pompidou - APHP; Universite Paris Saclay,"Martelli, N (通讯作者)，Georges Pompidou European Hosp, AP HP, Pharm Dept, 20 Rue Leblanc, F-75015 Paris, France.;Martelli, N (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Saclay, Univ Paris Sud, EA 7358, GRADES, 5 Rue Jean Baptiste Clement, F-92290 Chatenay Malabry, France.",nicolas.martelli@aphp.fr,"Martelli, Nicolas/ABB-2722-2021","Martelli, Nicolas/0000-0001-5959-231X",,,,,26,6,6,0,2,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

Assuming that preferences are monotonic with respect to adding friends and antimonotonic with respect to adding enemies, we use bipolar responsive extensions to lift the players' rankings of players to their (partial) preferences over coalitions. We propose cardinal comparability functions in order to extend partial to complete preference orders consistent with these polarized responsive orders, in particular focusing on Borda-induced FEN-hedonic games.

I.; Lambert-Mogiliansky, A.",,,Targeting in quantum persuasion problem,JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Persuasion; Belief; Updating; Quantum-like; Subjective representation,,"In this paper we investigate the potential for persuasion arising from the quantum indeterminacy of a decision-maker's beliefs, a feature that has been proposed as a formal expression of well-known cognitive limitations. We focus on a situation where an agent called Sender only has few opportunities to influence the decision-maker called Receiver. We do not address the full persuasion problem but restrict attention to a simpler one that we call targeting, i.e. inducing a specific belief state. The analysis is developed within the frame of a n-dimensional Hilbert space model. We find that when the prior is known, Sender can induce a targeted belief with a probability of at least 1/n when using two sequential measurements. This figure climbs to 1/2 when both the target and the belief are known pure states. A main insight from the analysis is that a well-designed strategy of distraction can be used as a first step to confuse Receiver. We thus find that distraction rather than the provision of relevant arguments is an effective means to achieve persuasion. We provide an example from political decision-making. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This study aimed to develop and compare conversion functions that map the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) total score to the EuroQoL 5-Dimensions, 5-Levels (EQ-5D-5L) utility value via four methods. We used the HRQoL scores of 238 Singapore patients with breast cancer to develop the conversion function for the equipercentile, linear equating, mean rank and ordinary least squares (OLS) methods. We compared the distributions of the observed values and the four sets of mapped values and performed regression analyses to assess whether the association with risk factors was preserved by utility values derived from mapping. At baseline, the observed EQ-5D-5L utility value had a mean +/- standard deviation (SD) of 0.820 +/- 0.152, and 24.8% of the respondents attained a value of 1. The OLS method (mean 0.820; SD 0.112; proportion 0%) better agreed with the observed data than the equipercentile (mean 0.831; SD 0.152; proportion 23.5%), linear equating (mean 0.814; SD 0.145; proportion 11.8%) and mean rank method (mean 0.821; SD 0.147; proportion 23.9%). The significance of association was preserved for all parameters involved in the regression analyses by the equipercentile and linear equating methods, but the mean rank and OLS methods were inconsistent with the observed data for one and two parameters, respectively. The problem of shrinkage in the variance occurred in the OLS method, but it provided an unbiased estimate for the mean and better agreement. Among the other three linking methods, the mean rank method better described the distribution, whereas the equipercentile and linear equating methods better assessed the association with risk factors.","[Lee, Chun Fan] Univ Hong Kong, Sch Publ Hlth, 1-F Patrick Manson Bldg,7 Sassoon Rd, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Ng, Raymond] Natl Canc Ctr, Dept Med Oncol, Singapore, Singapore; [Luo, Nan] Natl Univ Singapore, Saw Swee Hock Sch Publ Hlth, Singapore, Singapore; [Cheung, Yin Bun] Duke NUS Med Sch, Ctr Quantitat Med, Singapore, Singapore; [Cheung, Yin Bun] Singapore Clin Res Inst, Dept Biostat, Singapore, Singapore; [Cheung, Yin Bun] Univ Tampere, Ctr Child Hlth Res, Tampere, Finland; [Cheung, Yin Bun] Tampere Univ Hosp, Tampere, Finland",University of Hong Kong; National Cancer Centre Singapore (NCCS); National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; Singapore Clinical Research Institute; Tampere University; Tampere University; Tampere University Hospital,"Lee, CF (通讯作者)，Univ Hong Kong, Sch Publ Hlth, 1-F Patrick Manson Bldg,7 Sassoon Rd, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",fanlee@hku.hk,,,"National Medical Research Council, Singapore [NMRC/EDG/0063/2009]","National Medical Research Council, Singapore(National Medical Research Council, Singapore)","This study was funded by National Medical Research Council, Singapore (NMRC/EDG/0063/2009).",,27,13,13,1,10,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

Specifically, we study the impact of the Arkansas Health Care Payment Improvement Initiative, a multi-payer program that requires providers to enter into EBP arrangements for perinatal care, covering the majority of births in the state. Unlike fee-for-service reimbursement, EBP holds physicians responsible for all care within a discrete episode, rewarding physicians for efficient use of their own services and for efficient management of other health care inputs. In a difference-in-differences analysis of commercial claims, we find that perinatal spending in Arkansas decreased by 3.8% overall under EBP, compared to surrounding states. The decrease was driven by reduced spending on non-physician health care inputs, specifically the prices paid for inpatient facility care. We additionally find a limited improvement in quality of care under EBP. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: A cross-sectional and longitudinal design was used to assess the PerfO measurement properties using the US Food and Drug Administration guidance for industry around patient-reported outcome measures to support labeling claims. Patient-reported outcome measures and patient- and clinician-reported global concept items were completed along with four PerfO measures at visit 1 and two follow-up visits. Measurement properties assessed included reliability, construct validity, ability to detect change, and estimates of meaningful change. Results: A total of 280 patients (100 eTHR, 105 eTKR, and 75 HF) were recruited, with most (n = 276) providing data at visit 1. Most of the patients were female (64%) and retired (64%), and had at least one comorbidity (91%). Inter-rater and test-retest reliability ranged from good to excellent (0.73 < intraclass correlation coefficient < 0.95) for each PerfO measure. Known-groups validity was demonstrated for all PerfO measures, with those reporting less pain better physical functioning and those who did not use an assistive device having quicker mean completion times. Construct validity and ability to detect change were demonstrated and estimates of meaningful change derived. Conclusions: This study found the measurement properties of four PerfO measures in samples of patients with eTHR, eTKR, and HF to be supported for consideration of future use, and provided estimates for interpretation of change.","[Doll, Helen; Ballinger, Rachel] ICON Clin Res, Abingdon, Oxon, England; [Gentile, Brittany] ICON Clin Res, San Francisco, CA USA; [Bush, Elizabeth Nicole] Eli Lilly & Co, Patient Focused Outcomes Ctr Expertise, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA",ICON plc; ICON plc; Eli Lilly,"Ballinger, R (通讯作者)，ICON Clin Res UK Ltd, 100 Pk Dr,Milton Pk, Abingdon OX14 4RY, Oxon, England.",rachel.ballinger@iconplc.com,,"Gentile, Brittany/0000-0002-6302-5593",Eli Lilly and Co.,Eli Lilly and Co.(Eli Lilly),This study was funded by Eli Lilly and Co.,,34,14,15,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP,2018,21.0,9.0,,,,,1104,1114,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.02.006,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GT9BF,30224116.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000444833500014,0

This is the first study to evaluate the effects of nonadherence on the evaluation and selection of personalized screening strategies. Methods: Different adherence scenarios were established on the basis of findings from the literature. A Markov microsimulation model was adapted to evaluate the effects of these adherence scenarios on three different personalized strategies. Results: First, three adherence scenarios describing the relationship between risk and adherence were identified: 1) a positive association between risk and screening adherence, 2) a negative association, or 3) a curvilinear relationship. Second, these three adherence scenarios were evaluated in three personalized strategies. Our results show that it is more the absolute adherence rate than the nature of the risk-adherence relationship that is important to determine which strategy is the most cost-effective. Furthermore, probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that there are risk-stratified screening strategies that are more cost-effective than routine screening if the willingness-to-pay threshold for screening is below US $60,000. Conclusions: Our results show that nonadherence affects the relative performance of screening strategies. Thus, it is necessary to include the true adherence level to evaluate personalized screening strategies and to select the best strategy.","[Arnold, Matthias] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Munich Ctr Hlth Sci, Munich, Germany; [Arnold, Matthias] German Res Ctr Environm Hlth, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Neuherberg, Germany; [Quante, Anne S.] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Fac Med, IBE, Chair Genet Epidemiol, Munich, Germany; [Quante, Anne S.] German Res Ctr Environm Hlth, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Inst Genet Epidemiol, Neuherberg, Germany; [Quante, Anne S.] Tech Univ Munich, Univ Hosp Rechts Isar, Dept Gynecol & Obstet, Munich, Germany",University of Munich; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health; University of Munich; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health; Technical University of Munich,"Arnold, M (通讯作者)，Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Inst Gesundheitsokon & Management Gesundheitswese, Ludwigstr 28 RG,5 OG, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",arnold@bwl.lmu.de,,"Arnold, Matthias/0000-0002-9736-7233",,,,,46,4,4,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL,2018,21.0,7.0,,,,,799,808,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.12.022,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GM6VJ,30005752.0,"Green Accepted, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000438314900007,0
J,"Ahammer, A",,,,"Ahammer, Alexander",,,"Physicians, sick leave certificates, and patients' subsequent employment outcomes",HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,employment; general practitioners; sick leave duration,WORK ABSENCE; MODELS; COST,"I analyze how general practitioners (GPs) indirectly affect their patients' employment outcomes by deciding the length of sick leaves. I use an instrumental variables framework where spell durations are identified through supply-side certification measures. I find that a day of sick leave certified only because the worker's GP has a high propensity to certify sick leaves decreases the employment probability persistently by 0.45-0.69 percentage points, but increases the risk of becoming unemployed by 0.28-0.44 percentage points. These effects are mostly driven by workers with low job tenure. Several robustness checks show that endogenous matching between patients and GPs does not impair identification. My results bear important implications for doctors: Whenever medically justifiable, certifying shorter sick leaves to protect the employment status of the patient may be beneficial.","[Ahammer, Alexander] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Dept Econ, Linz, Austria; [Ahammer, Alexander] Christian Doppler Lab Aging Hlth & Labor Market, Linz, Austria",Johannes Kepler University Linz,"Ahammer, A (通讯作者)，Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Dept Econ, Linz, Austria.",alexander.ahammer@jku.at,,"Ahammer, Alexander/0000-0001-9280-4791","Christian Doppler Laboratory on Aging, Health; Christian Doppler Laboratory on Aging, Health, and the Labor Market","Christian Doppler Laboratory on Aging, Health; Christian Doppler Laboratory on Aging, Health, and the Labor Market","A previous version of this paper was circulated under the title How Physicians Affect Patients' Employment Outcomes Through Deciding on Sick Leave Durations.

Although broadly similar, the studies differ in how they identify the outcome equation. One approach uses conventional socio-economic variables as instruments for endogenous health care expenditure, whereas the other exploits exogenous elements in the resource allocation formula for local budgets. The former approach has usually been applied to specific disease areas (e.g., for cancer and circulatory disease), whereas the other has only been applied to all-cause mortality. In this letter, we compare the two approaches by using them to estimate the direct all-cause elasticity as well as disease-specific elasticities. We also calculate the implied all-cause elasticity associated with the disease-specific results. We find that the funding rule approach to identification can be successfully replicated and applied to disease area models. This is important because disease area models reduce the danger of aggregation bias present in all-cause analysis, and they offer the opportunity to link estimated mortality effects to more complete measures of health outcome that reflect what is currently known about the survival and morbidity disease burden in different programmes.","[Claxton, Karl; Lomas, James] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Claxton, Karl; Martin, Stephen] Univ York, Dept Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK; University of York - UK,"Martin, S (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",sdm1@york.ac.uk,,,UK's Department of Health,UK's Department of Health,UK's Department of Health.,,5,22,22,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,JUN,2018,27.0,6.0,,,,,1017,1023,,10.1002/hec.3650,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GF0UN,29607571.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431646700007,0

We examine the impact of this development on mortality among adults and the elderly by exploiting the variation in the timing of the deployment and the intensity of expansion of gas networks across provinces using data from 2001 to 2016. The results indicate that the expansion of natural gas has caused significant reductions in mortality among both adults and the elderly. These findings are supported by our auxiliary analysis, which demonstrates that the expansion of natural gas networks might have led to a significant improvement in air quality. Furthermore, we show that the mortality gains are primarily driven by reductions in cardiorespiratory deaths, which are more likely to be due to conditions caused or exacerbated by air pollution.

Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that is effective for the reversal of heroin overdose in emergency situations and can be used by nonmedical responders. Objective: Our aim was to assess the cost-effectiveness of distributing naloxone to adults at risk of heroin overdose for use by nonmedical responders compared with no naloxone distribution in a European healthcare setting (United Kingdom). Methods: A Markov model with an integrated decision tree was developed based on an existing model, using UK data where available. We evaluated an intramuscular naloxone distribution reaching 30% of heroin users. Costs and effects were evaluated over a lifetime and discounted at 3.5%. The results were assessed using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: The model estimated that distribution of intramuscular naloxone, would decrease overdose deaths by around 6.6%. In a population of 200,000 heroin users this equates to the prevention of 2,500 premature deaths at an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of 899. The sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results. Conclusions: Our evaluation suggests that the distribution of take-home naloxone decreased overdose deaths by around 6.6% and was cost-effective with an incremental cost per QALY gained well below a 20,000 willingness-to-pay threshold set by UK decision-makers. The model code has been made available to aid future research. Further study is warranted on the impact of different formulations of naloxone on cost-effectiveness and the impact takehome naloxone has on the wider society.","[Langham, Sue; Wright, Antony] Maverex Ltd, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Kenworthy, James; Dunlop, William C.

To assess value for money, their cost effectiveness in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel from the Dutch societal perspective was investigated. Methods A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted using efficacy, symptomatic skeletal-related event and safety data obtained from indirect treatment comparisons. Missing skeletal-related event data for cabazitaxel were conservatively assumed to be identical to radium-223. A Markov model combined these clinical inputs with Dutch-specific resource use and costs for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treatment from a societal perspective. Total quality-adjusted life-years and costs in 2017 euros were calculated over a 5-year (lifetime) time horizon. Results Radium-223 resulted in (sic)6092 and (sic)4465 lower costs and 0.02 and 0.01 higher quality-adjusted life-years compared with abiraterone and cabazitaxel, respectively, demonstrating dominance of radium-223. Sensitivity analyses reveal a 64% (54%) chance of radium-223 being cost effective compared with abiraterone (cabazitaxel) at the informal (sic)80,000 willingness-to-pay threshold. Compared with enzalutamide, radium-223 resulted in slightly lower quality-adjusted life-years (-0.06) and (sic)7390 lower costs, revealing a 61% chance of radium-223 being cost effective compared with enzalutamide. The lower costs of radium-223 compared with abiraterone and enzalutamide are driven by lower drug costs and prevention of expensive skeletal-related events. Compared with cabazitaxel, the lower costs of radium-223 are driven by lower costs of the drug, administration and adverse events. Conclusion Radium-223 may be a less costly treatment strategy offering similar gains in health benefits compared with abiraterone, cabazitaxel and enzalutamide in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel from the Dutch societal perspective.","[Peters, Michel L.; Baka, Agni] Mapi Grp, Real World Strategy & Analyt, Houten, Netherlands; [de Meijer, Claudine] Bayer BV, Mijdrecht, Netherlands; [Wyndaele, Dirk] Catharina Hosp, Dept Nucl Med, Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Noordzij, Walter] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Nucl Med & Mol Imaging, Groningen, Netherlands; [Leliveld-Kors, Annemarie M.] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Urol, Groningen, Netherlands; [van den Bosch, Joan] Albert Schweitzer Ziekenhuis, Dept Internal Med, Dordrecht, Netherlands; [van den Berg, Pieter H.] Tergooi Ziekenhuizen, Dept Internal Med, Hilversum, Netherlands; [Gaultney, Jennifer G.] Mapi Grp, Real World Strategy & Analyt, Translat & Innovat Hub Bldg,5th Floor, London W12 OBZ, England",Bayer AG; Catharina Hospital; University of Groningen; University of Groningen,"Gaultney, JG (通讯作者)，Mapi Grp, Real World Strategy & Analyt, Translat & Innovat Hub Bldg,5th Floor, London W12 OBZ, England.",jgaultney@mapigroup.com,,"Leliveld, Annemarie/0000-0002-7028-0824; Baka, A./0000-0001-6863-5561",Bayer B.

We build a theoretical framework that decomposes domestic and international financing for HIV into nonlinear functions of national income, HIV prevalence, and government effectiveness. We test this model, paying particular attention to nonlinearities and to problems of bad controls, multicollinearity, and reverse causality. Finally, we use the fitted values of quartile regressions to study how much countries could reasonably pay domestically and how much they should receive from donors. Worryingly, countries with higher financial means receive on average more aid per PLHIV than very poor ones, and countries with higher HIV prevalence receive on average less aid per people living with HIV. The normative analysis concludes that US$3.08billion of fiscal space could be created in LIC and MIC. We identify the countries that could be allocated more aid.","[Sterck, Olivier C.] Univ Oxford, Ctr Study African Econ, Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England",University of Oxford,"Sterck, OC (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Ctr Study African Econ, Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",olivier.sterck@economics.ox.ac.uk,,"Sterck, Olivier/0000-0003-3835-9388",Rush Foundation,Rush Foundation,"Rush Foundation, Grant/Award Number: RethinkHIV",,37,6,6,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,FEB,2018,27.0,2.0,,,,,320,332,,10.1002/hec.3550,0.0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA7NO,28685925.0,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428523400019,0

These so called neo-charismatic started expressing themselves in the 80s. The Brazillian-born Igreja Universal do Reino de Deus (IURD) and Mand-Igreja Crista, founded by a Portuguese man are two religious communities that have gained traction in their influence in the religious spectre. These groups adopted the Prosperity theology and introduced a new concept in the Portuguese religious sphere. They are oriented by a market sense, comparable to a business, assuming a highly competitive feature. This doctrine ends up being w ell accepted in the poverty-stricken sectors of the population, the socially frail and immigrants with difficulty integrating in society. The practical influence of these new religious communities' works as a temporary placebo' that ends in frustration, economical turmoil towards individuals and families, as well as monetary expenses due to the 'deviation' of considerable funds for religious organizations, that work as a multinational without subjecting to taxes. Thus, by not practicing good citizen standards of paying taxes in the name of a religious entity, they use their religious image merely as a facade. Given the evidence that we brought to light, the contributions given by the faithful are transferred to purchase personal goods for the heads of these organizations. It is time, in strict respect to the principle of religious freedom and secular vocation of democratic and civilized states, to learn how to deal with these social scourges that contribute nothing towards social, economic and psychological sustainability, and the well-being of the people.","[Brissos-Lino, Jose] CPES Univ Lusofona Humanidades & Tecnol, Lisbon, Portugal",,"Brissos-Lino, J (通讯作者)，CPES Univ Lusofona Humanidades & Tecnol, Lisbon, Portugal.",jose.lino@ulusofona.pt,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,363,368,,,,,,6,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BP4BP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000550734100038,0

But the agency theory may also be used in many different areas and situations when the principal's welfare, in the presence of information asymmetry, depends on the agent's actions. Therefore, due to the fact that this theory is rather rudimentary, it may be applied on other areas as well, such as the lemon market, insurance market, working vacancies, parliamentary election and similar. The aim of this research paper is application of the agency theory in the area of tax policy. To be more precise, this paper is an attempt to explain the problem of tax evasion through the prism of elements of the agency theory. In this paper a model will be specified in which the government with its fiscal sovereignty is considered to be the principal and the tax payer is considered to be the agent. The tax evasion problem is considered as the agency problem. Elements of the agency theory that are present in the problem of tax evasion include the opposition of goals between the government and the tax payer, definition of rules of the game, information asymmetry, moral hazard when illegally evading tax payments and agency costs, i.e. tax evasion costs. The purpose of studying agency problem in the context of tax evasion is to find a mechanism that will enable the principal-agent problem or to offer adequate solutions in the case of its occurrence. Consistent with the prior, the aim of this research paper is identification of possible solutions for prevention of the tax evasion problem or at least offering certain solutions for mitigation of this problem, as evident from the model that determines mutual relationships between different elements of the analysed mechanisms. It is also necessary to consider the limitations of the model, such as omission of different risk propensities between the government and the tax payer and avoidance of the adverse agent selection problem.","[Bubanic, Marijana; Lackovic, Ivana Dvorski; Kokotec, Ivana Djundjek] Univ Zagreb, Fac Org & Informat Varazdin, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Bubanic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Org & Informat Varazdin, Zagreb, Croatia.",mabubanic@foi.hr; idvorski@foi.hr; idjundjek@foi.hr,"Dvorski Lacković, Ivana/ACJ-3972-2022; Bubanic, Marijana/IAN-0613-2023","Dvorski Lacković, Ivana/0000-0003-4068-6273; Bubanic, Marijana/0000-0002-8882-1430",,,,,34,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,1,8,,,,,,8,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BP4BP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000550734100001,0

OBJECTIVES: To develop precise algorithms based on medication claims/prescriber visits (MCs/PVs) to identify psoriasis (PsO) patients and psoriatic patients with arthritic conditions (PsO-AC), a proxy for psoriatic arthritis, in Canadian databases lacking diagnosis codes. METHODS: Algorithms were developed using medications with narrow indication profiles in combination with prescriber specialty to define PsO and PsO-AC. For a 3-year study period from July 1, 2009, algorithms were validated using the PharMetrics Plus database, which contains both adjudicated medication claims and diagnosis codes. Positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity, and specificity of the developed algorithms were assessed using diagnosis code as the reference standard. Chosen algorithms were then applied to Canadian drug databases to profile the algorithm-identified PsO and PsO-AC cohorts. RESULTS: In the selected database, 183,328 patients were identified for validation. The highest PPVs for PsO (85%) and PsO-AC (65%) occurred when a predictive algorithm of two or more MCs/PVs was compared with the reference standard of one or more diagnosis codes. NPV and specificity were high (99%-100%), whereas sensitivity was low (=30%). Reducing the number of MCs/PVs or increasing diagnosis claims decreased the algorithms' PPVs. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed an MC/PV-based algorithm to identify PsO patients with a high degree of accuracy, but accuracy for PsO-AC requires further investigation. Such methods allow researchers to conduct retrospective studies in databases in which diagnosis codes are absent.

Although the prioritization of project roles in communication or project documentation in project management is key to the success of the project, a unique approach to quantify the soft structure of the project has not been introduced yet. Semantic networks can be used to manage projects to illustrate and quantify links between internal and external objects of the project environment - project goals, project outputs and project documents. The paper suggests a new approach to identifying and quantitating project roles in the project communication. The showed semantic model and its quantification can be used to construct a multi-criteria model for decision support in project management.

However, there is no advanced analysis how far these factors are influencing key investor decisions. Non-financial factors have a significant and irreplaceable role in the deepening of force against the competition. At present, these factors gain much more importance across all industrial sectors than they did in the past. Companies that develop their skills in non-financial areas are more attractive and competitive for investors than companies that do not sufficiently develop this area or are not willing to use this type of reporting. Perfect analysis of non-financial factors and their correct implementation can be appropriate step to the next successful phase of building company's financial future. The survey was conducted through a structured interview and questionnaires of 50 institutional investors, including portfolio managers, stock analysts and directors and 50 companies in Poland during the period of October 2016 - August 2017. Scientific aim of this article was therefore aimed at identifying non-financial factors and demonstrating their impact on the success of the IPO. The aim of the research was to provide information on the most common factors that influence investor decision-making. The research provided information on the most common factors that influence investor decision making when buying shares and determinate which criteria the investors give more weight. The first part of the article was determined by non-financial factors, which were selected by the investors themselves as the most important. The second part presented what kind of factors the investors give more weight in their decisions and why and is compared with the companies' opinions. The key non-financial factors determinate successful operation and will make flexible, efficient and effective management.

Reasons for this are quite clear: Interactions with customers, business partners, and competitors, in most cases, closely match models in game theory. This is further enhanced by the expansion of information technology and e-commerce. Here the customer and trader get into formal situations that can be modeled similarly to rational players of certain games. Game theory has recently begun to address increasingly large Czech and foreign online stores. Almost every e-shop has a large amount of well-sorted data about its customers, their behavior and price reflection on product sales in the form of past orders. Nevertheless, only a few of the possible uses have been explored, mainly in the field of intelligent product recommendation to individual customers, according to extensive statistics. But these options do not end here. The application of the game theory is also possible, in combination with statistical methods, to create complex strategic procedures to maximize profit. This can be achieved, whether by reordering products by customer groups, individual flash sales or targeted price manipulation. The aim of this article is to apply game theory and statistical methods (silhouette analysis, cluster analysis etc.) to the e-commerce sphere. This will create a theoretical basis to help with practical calculations.

In addition, the marginal distribution is also tested, and the result shows that normal distribution is the best fit for the marginal distribution for both financials and property & construction equations. Our results suggest that the exchange rate can exert significant impact on both sectors.

This suggests, alongside the dynamic factor decomposition of returns, a dynamic factor decomposition of volatilities or volatility proxies. Based on this observation, Barigozzi and Hallin (2016) proposed an entirely non-parametric and model-free two-step general dynamic factor approach which accounts for a joint factor structure of returns and volatilities, and allows for extracting the market volatility shocks. Here, we go one step further, and show how the same two-step approach naturally produces volatility forecasts for the various stocks under study. In an applied exercise, we consider the panel of asset returns of the constituents of the S&P100 index over the period 2000-2009. Numerical results show that the predictors based on our two-step method outperform existing univariate and multivariate GARCH methods, as well as static factor GARCH models, in the prediction of daily high-low range while avoiding the usual problems associated with the curse of dimensionality.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the development of the AFImpact, an AF-specific health-related quality-of-life patient-reported outcome measure. METHODS: Development and validation of the AFImpact comprised a qualitative stage, consisting of a literature review and concept elicitation interviews (91 patients with AF), item generation, and cognitive debriefing (30 patients with AF), and a quantitative stage, consisting of evaluation of the instrument's psychometric properties (313 patients with AF). Preliminary responsiveness to change was assessed in 118 patients undergoing cardioversion. RESULTS: On the basis of the literature review and concept elicitation interviews, 75 items were generated. Factor analyses guided a reduction to 18 items. Three domains were confirmed: vitality (7 items), emotional distress (8 items), and sleep (3 items). The 18-item AFImpact demonstrated high item convergent and discriminant validity. Cronbach a coefficients showed high internal consistency reliability. Test-retest reliability of individual items in stable patients (n = 33) was satisfactory, with intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from 0.61 to 0.86. All three AFImpact domain scores differentiated patients who reported different levels of overall health, thereby supporting known-groups validity. Scores for each item improved after cardioversion, with effect sizes ranging from -0.19 to -0.65. CONCLUSIONS: Psychometric evaluations support the reliability and validity of the AFImpact as a patient-reported outcome instrument to measure the impact of AF, with preliminary results in patients undergoing cardioversion supporting responsiveness to change.

Using a model with patients differing in severity within a DRG, we show that price dynamics depend on the extent of hospital altruism and the relation between patients' severity and benefit. Upwards and downwards price movements over time are both possible. In a steady state, DRG prices are unlikely to give optimal incentives to treat patients. Depending on the level of altruism, too few or too many patients are treated. DRG pricing may also give incentives to treat low-severity patients even though high-severity patients should be treated.

I use variation in the implementation of Title IX to measure the effects of increased athletic opportunities on the health of infants. Babies born to women with greater athletic opportunities as teenagers have babies that are healthier at birth.

Traditionally, healthcare reform is understood as an action undertaken by a government at a national or local level. However, bottom-up changes can also lead to improvements in the health system. This paper describes the efforts of a coordinated multi-stakeholder advocacy group in Spain to promote a more cost-effective and patient-centred treatment for people receiving renal replacement therapy and assesses the outcomes of their advocacy for health system financing and patient satisfaction. It concludes that bottom-up initiatives do indeed have the power to change health policy and that policy makers should pay attention to their arguments.","[Selgas, Rafael] Hosp Univ La Paz, Jefe Serv Nefrol, IdiPAZ, Dept Nephrol, P Castellana 261, Madrid 28046, Spain; [Rodriguez, Laura] GADDPE Secretariat, Madrid, Spain; [Julian, Juan Carlos] ALCER Spanish Renal Patient Fdn, Madrid, Spain; [Remon, Cesar] Hosp Univ Puerto Real, Dept Nephrol, Cadiz, Spain; [Prieto-Velasco, Mario] Complejo Asistencial Univ Leon, Dept Nephrol, Leon, Spain; [Perez-Contreras, Javier] Hosp Gen Univ Alicante, Alicante, Spain; [Perez Fontan, Miguel] Complejo Hosp Univ Coruna, La Coruna, Spain",Hospital Universitario La Paz; Universidad de Cadiz; Hospital Universitario Puerto Real; Universidad de Leon; General University Hospital of Alicante; Complejo Hospitalario Universitario A Coruna,"Selgas, R (通讯作者)，Hosp Univ La Paz, Jefe Serv Nefrol, IdiPAZ, Dept Nephrol, P Castellana 261, Madrid 28046, Spain.",Rafael.selgas@salud.madrid.org,"Remón-Rodríguez, César/AAC-3329-2020; Perez-Fontán, Miguel/ABG-4064-2020; rodriguez, laura/JTV-5149-2023","Remón-Rodríguez, César/0000-0001-8232-6060; Perez-Fontán, Miguel/0000-0001-7027-2296; Julian Mauro, Juan Carlos/0000-0002-4839-311X",Baxter; Genzyme,Baxter; Genzyme(Sanofi-AventisGenzyme Corporation),"The GADDPE initiative is led by ALCER, the Spanish Renal Patient Foundation, and is supported by grants from Baxter and Genzyme.

The impact of CDHPs on preventive care is unclear. On the one hand CDHPs might increase use of preventive care as such care is exempt from the deductible. However, CDHPs also decrease visits to physicians which might results in less screening. Prior research has found conflicting results. In this study, using data from 37 employers we examine the effects of CDHPs on the use of cancer screenings up to three years after the initial CDHP offering with ITT and LATE approaches. Being offered a CDHP or enrolling in a CDHP had little or no effect on cancer screening rates but individuals increase screenings prior to enrolling in a CDHP. Our findings suggest the importance of examining CDHP effects on periodic care over the longer -term and carefully controlling for anticipatory stockpiling. (C)2017 Elsevier B.V.

In such a situation, an external criterion in the form of a CE threshold that reflects the willingness to pay (WTP) per quality-adjusted life-year is necessary. Objectives: To determine a CE threshold for health care interventions in Malaysia. Methods: A cross-sectional, contingent valuation study was conducted using a stratified multistage cluster random sampling technique in four states in Malaysia. One thousand thirteen respondents were interviewed in person for their socioeconomic background, quality of life, and WTP for a hypothetical scenario. Results: The CE thresholds established using the nonparametric Turn-bull method ranged from MYR12,810 to MYR22,840 (similar to US $4,000-US $7,000), whereas those estimated with the parametric interval regression model were between MYR19,929 and MYR28,470 (similar to US $6,200-US $8,900). Key factors that affected the CE thresholds were education level, estimated monthly household income, and the description of health state scenarios.

Methods: A cost-effectiveness model was developed to analyze the costs and consequences of treatment with pembrolizumab compared to treatment with ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma not previously treated with ipilimumab. The model was parameterized by using data from a head to-head phase III randomized clinical trial, KEYNOTE-006. Extrapolation of long-term outcomes was based on approaches previously applied, combining ipilimumab data and melanoma patients' registry data. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the Portuguese National Health Service, and a lifetime horizon (40 years) was used. Portugal-specific disease management costs were estimated by convening a panel of six clinical experts to derive health state resource use and multiplying the results by national unit costs. To test for the robustness of the conclusions, we conducted deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: Pembrolizumab increases life expectancy in 1.57 undiscounted life-years (LYs) and is associated with an increase in costs versus that of ipilimumab. The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is 47,221 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and 42,956 per LY. Deterministic sensitivity analysis showed that the results were robust to the change of most input values or assumptions and were sensitive to time on treatment scenarios. According to the probabilistic sensitivity analysis performed, pembrolizumab is associated with a cost per QALY gained inferior to 50,000 in 75% of the cases. Conclusions: Considering the usually accepted thresholds in oncology, pembrolizumab is a cost-effective alternative for treating patients with advanced melanoma in Portugal.","[Miguel, Luis Silva; Pinheiro, Bernardete] Univ Lisbon, ISEG, Res Ctr Portuguese Econ, CISEP, Lisbon, Portugal; [Lopes, Francisca Vargas; Laires, Pedro Almeida] MSD, Paco De Arcos, Portugal; [Wang, Jingshu; Xu, Ruifeng; Pellissier, James] Merck & Co Inc, Kenilworth, NJ USA",Universidade de Lisboa; Merck & Company,"Miguel, LS (通讯作者)，ULisboa, Res Ctr Portuguese Econ, ISEG, CISEP, Lisbon, Portugal.",luis.silvamiguel@medicina.ulisboa.pt,"Laires, Pedro A/AAA-7663-2021; Miguel, Luís Silva/T-7970-2018; xu, rui/GRX-5734-2022","Miguel, Luís Silva/0000-0003-4363-7389; Vargas Lopes, Francisca/0000-0001-8198-1522","Merck Sharp, Dohme (MSD); MSD","Merck Sharp, Dohme (MSD)(Merck & Company); MSD","Research for this article was supported by a grant from Merck Sharp, & Dohme (MSD).

Methods: The primary endpoint was the share of patients with T2D with adequate A1C control (A1C <= 9%). We conducted a simulation of how increased A1C monitoring and treatment intensification affected this end point using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and clinical trials. Using the estimated changes in measured A(1c) levels, we calculated corresponding changes in the plan-level A(1c) quality measure, overall star rating, and reimbursement. Results: At baseline, 24.4% of patients with T2D in the average plan had poor A1C control. The share of plans receiving the highest A1C rating increased from 27% at baseline to 49.5% (increased monitoring), 36.2% (intensification), and 57.1% (joint implementation of both interventions). However, overall star ratings increased for only 3.6%, 1.3%, and 4.8% of plans, respectively, by intervention. Projected per-member per-year rebate increases under the MA Star program were $7.71 (monitoring), $2.66 (intensification), and $10.55 (joint implementation). Conclusions: The simulation showed that increased monitoring and treatment intensification would improve A1C levels; however, the resulting average increases in reimbursement would be small.","[Sussell, Jesse; Bognar, Kata; Schwartz, Taylor T.; Shafrin, Jason] Precis Hlth Econ, 555 12th St Suite1650, Oakland, CA 94607 USA; [Sheehan, John J.] AstraZeneca Pharmaceut LP, Wilmington, DE USA; [Sheehan, John J.] Janssen Sci Affairs LLC, Titusville, NJ USA; [Aubry, Wade] Univ Calif San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Scanlon, Dennis] Penn State Univ, State Coll, PA USA",AstraZeneca; Johnson & Johnson; Janssen Pharmaceuticals; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University,"Sussell, J (通讯作者)，Precis Hlth Econ, 555 12th St Suite1650, Oakland, CA 94607 USA.",jesse.sussell@precisionhealtheconomics.com,"Shafrin, Jason/AAI-7041-2020","Shafrin, Jason/0000-0001-8444-5979; Bognar, Katalin/0000-0001-8357-8569",,,,,29,3,4,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP,2017,20.0,8.0,,,,,1216,1220,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.03.016,0.0,,,5,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,FI3CO,28964455.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000411834200026,0

The health technology assessment (HTA) investigated surveillance options for women aged less than 50 years who were at elevated risk of breast cancer. Surveillance strategies using digital mammography, magnetic resonance imaging, or a combination of the two modalities were modeled on the basis of diagnostic test accuracy. The HTA faced a number of issues, including the use of diagnostic test accuracy as a surrogate for long-term outcomes; modeling interventions that were not considered acceptable to clinicians; and extrapolating for screening intervals and age ranges not directly supported by available evidence. The evaluation of screening programs gives rise to challenges in terms of balancing an adequate exploration of the possible options while also being cognizant of what is appropriately supported by evidence.

We propose a simple and easy-to-implement modification to the trinity of test statistics in the two-step efficient GMM setting and show that the modified test statistics are all asymptotically F distributed under the so-called fixed smoothing asymptotics. The modification is multiplicative and involves the J statistic for testing over identifying restrictions. This leads to convenient asymptotic F tests whose critical values, i.e., the standard F critical values, are readily available from standard statistical tables and programming environments. For testing a single restriction with a one-sided alternative, an asymptotic t test theory using the standard t distribution as the reference distribution is also developed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: A discrete time Markov model simulated HCV progression and treatment over 20 years. Population cohorts were defined by behaviors that influence the risk of HCV exposure: PWID, MSM-HIV, an overlap cohort of individuals who are both PWID and MSM-HIV, and all other adults. Six different treatment scenarios were modeled, with varying degrees of access to treatment at different fibrosis stages and to different risk cohorts. Benefits were measured as quality-adjusted life years and a $150,000/quality-adjusted life-year valuation was used to assess social benefits. Results: Compared with limiting treatment to METAVIR fibrosis stages F3 or F4 and excluding PWID, expanding treatment to patients in all fibrosis stages and including PWID reduces cumulative new infections by 55% over a 20-year horizon and reduces the prevalence of HCV by 93%. We find that treating all HCV-infected individuals is cost saving and net social benefits are over $500 billion greater compared with limiting treatment. Including PWID in treatment access saves 12,900 to 41,200 lives. Conclusions: Increased access to treatment brings substantial value to society and over the long-term reduces costs for payers, as the benefits accrued from long-term reduction in prevalent and incident cases, mortality, and medical costs outweigh the cost of treatment.","[Moreno, Gigi A.; Espinosa, Oliver Diaz; Vania, Diana K.] Precis Hlth Econ, 11100 Santa Monica Blvd,Suite 500, Los Angeles, CA 90025 USA; [Wang, Alice; Gonzalez, Yuri Sanchez] AbbVie Inc, Mettawa, IL USA; [Edlin, Brian R.] Cornell Univ, Weill Cornell Med Coll, New York, NY USA; [Brookmeyer, Ronald] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Fielding Sch Publ Hlth, Los Angeles, CA USA",AbbVie; Cornell University; Weill Cornell Medicine; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Espinosa, OD (通讯作者)，Precis Hlth Econ, 11100 Santa Monica Blvd,Suite 500, Los Angeles, CA 90025 USA.",oliver.diaz@precisionhealtheconomics.com,"Moreno, Gigi/T-7097-2019; Edlin, Brian R/F-2966-2018","Moreno, Gigi/0000-0002-3898-9219; Edlin, Brian R/0000-0001-8172-8797; Nagarwalla, Diana/0000-0001-8716-5446",AbbVie,AbbVie(AbbVie),"The design, analysis, and financial support of this study were provided by AbbVie.

On the one hand, multimorbid individuals consume a disproportionally large share of healthcare resources. On the other hand, the patient specific number and combination of co-occurring single diseases result in inhomogeneous data leading to biased estimates when using traditional regression techniques. Therefore, we applied a mixture of regressions in order to control for unobserved heterogeneity focussing on the identification of multimorbidity patterns. We used a subsample of N=1050 patients from a multicentre prospective cohort study of randomly selected multimorbid primary care patients aged 65 to 85years in Germany (ISRCTN 89818205) who completed a detailed questionnaire on healthcare utilization during the 6-month period preceding the interview. Disease combinations of 1047 were included. We detected four different groups of patients with regard to total costs. These groups corresponded largely to findings from the epidemiological literature. The effect of the presence of an additional disease on costs differed between groups. Moreover, two diametrically opposed cost trends were detected with respect to the number of co-occurring diseases. While in one group costs increased with the number of co-occurring diseases, in a second group cost tended to decrease.

J,"Pilny, A",,,,"Pilny, Adam",,,Explaining Differentials in Subsidy Levels Among Hospital Ownership Types in Germany,HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,hospitals; subsidies; ownership; Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition,DETAILED WAGE DECOMPOSITIONS; IDENTIFICATION PROBLEM; DISCRIMINATION; GAP; INTERINDUSTRY,"German hospitals receive subsidies for investment costs by federal states. Theoretically, these subsidies have to cover the whole investment volume, but in fact, only 50-60% are covered. Balance sheet data show that public hospitals exhibit higher levels of subsidies compared with for-profit hospitals. In this study, I examine the sources of this disparity by decomposing the differential in a so-called facilitation ratio, that is, the ratio of subsidies to tangible fixed assets, revealing to which extent assets are funded by subsidies. The question of interest is whether the differential can be attributed to observable hospital-specific and federal state-specific characteristics or to unobservable factors.

In this paper, we introduce a time-varying factor model where factor loadings are allowed to change smoothly over time. We propose a local version of the principal component method to estimate the latent factors and time-varying factor loadings simultaneously. We establish the limiting distributions and uniform convergence of the estimated factors and factor loadings in the standard large N and large T framework. We also propose a BIC-type information criterion to determine the number of factors, which can be used in models with either time varying or time-invariant factor models. Based on the comparison between the estimates of the common components under the null hypothesis of no structural changes and those under the alternative, we propose a consistent test for structural changes in factor loadings. We establish the null distribution, the asymptotic local power property, and the consistency of our test. Simulations are conducted to evaluate both our nonparametric estimates and test statistic. We also apply our test to investigate Stock and Watson's (2009) U.S. macroeconomic data set and find strong evidence of structural changes in the factor loadings. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

To identify causal treatment effects, we exploit over-time variation in the use of active labor market programs in 98 job centers and time-to-event. We find that ordinary education and subsidized job training have significant positive employment effects. Subsidized job training has a large, positive effect on the transition into employment but no effect on the subsequent employment duration. In contrast, ordinary education has a positive effect on employment duration but no effect on the transition into employment. The latter effect is the result of two opposing effects, a large positive effect of having completed education and a large negative lock-in effect, with low re-employment chances during program participation.(C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.","[Holm, Anders] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Sociol, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada; [Holm, Anders] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Econ, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada; [Hogelund, Jan; Houlberg, Helle Sofie Boje] Danish Working Environm Author, Landskronagade 33, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark; [Gortz, Mette] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, Oster Farimagsgade 5, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Rasmussen, Kristin Storck] Marselisborg Dev, Competence, Knowledge, Robert jacobsens Vej 76A, DK-2300 Copenhagen, Denmark",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario); University of Copenhagen,"Holm, A (通讯作者)，Univ Western Ontario, Dept Sociol, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada.",aholm@uwo.ca,"Holm, Anders/JBS-7378-2023","Gortz, Mette/0000-0002-9346-0625",Danish Council for Independent Research I Social Sciences [11-104448]; TrygFonden Foundation of Denmark,Danish Council for Independent Research I Social Sciences; TrygFonden Foundation of Denmark,"We thank two anonymous reviewers, the editor of Journal of Health Economics, Gauthier Lanot, Simen Markussen, Kenneth Lykke Sorensen, participants at the 2015 third joint workshop in health economics in Copenhagen, participants at the Danish Agency for Labour Market and Recruitment's seminar on effect measurement in Copenhagen (November 2015), and participants at the 2015 annual workshop of the Centre for Research in Active Labour Market Policy Effects (CAFE) for helpful comments.

The results will be applied to the future repricing of drugs and medical devices. On the basis of a request from the Central Social Insurance Medical Council (Chuikyo), our research team drafted the official methodological guideline for trial implementation. Here, we report the process of developing and the contents of the official guideline for cost-effectiveness evaluation. Methods: The guideline reflects discussions at the Chuikyo subcommittee (e.g., the role of quality-adjusted life-year) and incorporates our academic perspective. Team members generated research questions for each section of the guideline and discussions on these questions were carried out. A draft guideline was prepared and submitted to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW), and then to the subcommittee. The draft guideline was revised on the basis of the discussions at the subcommitte, if appropriate. Results: Although the public health care payer's perspective is standard in this guideline, other perspectives can be applied as necessary depending on the objective of analysis. On the basis of the discussions at the subcommittee, quality-adjusted life-year will be used as the basic outcome. A discount rate of 2% per annum for costs and outcomes is recommended. The final guideline was officially approved by the Chuikyo general assembly in February 2016. Conclusions: This is the first officially approved guideline for the economic evaluation of drugs and medical devices in Japan. The guideline is expected to improve the quality and comparability of submitted cost-effectiveness data for decision making.","[Shiroiwa, Takeru; Fukuda, Takashi] Natl Inst Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth & Welf Serv, 2-3-6 Minami, Wako, Saitama 3510197, Japan; [Ikeda, Shunya] Int Univ Hlth & Welf, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Ohtawara, Tochigi, Japan; [Takura, Tomoyuki] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Med, Suita, Osaka, Japan; [Moriwaki, Kensuke] Kobe Pharmaceut Univ, Dept Med Stat, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan",National Institute of Public Health - Japan; International University of Health & Welfare; Osaka University; Kobe Pharmaceutical University,"Shiroiwa, T (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth & Welf Serv, 2-3-6 Minami, Wako, Saitama 3510197, Japan.",t.shiroiwa@gmail.com,"Takura, Tomoyuki/AAO-8767-2021; Takeru, Shiroiwa/O-7926-2019","Takura, Tomoyuki/0000-0002-5987-9254; Shiroiwa, Takeru/0000-0003-3055-9932",Health Labour Sciences Research grant [H27-Seisaku-Shitei-010],"Health Labour Sciences Research grant(Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan)",This study was supported by a Health Labour Sciences Research grant (H27-Seisaku-Shitei-010).,,53,101,102,2,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR,2017,20.0,3.0,,,,,372,378,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.08.726,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,EO1HZ,28292481.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000396450600007,0

In our approach, the latent factor is allowed to be correlated with the innovation to the observed time series. If the latent factor becomes exogenous, our approach reduces to the conventional Markov switching. We develop a modified Markov switching filter to estimate the mean and volatility models with Markov switching that are frequently analyzed, and find that the presence of endogeneity in regime switching is indeed strong and ubiquitous.

The conventional approach employs the time series that is currently available for these aggregates for estimation, implying that the last observations are still subject to many rounds of revisions. This paper proposes a release-based approach that uses revised data of all observations to estimate DSGE models, but the model is still helpful for real-time forecasting. This new approach accounts for data uncertainty when predicting future values of macroeconomic variables subject to revisions, thus providing policy-makers and professional forecasters with both backcasts and forecasts. Application of this new approach to a medium-sized DSGE model improves the accuracy of density forecasts, particularly the coverage of predictive intervals, of US real macro variables. The application also shows that the estimated relative importance of business cycle sources varies with data maturity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This model focused on the high-risk HPV infection through human sexual behavior. Literature studies, observation, and depth interview with the experts of oncology were implemented. The agent-based simulation (ABS) illustrates the social and sexual interactions in which the HPV may spread easily. It also allows the interaction that occurred if government interventions were implemented and shows how much these actions affect the number of HPV infections. The results gave significant findings on the importance of the government intervention to prioritize on promotion and socialization program on sexual health practice in Indonesia, before implementing both the HPV vaccination (as a national program), and the improvement of the medical treatment on HPV+ patients.","[Hermawan, Pri; Komar, Yuliati; Putro, Utomo Sarjono] Inst Teknol Bandung, Sch Business & Management, Bandung, Indonesia; [Gondowiardjo, Soehartati] Dr Cipto Mangunkusumo Hosp, Radiotherapy Dept, Jakarta, Indonesia",Institute Technology of Bandung; University of Indonesia,"Hermawan, P (通讯作者)，Inst Teknol Bandung, Sch Business & Management, Bandung, Indonesia.",prihermawan@sbm-itb.ac.id; yuliati.komar@sbm-itb.ac.id; utomo@sbm-itb.ac.id; gondhow@gmail.com,"Putro, Utomo Sarjono/AAE-4968-2021; Hermawan, Pri/P-5259-2015; Gondhowiardjo, Soehartati/AEG-7309-2022","Gondhowiardjo, Soehartati/0000-0002-9446-4361",,,,,24,0,0,1,8,SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",1861-0803,,978-981-10-3662-0; 978-981-10-3661-3,SPRINGER SER AGENT B,,,2017,15.0,,,,,,27,43,,10.1007/978-981-10-3662-0_3,0.0,,,17,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BM0AJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000458551000003,0

On one hand, the government generates a policy to decrease waste to be sent to final disposal; on the other hand, the community will accept that, and without community involvement, sometimes the policy will not run well. Household waste management system policies focus on delivering value of composting and recycling in community. One of the policies is waste bank which lets the community turn their waste into money in the form of savings like in a bank. Efforts from different household waste supply chain parties such as government and communities must be coordinated. This research aims to find the exact coordination between government and communities in order to adopt household waste policies especially waste bank. This research considers possibilities to produce policies by determining community needs previously (bottom-up technologies). Agent-based modeling presents three kinds of community: the careless community (not willing to adopt waste management technologies/policies even it is profitable for them), arguing community (not willing to adopt waste management technologies/policies when it is not profitable for them), and adapting community (willing to adopt waste management technologies/policies whether it is profitable or not for them). The simulation shows that the number of adapting communities is increasing; meanwhile the number of arguing communities is decreasing. However, the number of careless communities is increasing in the first half of simulation and starts decreasing in the second half of simulation. According to this result, communities socially interact with and influence each other because in the first half, the number of arguing communities was larger than that of adapting communities, which affects the increasing number of careless communities, and then in the second half, the number of adapting communities was larger than that of arguing communities, which influence the decreasing number of careless communities. It also shows that the role of government to maintain policies profitable for community is important.","[Pambudi, Noorhan Firdaus; Adhiutama, Akbar] Inst Teknol Bandung, Sch Business & Management, Bandung, Indonesia",Institute Technology of Bandung,"Pambudi, NF; Adhiutama, A (通讯作者)，Inst Teknol Bandung, Sch Business & Management, Bandung, Indonesia.",noorhan.firdaus@sbm-itb.ac.id; akbar@sbm-itb.ac.id,"Adhiutama, Akbar/H-7777-2014",,,,,,15,0,0,1,10,SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",1861-0803,,978-981-10-3662-0; 978-981-10-3661-3,SPRINGER SER AGENT B,,,2017,15.0,,,,,,199,214,,10.1007/978-981-10-3662-0_16,0.0,,,16,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BM0AJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000458551000016,0

This relation also affects how NGO behave to the government; it is different in each NGO based on its point of view and orientation. Such relation indicates the lack of political will and capacity of the governmental bodies. Furthermore, this relation can also be explained in terms of child labor issue which is still considered as private rather than public issue. Furthermore, the study reveals that to have a bearing on the child labor itself, intervention does not only goes for the child, it must also shift child labor issue from private to public issue; a focus on society circle above the child is an important perspective to effective policy.","[Sabrina, Amelia Ayang; Budi, Kusnar] Univ Indonesia, Dept Adm Sci, Depok, Indonesia",University of Indonesia,"Sabrina, AA (通讯作者)，Univ Indonesia, Dept Adm Sci, Depok, Indonesia.",ayangamelia@gmail.com; budikusnar@yahoo.co.id,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-427-9,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2017,167.0,,,,,,111,116,,,,,,6,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Political Science; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration; Government & Law,BJ6IT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426719600017,0

The national program built on preexisting local programs in some, but not all, departements. Using data from multiple waves of a nationally representative biennial survey of the French population, we estimate the effect of organized screening on the percentage of women obtaining a mammogram. The analysis uses difference-in-differences methods to exploit the fact that the program was targeted at women in a specific age group: 50 to 74 years old. We find that organized screening significantly raised mammography rates among women in the target age range. Just above the lower age threshold, the percentage of women reporting that they had a mammogram in the past 2 years increased by over 10 percentage points after the national program went into effect. Mammography rates increased even more among women in their 60s. Estimated effects are particularly large for women with less education and lower incomes, suggesting that France's organized screening program has reduced socioeconomic disparities in access to mammography.","[Buchmueller, Thomas C.] Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Buchmueller, Thomas C.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Goldzahl, Leontine] Univ Manchester, Sch Hlth Sci, Manchester Ctr Hlth Econ, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Goldzahl, Leontine] EDHEC Business Sch, Roubaix, France",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Manchester; Universite Catholique de Lille; EDHEC Business School,"Buchmueller, TC (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",tbuch@umich.edu,,"Buchmueller, Thomas/0000-0002-3068-7419; Goldzahl, Leontine/0000-0001-6070-3347",chair Sante at the Fondation du risque; [ANR 11-LABX-0019],chair Sante at the Fondation du risque;,"Goldzahl's work on this paper was supported by a post-doctoral grant co-financed by the chair Sante at the Fondation du risque and the project ANR 11-LABX-0019.

We test the theory utilizing a unique experiment of China introducing the new cooperative medical scheme, unique in its long-term credibility necessary for our proposed channel. This scheme reduced cigarette use by around 9%.

However, little is known about delays within the mental health service system and its impact on patients. We explore the impact of waiting times on patient outcomes in the context of early intervention in psychosis (EIP) services in England from April 2012 to March 2015. We use the Mental Health Services Data Set and the routine outcome measure the Health of the Nation Outcome Scale. In a generalised linear regression model, we control for baseline outcomes, previous service use, and treatment intensity to account for possible endogeneity in waiting time. We find that longer waiting time is significantly associated with a deterioration in patient outcomes 12months after acceptance for treatment for patients that are still in EIP care. Effects are strongest for waiting times longer than 3months, and effect sizes are small to moderate. Patients with shorter treatment periods are not affected. The results suggest that policies should aim to reduce excessively long waits in order to improve outcomes for patients waiting for treatment for psychosis.","[Reichert, Anika; Jacobs, Rowena] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, Alcuin Coll Block A, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Reichert, A (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, Alcuin Coll Block A, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",ar1314@york.ac.uk,,"Jacobs, Rowena/0000-0001-5225-6321","Centre for Health Economics, University of York","Centre for Health Economics, University of York","Anika Reichert conducted this research as part of her PhD study that is funded by a scholarship from the Centre for Health Economics, University of York.",,64,69,75,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,NOV,2018,27.0,11.0,,,,,1772,1787,,10.1002/hec.3800,0.0,,,16,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GV7QD,30014544.0,"Green Published, hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000446323300009,0

A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed to identify all published literature on the impact of patent expiration on drug prices. Additional literature was identified using a less distinct syntax in Google Scholar and EconLit. Data extraction followed a standardized assessment form containing the domains study type, study aim, reported outcomes, number of drugs and drug classes assessed, and originators or generics assessed. The 16 identified studies that assessed impact of patent expiry on drug prices showed that price developments after patent expiration varied between countries. The included studies assessed price developments for the USA, Canada, Australia, the UK, the Netherlands, Germany and France, Spain, Italy, Norway, Sweden and Denmark. The number of drugs included within different studies ranged between 1 and 219. The identified studies indicated that drug prices decreased significantly after patent expiry with drug price ratios ranging from 6.6 to 66% 1-5 years after patent expiry. Drug prices decrease significantly after patent expiry. The extent of this price reduction varied greatly between products and countries. For this reason, country-specific analyses on price developments after patent expiry should be used when these are considered in decision making. Future research should be dedicated to gathering more country-specific data to reduce the uncertainty with regard to price developments.","[Vondeling, Gerard T.; Cao, Qi; Postma, Maarten J.; Rozenbaum, Mark H.] Univ Groningen, POB 72, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Vondeling, GT (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, POB 72, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands.",gertvondeling@msn.com; q.cao@rug.nl; m.j.postma@rug.nl; mark.rozenbaum@pfizer.com,,"Postma, Maarten/0000-0002-6306-3653",,,,,24,34,39,0,24,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

The considered general setup encompasses the benchmark cases of Cobb-Douglas, CES and Leontief (minimum) functions. It is shown that the technology menu and the global function (envelope of local functions) are dual objects, in a well-defined generalized sense of duality. In the optimum, partial elasticities of (i) the local function, (ii) the technology menu and (iii) the global function are all equal and there exists a clear-cut, economically interpretable relationship between their curvatures. In particular, the elasticity of substitution of the global function is always above that of the local function. The paper also invokes Bergson's theorem to comment on the consequences of assuming homogeneity or homotheticity, with a particular focus on technology menus constructed as level curves of idea (unit factor productivity) distributions.

The Vickrey auction is DSIC and efficient, but raises surplus revenue. In an environment where players have constant marginal values, we introduce a subsidized Vickrey auction (SVA) that uses surplus revenue to offset some of the production costs. By compromising efficiency, our SVA improves the players' payoffs over the Vickrey auction. We show that the SVA is DSIC, budget balanced, and value effective (awarding quantity only to the player who values it most), and it Pareto dominates any other mechanism with these three properties. We demonstrate that there is no welfare ranking between the SVA and the non-value effective serial cost-sharing mechanism.

Inverse probability weighted regression models have been developed to address the challenge of cost censoring in order to identify intent-to-treat effects (i.e., to compare mean costs between groups on the basis of their initial treatment assignment, irrespective of any subsequent changes to their treatment status). In this paper, we describe a nested g-computation procedure that can be used to compare mean costs between two or more time-varying treatment regimes. We highlight the relative advantages and limitations of this approach when compared with existing regression-based models. We illustrate the utility of this approach as a means to inform public policy by applying it to a simulated data example motivated by costs associated with cancer treatments. Simulations confirm that inference regarding intent-to-treat effects versus the joint causal effects estimated by the nested g-formula can lead to markedly different conclusions regarding differential costs. Therefore, it is essential to prespecify the desired target of inference when choosing between these two frameworks. The nested g-formula should be considered as a useful, complementary tool to existing methods when analyzing cost outcomes.","[Spieker, Andrew; Roy, Jason; Mitra, Nandita] Univ Penn, Dept Biostat Epidemiol & Informat, 423 Guardian Dr,1313 Blockley Hall, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Spieker, A (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Dept Biostat Epidemiol & Informat, 423 Guardian Dr,1313 Blockley Hall, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",aspieker@pennmedicine.upenn.edu,,"Spieker, Andrew/0000-0002-0548-8311",NIH [R01 GM 112327],NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),"NIH, Grant/Award Number: R01 GM 112327.",,11,5,6,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,JUL,2018,27.0,7.0,,,,,1063,1073,,10.1002/hec.3651,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GI2SF,29663579.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000434221500002,0

Methods Using information from the Swiss household panel from the year 1999 to 2003 (n = 18,030), a linear regression is implemented to compare the health status of family members cohabiting with individuals dealing with a long-term disability with the health status of individuals of similar characteristics in the general population. Additionally, a non-parametric graphical analysis estimates the smooth patterns of the results over time. Results Family members who cohabit with a person dealing with a long-term disability have a consistently reduced health status. The size of the impact depends on the sex and the role in the family. In general, women show the most negative effects. For children, the impact depends on the relationship with the disabled person. Conclusion Recognizing the presence of health spillovers can help to design policies to better support families. Being the perceived health status a good indicator of the use of health services and mortality, the health system should focus on the entire family, and not only on the patient or the main caregiver.","[Barzallo, Diana Pacheco] Swiss Parapleg Res, Hlth Serv Stat & Econ Unit, Nottwil, Switzerland",Swiss Paraplegic Research,"Barzallo, DP (通讯作者)，Swiss Parapleg Res, Hlth Serv Stat & Econ Unit, Nottwil, Switzerland.",diana.pachecobarzallo@paraplegie.ch,,"Pacheco Barzallo, Diana/0000-0002-8816-4071",Swiss National Science Foundation,Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"This study has been realized using the data collected by the Swiss Household Panel (SHP), which is based at the Swiss Centre of Expertise in the Social Sciences FORS.

We employ double asymptotics under which both the cross-sectional sample size and the length of time series tend to infinity and utilize the sieve AR approximation with its lag order increasing with the sample size. We establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the fixed effects estimator and propose a bias-corrected fixed effects estimator based on a theoretical asymptotic bias term. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the usefulness of bias correction. As an illustration, the proposed methods are applied to dynamic panel estimation of the law of one price deviations among US cities. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The U.S. federal and state governments have hiring preferences to benefit veterans, especially disabled veterans. Other factors may also push veterans toward public sector employment. I found that veteran status substantially increased the likelihood of federal employment, with the largest magnitudes for severely disabled veterans.

Connecting Q with survey methods to measure societal support for views on the value of life-extending treatments,HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,end of life; Q survey; resource allocation; societal views,,"Preference elicitation studies reporting societal views on the relative value of end-of-life treatments have produced equivocal results. This paper presents an alternative method, combining Q methodology and survey techniques (Q2S) to determine the distribution of 3 viewpoints on the relative value of end-of-life treatments identified in a previous, published, phase of this work. These were Viewpoint 1, A population perspective: value for money, no special cases; Viewpoint 2, Life is precious: valuing life-extension and patient choice; and Viewpoint 3, Valuing wider benefits and opportunity cost: the quality of life and death. A Q2S survey of 4,902 respondents across the United Kingdom measured agreement with these viewpoints; 37% most agreed with Viewpoint 1, 49% with Viewpoint 2, and 9% with Viewpoint 3. Regression analysis showed associations of viewpoints with gender, level of education, religion, voting preferences, and satisfaction with the NHS. The Q2S approach provides a promising means to investigate how in-depth views and opinions are represented in the wider population. As demonstrated in this study, there is often more than 1 viewpoint on a topic and methods that seek to estimate that averages may not provide the best guidance for societal decision-making.","[Mason, Helen; Collins, Marissa; McHugh, Neil; Godwin, Jon; Donaldson, Cam; Baker, Rachel] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Yunus Ctr Social Business & Hlth, Cowcaddens Rd, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland; [Van Exel, Job] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Hlth Policy & Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Van Exel, Job] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Glasgow Caledonian University; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Mason, H (通讯作者)，Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Yunus Ctr Social Business & Hlth, Cowcaddens Rd, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland.",helen.mason@gcu.ac.uk,"van Exel, Job/E-6191-2013; Baker, Rachel M/B-8469-2013; McHugh, Neil/JEO-5752-2023","van Exel, Job/0000-0002-4178-1777; Baker, Rachel M/0000-0002-3451-2018; McHugh, Neil/0000-0002-2567-1527; Mason, Helen/0000-0002-9303-2794; Donaldson, Cam/0000-0003-4670-5340; Collins, Marissa/0000-0002-0896-6673",Medical Research Council (MRC) Methodology Panel [G1002324]; Medical Research Council [G1002324] Funding Source: researchfish; MRC [G1002324] Funding Source: UKRI,Medical Research Council (MRC) Methodology Panel; Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"Medical Research Council (MRC) Methodology Panel, Grant/Award Number: G1002324",,15,7,8,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,MAY,2018,27.0,5.0,,,,,819,831,,10.1002/hec.3640,0.0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GB3YG,29349842.0,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428996100003,0

Birth weight thresholds in hospital reimbursement systems,JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Neonatal care; DRG upcoding; Quantity and quality of care,MARGINAL RETURNS; PRICE CHANGES; MEDICAL-CARE; HEALTH; RESPOND,"Birth weight manipulation has been documented in per-case hospital reimbursement systems, in which hospitals receive more money for otherwise equal newborns with birth weight just below compared to just above specific birth weight thresholds. As hospitals receive more money for cases with weight below the thresholds, having a (reported) weight below a threshold could benefit the newborn. Also, these reimbursement thresholds overlap with diagnostic thresholds that have been shown to affect the quantity and quality of care that newborns receive. Based on the universe of hospital births in Germany from the years 2005-2011, we investigate whether weight below reimbursement relevant thresholds triggers different quantity and quality of care. We find that this is not the case, suggesting that hospitals' financial incentives with respect to birth weight do not directly impact the care that newborns receive. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

When these data exist, analyses tend to focus on rural environments. In this paper, we study the effects that health facility access and quality have on contraceptive use and desired number of children for women in urban Senegal. Unlike related studies focusing on rural environments, we find no evidence that greater access to health facilities and pharmacies increases contraceptive use among urban women. However, we do find that contraceptive use among urban women is higher with greater facility quality. For example, we find that increasing the proportion of pharmacies employing multiple pharmacists from 0% to 50% would increase contraceptive use by 6.0 percentage points, and increasing the proportion of facilities with family planning guidelines/protocols from 50% to 100% would increase use by 2.1 percentage points.","[Cronin, Christopher J.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Econ, 916 Flanner Hall, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Guilkey, David K.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Econ, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Guilkey, David K.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Carolina Populat Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Speizer, Ilene S.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Gillings Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Maternal & Child Hlth, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Speizer, Ilene S.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Carolina Populat Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC USA",University of Notre Dame; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine,"Cronin, CJ (通讯作者)，Univ Notre Dame, Dept Econ, 916 Flanner Hall, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",ccronin1@nd.edu,,"Cronin, Christopher/0000-0002-6348-4175",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [52037]; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [5 R24 HD050924],Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); National Institute of Child Health and Human Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),"Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 52037; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Grant/Award Number: 5 R24 HD050924",,38,14,14,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,MAR,2018,27.0,3.0,,,,,576,591,,10.1002/hec.3615,0.0,,,16,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA4TF,29094775.0,"Green Accepted, Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428324700015,0

This study aims to estimate the causal impact of detrimental working conditions on the self-declaration of chronic diseases in France. Using a rebuilt retrospective lifelong panel and defining indicators for physical and psychosocial strains, I implement a mixed econometric strategy that relies on difference-in-differences and matching methods to take into account for selection biases as well as unobserved heterogeneity. For men and women, I find deleterious effects of both types of working conditions on the declaration of chronic diseases after exposure, with varying patterns of impacts according to the nature and magnitude of the strains. These results provide insights into the debate on legal retirement age postponement and justify not only policies being enacted early in individuals' careers in order to prevent subsequent midcareer health repercussions, but also schemes that are more focused on psychosocial risk factors.","[Defebvre, Eric] Paris Est Creteil Univ, Erudite, 61 Ave Gen Gaulle, F-94010 Creteil, France; [Defebvre, Eric] CNRS, Tepp FR 3435, Paris, France",Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Defebvre, É (通讯作者)，Paris Est Creteil Univ, Erudite, 61 Ave Gen Gaulle, F-94010 Creteil, France.",eric.defebvre@univ-paris-est.fr,,,,,,,40,5,5,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,MAR,2018,27.0,3.0,,,,,E59,E76,,10.1002/hec.3619,0.0,,,18,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA4TF,29152815.0,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428324700004,0

Accordingly, the main aim was to explore the marginal effectiveness of care when measured in terms of people's overall care-related quality of life (CRQoL) and assess changes in marginal effect for increasing intensity. The associated aim was to refine and apply an observational method to estimate marginal effectiveness. A production function approach was used with survey data, including Adult Social Care Outcomes Toolkit-measured CRQoL, whereby we statistically modelled the expected relationship between service utilisation rates and CRQoL. This method seeks to limit endogeneity issues by controlling on observables and using instrumental variable. Using a survey of publicly funded long-term care service users in England, we found that community-based long-term care significantly improved people's CRQoL but with diminishing marginal effects and effects differentiated by baseline impairment levels. There are implications for how the care system should respond to changes in global public budgets. For example, where there is unmet need, a system aimed to maximise (unadjusted) CRQoL would put more emphasis on access (more recipients) than intensity of support compared to a system operating on a needs basis.","[Forder, Julien; Vadean, Florin; Rand, Stacey] Univ Kent, Qual & Outcomes Person Ctr Care Policy Res Unit Q, PSSRU, Canterbury, Kent, England; [Malley, Juliette] London Sch Econ, Qual & Outcomes Person Ctr Care Policy Res Unit Q, PSSRU, London, England",University of Kent; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Forder, J (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Personal Social Serv Res Unit, Canterbury CT2 7NF, Kent, England.",j.e.forder@kent.ac.uk,"Vadean, Florin/J-4743-2016; Malley, Juliette/B-5537-2014","Vadean, Florin/0000-0001-7882-3400; Forder, Julien/0000-0001-7793-4328; Rand, Stacey/0000-0001-9071-2842; Malley, Juliette/0000-0001-5759-1647",Department of Health: Policy Research Programme [QORU (PRP 100/0001)],Department of Health: Policy Research Programme,"Department of Health: Policy Research Programme, Grant/Award Number: QORU (PRP 100/0001)",,30,11,12,9,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,MAR,2018,27.0,3.0,,,,,E43,E58,,10.1002/hec.3612,0.0,,,16,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA4TF,29098741.0,"Green Published, hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428324700003,0

Methods: We developed a decision-analytic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of four antibiotic prophylaxis strategies: ciprofloxacin alone, ceftriaxone alone, ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone in combination, and directed prophylaxis selection based on susceptibility testing. We used a payer's perspective and estimated the health care costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with each strategy for a cohort of 66-year-old men undergoing TRPB. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3% annually. Base-case resistance prevalence was 29% to ciprofloxacin and 7% to ceftriaxone, reflecting susceptibility patterns observed at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Health Care System. Resistance levels were varied in sensitivity analysis. Results: In the base case, single-agent prophylaxis strategies were dominated. Directed prophylaxis strategy was the optimal strategy at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY gained. Relative to the directed prophylaxis strategy, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the combination strategy was $123,333/QALY gained over the lifetime time horizon. In sensitivity analysis, single-agent prophylaxis strategies were preferred only at extreme levels of resistance. Conclusions: Directed or combination prophylaxis strategies were optimal for a wide range of resistance levels. Facilities using single-agent antibiotic prophylaxis strategies before TRPB should re-evaluate their strategies unless extremely low levels of antimicrobial resistance are documented.","[Lee, Kyueun] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Hlth Res & Policy, Redwood Bldg T261, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Drekonja, Dimitri M.] Minneapolis Vet Affairs Hlth Care Syst, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Drekonja, Dimitri M.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis & Internal Med, Box 736 UMHC, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Enns, Eva A.] Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Hlth Policy & Management, Minneapolis, MN USA",Stanford University; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); Minneapolis VA Health Care System; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Lee, K (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Hlth Res & Policy, Redwood Bldg T261, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",kyueunl@stanford.edu,"Drekonja, Dimitri/JXL-9620-2024","Drekonja, Dimitri/0000-0002-6993-4704; Lee, Kyueun/0000-0002-0013-4733",,,,,37,5,6,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR,2018,21.0,3.0,,,,,310,317,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.08.3016,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA0QL,29566838.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428019200010,0

They greatly influence burden of disease estimations and economic evaluations involving stays in healthcare facilities. However, different estimation techniques employ assumptions that differ crucially in whether to consider the value of the second-best alternative use forgone, of any available alternative use, or the value of the actually chosen alternative. Informed by economic theory, this paper provides a taxonomic framework of methodologies for estimating the opportunity costs of resources. This taxonomy is then applied to bed-days by classifying existing approaches accordingly. We highlight differences in valuation between approaches and the perspective adopted, and we use our framework to appraise the assumptions and biases underlying the standard approaches that have been widely adopted mostly unquestioned in the past, such as the conventional use of reference costs and administrative accounting data. Drawing on these findings, we present a novel approach for estimating the opportunity costs of bed-days in terms of health forgone for the second-best patient, but expressed monetarily. This alternative approach effectively re-connects to the concept of choice and explicitly considers net benefits. It is broadly applicable across settings and for other resources besides bed-days.","[Sandmann, Frank G.; Edmunds, W.

The Special Task Force chose to take a health economics approach to the question of whether a health plan should cover and reimburse a specific technology, beginning with the view that the conventional cost-per-quality-adjusted life-year metric has both strengths as a starting point and recognized limitations. This report calls for the development of a more comprehensive economic evaluation that could include novel elements of value (e.g., insurance value and equity) as part of either an augmented cost-effectiveness analysis or a multicriteria decision analysis. Given an aggregation of elements to a measure of value, consistent use of a cost-effectiveness threshold can help ensure the maximization of health gain and well-being for a given budget. These decisions can benefit from the use of deliberative processes. The six recommendations are to: 1) be explicit about decision context and perspective in value assessment frameworks; 2) base health plan coverage and reimbursement decisions on an evaluation of the incremental costs and benefits of health care technologies as is provided by cost-effectiveness analysis; 3) develop value thresholds to serve as one important input to help guide coverage and reimbursement decisions; 4) manage budget constraints and affordability on the basis of cost-effectiveness principles; 5) test and consider using structured deliberative processes for health plan coverage and reimbursement decisions; and 6) explore and test novel elements of benefit to improve value measures that reflect the perspectives of both plan members and patients.","[Garrison, Louis P., Jr.; Basu, Anirban] Univ Washington, Comparat Hlth Outcomes Policy & Econ CHOICE Inst, Pharmaceut Outcomes Res & Policy Program, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Neumann, Peter J.] Tufts Med Ctr, Ctr Evaluat Value & Risk Hlth, Boston, MA USA; [Willke, Richard J.] Int Soc Pharmacoecon & Outcomes Res, Lawrenceville, NJ USA; [Danzon, Patricia M.; Pauly, Mark V.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Hlth Care Management, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Doshi, Jalpa A.] Univ Penn, Div Gen Internal Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Drummond, Michael F.] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Lakdawalla, Darius N.] Univ Southern Calif, Schaeffer Ctr Hlth Policy & Econ, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Phelps, Charles E.] Univ Rochester, Econ, Publ Hlth Sci, Polit Sci, Gualala, CA USA; [Ramsey, Scott D.] Univ Washington, Dept Gen Internal Med, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Towse, Adrian] Off Hlth Econ, London, England; [Weinstein, Milton C.] Harvard Univ, Hlth Policy & Management, Boston, MA 02115 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Tufts Medical Center; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of York - UK; University of Southern California; University of Rochester; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Harvard University,"Garrison, LP (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Comparat Hlth Outcomes Policy & Econ Inst, POB 357630, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",lgarrisn@uw.edu,"Lakdawalla, Darius/B-4409-2011; Towse, Adrian K/M-3760-2014","Lakdawalla, Darius/0000-0001-5934-8042;",,,,,6,105,110,1,31,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,FEB,2018,21.0,2.0,,,,,161,165,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.12.009,0.0,,,5,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,FX2ML,29477394.0,"hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000425894000008,0

Using a contingent valuation method, we elicit children's and parents' WTP to reduce children's risk of an asthma attack. Our results suggest that children are able to understand and value their own health risk reductions, and their ability to do so improves with age. Child age was found to be inversely related to parents' and children's WTP. The results also suggest that non-paternalistic altruism is predictive of children's WTP. For parents, care for their own health was found to be inversely related with their WTP for children's risk reductions. Comparison of parents' and children's WTP suggests that parents are willing to sacrifice for their child's health risk reduction an amount that is approximately twice that of their children. The analysis of matched pairs of parents and children suggest that there are within-household similarities as the child's WTP is positively related to parents' WTP.","[Guerriero, Carla] Univ Napoli Federico II, Dept Econ, CSEF, Via Cintia Monte S Angelo, I-80126 Naples, Italy; [Guerriero, Carla; Cairns, John] London Sch Hyg & Troical Med, Fac Publ Hlth & Policy, London, England; [Bianchi, Fabrizio; Cori, Liliana] CNR, Environm Epidemiol Unit, Inst Clin Physiol, Pisa, Italy",University of Naples Federico II; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Fisiologia Clinica (IFC-CNR),"Guerriero, C (通讯作者)，Univ Napoli Federico II, Dept Econ, CSEF, Via Cintia Monte S Angelo, I-80126 Naples, Italy.",carla.guerriero@unina.it,"Cori, Liliana/K-6027-2014; Cairns, John/AAD-1168-2020; Bianchi, Fabrizio/F-7900-2015","Cori, Liliana/0000-0002-3070-2535; Cairns, John/0000-0001-6442-0440; Bianchi, Fabrizio/0000-0002-3459-9301",Colt Foundation,Colt Foundation,Colt Foundation,,42,12,12,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,FEB,2018,27.0,2.0,,,,,E55,E68,,10.1002/hec.3562,0.0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA7NO,28901604.0,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428523400005,0

We ask respondents to report information about their willingness to pay for health risk reductions that are different from those used in earlier valuation work because they are comprised of two probabilities that of getting cancer, and that of dying from it (conditional on getting it in the first place). The product of these two probabilities is the unconditional cancer mortality risk. Our hypothetical risk reductions also include two severity-related attributes quality-of-life impacts and pain. The results show that respondents did appear to have an intuitive grasp of compound probabilities, and took into account each component of the unconditional cancer mortality risk when answering the valuation questions. We estimate the cancer VSL to be between approximately 2 and 5.950 million, depending on whether the (unconditional) mortality risk was reduced by lowering the chance of getting cancer, increasing the chance of surviving cancer, or both. The VSCC is estimated to be up to 0.578 million euro, and its magnitude depends on the initial (conditional) cancer mortality and on the improvement in survival. The survey responses show that our measures of cancer severity impacts on daily activities and pain have little or no effect on the WTP to reduce the adverse health risks. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The European Capital of Culture Programme, launched in 1985, is one of the most recognised EU projects. Since 1985, two European cities have been declared the European Capital of Culture every year. The Programme has become the key platform for economic and cultural regeneration. Through well-prepared and organized marketing of culture, arts and different cultural events, the European Capital of Culture Programme has a substantial economic impact on regional development, which improves the quality of life in these cities and also attracts a substantial number of local and foreign tourists. The research process consists of desk research and analysis of secondary data from different documents, such as a combination of academic studies, evaluations, literature reviews, case studies, abstracts of proposed studies, policy papers and reports by different committees and departments. The main method is the case study method of selected European Capitals of Culture. Other methods that have been used in this paper are: analysis, synthesis, induction, deduction, comparison, compilation. The results of the case study indicate that the European Capital of Culture Programme brings lots of tourists to the city, who are mostly attracted by this Programme. The most important economic impacts in tourism and the ways marketing can influence the positive image of a city will be emphasised through a comparative study of the selected cities. Finally, some recommendations will be given for future research.","[Cvenic, Marta Boric; Buljubasic, Iva; Tolusic, Marija] JJ Strossamyer Univ Osijek, Acad Arts & Culture Osijek, Kralja Petra Svacica 1-F, Osijek 31000, Croatia",,"Cvenic, MB (通讯作者)，JJ Strossamyer Univ Osijek, Acad Arts & Culture Osijek, Kralja Petra Svacica 1-F, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",mboric@unios.hr; ibuljuba@unios.hr; mtolusic@unios.hr,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,9,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,554,559,,,,,,6,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BP4BP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000550734100058,0

The aim of this study is to produce a value set to support use of EQ-5D-5L data in decision-making. The study design followed an international research protocol. Randomly selected members of the English general public completed 10 time trade-off and 7 discrete choice experiment tasks in face-to-face interviews. A 20-parameter hybrid model was used to combine time trade-off and discrete choice experiment data to generate values for the 3,125 EQ-5D-5L health states. Valuation data are available for 996 respondents. Face validity of the data has been demonstrated, with more severe health states generally given lower values. Problems with pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression received the greatest weight. Compared to the existing EQ-5D-3L value set, there are considerably fewer worse than dead states (5.1%, compared with over one third), and the minimum value is higher. Values range from -0.285 (extreme problems on all dimensions) to 0.950 (for health states 11211 and 21111). Results have important implications for users of the EQ-5D-5L both in England and internationally. Quality-adjusted life year gains from interventions seeking to improve very poor health may be smaller using this value set and may previously have been overestimated.","[Devlin, Nancy J.; Shah, Koonal K.; Feng, Yan] Off Hlth Econ, 105 Victoria St, London SW1E 6QT, England; [Devlin, Nancy J.; Mulhern, Brendan; van Hout, Ben] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Mulhern, Brendan] Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Evaluat, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Sheffield; University of Technology Sydney,"Devlin, NJ (通讯作者)，Off Hlth Econ, 105 Victoria St, London SW1E 6QT, England.",ndevlin@ohe.org,"Shah, Koonal/M-9123-2014; Feng, Yan/M-5358-2014","Shah, Koonal/0000-0002-4927-7858; Devlin, Nancy/0000-0002-1561-5361; Mulhern, Brendan/0000-0003-3656-8063; Feng, Yan/0000-0003-4436-1126",EuroQol Research Foundation; Department of Health Policy Research Programme [NIHR PRP 070/0073],EuroQol Research Foundation; Department of Health Policy Research Programme,"EuroQol Research Foundation; Department of Health Policy Research Programme, Grant/Award Number: NIHR PRP 070/0073",,49,745,754,5,78,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,JAN,2018,27.0,1.0,,,,,7,22,,10.1002/hec.3564,0.0,,,16,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,FV1VI,28833869.0,"hybrid, Green Accepted, Green Published, Green Submitted",Y,N,2024-03-10,WOS:000424352500008,0

An international protocol has been developed to guide the collection of stated preference data for this purpose and has been used to generate EQ-5D-5L valuation data for England. The aim of this paper is report the innovative methods used for modelling those data to obtain a value set. Nine hundred and ninety-six members of the English general public completed time trade-off (TTO) and discrete choice experiment (DCE) tasks. We estimate models, with and without interactions, using DCE data only, TTO data only, and TTO/DCE data combined. TTO data are interpreted as both left and right censored. Heteroskedasticity and preference heterogeneity between individuals are accounted for. We use Bayesian methods in the econometric analysis. The final model is chosen based on the deviance information criterion (DIC). Censoring and taking account of heteroskedasticity have important effects on parameter estimation. For DCE data only, TTO data only, and DCE/TTO data combined, models with parameters for all dimensions and levels perform best, as judged by the DIC. Taking account of heterogeneity improves fit, and the multinomial model reports the lowest DIC. This paper presents approaches that suit observed characteristics of EQ-5D-5L valuation data and recognise respondents' preference heterogeneity. The methods described are potentially relevant to other value set studies.","[Feng, Yan; Devlin, Nancy J.; Shah, Koonal K.] Off Hlth Econ London, London, England; [Devlin, Nancy J.; Mulhern, Brendan; van Hout, Ben] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St Sheffield, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Mulhern, Brendan] Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Evaluat, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Sheffield; University of Technology Sydney,"van Hout, B (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St Sheffield, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",b.a.vanhout@sheffield.ac.uk,"Shah, Koonal/M-9123-2014; Feng, Yan/M-5358-2014","Shah, Koonal/0000-0002-4927-7858; Mulhern, Brendan/0000-0003-3656-8063; Feng, Yan/0000-0003-4436-1126; Devlin, Nancy/0000-0002-1561-5361",Department of Health Policy Research Programme National Institute for Health Research [PRP 070/0073]; EuroQol Research Foundation,Department of Health Policy Research Programme National Institute for Health Research; EuroQol Research Foundation,"Department of Health Policy Research Programme, Grant/Award Number: National Institute for Health Research PRP 070/0073; EuroQol Research Foundation",,24,54,55,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,JAN,2018,27.0,1.0,,,,,23,38,,10.1002/hec.3560,0.0,,,16,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,FV1VI,28833854.0,"hybrid, Green Published, Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000424352500009,0

In this paper, we treat the problem as follows: beginning with a binary relation greater than or similar to on events that does not preclude a probabilistic interpretation, in the sense that greater than or similar to has extensions that are probabilistically representable, we characterize the extension greater than or similar to(+) of greater than or similar to that is exactly the intersection of all probabilistically representable extensions of greater than or similar to. This extension greater than or similar to(+) gives us all the additional comparisons that we are entitled to infer from greater than or similar to, based on the assumption that there is some probability measure of which greater than or similar to gives us partial qualitative information.

Over the last decade, an increasing number of studies account for attribute non-attendance (ANA) when using discrete choice experiments to elicit individuals' preferences. Most studies assume such behaviour is a heuristic and therefore uninformative. This assumption may result in misleading welfare estimates if ANA reflects preferences. This is the first paper to assess if ANA is a heuristic or genuine preference without relying on respondents' self-stated motivation and the first study to explore this question within a health context. Based on findings from cognitive psychology, we expect that familiar respondents are less likely to use a decision heuristic to simplify choices than unfamiliar respondents. We employ a latent class model of discrete choice experiment data concerned with National Health Service managers' preferences for support services that assist with performance concerns. We present quantitative and qualitative evidence that in our study ANA mostly represents preferences. We also show that wrong assumptions about ANA result in inadequate welfare measures that can result in suboptimal policy advice. Future research should proceed with caution when assuming that ANA is a heuristic.","[Heidenreich, Sebastian; Watson, Verity; Ryan, Mandy] Univ Aberdeen, Hlth Econ Res Unit, Polwarth Bldg,Foresterhill, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, Scotland; [Phimister, Euan] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Business, Aberdeen, Scotland",University of Aberdeen; University of Aberdeen,"Heidenreich, S (通讯作者)，Univ Aberdeen, Hlth Econ Res Unit, Polwarth Bldg,Foresterhill, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, Scotland.",sebastian.heidenreich@abdn.ac.uk,,"Phimister, Euan/0000-0002-6483-0113; Watson, Verity/0000-0002-3824-5076",National Clinical Assessment Service (NCAS); Institute of Applied Health Science; Chief Scientist Office [HERU1] Funding Source: researchfish,National Clinical Assessment Service (NCAS); Institute of Applied Health Science; Chief Scientist Office(Chief Scientist Office - Scotland),National Clinical Assessment Service (NCAS); Institute of Applied Health Science,,63,33,35,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,JAN,2018,27.0,1.0,,,,,157,171,,10.1002/hec.3524,0.0,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,FV1VI,28620975.0,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000424352500017,0

Nevertheless, research of banking performance can be further improved as a stimulus for the further development of financial system and to provide important information for creditors, investors and stakeholders. The efficiency of financial institutions has been widely and extensively studied in the recent years. In this paper, the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method is applied. This nonparametric approach has become one of the most commonly used methods in measuring technical and cost efficiency of financial institutions. The purpose of this paper is to determine factors, i.e., inputs and outputs of models which evaluate the relative efficiency of banking sector as well as the relative efficiency of particular banking institutions. The paper emphasizes a number of variables that can be used in DEA models for banking institutions, for example asset value, number of employees, interest and non-interest income, deposits and loans. The main results of the research will be the comparative analysis of different theoretical and empirical scientific research regarding banking sector evaluation especially for the new EU member countries, including Croatia. Although authors present the research achievements of the relative efficiency of banking sector, this can be the basis for further empirical studies of banking sector efficiency measurement.","[Maradin, Dario; Drazenovic, Bojana Olgic] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ & Business, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia; [Benkovic, Sladjana] Univ Belgrade, Fac Org Sci, Jove Ilica 154, Belgrade 11010, Serbia",University of Rijeka; University of Belgrade,"Maradin, D (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ & Business, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia.",dario.maradin@efri.hr; bojana.olgic.drazenovic@efri.hr; benko@fon.bg.ac.rs,"Maradin, Dario/Q-9380-2018; BENKOVIC, SLADJANA/GVS-7501-2022; Olgic Drazenovic, Bojana/R-4177-2018","Maradin, Dario/0000-0001-9642-6038; BENKOVIC, SLADJANA/0000-0003-3973-2180;",University of Rijeka [17.02.2.2.01],University of Rijeka,This work has been fully supported by/supported in part by the University of Rijeka under the project number 17.02.2.2.01.,,20,2,2,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,684,690,,,,,,7,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BP4BP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000550734100072,0

The present study examines whether cultural factors can have an influence on attitudes related to the state's responsibility for social issues, such as unemployment, family services, and care for the elderly. An important starting point is Hofstede's analysis of cultural values and, in particular, the concept of individualism. In this study, data from the European Social Survey (N=37,743 in 20 countries) are analyzed using a two-level regression analysis. The findings indicate that the individualist culture is a significant factor in terms of the socio-political attitudes of individuals. The dependence between individualism and attitudes can be observed in both the country-level analysis and the two-level regression analysis. According to the final regression model, other country-level factors, i.e. GDP, unemployment rate, distribution of income (GINI index), social and health expenditure, and other cultural dimensions of Hofstede's model, do not significantly explain the sociopolitical attitudes of individuals. On the other hand, many individual-level factors correlate with attitudes and their effect is greater than the effect of individualism.","[Toikko, Timo] Univ Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland; [Rantanen, Teemu] Laurea Univ Appl Sci, Vantaa, Finland",University of Eastern Finland; Laurea University of Applied Sciences,"Toikko, T (通讯作者)，Univ Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.",timo.toikko@uef.fi; teemu.rantanen@laurea.fi,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,766,775,,,,,,10,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BP4BP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000550734100082,0

Additionally, the results estimated by the GPD model confirmed that there were extreme events inside the trends of the four stock indexes.

We investigate responses of German health plans to the introduction of morbidity-based risk adjustment in the Statutory Health Insurance in 2009, which triggers payments based on validated diagnoses by providers. Using the regulator's data from office-based physicians, we estimate a difference-in-difference analysis of the change in the share and number of validated diagnoses for ICD codes that are inside or outside the risk adjustment but are otherwise similar. We find a differential increase in the share of validated diagnoses of 2.6 and 3.6 percentage points (3-4%) between 2008 and 2013.

The recent literature yields varying findings, which are likely due to differences in data, methods, samples, and institutional settings. Taking a more general approach, we provide comparable evidence for four countries with different institutional settingsAustralia, Germany, the UK, and the United Statesusing a nonparametric bounds analysis. Relying on fairly weak and partially testable assumptions, our paper shows that unemployment has a significant negative effect on mental health in all countries. Our results rule out effects larger than a quarter of a standard deviation for Germany and half a standard deviation for the Anglo-Saxon countries. The effect is significant for both men and women and materialises already for short periods of unemployment. Public policy should hence focus on early prevention of mental health problems among the unemployed.","[Cygan-Rehm, Kamila; Kuehnle, Daniel; Oberfichtner, Michael] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Nurnberg, Germany; [Oberfichtner, Michael] IAB, Nurnberg, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Kuehnle, D (通讯作者)，Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Nurnberg, Germany.",daniel.kuehnle@fau.de,,"Kuehnle, Daniel/0000-0002-2476-6655","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,72,56,60,4,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,DEC,2017,26.0,12.0,,,,,1844,1861,,10.1002/hec.3510,0.0,,,18,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,FT4AW,28497638.0,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000423095100047,0

A responsible agent, when indifferent between his objects at two different allocations, prefers the first allocation to the second if the first allocation is closer to the optimal allocation than the second, in the sense that all the agents who are allocated their optimal objects in the second allocation are allocated their optimal objects also in the first allocation, and there is at least one more agent in the first allocation receiving his optimal object.

The dimensionality was first reduced via a high-dimensional factor model implemented by the principal component analysis. Using the extracted factors, we develop a novel forecasting method called the sufficient forecasting, which provides a set of sufficient predictive indices, inferred from high-dimensional predictors, to deliver additional predictive power. The projected principal component analysis will be employed to enhance the accuracy of inferred factors when a semi-parametric factor model is assumed. Our method is also applicable to cross-sectional sufficient regression using extracted factors. The connection between the sufficient forecasting and the deep learning architecture is explicitly stated. The sufficient forecasting correctly estimates projection indices of the underlying factors even in the presence of a nonparametric forecasting function. The proposed method extends the sufficient dimension reduction to high-dimensional regimes by condensing the cross-sectional information through factor models. We derive asymptotic properties for the estimate of the central subspace spanned by these projection directions as well as the estimates of the sufficient predictive indices. We further show that the natural method of running multiple regression of target on estimated factors yields a linear estimate that actually falls into this central subspace. Our method and theory allow the number of predictors to be larger than the number of observations. We finally demonstrate that the sufficient forecasting improves upon the linear forecasting in both simulation studies and an empirical study of forecasting macroeconomic variables.

We use information on the selection rule to qualify for the plan to identify the effect of eligibility and adopt a regression discontinuity approach. Our sample consists of low-income individuals enrolled in the Health Insurance Fund and recipients of social benefits from the Family Allowance Fund of an urban area in Northern France. Our findings do not show significant impacts of the CMUC threshold on the number of doctor visits within the full sample. Among the subsample of adults under 30years old, however, eligible individuals are more likely to see a specialist and have, on average, significantly more specialist visits than non-eligible individuals. This specific impact of the CMUC cut-off point among young adults may be explained by the fact that young adults are less likely to be covered by a complementary health insurance plan when they are not recipients of the CMUC plan.

Receivers only observe a noisy public signal about the effort, which has no intrinsic value. The modelling of signalling in a dynamic context gives rise to novel equilibrium outcomes. In some equilibria, a sender with a higher cost of effort exerts strictly more effort than his low-cost counterpart. The low-cost type can compensate later for initial low effort, but this is not worthwhile for a high-cost-type. The interpretation of a given signal switches endogenously over time, depending on which type the receivers expect to send it. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This potential substitution effect has drawn political attention in countries looking for measures to reduce the growth in demand for hospital care. However, intensified competition may induce GPs to secure hospital admissions a signal to attract new patients and to keep the already enlisted ones satisfied, resulting in higher admission rates at hospitals. Using both static and dynamic panel data models, we aim to enhance the understanding of whether such relations are causal. Results based on ordinary least square (OLS) models indicate that aggregate inpatient admissions are negatively associated with intensified competition both in the full sample and for the sub-sample patients aged 45 to 69, while outpatient admissions are positively associated. Fixed-effect estimations do not confirm these results though. However, estimations of dynamic models show significant negative (positive) effects of GP competition on aggregate inpatient (outpatient) admissions in the full sample and negative effects on aggregate inpatient admissions and emergency admissions for the sub-sample. Thus, intensified GP competition may reduce inpatient hospital admissions by inducing GPs to provide more services, whereas, the alternative hypothesis seems valid for outpatient admissions.

It takes many days for peritoneal-fluid fungal culture to become positive, and the recommended empirical antifungal therapy involves excessive costs. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) should produce results more rapidly than fungal culture. Objectives: To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of the combination of several diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to manage Candida peritonitis in non-neutropenic adult patients in ICUs. Methods: We constructed a decision tree model to evaluate the cost effectiveness. Cost and effectiveness were taken into account in a 1-year time horizon and from the French National Health Insurance perspective. Six strategies were compared: fluconazole or echinocandin as an empirical therapy, plus diagnosis by fungal culture or detection by PCR of all Candida species, or use of PCR to detect most fluconazole-resistant Candida species (i.e., Candida krusei and Candida glabrata). Results: The use of fluconazole empirical treatment and PCR to detect all Candida species is more cost effective than using fluconazole empirical treatment without PCR (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of (sic)40,055/quality-adjusted life-year). Empirical treatment with echinocandin plus PCR to detect C. krusei and C. glabrata is the most effective strategy, but has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of (sic)93,776/quality-adjusted life-year. If the cost of echinocandin decreases, then strategies involving PCR plus empirical echinocandin become more cost-effective. Conclusions: Detection by PCR of all Candida species and of most fluconazole-resistant Candida species could improve the cost-effectiveness of fluconazole and echinocandin given to non-neutropenic patients with suspected peritoneal candidiasis in ICUs.

The main feature of the game is that when the marginal follower leaves the market the price jumps up, so that a leader's payoff is neither continuous nor quasiconcave. To show existence I check that a leader's value function satisfies the following single crossing condition: When the other leaders produce more the leader never accommodates entry of more followers. If demand is strictly logconcave, and if marginal costs are both non decreasing and not flatter than average costs, then a Stackelberg equilibrium exists. Besides showing existence I characterize the equilibrium set and provide a number of results that contribute to the applied literature. As the number of leaders increases, leaders produce more and eventually they deter entry. Leaders produce more than the Cournot best reply, but they may underinvest in entry deterrence. As the number of followers increases, leaders become more aggressive. When this number is large, if leaders can produce the limit quantity and at the same time have market power, then they deter entry. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: From 2009 to 2014, the Hemophilia Utilization Group Studies Part Vb collected prospective data from 10 US hemophilia treatment centers. Participants with HB completed initial surveys on sociodemographic characteristics, clinical characteristics, and treatment patterns. During the 2-year follow-up, participants reported bleeding episodes, work absenteeism, and caregiver time quarterly. These data were used to calculate ABR and indirect costs. Direct costs were calculated using 1-year clinical chart records and 2-year dispensing records. Results: Of the 148 participants, 112 with complete medical records and one or more follow-up survey were included. Total mean annual per-person costs were $85,852 (median $20,160) for mild/moderate HB, $198,733 (median $147,891) for severe HB, and $140,240 (median $63,617) for all participants without inhibitors (P < 0.0001). Mean ABR for participants with severe HB on prophylaxis (5.5 +/- 7.9 bleeds/y) was almost half that of those treated episodically. Clotting factor and indirect costs accounted for 85% and 9% of total costs, respectively. Compared with episodic treatment, prophylaxis use was associated with 2.5-fold higher clotting factor costs (P < 0.01), low but significantly more missed parental workdays (P < 0.0001) and clinician (P < 0.001) or nursing visits (P < 0.0001), less part-time employment and unemployment, and lower hospitalizations costs (P = 0.17) and ABR (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: HB is associated with high economic burden, primarily because of clotting factor costs. Nevertheless, prophylaxis treatment leads to clinical benefits and may reduce other nonfactor costs.","[Chen, Christina X.; Nichol, Michael B.] Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Baker, Judith R.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Baker, Judith R.] Ctr Inherited Blood Disorders, Orange, CA USA",University of Southern California; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Nichol, MB (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Sol Price Sch Publ Policy, Ralph & Goldy Lewis Hall 212, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",mnichol@usc.edu,"Nichol, Michael/AHE-6000-2022","Baker, Judith R./0000-0002-7850-0027",Pfizer,Pfizer(Pfizer),HUGS Vb was funded by Pfizer (formerly Wyeth).

Methods: A Markov cohort state-transition model was constructed to evaluate the cost utility of EBR/GZR RBV over a lifetime time horizon from the payer perspective. The target population was patients infected with chronic hepatitis C GT1 subtypes a orb (GT1a or GT1b), stratified by treatment history (treatment-naive [TN] or treatment-experienced), presence of cirrhosis, baseline hepatitis C virus RNA (< or >= 6 million IU/mL), and presence of NS5A resistance-associated variants. The primary outcome was incremental cost-utility ratio for EBR/GZR RBV versus available oral direct-acting antiviral agents. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the model. Results: EBR/GZR +/- RBV was economically dominant versus LDV/SOF in all patient populations. EBR/GZR +/- RBV was also less costly than SOF/VEL and 3D +/- RBV, but produced fewer quality-adjusted life-years in select populations. In the remaining populations, EBR/GZR +/- RBV was economically dominant. One-way sensitivity analyses showed varying sustained virologic response rates across EBR/GZR +/- RBV regimens, commonly impacted model conclusions when lower bound values were inserted, and at the upper bound resulted in dominance over SOF/VEL in GT1a cirrhotic and GT1b TN noncirrhotic patients. Results of the probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that EBR/GZR +/- RBV was cost-effective in more than 99% of iterations in GT1a and GT1b noncirrhotic patients and more than 69% of iterations in GT1b cirrhotic patients. Conclusions: Compared with other oral direct-acting antiviral agents, EBR/GZR RBV was the economically dominant regimen for treating GT1a noncirrhotic and GT1b TN cirrhotic patients, and was cost saving in all other populations.","[Corman, Shelby; Michalopoulos, Steven N.] Pharmerit Int, Bethesda, MD USA; [Elbasha, Elamin H.] Merck & Co Inc, N Wales, PA USA; [Nwankwo, Chizoba] Merck & Co Inc, Kenilworth, NJ USA",Pharmerit North America LLC; Merck & Company; Merck & Company,"Corman, S (通讯作者)，4350 East West Highway,Suite 1110, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",scorman@pharmerit.com,"Michalopoulos, Efstathios/AAA-4674-2020; Nwankwo, Chizoba/S-5264-2019",,"Merck Co., Inc.","Merck Co., Inc.(Merck & Company)","Support for this work was provided by Merck & Co., Inc.",,74,13,17,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP,2017,20.0,8.0,,,,,1110,1120,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.05.003,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,FI3CO,28964443.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000411834200014,0

We merge seven years (2003-2009) of advertising data from Kan tar Media with the Simmons National Consumer Survey to estimate individual-level vitamin print and television ad exposure effects. Identification relies on exploiting exogenous variation in year-to-year advertising exposure by controlling for each individual's unique media consumption.

A specification using backward myopic prices gives more plausible and stable results than using forward myopic prices. Using 171 million person-months spanning 73 employers from 2008 to 2014, we estimate that the overall demand elasticity by backward myopic consumers is 0.44, with higher elasticities of demand for pharmaceuticals (-0.44), specialists visits (-0.32), MRIs (-0.29) and mental health/substance abuse (-0.26), and lower elasticities for prevention visits (-0.02) and emergency rooms (-0.04). Demand response is lower for children, in larger firms, among hourly waged employees, and for sicker people. Overall the method appears promising for estimating elasticities for highly disaggregated services although the approach does not work well on services that are very expensive or persistent.

Researchers typically focus on monotone equilibria. We provide conditions under which non-monotone equilibria also exist, where players attempt to coordinate to obtain the stochastic payoff whenever signals are in a bounded interval. In bounded interval equilibria (BIE), an endogenous fear of miscoordination discourages players from coordinating to obtain the stochastic payoff when their signals suggest coordination is most beneficial. In contrast to monotone equilibria, expected payoffs from successful coordination in BIE are lower than the ex-ante expected payoff from ignoring signals and always trying to coordinate to obtain the stochastic payoff. We show that BIE only exist when, absent private information, the game would be a coordination game. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

As an application, using Current Population Survey (CPS) data, we apply the new measure to Blinder and Esaki's (1978) aggregate macro-modeling approach to examine US income inequality trends from 1947 to 2014. Increases in the unemployment rate and decreases in inflation rates and in the growth rate in gross domestic product (GDP) were found to deepen income inequality; rising inequality is a recent trend many policymakers have been watching with concern.

Although the causes and impacts of seasonality are generally well documented in different study contexts, and many methods for isolating the seasonal component have been developed, considerably less attention has been paid to the measurement of the degree of seasonality. After reviewing the main indices used for measuring seasonality in different study contexts, we will propose a new approach in which seasonality is evaluated on the basis of the solution of a transportation problem. By considering the interdisciplinary nature of seasonal phenomena, the topic of measuring seasonality merits attention from a wide variety of perspectives. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we examine the impact of reductions in local expenditure on one particular public health target: reducing rates of teen pregnancy. Contrary to predictions made at the time of the cuts, panel data estimates provide no evidence that areas which reduced expenditure the most have experienced relative increases in teenage pregnancy rates. Rather, expenditure cuts are associated with small reductions in teen pregnancy rates, a result which is robust to a number of alternative specifications and tests for causality. Underlying socio-economic factors such as education outcomes and alcohol consumption are found to be significant predictors of teen pregnancy. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We investigate the effects of highly publicized sex work regulations introduced in 2005 in Tijuana, Mexico on the incidence of trichomoniasis. State-level, annual data for the 1995-2012 period are employed that include the incidence rates of trichomoniasis by age group and predictor variables. We find that the regulations led to a decrease in the incidence rate of trichomoniasis. Specifically, while our estimates are somewhat noisy, the all-ages incidence rate in the 2005-2012 period is roughly 37% lower than what is predicted by our synthetic control estimates and corresponds to approximately 800 fewer reported cases of trichomoniasis per year. We find that the decreases are especially pronounced for 15-24 and 25-44 age cohorts.

J,"Ryan, M",,,,"Ryan, Matthew",,,Random binary choices that satisfy stochastic betweenness,JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Fechner model; Betweenness,PREFERENCES; UNCERTAINTY; BEHAVIOR; UTILITY; MODELS,"Experimental evidence suggests that the process of choosing between lotteries (risky prospects) is stochastic and is better described through choice probabilities than preference relations. Binary choice probabilities admit a Fechner representation if there exists a utility function u such that the probability of choosing a over b is a non-decreasing function of the utility difference u (a) - u (b). The representation is strict if u (a) >= u (b) precisely when the decision-maker is at least as likely to choose a from {a, b} as to choose b. Blavatskyy (2008) obtained necessary and sufficient conditions for a strict Fechner representation in which u has the expected utility form. One of these is the Common Consequence Independence (CCI) axiom (ibid., Axiom 4), which is a stochastic analogue of the mixture independence condition on preferences. Blavatskyy also conjectured that by weakening CCI to a condition we call Stochastic Betweenness - a stochastic analogue of the betweenness condition on preferences (Chew, 1983) - one obtains necessary and sufficient conditions for a strict Fechner representation in which u has the implicit expected utility form (Dekel, 1986). We show that Blavatskyy's conjecture is false, and provide a valid set of necessary and sufficient conditions for the desired representation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Objective This study evaluates the cost effectiveness of insulin degludec plus liraglutide (IDegLira, Xultophy (R)) compared with six potential intensification treatment options for patients with T2DM that is uncontrolled with basal insulin. Methods The Swedish Institute for Health Economics (IHE) Cohort Model of Type 2 Diabetes was used with Swedish input data, a 40-year time frame and a societal perspective. The comparators for treatment intensification included insulin glargine, neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin, insulin aspart plus either glargine or NPH, and liraglutide plus either glargine or NPH. Clinical data for all comparators (except NPH insulin) were based on an indirect treatment comparison of several studies. Prices were obtained from the 2014 Swedish Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency (Tandvards-och lakemedelsformansverket [TLV]) database, and utility values were obtained from published studies. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken. Results Overall incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were Swedish krona (SEK) 70,000 or lower per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). IDegLira compared with intensified basal insulin showed an ICER of SEK 28,000 per QALY versus insulin glargine, SEK70,000 per QALY versus NPH insulin and SEK 60,000 per QALY versus NPH insulin plus liraglutide. IDegLira was dominant over insulin glargine plus liraglutide and insulin aspart plus insulin glargine or NPH insulin. Results were driven by the difference in glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) reduction between treatments, as confirmed by sensitivity analyses. Conclusions IDegLira is estimated to be a cost-effective treatment in Sweden compared with commonly used intensification treatments for patients with T2DM uncontrolled with basal insulin.","[Ericsson, Asa] Novo Nordisk Scandinavia AB, Box 505, S-20215 Malmo, Sweden; [Lundqvist, Adam] Swedish Inst Hlth Econ, IHE, Lund, Sweden",Novo Nordisk,"Ericsson, Å (通讯作者)，Novo Nordisk Scandinavia AB, Box 505, S-20215 Malmo, Sweden.",asae@novonordisk.com,,"Fridhammar, Adam/0000-0003-3715-003X","Novo Nordisk Scandinavia AB, the manufacturer of IDegLira","Novo Nordisk Scandinavia AB, the manufacturer of IDegLira","This study was funded by Novo Nordisk Scandinavia AB, the manufacturer of IDegLira.",,59,26,26,0,10,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

However, for patient preferences to be given adequate consideration by decision makers they need to be quantified. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is one way to quantify and capture the patient voice. The objective of this review was to report on existing MCDAs involving patients to support the future use of MCDA to capture the patient voice. Methods MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched in June 2014 for English-language papers with no date restriction. The following search terms were used: 'multi-criteria decision*', 'multiple criteria decision*', 'MCDA', 'benefit risk assessment*', 'risk benefit assessment*', 'multicriteri* decision*', 'MCDM', 'multi-criteri* decision*'. Abstracts were included if they reported the application of MCDA to assess healthcare interventions where patients were the source of weights. Abstracts were excluded if they did not apply MCDA, such as discussions of how MCDA could be used; or did not evaluate healthcare interventions, such as MCDAs to assess the level of health need in a locality. Data were extracted on weighting method, variation in patient and expert preferences, and discussion on different weighting techniques. Results The review identified ten English-language studies that reported an MCDA to assess healthcare interventions and involved patients as a source of weights. These studies reported 12 applications of MCDA. Different methods of preference elicitation were employed: direct weighting in workshops; discrete choice experiment surveys; and the analytical hierarchy process using both workshops and surveys. There was significant heterogeneity in patient responses and differences between patients, who put greater weight on disease characteristics and treatment convenience, and experts, who put more weight on efficacy. The studies highlighted cognitive challenges associated with some weighting methods, though patients' views on their ability to undertake weighting tasks was positive. Conclusion This review identified several recent examples of MCDA used to elicit patient preferences, which support the feasibility of using MCDA to capture the patient voice. Challenges identified included, how best to reflect the heterogeneity of patient preferences in decision making and how to manage the cognitive burden associated with some MCDA tasks.","[Marsh, Kevin; Zaiser, Erica] Evidera, Metro Bldg 6th Floor,1 Butterwick, London W6 8DL, England; [Caro, J.

During this period, there has been a significant decline in mortality, in particular for low birth weight infants. We identified four interventions that together explained about 50% of the decline in early neonatal and infant mortality: ventilators, antenatal steroids, surfactant and insure. The analyses were performed on a large set of data, encompassing more than 1.6 million deliveries (Medical Birth Registry of Norway). The richness of the data allowed us to perform several robustness tests. Our study indicates that the introduction of new medical interventions has been a very important channel through which the decline in mortality among newborn babies occurred during the second half of the last century.

We took advantage of a unique survey of participants in the 2012 annual MIR cycle to analyze preferences under two different choice scenarios: the residency program actually chosen by each participant when it came her turn (the 'real') and the program that she would have chosen if all residency training programs had been available (the 'counterfactual'). Utilizing conditional logit models with random coefficients, we found significant differences in medical graduates' preferences between the two scenarios, particularly with respect to three specialty attributes: work hours/lifestyle, prestige among colleagues, and annual remuneration. In the counterfactual world, these attributes were valued preferentially by those nearer to the top, while in the real world, they were valued preferentially by graduates nearer to the bottom of the national ranking. Medical graduates' specialty preferences, which we conclude, are not intrinsically stable but depend critically on the 'rules of the game'. The MIR assignment system, by restricting choice, effectively creates an externality in which those at the bottom, who have fewer choices, want what those at the top already have.

Our identification strategy exploits unexpected health shocks and combines matching with individual fixed effects in a generalized difference-in-differences framework to control for observable and unobservable heterogeneity. While the effect of spousal health shocks on labor supply is theoretically ambiguous, we find strong evidence for a decline in employment and earnings of individuals whose spouses are diagnosed with cancer. We interpret this result as individuals reducing their labor supply to provide care to their sick spouses and to enjoy joint leisure. Family income substantially declines after spouses' cancer diagnoses, suggesting that the financial consequences of such health shocks are considerable. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We generalize the notion of the profit-target strategy which is first introduced as a truthful strategy in a first price package auction with a single seller by Bernheim and Whinston (1986b). We then show that the set of equilibrium payoffs in profit-target strategies is equal to the bidder-optimal core, and is also equal to the set of coalition-proof Nash equilibria. Using this result, we find that any equilibrium payoff vector is weakly Pareto-dominated by the VCG payoff vector for buyers, and that the Walrasian competitive equilibrium payoff vector is weakly Pareto-dominated by some equilibrium payoff vector for buyers, even if goods are substitutes. This contrasts with the first price package auction with a single seller, in which it is shown that if goods are substitutes, then those three outcomes are payoff-equivalent. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

To measure patients' acceptance of this treatment modality, a new patient-reported outcome, the Injection-Treatment Acceptance Questionnaire (I-TAQ), was developed. Objectives: To psychometrically evaluate the I-TAQ with patients at high risk of cardiovascular events receiving alirocumab. Methods: The 22-item, 5-domain I-TAQ was administered cross-sectionally to 151 patients enrolled in alirocumab clinical trials. Item response distributions, factor and multitrait analyses, interitem correlations, correlations with an existing measure of acceptance (convergent validity), and comparison of known groups were performed to assess the I-TAQ's psychometric properties. Results: Completion rates were high, with no patients missing more than two items and 91.4% missing no data. All items displayed high ceiling effects (>30%) because of high treatment acceptance. Factor analysis supported the a priori hypothesized item-domain structure with good fit indices (root mean square error approximation = 0.070; comparative fit index = 0.988) and high factor loadings. All items demonstrated item convergent validity (item-scale correlation > 0.40), except for the side effects domain, which was limited by small numbers (n = 46). Almost all items correlated most highly with the domain to which they were assigned (item discriminant validity). Internal reliability was acceptable for all domains (Cronbach a range 0.72-0.88) and convergent validity was supported by a logical pattern of correlations with the Chronic Treatment Acceptance Questionnaire. Conclusions: These findings provide initial evidence of validity and reliability for the I-TAQ in patients treated with subcutaneous alirocumab. The I-TAQ could prove to be a valuable patient-reported outcome for therapies requiring subcutaneous injection.","[Tatlock, Sophi; Arbuckle, Rob; Grant, Laura] Adelphi Values Ltd, Bollington SK10 5JB, Cheshire, England; [Sanchez, Robert; Manvelian, Garen] Regeneron Pharmaceut, Tarrytown, NY USA; [Khan, Irfan] Sanofi, Bridgewater, NJ USA; [Spertus, John A.] St Lukes Hosp, Mid Amer Heart Inst, Kansas City, MO 64111 USA; [Spertus, John A.] Univ Missouri, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA",Adelphi Group Ltd; Regeneron; Sanofi-Aventis; Saint Luke's Hospital - Missouri; Saint Luke's Mid America Heart Institute; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Kansas City,"Tatlock, S (通讯作者)，Adelphi Values Ltd, Bollington SK10 5JB, Cheshire, England.",sophi.tatlock@adelphivalues.com,"Khan, Irfan/ABD-3838-2020; Spertus, John/ABD-3075-2021","Khan, Irfan/0000-0002-9832-0904; Spertus, John/0000-0002-2839-2611",Regeneron Pharmaceuticals; Sanofi,Regeneron Pharmaceuticals(Regeneron); Sanofi,This work was sponsored and funded by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi.,,19,6,6,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR,2017,20.0,3.0,,,,,430,440,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.09.2410,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,EO1HZ,28292488.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000396450600014,0

Previous work in this area has typically focused on the relationship between current program eligibility and current health. But because health is a stock variable which reflects the cumulative influence of health inputs, it would be preferable to estimate the impact of total program eligibility during childhood on longer-term health outcomes. I provide such estimates by using longitudinal data to construct Medicaid and CHIP eligibility measures that are observed from birth through age 18 and estimating the effect of cumulative program exposure on a variety of health outcomes observed in early adulthood. To account for the endogeneity of program eligibility, I exploit variation in Medicaid and CHIP generosity across states and over time for children of different ages. I find that an additional year of public health insurance eligibility during childhood improves a summary index of adult health by .079 standard deviations, and substantially reduces health limitations, chronic conditions and asthma prevalence while improving self-rated health.

Apixaban was shown to be safer than warfarin, with superior reduction in the risk of stroke, systemic embolism, mortality, and major bleeding irrespective of kidney function. Objectives: To evaluate the cost-utility of apixaban compared with warfarin in AF patients at different levels of kidney function. Methods: A Markov model was used to estimate the cost effectiveness of apixaban compared with warfarin in AF patients at three levels of kidney function: estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of more than 80 ml/min, 50 to 80 ml/min, and 50 ml/min or less. Event rates and associated utilities were obtained from previous literature. The model adopted the US health care system perspective, with hospitalization costs extracted from the Healthcare and Utilization Project. Treatment costs were obtained from official price lists. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of results. Results: Apixaban was a dominant treatment strategy compared with warfarin in AF patients with eGFR levels of 50 ml/min or less and 50 to 80 ml/min. In patients with an eGFR of more than 80 ml/min, apixaban was cost-effective compared with warfarin, costing $6307 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Results were consistent assuming anticoagulant discontinuation after major bleeding events. Compared with dabigatran and rivaroxaban, apixaban was the only cost-effective anticoagulant strategy relative to warfarin in both mild and moderate renal impairment settings. Conclusions: Apixaban is a favorably cost-effective alternative to warfarin in AF patients with normal kidney function and potentially cost-saving in those with renal impairment.","[Altawalbeh, Shoroq M.; Alshogran, Osama Y.] Jordan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Clin Pharm, Fac Pharm, POB 3030, Irbid 22110, Jordan; [Smith, Kenneth J.] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Ctr Res Hlth Care, Sect Decis Sci, Pittsburgh, PA USA",Jordan University of Science & Technology; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Altawalbeh, SM (通讯作者)，Jordan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Clin Pharm, Fac Pharm, POB 3030, Irbid 22110, Jordan.",smaltawalbeh@just.edu.jo,,"Alshogran, Osama/0000-0002-2466-4763; Altawalbeh, Shoroq/0000-0001-8345-4048",Jordan University of Science and Technology [87/2017],Jordan University of Science and Technology,This project was supported by the Deanship of Scientific Research at Jordan University of Science and Technology (grant no. 87/2017).,,52,5,6,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2018,21.0,12.0,,,,,1365,1372,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.06.009,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,HC2LE,30502779.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000451632700003,0

Our criterion distinguishes between interdependence and behaviour in the margins. Many economics contexts concern interdependence only e.g. complementarities in production function, intergenerational mobility, social gradient in health. We prove that the proposed relations, namely, increasing discordance (concordance) orderings, are equivalent to first order stochastic (survival) dominance. We generalize to three dimensions for which dependence becomes a more complex notion. We measure interdependence via a most general measure, namely, a copula. Main challenge is that in a discrete setting there are many copulas associated with a given distribution. Drawing on a copula theory (Carley, 2002) we offer an algorithm which generates distributions that are more increasing concordant.

Although many researchers have addressed this issue, most previous studies assume symmetric firms in terms of demand and cost structures due to analytical tractability. We attempt to find a stable merger in a general n-firm oligopoly in which we allow for asymmetric substitutability between firms. To ensure analytical tractability, we follow the related literature and employ a simple core allocation for a monopoly merger as a stability concept. We analyze several typical markets with asymmetric substitutability and show that although gamma-core is always nonempty in every setting that we examine, the delta-core is very likely to be empty-it is always empty in a market with three or more symmetric firms. Nevertheless, we present an example of a market with a nonempty delta-core, regardless of the number of firms in a market. The market has at most two symmetric firms in terms of substitutability (e.g., a linear city). Furthermore, substitutability is so low across the market that each firm competes with only two neighboring firms. Therefore, contrary to the conventional view suggested in previous studies, we show that a monopoly merger can be stable in a Cournot oligopoly market, even if there are many firms in the market.

A three-stage estimation procedure is proposed to estimate both constant and functional coefficients and their asymptotic properties are investigated. A simple and easily implemented procedure for making inferences is proposed. Monte Carlo simulation is conducted to examine the finite sample performance of the proposed estimators. Finally, using the cross-country panel data, we find a strong empirical evidence of the existence of the absorptive capacity hypothesis, together with another new finding that FDI has much stronger growth effects for countries with fast economic growth than for those with slow economic growth.

It is also a useful approach for dimension reduction for modeling cross-section dependence. However, (lambda) under tilde (i) and f(similar to t) are unobservable. We explore the implications for econometric modeling under various formulations of the interactive effects models and suggest a quasi-likelihood approach as a common framework to study issues of estimation and statistical inference when regressors are either strictly exogenous or predetermined and under different combinations of the data size of cross-sectional dimension, N, and time series dimensions, T. We also suggest some computationally simpler estimation methods in light of the quasi-likelihood approach. Monte Carlo studies are conducted to highlight the issues involved. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

I formalize this observation by defining the property of integration monotonicity, which requires that every agent becomes better off after any number of matching markets merge. Integration monotonicity is also incompatible with the weaker efficiency property of Pareto optimality. Nevertheless, I obtain two possibility results. First, stable matching mechanisms never hurt more than one half of the society after the integration of several matching markets occurs. Second, in random matching markets there are positive expected gains from integration for both sides of the market, which I quantify. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.
