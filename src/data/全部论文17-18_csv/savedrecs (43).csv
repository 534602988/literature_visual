Security is a key foundation for the preservation of human society and all its values. Contemporary threats and threatening phenomena accompanying social development have imposed a change in the theoretical understanding of the phenomenon of security. New challenges, risks and threats require new concepts of security. The factors influencing threats to security following the post bipolar period have extended not only in size, but also by type. These factors have affected the social, political, cultural, ecological and economic sphere of society and created the world different from the one in the last decades of the twentieth century. The methods used during the preparation of this work were the method of content analysis, comparative analysis and reference sources. The purpose of this work is to show that the contemporary threats and threatening phenomena of globalization have widely affected the individual and international security.

The study case takes into consideration the provisions of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines, and where was required the application of a domestic legislation, we applied the Romanian one. We found that the most important step is represented by a comparability analysis between related party transactions and comparable market transactions. Further on, we noted that the application of this step triggers some practical issues which are strongly determined by the deadlines for the documentation of the arm's length principle. More exactly, depending on these deadline, the financial information for comparables are or not available for the year under analysis. Given this, in relation to the comparability analysis, in practice are met two situations: the use of comparable entities' information from the year under analysis and the use of this information from previous years. In this context we selected a sample of comparables and analysed if these two practical approaches impact the final conclusion regarding the compliance with the arm's length principle. We found that there can be a small difference among the results obtained in the two situations.

Therefore, one of the focal points towards which policymakers direct public attention nowadays is raising the level of financial literacy of financial consumers as a necessary prerequisite for making more informed financial decisions. Bearing that in mind, with this empirical survey we aim to explore personal factors which might explain disparities in the level of financial literacy, rather than investigating the effects of financial literacy on financial decisions and their successfulness. Furthermore, while personal finance and individuals or households are at the center of the most of studies, we pay attention to corporate finance, to be more precise, hotel managers, since tourism, hospitality and hotel industry are continuously increasing their importance in the Croatian economy. Besides examination of other personal characteristics, an assumption is made that hotel managers' financial literacy is driven by the level of formal education, continuous professional specialization and consulting as well as work experience in comparable job positions. A questionnaire research encompassed 120 hotels (3, 4 and 5 star hotels) in the Split-Dalmatia County. The response rate was approximately 27% i.e. managers from 32 hotels filled out the questionnaire. The most of them had intermediate and higher level of financial literacy, while disparities in the level of financial literacy are explained with a presence or absence of professional specialization and consulting services. Thus, with an overall promotion of financial literacy importance, the concept of lifelong learning and using financial experts' service in the corporate sector need to be emphasized in order to potentially boost the performance of this industry.","[Novokmet, Ana Kundid] Univ Split, Fac Econ, Cvite Fiskovica 5, Split 21000, Croatia; [Zalic, Zana] Asco Doo, Rovinjska 4, Split 21000, Croatia",University of Split,"Novokmet, AK (通讯作者)，Univ Split, Fac Econ, Cvite Fiskovica 5, Split 21000, Croatia.",akundid@efst.hr; zaliczana@gmail.com,,,,,,,19,1,1,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,533,543,,,,,,11,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6MR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426857700058,0

There is no significant asymmetry in the effectiveness between the target rate increase and target rate decrease.

Two common elicitation formats are the direct measurement of a subjective point estimate of life expectancy and the assessment of survival probabilities to a range of target ages. This study presents one of the few direct comparisons of these two methods. Results from a representative sample of the Dutch population indicate that respondents on average gave higher estimates of longevity using survival probabilities (83.6 years) compared to point estimates (80.2 years). Individual differences between elicitation methods were smaller for younger respondents and for respondents with a higher socioeconomic status. The correlation between the subjective longevity estimations was moderate, but their associations with respondents' characteristics were similar. Our results are in line with existing literature and suggest that findings from both elicitation methods may not be directly comparable, especially in certain subgroups of the population.

At the same time the capability of the developing economy to export high-technology goods depends on a number of factors, including inflow of the direct foreign investments (DFI), efficiency of scientific research, quality of state regulation, and also other factors. A considerable factor of development of economy is its resource intensity which level influences the speed of technology development. Within this research influence of such factors as DFI and outflow of foreign investments, payments for use of intellectual property items and export of resources for export of high-technology products in the countries with the average level of the income is analyzed. Results of this analysis allow to draw to us a conclusion that a number of factors positively influences a capability of the country to export hightechnology goods on the world market. Also on the example of Russia influence of resource intensity of economy on production of high-technology products and its export is proved negative. The conducted research allowed to formulate a conclusion that resource dependence of the Russian economy is the factor constraining innovative development of economy. Also by results of the carried-out analysis it was established that the greatest positive impact on export of high-technology production in Russia is exerted by a payment for developed technologies.

We find that increases in VIX lead to significant immediate and delayed declines in emerging market returns in all periods. However, changes in VIX explained a greater percentage of changes in emerging market returns during the financial crisis than in other periods. The higher US stock market uncertainty exerts a much stronger depressing effect on emerging market returns than their own-lagged and regional returns. Our risk transmission model suggests that a heightened US stock market uncertainty lowers emerging market returns by both reducing the mean returns and raising the variance of returns. The VIX fears raise the volatility of emerging market returns through generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH)-type volatility transmission processes.","[Sarwar, Ghulam] Calif State Univ San Bernardino, Dept Accounting & Finance, Coll Business & Publ Adm, 5500 Univ Pkwy, San Bernardino, CA 92407 USA; [Khan, Walayet] Univ Evansville, Schroeder Sch Business, Evansville, IN USA",California State University System; California State University San Bernardino; University of Evansville,"Sarwar, G (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ San Bernardino, Dept Accounting & Finance, Coll Business & Publ Adm, 5500 Univ Pkwy, San Bernardino, CA 92407 USA.",gsarwar@csusb.edu,,,,,,,42,44,46,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Based on portfolio accounting identities, the change of foreign exchange reserves was decomposed into the net purchase change and the non-purchase change. The newly constructed non-purchase change was used to estimate the latent currency composition. Empirical results show that by the end of 2015Q1, China held about 63.6% of its reserves in the U.S. dollar, 19.6% in the euro, 3.09% in the Japanese yen, 4.89% in the pound sterling, 2.22% in the Canadian dollar, 2.03% in the Australian dollar, and 0.09% in the Swiss franc. Although the currency composition kept relatively stable, more attention had been paid to the emerging international currencies. China decreased the U.S. dollar share during the subprime crisis, while resorted to the portfolio rebalance strategy since 2011. The euro share and the pound sterling share declined during the European sovereign debt crisis. The first derivative of the U.S. dollar was positive while those of other currencies were negative before 2014Q3, and vice versa after 2014Q4. In general, the currency composition management of China's foreign exchange reserves was effective.","[Shi, Kai] Northeast Normal Univ, Sch Econ, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Nie, Li] Hitotsubashi Univ, Grad Sch Commerce & Management, 2-1 Naka, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868601, Japan",Northeast Normal University - China; Hitotsubashi University,"Nie, L (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Grad Sch Commerce & Management, 2-1 Naka, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868601, Japan.",brilliant.so.kai@gmail.com,,"Nie, Li/0000-0002-1971-667X; Shi, Kai/0000-0003-4768-6866",Ministry of Education Humanities & Social Science Fund [15YJC790086],Ministry of Education Humanities & Social Science Fund,This work was supported by the Ministry of Education Humanities & Social Science Fund under Grant No. 15YJC790086.,,20,3,4,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Integration priorities and policies are set out by the European Union Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region. The document recognised connectivity as one of the three primary objectives, while transport development as one of the 13 specific objectives. The main element of this region is the sea basin which is a physical barrier for integration processes. Overcoming this barrier is a challenge for the transport system, in particular for the air transport. This paper analyses the key factors of this system. Literature research was conducted. The Region was delimited, taking into account both state borders and borders of NUTS 2 statistical regions situated at the Baltic Sea. Based on cutting-edge IT tools (Skyscanner and Flightradar), airports which serve passenger traffic in this region were identified. Measures of air infrastructure development as well as air transport and price accessibility were prepared. Next, empirical research on this issue was conducted. The Region, which has an area of 3,839.8 km2 and a population of 107.51 m., has 163 airports that serve 983 intra-regional air operations. The highest number of operations was noted in capital airports in Scandinavian countries (Stockholm, Oslo, Helsinki, Copenhagen). As regards measures of air operations and measures of air infrastructure development, a wide disparity between the well-developed Scandinavian countries and the other part of the Region was observed. Analysis of price accessibility of air services gave different results. Scandinavian countries together with Belarus and Russia proved to have unfavourable price accessibility. Kaliningrad had the most expensive and worst connectivity among Baltic airports. Out of airports not situated in capitals, the Gdansk airport had the best connectivity. As regards the development of the passenger air transport system, the integration of the Baltic Sea Region was found to be good.","[Studzieniecki, Tomasz; Marciszewska, Barbara] Gdynia Maritime Univ, Gdynia, Poland",Gdynia Maritime University,"Studzieniecki, T (通讯作者)，Gdynia Maritime Univ, Gdynia, Poland.",t.studzieniecki@wpit.am.gdynia.pl; b.marciszewska@wpit.am.gdynia.pl,"Studzieniecki, Tomasz/Q-7351-2018; Marciszewska, Barbara/X-8540-2018","Studzieniecki, Tomasz/0000-0002-1272-0908; Marciszewska, Barbara/0000-0002-7952-889X",,,,,27,0,0,0,4,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,608,617,,,,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6MR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426857700066,0

However, it is not yet clear whether consumers perceive these value-added products to be substitutes for the traditional unbreaded products. We model the demand for frozen seafood in the United States using the linear approximate almost ideal demand system (LA-AIDS) employing market-level monthly retail scanner panel data. Our emphasis is on the demand relationships between the three aggregate frozen seafood categories, namely, breaded products, entrees and unbreaded products, and on the demand relationships for these categories when disaggregated as finfish and shellfish. We use fixed effects on the spatial and temporal variation in demand and incorporated demographic shifter variables. Our results show that unbreaded products, as compared to value-added categories of breaded seafood and seafood entrees, would gain market share if expenditure on frozen seafood increases. We also find that unbreaded products are stronger substitutes for value-added products than vice versa. We explore similar relationships between frozen shellfish and finfish products. Unbreaded shellfish can be expected to gain market share if expenditure on frozen seafood were to increase.","[Surathkal, Prasanna] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Dey, Madan M.] Texas State Univ, Dept Agr, San Marcos, TX USA; [Engle, Carole R.] Engle Stone Aquat LLC, Strasburg, VA USA; [Chidmi, Benaissa] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Singh, Kehar] Univ Prince Edward Isl, Atlantic Vet Coll, Dept Hlth Management, Agr Resource Econ Div, Charlottetown, PE, Canada",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; Texas State University System; Texas State University San Marcos; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; University of Prince Edward Island,"Surathkal, P (通讯作者)，Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 421B Ag Hall, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",pras.kota@gmail.com,"Chidmi, Ben/HJA-8174-2022; Singh, Kehar/AAI-9069-2020","Singh, Kehar/0000-0002-2580-7447; Dey, Madan/0000-0001-5273-2789",Southern Regional Aquaculture Center (SRAC),Southern Regional Aquaculture Center (SRAC),The authors gratefully acknowledge the access to ACNielsen's proprietary and confidential 'Scantrack' data sets through financial support provided by the Southern Regional Aquaculture Center (SRAC).,,43,20,20,2,16,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

The arguments used against free trade are often presented as legal ones, as the recent experience with several agreements negotiated by the European Union (such as the CETA and the TTIP) shows. Against that background, doubts as to the prosperous future of the European Union's trade policy seem legitimate, notwithstanding the fact that the European Union is currently negotiating around twenty trade agreements with different countries or groups of countries. This article is meant to provide a few thoughts on the future of EU trade policy. In particular, the following questions will be addressed: should the European Union, at this point in time, continue to pursue a free trade agenda? If so, does the European Union have the means to do that effectively? The authors explain that the pursuit of a free (and fair) trade agenda is part of the Union's DNA.

However, the process of regulatory approval and the establishment of reimbursement decisions varies across countries. This study aims to analyze the duration between regulatory approval and reimbursement decision for new drugs and to evaluate various factors affecting the timely availability of new medicines in the Korean market. The duration was subdivided into regulatory approval-reimbursement application and reimbursement application-reimbursement decision. We used pharmaceutical approval data to identify new medicines, retrieved documents from the pharmaceutical benefits committee to collect information on reimbursement decision, and applied a non-parametric event history model. Results: A total of 128 new medicines applied for reimbursement decision, including 85 drugs between 2007 and 2013 and 43 drugs between 2014 and 2016. Delays in access to new medicines occurred at various levels, and various factors affected in different durations. In proportional hazard model, the second period shortened all durations in the models. Biologics and clinically improved drugs were the factor that delayed the duration of regulatory approval-reimbursement application, while uncertain drugs in clinical effectiveness and ATC J or L delayed the duration of reimbursement application-reimbursement decision. Conclusions: The duration between regulatory approval and reimbursement decision has decreased, and the main cause of the delay has changed. For instance, the proportion of reimbursement trial-reimbursement decision in the total duration was 62.9% (18.39 months out of 29.24 months) in the first period, while the proportion of regulatory approval-reimbursement trial in the total duration was 64.2% (8.6 months out of 13.40 months) in the second period. A series of policies to reinforce access to medicines after 2014 has been effective for the timely availability of new medicines, including both prompt reimbursement application decided by manufacturers and timely review process by the authorities.","[Son, Kyung-Bok] Ewha Womans Univ, Coll Pharm, 52Ewhayeodae Gil, Seoul 03760, South Korea",Ewha Womans University,"Son, KB (通讯作者)，Ewha Womans Univ, Coll Pharm, 52Ewhayeodae Gil, Seoul 03760, South Korea.",sonkyungbok@gmail.com,"Son, Kyung-Bok/AFZ-7226-2022","Son, Kyung-Bok/0000-0002-6343-5808",,,,,28,8,8,0,4,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

Our study investigates the socio-economic performance of a community-based initiative that uses cooperative-driven organic certification of honey producers in Mwingi, Eastern Kenya, to improve livelihoods and acacia woodland management. Data were collected through a household survey of 303 beekeepers from 38 organic certified and 16 non-certified beekeeper groups. More data were collected using key informant interviews, informal conversations, participant observation, participatory rural appraisal, internal document reviews and secondary sources. The survey included questions regarding beekeepers' livelihood activities, organisation involvement, quantity of honey produced and sold, net honey income and welfare perceptions after certification (2015) and before certification (2008), retrospectively. The results showed minimal to no significant impacts of certification on households' incomes, honey quantity or sales prices, as the general development, though positive, followed that of the non-certified households. The lack of impacts stemmed from failure to monitor and technical backstopping of certified beekeepers, a poor cooperative management and mistrust among the members and Mwingi organic cooperative board. The board mainly bought honey from a non-certified middleman thereby undermining the Mwingi organic cooperative's values as well as their own potential niche market. On a positive note, the cooperative's honey market place, receiving customers from afar, has the potential to support the development of a niche organic market outlet. However, this requires reconnection of the cooperative to its members, trust rebuilding and transparent management of the cooperative. The study exemplifies a case of community-based livelihoods-conservation initiative which did not take local community capacity development and more general long-term project sustainability into consideration.","[Musinguzi, Peter; Bosselmann, Aske Skovmand; Pouliot, Marieve] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Musinguzi, Peter] Univ New England, Business Sch, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia",University of Copenhagen; University of New England,"Musinguzi, P (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.;Musinguzi, P (通讯作者)，Univ New England, Business Sch, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia.",ktp990@alumni.ku.dk,"Pouliot, Marieve/E-6245-2015; Bosselmann, Aske Skovmand/D-8965-2015","Pouliot, Marieve/0000-0002-0611-1743; Bosselmann, Aske Skovmand/0000-0001-7764-5630; Musinguzi (PhD), Peter/0000-0003-2182-8985",Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA) [13-02KU]; University of Copenhagen; PLAN DANMARK grant; Danida Fellowship Centre [A29104]; OTICON Fonden,Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA); University of Copenhagen; PLAN DANMARK grant; Danida Fellowship Centre; OTICON Fonden,"The study is part of the VALOR research project, financed by the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA) grant number 13-02KU.

We employed two indexes - the revealed comparative advantage (RCA) index and the revealed symmetric comparative advantage (RSCA) index - to ascertain the underlying comparative advantages between countries. Further, we used the trade balance index (TBI) to assess wood pulp's impacts on trade balance. Results showed that under the RCA index, all countries but China have comparative advantages. The RSCA indicated that the highest comparative advantages belong to Finland, Canada, and Sweden. Trade balance, assessed via the TBI index, found positive trade balances for Brazil, Finland, Canada, Sweden, and the USA. China has the greatest comparative disadvantage.

Implementing the European Union Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Voluntary Partnership Agreement in Ghana",FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,LEGALITY; TIMBER; SUSTAINABILITY; INDONESIA; MARKET; VPA,"In this paper, we challenge recent positive assessments made of the European Union Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Voluntary Partnership Agreements (VPAs), through a case study of their implementation in Ghana. We do this through a review of the rich literature on forest governance in Ghana and the results of 160 semi-structured interviews with relevant actors in the country. While we agree that the VPA has helped establish new fora for dialogue in the forest sector in Ghana, we argue that it has not fundamentally changed the existing forest governance regime. Specifically, the VPA implementation has not changed tree tenure and benefit sharing practices, and by extension, the forestry concession system that for over 8 decades has failed to secure forest sustainability and social equity. The changes introduced through the VPA implementation the Timber Legality Assurance System, updated forest management plans, and an artisanal milling strategy, largely represent technical fixes to deeply political processes that have long upheld unsustainable practices. Other changes such as enhanced enforcement of Social Responsibility Agreements and more transparent allocations of timber rights are improvements, but they do not fundamentally change the tenure and benefit sharing arrangement, which by any standard is inequitable. Our evidence particularly contradicts Overdevest and Zeitlin's (2016, 2018) depiction of the country's VPA experience as an emerging 'experimentalist' forest governance entailing substantive dialogue, recursive problem-solving, and policy learning. At the contrary, and paradoxically, we argue that the VPA implementation in Ghana serves to stabilize and reproduce the very forest governance regime that it set out to reform a process that is much less 'experimental', and much more business as usual.","[Hansen, Christian P.; Rutt, Rebecca] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Rutt, Rebecca] Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Acheampong, Emmanuel] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Silviculture & Forest Management, Kumasi, Ghana",University of Copenhagen; University of East Anglia; Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology,"Hansen, CP (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",cph@ifro.ku.dk,"Hansen, Christian P/D-8226-2015; Hansen, Christian Pilegaard/ABE-6060-2020","Rutt, Rebecca/0000-0002-9664-2782; Acheampong, Emmanuel/0000-0001-7419-1821",Europe and Global Challenges initiative of Riksbankens Jubileumsfond; Wellcome Trust; Volkswagen Stiftung,Europe and Global Challenges initiative of Riksbankens Jubileumsfond(Swedish Foundation for Humanities & Social Sciences); Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust); Volkswagen Stiftung(Volkswagen),"We are thankful to the comments provided by two anonymous reviewers.

By emphasizing the economic features of social innovation, social enterprises, as ventures with both social and economic goals, are frequently associated with social innovation, especially in the developed economies. As an EU member country, Slovenia needed to adjust its policies to the EU social innovation concepts. Bearing in mind the EU interpretation of social innovation and the significance of state policies for its development, our aim is to investigate the policy framework conditions for the development of forestry-based social innovation initiatives in Slovenia. We found out that the prevalent economic understanding of social innovation reflects in Slovenian policy documents by equating social innovation with social enterprise. In this sense, the view of social innovation as both growth engine and a way for solving societal problems translates into explicit statements on social innovation in cohesion policy documents and progresses by operationalization of social innovation through indicators solely on social enterprise. Within the regulatory framework on social entrepreneurship, social enterprise is defined strictly with respect to legal forms, activities, profit sharing and governance, imposing barriers to the registration and development. Similarly to cohesion policy, the Rural Development Programme embraces a market-oriented understanding of social innovation and focuses explicitly on social enterprise. Forest policy documents do not explicitly mention social innovation or social enterprise. This is reasonable for documents adopted before 2011 when social innovation and social enterprises became a part of the prevailing discourse in Slovenia. However, newly adopted forest policy documents also do not integrate either social innovation or social enterprise. As forestry-based social innovation initiatives cannot be officially recognized as such, there are two possible ways for them to develop. The first applies to market oriented, forestry-based social innovation initiatives that offer new products or services. Such initiatives can register as social enterprises and mobilize resources they can access within the social entrepreneurship regulatory framework and the Rural Development Programme measures explicitly addressing social enterprise. The second way addresses forestry-based social innovation initiatives that are not market-oriented. Those initiatives will have to navigate through policy framework conditions for resources available through the Rural Development Programme and forest policy instruments that target cooperation and networking.","[Rogelja, T.; Secco, L.] Univ Padua, Dept Land Environm Agr & Forestry TESAF, Via Univ 16, I-35020 Legnaro, PD, Italy; [Ludvig, A.; Weiss, G.] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, European Forest Inst Cent East Reg Off EFICEEC, Inst Forest Environm & Nat Resource Policy, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria","University of Padua; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Rogelja, T (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dept Land Environm Agr & Forestry TESAF, Via Univ 16, I-35020 Legnaro, PD, Italy.",todora.rogelja@phd.unipd.it; alice.ludvig@boku.ac.at; gerhard.weiss@boku.ac.at; laura.secco@unipd.it,"Secco, Laura/B-6304-2012; Ludvig, Alice/ABF-3048-2020; Rogelja, Todora/N-9394-2017","Ludvig, Alice/0000-0003-1323-2276; Rogelja, Todora/0000-0002-3439-2001; SECCO, LAURA/0000-0001-7533-7474","University of Padova; European Forest Institute, EFI Central-East European Regional Office (EFICEEC); University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences; Vienna Institute of Forest, Environmental and Natural Resource Policy; Horizon 2020 project Social Innovation in Marginalized Rural Areas (SIMRA) [677622]; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [677622] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme","University of Padova; European Forest Institute, EFI Central-East European Regional Office (EFICEEC); University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences; Vienna Institute of Forest, Environmental and Natural Resource Policy; Horizon 2020 project Social Innovation in Marginalized Rural Areas (SIMRA); H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme)","This study presents the first empirical step of the Ph.D. project titled Governance capacities of public actors for supporting social innovation initiatives in the forest-based sector conducted under the scholarship of the University of Padova.

To expand the forest area by establishing forest plantations has been proposed as a way out to satisfy current and future demands, as well as to mitigate expected increases in atmospheric carbon. Specialized scientists in forestry and tree biotechnology advocate that humanity should rely on biotechnological solutions, particularly GM tree plantations, to achieve sustainable and more productive forest plantations. During the last decade, significant advances have occurred in both molecular methodologies and basic understanding of biotechnological processes associated with timber production. However, important sectors of civil society have showed reticence, even open opposition, towards these eco-technological solutions. This article explores on the one hand the rationale of the academic sector in promoting biotechnological solutions to satisfy current demands of forest products and biofuels, and on the other, analyzes society's opposition towards these solutions. The academic sector needs to understand where the resistance towards the development and establishment of these highly innovative technologies stems. Scientists need to become better at framing the importance of scientific research to citizens, at eliciting public participation and fostering public dialogue about science.","[Herrera, Francisco F.] Venezuelan Inst Sci Res, Ctr Ecol, Apdo 20632, Caracas 1020A, Venezuela",Venezuelan Institute Science Research,"Herrera, FF (通讯作者)，Venezuelan Inst Sci Res, Ctr Ecol, Apdo 20632, Caracas 1020A, Venezuela.",herreraf@ivic.gob.ve,,,,,,,29,2,2,0,15,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,SEP,2018,94.0,,,,,,27,31,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.05.015,0.0,,,5,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GP0VG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440528900004,0

We extend the literature on financial literacy by examining its role in the purchase of energy consumer durables: a setting purported to suffer from sub-optimal levels of investment due to consumer mistakes. We augment a standard choice experiment for purchasing a hot water system with data on financial literacy. Financial literacy is an economically important and statistically significant determinant of investment in energy efficiency. This result is robust to incorporating individual discount rates and risk aversion, as well as standard controls such as income and education, indicating that financial literacy is not merely a proxy for standard demographic characteristics. Financial literacy also makes choices more consistent with standard consumer preferences and increases the probability that respondents select investments with the lowest lifetime discounted costs. The results establish low financial literacy as a mechanism driving low investment in energy efficiency. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

I find that the institutional context indeed shapes preferences. The results reveal, for instance, that state bodies reject increasing activation efforts in flexicurity countries but support it in dualizing countries. Moreover, in line with previous research, social democratic parties are found to cater to the interests of insiders by endorsing the expansion of traditional measures in dualizing countries, while focusing on outsiders' interests by preferring the expansion of activation in flexicurity countries.","[Fossati, Flavia] Univ Lausanne, Dept Social Policy, Batiment IDHEAP,Rue Mouline 28, CH-1015 Lausanne, VD, Switzerland",University of Lausanne,"Fossati, F (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, Dept Social Policy, Batiment IDHEAP,Rue Mouline 28, CH-1015 Lausanne, VD, Switzerland.",flavia.fossati@unil.ch,"Fossati, Flavia/N-3929-2017","Fossati, Flavia/0000-0002-9218-5422",NCCR Democracy 21 [11]; Swiss National Science Foundation,NCCR Democracy 21; Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"This research has been supported by the NCCR Democracy 21, Project 11, which is financed by the Swiss National Science Foundation.",,68,6,9,1,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Some HTA agencies accept a higher cost per QALY gained when treatment is aimed at prolonging survival for patients with a short expected remaining lifetime, a so-called end-of-life (EoL) premium. The objective of this study is to elicit the existence and size of an EoL premium in cancer. Data was collected from 509 individuals in the Swedish general population 20-80 years old using a web-based questionnaire. Preferences were elicited using subjective risk estimation and the contingent valuation (CV) method. A split-sample design was applied to test for order bias. The mean value of a QALY was MSEK4.8 (a,notsign528,000), and there was an EoL premium of 4-10% at 6 months of expected remaining lifetime. Using subjective risk resulted in more robust and valid estimates of the value of a QALY. Order of scenarios did not have a significant impact on the WTP and the result showed scale sensitivity. Our result provides some support for the use of an EoL premium based on individual preferences when expected remaining lifetime is short and below 24 months. Furthermore, we find support for a value of a QALY that is above the current threshold of several HTA agencies.","[Olofsson, S.; Gerdtham, U. -G.; Persson, U.] Swedish Inst Hlth Econ IHE, IHE Box 2127, S-22002 Lund, Sweden; [Olofsson, S.; Gerdtham, U. -G.] Lund Univ, Dept Clin Sci, Hlth Econ Unit, Malmo, Sweden; [Gerdtham, U. -G.; Persson, U.] Lund Univ, Inst Econ Res, Sch Econ & Management, Lund, Sweden; [Gerdtham, U. -G.] Lund Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Lund, Sweden; [Hultkrantz, L.] Orebro Univ, Sch Business, Orebro, Sweden",Lund University; Lund University; Lund University; Orebro University,"Olofsson, S (通讯作者)，Swedish Inst Hlth Econ IHE, IHE Box 2127, S-22002 Lund, Sweden.;Olofsson, S (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Clin Sci, Hlth Econ Unit, Malmo, Sweden.",so@ihe.se,"Gerdtham, Ulf-Goran/I-6766-2018","Gerdtham, Ulf-Goran/0000-0002-0647-7817",Janssen Pharmaceutica NV,Janssen Pharmaceutica NV(Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson USAJanssen Biotech Inc),Janssen Pharmaceutica NV funded the project through an unrestricted Grant to IHE.,,60,9,9,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The ruling marks the first-ever federal level regulation under the Clean Air Act that overrides state-level regulations and is directly imposed upon a single pollution source.

The article examines the fragmented nature of employment regulation and visa categories constraining worker agency which, combined with widening avenues for temporary migration, have contributed to the underpayment problem.

Despite this fact, they have also been criticised by policy makers for not being relevant to policy processes and assessment. This paper proposes a generic approach to enhance policy relevance in the development of exploratory scenarios. This is carried out by participatory exploration and categorisation of available policy responses and framing of scenarios in terms of challenges to these. An exploration of the factors that make these policies more or less effective is used to develop a narrative for temporal developments in scenario instantiation, in comparison to more generic drivers for change. Within this paper, this process is applied to a case-study exploring the future of natural disaster risk; improving understanding of future uncertainties and subsequently the effectiveness of long-term disaster risk reduction. The case-study application consider bushfire, earthquake, flooding and heatwaves and resulted in five scenarios framed on challenges to resilience and challenges to mitigation for policy makers in Adelaide, Australia.","[Riddell, Graeme A.; van Delden, Hedwig; Dandy, Graeme C.; Zecchin, Aaron C.; Maier, Holger R.] Univ Adelaide, Sch Civil Environm & Min Engn, North Terrace Campus, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Riddell, Graeme A.; van Delden, Hedwig] Res Inst Knowledge Syst, POB 463, NL-6211 NC Maastricht, Netherlands",University of Adelaide; Maastricht University; Maastricht University Medical Centre (MUMC),"Riddell, GA (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Sch Civil Environm & Min Engn, North Terrace Campus, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",graeme.riddell@adelaide.edu.au,"van Delden, Hedwig/B-4276-2010; Maier, Holger/B-9639-2008","Maier, Holger/0000-0002-0277-6887; van Delden, Hedwig/0000-0001-6976-4832; Riddell, Graeme/0000-0002-1592-5749; Zecchin, Aaron/0000-0001-8908-7023",Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre; Australian Postgraduate Research Award,"Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme); Australian Postgraduate Research Award","The authors thank Jeffrey Newman, Charles Newland and Ariella Helfgott, for their assistance in the facilitation of participatory activities, along with all the participants from the South Australian State Government who were involved in the process.

Addressing this challenge requires adjustments to forest management strategies as of now, but it is still unclear to what extent this is already in progress. Using data from surveys of 1131 forest owners and managers from seven European countries, we assessed how they perceive their role in adapting forest management to climate change. The surveys focused on foresters' observations of climate change impacts, the degree to which climate change is a part of their operational and strategic management, and their ability to address related risks and opportunities. We found evidence of a strong continent-wide climate change awareness among respondents, with 73% foresters convinced that climate change will impact their forest. However, only about one-third (36%) reported having modified their management practices, though figures vary widely between countries, from 14% in Portugal to 57% in Slovakia. Among the constraints limiting their actions, lack of knowledge and information emerged as a major barrier towards forest adaptation. Differences between countries could be linked to their socio-economic and political contexts. Our results further suggest that severely damaging events, such as windstorms, fires and pest outbreaks, present relevant opportunities to engage people with climate change and encourage action. Further work needs to be done in strengthening the relationship between scientific research and practice, working out context dependent measures to foster adaptation to changing climate and disturbance regimes in forest management.","[Sousa-Silva, Rita; Verbist, Bruno; Muys, Bart] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Div Forest Nat & Landscape, Celestijnenlaan 200E,Box 2411, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium; [Lomba, Angela] Univ Porto, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, CIBIO Inbio, Campus Agr Vairao,R Padre Armando Quintas 7, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal; [Valent, Peter] Tech Univ Zvolen, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest Management & Geodesy, Zvolen 96053, Slovakia; [Suskevics, Monika] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Agr & Environm Sci, Kreutzwaldi 5, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia; [Picard, Olivier] Ctr Natl Propriete Forestiere, 47 Rue Chaillot, F-75116 Paris, France; [Hoogstra-Klein, Marjanke A.] Wageningen Univ & Res, Forest & Nat Conservat Policy Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Cosofret, Vasile-Cosmin; Bouriaud, Laura] Univ Stefan Cel Mare Suceava, Univ Str 13, Suceava 720229, Romania; [Ponette, Quentin] Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Environm Sci, Croix Sud 2,Box L7-05-09, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Verheyen, Kris] Univ Ghent, Forest & Nat Lab, Geraardsbergsesteenweg 267, B-9090 Gontrode, Melle, Belgium; [Muys, Bart] European Forest Inst EFIMED, St Pau Hist Site,St Leopold Pavil, Barcelona 08025, Spain",KU Leuven; Universidade do Porto; Technical University Zvolen; Estonian University of Life Sciences; Wageningen University & Research; Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava; Universite Catholique Louvain; Ghent University,"Sousa-Silva, R; Muys, B (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Div Forest Nat & Landscape, Celestijnenlaan 200E,Box 2411, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium.",anarita.silva@kuleuven.be; bart.muys@kuleuven.be,"Muys, Bart/ABN-3906-2022; Cosofret, Cosmin/ABJ-2037-2022; Bouriaud, Laura/N-7156-2014; Lomba, Angela/L-7117-2013; Sousa-Silva, Rita/K-9520-2013; Suskevics, Monika/H-3666-2017; Verbist, Bruno/D-3767-2013","Muys, Bart/0000-0001-9421-527X; Cosofret, Cosmin/0000-0002-1858-349X; Bouriaud, Laura/0000-0002-3111-9261; Sousa-Silva, Rita/0000-0001-8640-6121; Suskevics, Monika/0000-0002-5666-2623; Verheyen, Kris/0000-0002-2067-9108; Hoogstra-Klein, Marjanke/0000-0001-8405-4345; Verbist, Bruno/0000-0001-5169-7176; Valent, Peter/0000-0001-7017-6640; Ponette, Quentin/0000-0002-2726-7392","BELSPO, project FORBID Climate (Belgium); FCT-Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [FARSYD-2011-2016-POCI.01-0145-FEDER-016664]; Romanian Agency UEFISCDI [PN-II-RU-TE-2011-3-0222]; FCT [SFRH/BPD/80747/2011]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BPD/80747/2011] Funding Source: FCT","BELSPO, project FORBID Climate (Belgium); FCT-Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Romanian Agency UEFISCDI(Consiliul National al Cercetarii Stiintifice (CNCS)Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii (UEFISCDI)); FCT(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))","The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions to improve the quality of the paper.

This article focuses on his last official role, as Chair of the World Bank Commission on Global Poverty. The report of the Commission - already referred to as the Atkinson Commission - proposes a new approach to measuring and monitoring the global poverty reduction targets established as part of the Sustainable Development Goals agreed by the United Nations in 2015. Atkinson developed the framework and provided the academic impetus to the work of the Commission and wrote much of its report, assisted by comments provided by an Advisory Board of eminent experts in the field and a smaller working group of selected members. The article describes some of the main features of the report's 21 recommendations, focusing on the measurement of poverty in both monetary and non-monetary dimensions and its attempt to draw together national and global efforts to measure and reduce poverty in all its forms. It concludes with a discussion of the implications of the new approach for Australia, which like many other developed countries has so far failed to engage actively with the debate over addressing extreme global poverty.

Both paradigms are important for environmental and resource economics as they capture the essence of real-world environmental and resource problems - the provision of pure public goods, and overextraction of common pool resources. This paper aims to understand why rewards are effective in one paradigm and not in the other. We hypothesize that this is because of an important difference between the two; the marginal per capita return is uncertain in the Common Pool Resource game because subjects can undo cooperative actions of others. This is just one of many differences between the two paradigms and hence we test our Hypothesis by introducing the option to reward in the Claim game, a game identical to the standard public good game except that it allows for both giving and taking. This feature causes the marginal per capita return to be uncertain. We find that while rewards are effective in sustaining cooperation in the Public Good game, they are much less effective in the Claim game. We identify the underlying mechanism causing this differential impact. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

A portion of these reductions are based on expected sequestration and storage contributions from land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF). Significant uncertainty exists in future forest markets and thus the potential LULUCF contribution to US GHG reduction goals. This study seeks to inform the discussion by modeling US forest GHG accounts per different simulated demand scenarios across a grid of over 130,000 USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) forestland plots over the conterminous United States. This spatially disaggregated future supply is based on empirical yield functions for log volume, biomass and carbon. Demand data is based on a spatial database of over 2300 forest product manufacturing facilities representing 11 intermediate and 13 final solid and pulpwood products. Transportation costs are derived from fuel prices and the locations of FIA plot from which a log is harvested and mill or port destination. Trade between mills in intermediate products such as sawmill residues or planer shavings is also captured within the model formulation. The resulting partial spatial equilibrium model of the US forest sector is solved annually for the period 2015-2035 with demand shifted by energy prices and macroeconomic indicators from the US EIA's Annual Energy Outlook for a Reference, Low Economic Growth, and High Economic Growth case. For each macroeconomic scenario simulated, figures showing historic and scenario-specific live tree camon emissions and sequestration are generated. Maps of the spatial allocation of both forest harvesting and related carbon fluxes are presented at the National level and detail is given for both regions and ownerships.","[Latta, Gregory S.] Univ Idaho, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Baker, Justin S.] RTI Int, Raleigh, NC USA; [Ohrel, Sara] US Environm Protect Agcy, Washington, DC USA",Idaho; University of Idaho; Research Triangle Institute; United States Environmental Protection Agency,"Latta, GS (通讯作者)，Univ Idaho, Moscow, ID 83843 USA.",greg.latta@oregonstate.edu,,"Baker, Justin/0000-0002-9914-8421",Intramural EPA [EPA999999] Funding Source: Medline,Intramural EPA,,,31,26,27,2,33,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,FEB,2018,87.0,,,,,,35,48,,10.1016/j.forpol.2017.10.003,0.0,,,14,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,FU1WK,32280299.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000423640000004,0

We find that dual-class firms underperform prior to their initial public offering (IPO) and then improve and have better operating performance than single-class firms in the second year after IPO. We find that dual-class firms also have better market performance than single-class firms beginning in the initial year, which is contrary to the finding in most other studies.

The results show that the Nordic-Baltic markets respond to price innovations from the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany in diverse ways in the period 2001-2013. Response patterns for Finland, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, and Denmark are more significant to market innovations from the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, and less significant to those from Germany. German influence is more significant over Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia than the rest of the advanced markets. While the dynamics of the Nordic-Baltic markets exhibit a dominance of own price innovation, the influence of the United States is stronger than that of France, the United Kingdom, and Germany. These results imply that investors from the Nordic States may derive greater benefits by diversifying into Germany and vice versa, rather than diversifying into the United States, the United Kingdom, or France.

Studies of wage determination with worker and firm fixed effects typically find that firm-specific premiums explain 20% of overall wage variation. To interpret these findings, we develop a model of wage setting in which workers have idiosyncratic tastes for different workplaces.

Corporate Social Responsibility represents the voluntary commitment of the organization to consider in its decision-making process and daily activities the needs of the customers, clients, suppliers, employees and the citizens living on the site where it operates. Socially responsible business means voluntary monitoring and respects social and environmental aspects in everyday economic activities as well as relations with cooperating and supporting bodies. Foreign definitions emphasize the continuous commitment of organizations to behave ethically and to contribute to economic growth, while promoting the improvement of the quality of life of employees and their families, as well as local communities and companies.

The particular organization of these programs has consequences for public health, social justice, and ecological sustainability. This contribution draws on political economy, critical food studies, and feminist economics to analyze the US National School Lunch Program, one of the world's oldest and largest government-sponsored school lunch programs. It makes visible the social and environmental costs of the heat-and-serve economy, where widely used metrics consider only the speed and volume of service as productive work. This study demonstrates that such a narrow understanding of the labor of lunch devalues care and undercuts the potential for school food provisioning to promote ecological and feminist goals.

This article shows that some recent patient-preference studies attribute value to surrogate endpoints even when there is no improvement in patient-relevant outcomes.

The consumption is the main factor of the Gross Domestic Product. Previous studies focused on the economic convergence - a few researchers analyzed consumption convergence. This paper is based on previous studies on consumption convergence. The primary aim of the study is to verify hypothesis about the occurrence of the convergence process in households' final consumption expenditures across EU countries. The second aim is to verify whether whether the sustainable consumption significantly influences the researched process. The sustainable consumption is one of the several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) defined in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. However, some EU countries that want to align the level of consumption expenditures do not pay attention at sustainability. It depends among others on the consumerism idea. In the analysis, the level of the households' final consumption expenditures per capita is applied as the consumption. The sustainable consumption process is calculated using Hellwig's taxonomic measure of development (TMD), based on four diagnostic variables: final energy consumption, energy productivity, share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption, resource productivity and domestic material consumption (DMC). To verify spatial dependencies in considered processes the spatial autocorrelation is tested. Consumption convergence process is verified with absolute and conditional beta-convergence approach. In the first place, beta-convergence panel data models are estimated and verified. Then, models are supplemented with a spatial factor - the dependence on the neighborhood countries. The spatial autoregressive and spatial error beta-convergence panel data models are used. In the investigation of the conditional convergence the following indicators are added: the sustainable consumption and the period of financial crisis. The financial crisis slowed down the consumption convergence process in EU countries. As a result of the study, the sustainable consumption does not have a significant influence on the convergence process.","[Jankiewicz, Mateusz] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Gagarina 11, PL-87100 Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Jankiewicz, M (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Gagarina 11, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.",mateuszj@doktorant.umk.pl,"Jankiewicz, Mateusz MJ/C-6657-2019","Jankiewicz, Mateusz MJ/0000-0002-4713-778X",,,,,26,9,9,0,2,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,142,154,,,,,,13,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200013,0

Results demonstrate that salmon aquaculture is undertaken with considerable underlying levels of economic risk, expansion offshore probably represents the lowest initial capital investment and greatest economic return, and that levels of financial uncertainty increase with land-based RAS production.

This is mainly due to the fact that the ongoing process of urbanization of the world, although it is a symbol of social evolution, raises numerous challenges related to intensive energy consumption, overloaded transport networks, water and air pollution, waste and a drop in the quality of life. The implementation of new technologies is currently perceived as a key factor in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, pollution or improving the efficiency of cities. These technologies must be smart, slim, integrated, cost-effective. They should play an important role not only in the field of environmental sustainability but also with regard to the well-being of citizens and financial stability. One of the key areas shaping smart cities, where contemporary technologies should be implemented, is transport. The effective transport operates in well-developed areas. This is one of the aspects of the functioning of urban areas, which is also an element and condition for economic growth.","[Kornec, Radoslaw] Siedlce Univ Nat Sci & Humanities, Zytnia 17-19 St, PL-08110 Siedlce, Poland; [Wereda, Wioletta] Mil Univ Technol Warsaw, Sylwestra Kaliskiego 2, PL-01476 Warsaw, Poland",Military University of Technology in Warsaw,"Wereda, W (通讯作者)，Mil Univ Technol Warsaw, Sylwestra Kaliskiego 2, PL-01476 Warsaw, Poland.",weredawioletta@tlen.pl,"Wereda, Wioletta/ABC-1459-2020; Wereda, Wioletta S/S-4342-2018; Kornec, Radoslaw/R-1901-2017","Wereda, Wioletta/0000-0002-6948-0239;",,,,,33,0,0,0,2,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,1186,1200,,,,,,15,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200101,0

Of the original 17 retail products examined only 8 cointegrate with export prices. Of these, all but one reject a null of full price transmission and all show price causality from export to retail level.

Results emphasize that administration subsector has a major contribution in achieving public sector performance. The results indicate that EU old countries have the best competitive potential for prospectively furthering sustainable development. Only four EU states register a discordant behavior.

At the WTO, the UK stance will require amending the current EU lists of concessions in a way that may lead to a broad renegotiation process. At the bilateral level, the status of current EU agreements regarding the UK and third countries is uncertain, as these agreements may no longer apply to the UK. Further, agreements on goods, such the customs union with Turkey, will no longer be valid for the UK. Least developed countries (LL)Cs) and developing countries who benefit from the EU Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) will continue under this regime, but that framework will no longer be applicable to the UK. In all cases, third countries who consider that Brexit has diminished the value of their commitments may request compensation or changes in the text of the agreements, or ultimately terminate the agreement.

The paper main objective is to demonstrate the necessity and the possibility of the new type of the company management stakeholders based management - instead of the classical management based on shareholder - manager - executant relationships. In order to achieve this objective, the study is structured in three main parts. The first part contains the demonstration of the necessity of the stakeholders based management, in the present period, using three categories of arguments - organizational, managerial and societal. Among the managerial arguments we mention: awareness of the existence of a comprehensive network of the stakeholders inside and outside organization; management of organization is based on the absolute primacy of the owner/ or shareholders' interests; potential of a large part of the companies endogen stakeholders (executants, managers) is used only to a small extent; traditional managerial relationship, manager-subordinate is not performing enough in the majority of the organizations; potential of the most part of companies exogenous stakeholders (clients, suppliers, investors, etc.) is frequently ignored or used only to a small degree; conceptualization, based on the stakeholders theory, of the firm as a multipurpose entity. The second part of the paper deals with the possibility to focus the management on the endogen and exogenous stakeholders. In order to demonstrate this, 26 arguments are structured on three levels - organizational, managerial and societal. The final conclusion of the study is that the organization stakeholders based management could and should represents the new type of the management in the company. This means new managerial strategy, system, mechanism, processes, culture and performance. Stakeholders based management is able to deal and solve much better and competitively the complex problems faced by companies during the transition to the knowledge-based economy and society, under the comprehensive impact of the present digital revolution.","[Nicolescu, Ovidiu] Romanian Sci Management Soc, 41 Dacia Ave, Bucharest 010404, Romania; [Nicolescu, Ciprian] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 2-10 Caderea Bastiliei St, Bucharest 010374, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Nicolescu, O (通讯作者)，Romanian Sci Management Soc, 41 Dacia Ave, Bucharest 010404, Romania.",inst.manager@gmail.com; ciprian.nicolescu@gmail.com,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,319,331,,,,,,13,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200029,0

In order to identify countries with reverence of development of their renewable energy sector statistical clustering methods are applied. The relations between renewable and non-renewable electricity consumption and economic growth are investigated within the panel VAR framework. The results reveal that the level of development of the renewable energy sector is crucial for linkages between electricity consumption and economic growth. In a group of countries with a relatively high level of development of the renewable energy sector, renewable electricity consumption and economic growth are mutually dependent. Additionally, the increase in economic growth leads to a short-term increase in renewable electricity consumption. At the same time, the rise in renewable electricity consumption is helpful in increasing economic activity. In the remaining countries renewable electricity consumption and economic growth are independent.","[Papiez, Monika; Smiech, Slawomir; Frodyma, Katarzyna] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Stat, Rakowicka 27 St, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Papiez, M (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Stat, Rakowicka 27 St, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",papiezm@uek.krakow.pl; smiechs@uek.krakow.pl; frodymak@uek.krakow.pl,"Papież, Monika/I-3257-2018; Frodyma, Katarzyna/I-4596-2018; Śmiech, Sławomir/I-3253-2018","Papież, Monika/0000-0003-3597-2080;","National Science Centre (NCN), Poland [2015/17/B/HS4/02685]","National Science Centre (NCN), Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)","This paper was supported by funds from the National Science Centre (NCN), Poland through grant No 2015/17/B/HS4/02685.",,17,0,0,3,7,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",2545-1227,,978-83-65907-20-2,SOC ECON MODEL FOREC,,,2018,1.0,,,,,,355,364,,10.14659/SEMF.2018.01.36,0.0,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BQ1LQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000576774700036,0

This research resulted in useful implications for marketing management of hotel businesses and tourist boards in order to contribute to improving the quality of the tourist offer and thus respond to the challenges imposed by modern tourism. Management of hotel businesses and tourist boards should primarily collaborate regarding strategic marketing planning of tourist destinations.

Therefore, companies cannot exempt themselves from integrating environmental and social factors into their activities. It is no longer sufficient that only large companies, obliged by their own countries' legislation on EU guidelines, adapt to the presentation of non-financial reporting; SMEs must also start to highlight good practices in the area of sustainability. In fact, Directive 2014/95/EU suggests that companies not subject to the obligation submit a voluntary non financial declaration on the areas indicated by providing simplified forms for SMEs. An exemption from the checks on the correctness of the non-financial statement is envisaged for such companies. In many cases, sustainability is inherent in SMEs, as they have a close link with the territory and the environment in which they operate, as well as with customers and suppliers. It is necessary to highlight their activities and to report them under the aspect of shared value with all stakeholders. Furthermore, SMEs can contribute to the SDGs 2030, as they are the backbone of national economies and the global supply chains of large companies. SMEs represent 99% of all companies, and if they have a limited environmental and social impact individually, they have a much larger impact as a group. The SDGs can be a strategic line of conduct to innovate products and create new business and at the same time bring out the most innovative and characterizing aspects of integration of sustainability by companies in connection with the 2030 sustainability objectives. With Key Performance Indicators (KPI) and sustainability performance, we can monitor the progress of the business process from both a quantitative and a qualitative point of view, thus discovering how an SME works in terms of accountability, sustainability and reporting back what is done to all stakeholders with legitimate interests. After an analysis of the literature to support integrating sustainability into SME business strategy, we will analyze two companies' approaches to sustainability through a case study of their different characteristics and choices in relation to the EU directive.","[Querci, Elena] Insubria Univ, 71Via Monte Generoso, Varese, Italy",University of Insubria,"Querci, E (通讯作者)，Insubria Univ, 71Via Monte Generoso, Varese, Italy.",elena.querci@unisubria.it,,,,,,,27,0,0,3,19,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,1008,1017,,,,,,10,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200086,0

This paper deals with the analysis of the wood consumption from point of view wood production, export and import wood, the market development of this commodities and influence of bio-economy. Policy harmonization still needs to allow room for each country situation in terms of wood availability and utilization. The emphasis in industries using wood-based biomass as raw material is moving toward the green economy. New opportunities are arising to versatile use of wood biomass and side streams. Renewal of the wood products is based on knowledge that is created by research, development and innovation processes.

However, in a long period of time, the economic development of China depends to a large extent on the market of some developed countries in the world, which leads to the unbalanced trade structure, frequent trade frictions, and serious impact on the production of related industries. The occurrence of face problems and the outbreak of the world economic crisis will have serious adverse effects on the economic development of our country. In this case, our government resolutely adopts the policy of expanding domestic demand. In the process of expanding domestic demand, it is found that the imbalance between urban and rural consumption and the flow industry is rather serious. Therefore, it is of great practical significance to explore the strategy of promoting the coordinated development of urban and rural regional economic circulation in China. Firstly, this paper analyzes the current situation of the development of the regional economic circulation industry in urban and rural areas in China, and then points out its existing problems, and finally puts forward some countermeasures and suggestions.","[Teng, Su] Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Reg Dev & Reform Commis, Nanning 530022, Guangxi, Peoples R China",,"Teng, S (通讯作者)，Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Reg Dev & Reform Commis, Nanning 530022, Guangxi, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,1,FRANCIS ACAD PRESS,LONDON,"35 IVOR PL, LOWER GROUND, LONDON, NW1 6EA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-912407-98-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,49,52,,,,,,4,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BL4ID,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450418800010,0

It has become a literary theme with a unique national cultural color in the history of Chinese literature. The poet framed the love story of the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl, and the firm and persistent love story was constructed through words. Especially in the Han and Wei Six Dynasties, the social turmoil and the war were frequent. The literary works of this period were mainly full with pain, sadness and jealousy. The tragic story of the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl in the legend of Qixi is also the projection of the author's own experience and sigh. Therefore, under his own emotional control, the writer has created a seven-day literary work with rich connotations and beautiful charm. The paper mainly discusses the cultural connotation of Zhongqixi in the Han, Wei and Six Dynasties, and interprets the text through the image analysis of Qixi literature.","[Zhang, Ruifang] Weinan Normal Univ, Coll Humanities, Weinan 714099, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ruifang] Southeast Univ, Sch Arts, Nanjing 210096, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Weinan Normal University; Southeast University - China,"Zhang, RF (通讯作者)，Weinan Normal Univ, Coll Humanities, Weinan 714099, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.;Zhang, RF (通讯作者)，Southeast Univ, Sch Arts, Nanjing 210096, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",,"zhang, rui/HZI-0079-2023; Zhang, Rui/GXN-3801-2022",,,,,,7,0,0,0,2,FRANCIS ACAD PRESS,LONDON,"35 IVOR PL, LOWER GROUND, LONDON, NW1 6EA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-912407-98-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,313,316,,,,,,4,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BL4ID,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450418800070,0

The relationship between other social factors is also ambiguous. In the current study, the relationship between socio-economic indicators reported by the National Bureau of Statistics of the People's Republic of China and moral motivation revealed from online social networking, Sina Weibo was constructed. Using data from the whole year of 2013 Sina Weibo microblogs, we found that the poor and rich areas were more willing to behave immorally, and the relation between GDP and collective moral motivation was curved. Also, normal people were less ethical when prices increased than when incomes decreased. Ecological construction and the value added by industries which used more farmers and off-farm workers were both correlated with morality. We also found a dark side to science and technological innovation, which harmed collective morality when areas grew richer. But all the results we found were correlational, more casual lab experiments were needed in future research.","[Zhang, Yu] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Marxism, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yu, Feng] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Inst Social Psychol, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University; Xi'an Jiaotong University,"Yu, F (通讯作者)，Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Inst Social Psychol, Psychol, Xian 710049, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",yufengx@xjtu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71501105]; Beijing Social Science Fund [15ZXC020],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Social Science Fund,This research was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71501105) and Beijing Social Science Fund (Grant No. 15ZXC020).,,17,17,17,0,46,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

In case of illness, they are protected by international regulations stating that the employers must pay all expenses in relation to repatriation, but very little is known about the cost of these repatriations. The objective of this study was to estimate the financial burden of repatriations in case of illness. We applied a local approach, a micro-costing method, with an employer perspective using four case vignettes: I) Acute myocardial infarction (AMI), II) Malignant hypertension, III) Appendicitis and IV) Malaria. Direct cost data were derived from the Danish Maritime Authority while for indirect costs estimations were applied using the friction cost approach. The average total costs of repatriation varied for the four case vignettes; AMI (98,823 EUR), Malignant hypertension (47,597 EUR), Appendicitis (58,639 EUR) and Malaria (23,792 EUR) mainly due to large variations in the average direct costs which ranged between 9560 euro in the malaria case and 77,255 in the AMI case. Repatriating an ill seafarer is a costly operation and employers have a financial interest in promoting the health of seafarers by introducing or further strengthen cost-effective prevention programs and hereby reducing the number of repatriations.","[Faurby, Mads D.; Jensen, Olaf C.; Hjarnoe, Lulu; Andrioti, Despena] Univ Southern Denmark, Fac Hlth Sci, Inst Publ Hlth, Ctr Maritime Hlth & Soc, Niels Bohrs Vej 9, DK-6700 Esbjerg, Denmark; [Faurby, Mads D.] Faurby Consulting, Aebleparken 190,3rd Floor, DK-5270 Odense N, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark,"Faurby, MD (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Fac Hlth Sci, Inst Publ Hlth, Ctr Maritime Hlth & Soc, Niels Bohrs Vej 9, DK-6700 Esbjerg, Denmark.;Faurby, MD (通讯作者)，Faurby Consulting, Aebleparken 190,3rd Floor, DK-5270 Odense N, Denmark.",mfaurby@outlook.dk,"jensen, olaf c/N-4517-2017","Andrioti Bygvraa, Despoina/0000-0002-9355-3004",Danish Maritime Fund [2014-057],Danish Maritime Fund,This work was supported by the Danish Maritime Fund (grant number 2014-057).,,38,8,9,0,3,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

There are concerns, however, that this approach does not include local communities as important stakeholders of the decision-making process. Little regards are also given to environmental sustainability, which would ensure inter-generational equity. This paper develops options for addressing these issues, thereby greening the Concessionary Forestry Business Model in Africa. Firstly, socioeconomic, environmental and technological challenges facing concessionary forestry businesses are discussed by reference to country case studies. The paper then continues to provide the core elements of a greener Concessionary Forestry Business Model, with more emphasis on business infrastructure, value propositions, customer interfaces, and profit models. The paper concludes by examining the necessary policy tools that will promote the integration of eco-innovations into Africa's forestry sector.","[Atewamba, Calvin] United Nations Univ, Inst Nat Resources Africa, Accra, Ghana; [Boimah, Mavis] Univ Ghana, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Accra, Ghana",University of Ghana,"Atewamba, C (通讯作者)，United Nations Univ, Inst Nat Resources Africa, Accra, Ghana.",atewamba@gmail.com; nusinyoo@gmail.com,"Boimah, Mavis/AGY-8703-2022; Atewamba, Calvin/GWU-8149-2022; Boimah, Mavis/HTP-5692-2023","Atewamba, Calvin/0000-0001-7609-0397","United Nations University Institute for Natural Resources in Africa, Accra, Ghana","United Nations University Institute for Natural Resources in Africa, Accra, Ghana","The authors acknowledge the support of the United Nations University Institute for Natural Resources in Africa, Accra, Ghana.",,56,4,5,1,20,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,DEC,2017,85.0,,1,,,,46,51,,10.1016/j.forpol.2017.08.015,0.0,,,6,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,FR3SG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418986200005,0

We explain how some of the modeling strategies preferred by economists seem to be at odds with the complex test design, and provide clear advice on the types of robustness tests that are therefore needed when analyzing these datasets.

In particular, the previous literature has compared student effort under relative and absolute grading systems, but the results are mixed and the implications of the models have not been empirically tested. In this paper, I build a model where students maximize their utility by choosing effort. I investigate how student effort changes when there is a change in the grading system from absolute grading to relative grading. I use a unique dataset from college students in Chile who faced a change in the grading system to test the implications of my model. My model predicts that, for low levels of uncertainty, low-ability students exert less effort with absolute grading, and high-ability students exert more effort with absolute grading. The data confirm that there is a change in the distribution of effort.","[Paredes, Valentina] Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Chile,"Paredes, V (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Santiago, Chile.",vparedes@fen.uchile.cl,,"Paredes, Valentina/0000-0002-2089-3577","CEPPE, project Conicyt [CIE-01-4]; Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies [CONICYT/FONDAP/15130009]; Conicyt [PAI 7912010032]","CEPPE, project Conicyt; Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies; Conicyt(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT))","I would like to thank CEPPE, project CIE-01-4 Conicyt, for providing financial support.

This study involved an exploratory analysis of how current woody residue utilization as well as willingness to use, pay for, and haul additional logging residues varied among mills representing different primary forest products manufacturer types and different processing capacities. A four contact mail survey was sent in 2012 to 2138 mills in the southern United States. The study used nonparametric independent sample test and analysis of variances to make comparative and explanatory inferences. Approximately 70% of mills utilized woody residues for bioenergy purposes and 11% were willing to utilize additional logging residues to produce electricity. Mills were willing to pay US$11.58/green tonne (t) (2012 dollars) of logging residues at the mill gate. Mills already utilizing woody residues for bioenergy were more likely to improve their utilization, especially those with existing woody residue processing capacities of 1000 to 6000 t/month. Pulp, paper, and paperboard mills and composite wood product mills were the largest woody residues utilizers and were willing to increase use, pay more, and haul additional logging residues over longer distances. These results will be helpful in identifying mills most suitable for increasing utilization of woody residues, guiding investment decisions regarding retrofitting and constructing new facilities for production of bioenergy, and formulating future policies related to biomass-based energy production.","[Pokharel, Raju; Grala, Robert K.; Grebner, Donald L.] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Forestry, Box 9681, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA",Mississippi State University,"Pokharel, R (通讯作者)，Univ Idaho, Coll Nat Resources, Dept Nat Resources & Soc, 875 Perimeter Dr,MS 1142, Moscow, ID 83844 USA.",rp813@msstate.edu; r.grala@msstate.edu; dig26@msstate.edu,"Pokharel, Raju/F-3735-2015","Pokharel, Raju/0000-0002-2245-6661","Forest and Wildlife Research Center, Mississippi State University [FO467]; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture, McIntire-Stennis Project [1006988]; USDA Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service (CSREES); Special Grant for Wood Utilization Research; College of Forest Resources, Mississippi State University","Forest and Wildlife Research Center, Mississippi State University; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture, McIntire-Stennis Project; USDA Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service (CSREES)(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture); Special Grant for Wood Utilization Research; College of Forest Resources, Mississippi State University","This publication is a contribution of the Forest and Wildlife Research Center, Mississippi State University (FO467).

To capture the complex genetic architecture that underlies the bio-developmental pathways, behavioral traits and evoked environments associated with educational attainment, we construct polygenic scores (PGS) for respondents in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) that aggregate thousands of individual loci across the human genome and weight them by effect sizes derived from a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) of years of education. Our findings suggest veterans with below average PGSs for educational attainment may have completed fewer years of schooling than comparable non-veterans. On the other hand, we do not find any difference in the educational attainment of veterans and non-veterans with above average PGSs. Results indicate that public policies and exogenous environments may induce heterogeneous treatment effects by genetic disposition.","[Schmitz, Lauren L.] Univ Michigan, Survey Res Ctr, Inst Social Res, 426 Thompson St, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA; [Conley, Dalton] Princeton Univ, Dept Sociol, 153 Wallace Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Princeton University,"Schmitz, LL (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Survey Res Ctr, Inst Social Res, 426 Thompson St, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA.",lschmitz@umich.edu; dconley@princeton.edu,"Baltutyte, Gerda/AGH-5630-2022",,"Russell Sage Foundation [83-15-29]; National Institute on Aging NIA of the National Institutes of Health [T32 AG000221]; National Institute on Aging [NIA U01AG009740, RC2AG036495, RC4AG039029, 0925-0670]; NIH/NICHD [R01 HD060726]",Russell Sage Foundation; National Institute on Aging NIA of the National Institutes of Health; National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); NIH/NICHD(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),"This work was supported by the Russell Sage Foundation (Grant number 83-15-29) and by a National Institute on Aging NIA of the National Institutes of Health training grant to the Population Studies Center at the University of Michigan (T32 AG000221).

We simulate the effects of petrol and diesel fuel taxes and a diesel car tax, taking into account their interactions with the pre-existing petrol fuel tax and car sales taxes. At levels sufficient to reduce total fuel consumption by 7%, the increased diesel and petrol fuel taxes both yield deadweight losses (net of externalities) of about 4 (2010) Rs./L,. However, at levels sufficient to reduce total fuel consumption by 2%, the increased petrol fuel tax results in a deadweight loss per liter of fuel conserved that is greater than that caused by the diesel fuel tax. This reflects both the high pre-existing tax on petrol fuel and the high own-price elasticities of fuel demand in India. A tax on diesel cars that results in the same diesel market share as the large diesel fuel tax actually has a negative deadweight loss per liter of fuel conserved. The welfare effects of all three policy instruments are positive, once the external benefits of reducing fuel consumption are added to the excess burden of taxation.

The article examines the historical dynamics behind the construction of futures knowledge and futures expertise on the one hand, and current futures construction within design museum collections on the other. It tests strategic drivers and trends for the imagination and design of futures in the museum within the context of wider debates about the value of museums as sites of transdisciplinary practical learning. In this way the article also considers how cultural value is articulated through changing concepts of time and temporality embodied in material form. The final section examines the potential for social agency and activism within the design museum to foster critical reflection on the methods by which social institutions signal and shape directions of change. The article finds that in providing tools for the sharing as well as shaping of visions of the future, wider debates about the designed object in the museum have much to contribute to futures agency and literacy across disciplinary and professional boundaries.","[Kemp, Sandra] Imperial Coll London, Res Dept, Victoria & Albert Museum, London, England; [Kemp, Sandra] Imperial Coll London, Dept Mat, London, England",Imperial College London; Imperial College London,"Kemp, S (通讯作者)，Victoria & Albert Museum, Res Dept, Cromwell Rd, London SW7 2RL, England.",s.kemp@vam.ac.uk,,,V & A's The Future is Our Business project [AH/K005510/1]; AHRC [AH/N504567/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Arts and Humanities Research Council [AH/N504567/1] Funding Source: researchfish,V & A's The Future is Our Business project; AHRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)); Arts and Humanities Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),"I am also grateful to Tim Boon, Graeme Gooday, Keith Moore, Emily Hayes and Mat Paskins for their collaboration on Soirees; to Mary Ryan and the 2014-2017 MSc students in the Department of Materials at the Imperial College on the Nano Project; and to Karen Verschoren for research partnership on the V & A's The Future is Our Business project in 2013 (Project Reference Grant Number AH/K005510/1).",,159,9,9,4,25,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,NOV,2017,94.0,,,,SI,,59,75,,10.1016/j.futures.2017.04.002,0.0,,,17,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,FQ2UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418213300007,0

These approaches focus on covering a wide variety of scenarios and searching for robust strategies. However, they generally do not take the multiplicity of stakeholder perspectives into account in analytic terms, which could bring in diverse opinions and views, not only on possible futures but also on values and interests. In this study, we present an approach to incorporate stakeholder perspectives into model-based scenarios for exploring the future dynamics of the Dutch gas sector. The results demonstrate that the scenario space can be demarcated according to the perspectives. This allows for a systematic comparison of the perspectives and provides a basis for identification of robust strategies. Also, the analysis shows that incompatible elements between the model and perspectives, or within perspectives can be identified. This provides insights about the problem complexity and potential barriers to the futures envisioned by the perspectives. Future research can strengthen this approach by involving stakeholders in modelling and in the model-based representation of the perspective narratives to enhance learning and credibility, and can extend the analysis to identify (socially) robust policies.","[Eker, Sibel; van Daalen, Els; Thissen, Wil] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, POB 5015, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands; [Eker, Sibel] IIASA, Schlosspl 1, Laxenburg, Austria",Delft University of Technology; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA),"Eker, S (通讯作者)，Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, POB 5015, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands.",eker@iiasa.ac.at; c.vandaalen@tudelft.nl; w.a.h.thissen@tudelft.nl,"Eker, Sibel/HHS-4681-2022; Eker, Sibel/I-3780-2019","Eker, Sibel/0000-0003-2264-132X","Energy Delta Gas Research (EDGaR) program; Northern Netherlands Provinces; European Fund for Regional Development; Ministry of Economic Affairs, Agriculture and Innovation; Province of Groningen","Energy Delta Gas Research (EDGaR) program; Northern Netherlands Provinces; European Fund for Regional Development(European Union (EU)); Ministry of Economic Affairs, Agriculture and Innovation; Province of Groningen","This research has been financed by a grant of the Energy Delta Gas Research (EDGaR) program.

In the first stage model, we detected spatial dependence using the Lagrange-Multiplier Robust tests and found significant spatial correlations in house prices for each of five California counties. Our identification strategy relies on flexibly controlling for unobserved spatial effects by using the Spatial Lag Model (SAR) to get consistent estimates of urban tree cover. The SAR model solves the problem by establishing the spatial weight matrix to incorporate the neighboring house price. In the second stage, we then used market segmentation to identify the demand parameters by collecting data from five geographic markets, assuming that residents in each market share common preference structures. Consequently, the first-stage analysis provides evidence of positive effect of tree cover on home values, which is robust with different specifications. We further found that the estimated own price elasticity of demand for tree cover within each parcel was - 0.075, suggesting an inelastic demand curve.","[Mei, Yingdan] China Univ Petr, Sch Business & Adm, B1003 New Main Bldg,18 Fuxue Rd, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China; [Hite, Diane] Auburn Univ, Coll Agr, 208A Comer Hall, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Sohngen, Brent] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, 322 Agr Adm Bldg,2120 Fyffe Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",China University of Petroleum; Auburn University System; Auburn University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Mei, YD (通讯作者)，China Univ Petr, Sch Business & Adm, B1003 New Main Bldg,18 Fuxue Rd, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China.",mei.59@osu.edu; hitedia@auburn.edu; sohngen.1@osu.edu,,,,,,,34,24,25,2,14,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,OCT,2017,83.0,,,,,,29,35,,10.1016/j.forpol.2017.05.009,0.0,,,7,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,FK6JW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413611000004,0

Using economic theory and a microsimulation model, we predict how employers will respond to the Cadillac tax by adjusting wages and health insurance benefits. In its first year, 13.34 percent of individual and 16.73 percent of family employer-sponsored health insurance plan holders will be affected by the Cadillac tax; these percentages will increase to 35.33 and 42.01 percent, respectively, by 2025. Over 99 percent of those affected will reduce their health insurance benefits to the thresholds. Effectively, the Cadillac tax will impose a hard cap on health insurance benefits, causing a clustering of benefits at the thresholds and a sharp reduction in the variance of benefits. Revenue from the Cadillac tax through 2025 will total $204 billion, all but $42 million of which will stem from indirect revenues-health insurance benefits shifted into taxable wages. This shift will increase wage growth and decrease benefit growth for those affected by the Cadillac tax.

A common example is distance-decay analysis. Although distance-based models such as these are easily estimated, the ubiquity of this paradigm can lead to analyses that overlook other forms of analysis with equal or greater relevance. This paper develops an alternative approach to spatial heterogeneity in stated preference willingness to pay (WIP) based on the quantity or area of an affected resource surrounding each respondent at an optimized distance band or radius, with distance bands optimized using a grid-search algorithm that maximizes model likelihood. Methods and results are illustrated using a choice experiment on riparian land restoration in Maine, USA. The resulting quantity-within-distance model identifies systematic spatial patterns that are undetectable using distance-based analysis and directly relevant for welfare analysis.

Prior work indicates that children do worse in the year of a school move, but has been largely unsuccessful in isolating the causal effects of mobility. We use longitudinal data on students in New York City public elementary and middle schools to isolate the causal effects of school moves on student performance. We account for observed and time-invariant differences between movers and non-movers using rich data on student sociodemographic and education program characteristics and student fixed effects. To address the potential endogeneity of school moves arising from unobserved, time-varying factors, we use three sets of plausibly exogenous instruments for mobility: first-grade school grade span, grade span of zoned middle school, and building sale. We find that in the medium term, students making structural moves perform significantly worse in both English language arts (ELA) and math, whereas those making nonstructural moves experience a significant increase in ELA performance. In the short term, there is an additional negative effect for structural moves in ELA. These effects are meaningful in magnitude and results are robust to a variety of alternative specifications, instruments, and samples.","[Schwartz, Amy Ellen] Syracuse Univ, Maxwell Sch Citizenship & Publ Affairs, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Stiefel, Leanna] NYU, Robert Wagner Grad Sch Publ Serv, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Stiefel, Leanna] NYU, Inst Educ & Social Policy, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Cordes, Sarah A.] Temple Univ, Coll Educ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Syracuse University; New York University; New York University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Cordes, SA (通讯作者)，Temple Univ, Coll Educ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",amyschwartz@syr.edu; leanna.stiefel@nyu.edu; sarah.cordes@temple.edu,"Stiefel, Leanna/K-9392-2019","Cordes, Sarah/0000-0003-4355-0806",Spencer Foundation,Spencer Foundation,"We thank Elizabeth Debraggio for invaluable research assistance; seminar participants at Cornell University, University of Pennsylvania, Wagner School-New York University, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and APPAM and AEFP annual meetings for helpful advice; and the Spencer Foundation for support for this research.

It may affect the utilization of different services, but is yet to be well understood. Objective: This paper investigates the effects of reducing cost sharing for outpatient services on hospital admissions by exploring a subsidy policy for children's outpatient services in Japan. Methods: Data were extracted from the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination database for 2012 and 2013. A total of 366,566 inpatients from 1390 municipalities were identified. The impact of expanding outpatient care subsidy on the volume of inpatient care for 1390 Japanese municipalities was investigated using the generalized linear model with fixed effects. Results: A decrease in cost sharing for outpatient care has no significant effect on overall hospital admissions, although this effect varies by region. The subsidy reduces the number of overall admissions in low-income areas, but increases it in high-income areas. In addition, the results for admissions by type show that admissions for diagnosis increase particularly in high-income areas, but emergency admissions and ambulatory-care-sensitive-condition admissions decrease in low-income areas. Conclusions: These results suggest that outpatient and inpatient services are substitutes in low-income areas but complements in high-income ones. Although the subsidy for children's healthcare would increase medical costs, it would not improve the health status in high-income areas. Nevertheless, it could lead to some health improvements in low-income areas and, to some extent, offset costs by reducing admissions in these regions.","[Kato, Hirotaka] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Goto, Rei] Keio Univ, Grad Sch Business Adm, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan",Kyoto University; Keio University,"Kato, H (通讯作者)，Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.",kato.hirotaka.44u@st.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,"JSPS KAKENHI [15 J03333, 15 K03508]; Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan [H27-Policy-Strategic-011]; Actualize Energetic Life by Creating Brain Information Industries of ImPACT program of Cabinet Office, Government of Japan; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17H03589, 15J03333, 15K03508, 15H04793] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan(Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan); Actualize Energetic Life by Creating Brain Information Industries of ImPACT program of Cabinet Office, Government of Japan; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This research is funded by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers 15 J03333 and 15 K03508, and grants from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan (H27-Policy-Strategic-011), and Actualize Energetic Life by Creating Brain Information Industries of ImPACT program of Cabinet Office, Government of Japan.",,25,9,9,2,12,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

That the encounter of domestic and transnational groups of forest bureaucrats, tropical biologists, nature enthusiasts, eco-tourism entrepreneurs, activist anthropologists and grassroots leaders produced a participatory protected area, friendly towards indigenous peoples rights and forest-based economic development, can only be fully understood when looking at agency in its specific human-ecological context.

I investigate whether providing a $4,000 financial incentive to low-income students in their junior and senior years of college induces them to major in a STEM field. Using administrative data from Ohio public colleges, I exploit a discontinuity in income eligibility for the National SMART Grant on the pursuit of science majors.

The null findings are fairly precise, ruling out modest, policy relevant effects for students near the Pell Grant eligibility threshold.

I examine this question in the context of primary and secondary education in the Netherlands, where the per student budget for special needs students in regular schools is roughly twice the amount of the regular student budget. I use three independent identification approaches: student fixed effects models, school fixed effects models, and neighborhood variation. For both education levels and all three identification approaches, the estimates indicate that special needs students do not have a statistically significant effect on the academic achievement of their classmates. The estimates are precise enough to rule out even modest effects. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

With Iceland's economy experiencing a phase of economic recovery, an opportunity to pursue a longer-term analysis of the collapse has emerged. Using data from a nationally representative sample, fixed-effect estimations and mediation analyses were performed to explore the relationship between the Icelandic economic collapse in 2008 and the longer-term impact on hypertension and cardiovascular health. A sensitivity analysis was carried out with pooled logit models estimated as well as an alternative dependent variable. Our attrition analysis revealed that results for cardiovascular diseases were affected by attrition, but not results from estimations on the relationship between the economic crisis and hypertension. When compared to the boom year 2007, our results point to an increased probability of Icelandic women having hypertension in the year 2012, when the Icelandic economy had recovered substantially from the economic collapse in 2008. This represents a deviation from pre-crisis trends, thus suggesting a true economic-recovery impact on hypertension.","[Birgisdottir, Kristin Helga; Asgeirsdottir, Tinna Laufey] Univ Iceland, Fac Econ, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Jonsson, Stefan Hrafn] Univ Iceland, Fac Social & Human Sci, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland",University of Iceland; University of Iceland,"Birgisdóttir, KH (通讯作者)，Univ Iceland, Fac Econ, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland.",khb6@hi.is,"Jonsson, Stefan H/E-8191-2011; Ásgeirsdóttir, Tinna Laufey/ISA-3677-2023",,Icelandic Research Fund (IRF grant) [130611-052]; University of Iceland Eimskip Fund; Directorate of Health Iceland,Icelandic Research Fund (IRF grant); University of Iceland Eimskip Fund; Directorate of Health Iceland,The project was funded by the Icelandic Research Fund (IRF grant number 130611-052) and The University of Iceland Eimskip Fund.

This paper provides a review of results from empirical studies of alcohol policy interventions in five countries: Denmark, Finland, Hong Kong, Sweden, and Switzerland. Major policy changes were removal of quotas on travelers' tax-free imports and reductions in alcohol taxes. A total of 29 primary articles are reviewed, which contain 35 sets of results for alcohol consumption by various subpopulations and time periods. For each country, the review summarizes and examines: (1) history of tax/quota policy interventions and price changes; (2) graphical trends for alcohol consumption and liver disease mortality; and (3) empirical results for policy effects on alcohol consumption and drinking patterns. We also compare cross-country results for three select outcomes-binge drinking, alcohol consumption by youth and young adults, and heavy consumption by older adults. Overall, we find a lack of consistent results for consumption both within- and across-countries, with a general finding that alcohol tax interventions had selective, rather than broad, impacts on subpopulations and drinking patterns. Policy implications of these findings are discussed.","[Nelson, Jon P.] Penn State Univ, 609 Kern Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Nelson, JP (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, 609 Kern Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",jpn@psu.edu,,,"International Alliance for Responsible Drinking, Washington, DC","International Alliance for Responsible Drinking, Washington, DC","Research leading to this paper was supported in part by the International Alliance for Responsible Drinking, Washington, DC, a not-for-profit organization sponsored by major producers of alcohol beverages.

Many students expect humanities and technology to be substitutes rather than complements. This paper seeks to leverage this expectation by challenging students to instead consider humanities as itself a technology-indeed, a very powerful technology. Three examples of humanities as technology are discussed. First, as an extension of essay examination technology, instructors might ask students to prepare one-act plays that are situated in the context of the work students would most wish to engage upon graduation. Second, we might ask students to prepare term papers in which they discover principles of economics in poetry. Third, instructors might feature philosophical tracts such as Plato's Republic as a platform for discussing a number of economic concepts at both the principles and upper-division levels. These technologies arguably make learning economics more interesting and more permanent for students than would otherwise be the case.","[Wagner, Jeffrey] Rochester Inst Technol, Dept Econ, 92 Lomb Mem Dr, Rochester, NY 14623 USA",Rochester Institute of Technology,"Wagner, J (通讯作者)，Rochester Inst Technol, Dept Econ, 92 Lomb Mem Dr, Rochester, NY 14623 USA.",jeffrey.wagner@rit.edu,,,,,,,15,1,1,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1477-3880,2352-4421,,INT REV ECON EDUC,Int.

This paper adopts a pathways to sustainability approach to review Australia's forest governance models, which are strongly tenure-dependent, and generally vary between sub-national jurisdictions: only climate change-related pOlicies, which are in a state of considerable flux, apply to all forests. Consequently, pathways to sustainability are defined largely in terms of the dominant purpose of particular tenures, and are now little integrated across institutions, landscapes or tenures. Three decades of trialing devolved models of natural resource governance have effectively been abandoned, as have many of the initiatives intended to support development of a more diverse and more integrated 'forestry' sector. While the near-term prospects for sustainability of Australia's forests in anything more than the narrowest sense are poor, there are both knowledge-based and historical institutional foundations from which more substantive progress towards sustainability could be realized. This progress will need to be founded on approaches to policy development and implementation that recognize and accommodate the plurality of interests in forests, that enhance coordination and integration between institutions and across landscapes, and that empower and enable the diverse communities of interests in forests.

A major reason for the party's electoral loss in 2013 was arguably popular disappointment with its eschewal of social democratic principles. Notwithstanding some progressive measures initiated between 2008 and 2013, successive Australian Labor Party governments were constrained by neoliberal strictures, even when they chose to implement progressive policies. Whatever other reasons exist for its decline in popularity between 2007 and 2013, the Australian Labor Party's unwillingness or inability to mark out a clear alternative to neoliberalism was fundamental. In making this case, this article uses the conceptual framework of depoliticisation', defined as the displacement of policy decisions from the sphere of democratic accountability and public debate, making them matters for regulation by technocratic experts operating according to supposed edicts of the market.

Substantial economic evaluation of asthma cost requires knowledge of asthma severity, which is in general not part of claims data. Algorithms need to be defined to use this data source. The aim of this study was to systematically review the international literature to identify algorithms for the stratification of asthma patients according to disease severity based on available information in claims data. A systematic literature review was conducted in September 2015 using the DIMDI SmartSearch, a meta search engine including several databases with a national and international scope, e.g. BIOSIS, MEDLINE, and EMBASE. Claims data based studies that categorize asthma patients according to their disease severity were identified. The systematic research yielded 54 publications assessing asthma severity based on claims data. Thirty-nine studies used a standardized algorithm such as HEDIS, Leidy, the GINA based approach or CACQ. Sixteen publications applied a variety of different criteria for the severity categorisation such as asthma diagnoses, asthma-related drug prescriptions, emergency department visits, and hospitalisations. There is no best practice method for the categorisation of asthma severity with claims data. Rather, a combination of algorithms seems to be a pragmatic approach.

We develop several scenarios to illustrate the diversity of circumstances, health, and living situations for older adults in the future. We discuss possible negative outcomes resulting from the proliferation of technology, including increased social isolation and a widening digital divide. However, we focus primarily on envisioning desired situations wherein older adults have autonomy and independence; are easily able to manage their health and wellness needs; have rich and rewarding opportunities for social connectedness, personal growth, continued life purpose, and overall high quality of life. To attain this future, we must be acting now: designing the technology with involvement by today's older adults who represent the needs and capabilities of tomorrow's older adults; developing the necessary infrastructure to support widespread availability and deployment of these technologies; and supporting the integration of technology into people's lives at younger ages with adaptive functionality to support changing needs and preferences.

This article explores the links between changes to organisational and employment structures and shifts in worker attitudes, focusing on the implications of attitudinal shifts for the capacity for organised workplace resistance. It documents a loss of collective identity and a growth of individualism and social distrust. The analysis is based on publicly available economic and social statistics and the author's own qualitative and quantitative research, drawn in part from computer-aided interviews in de-industrialising Lower Silesia. Evidence is provided that the extent and intensity of attitudinal shifts have varied according to changed workplace structures, based on privatisation and organisational size, and especially on the accompanying changes in workplace culture and climate. Increased individualism, based on formal decollectivisation, has been accompanied by attitudinal individualism and distrust of other people and social institutions. As a result, declining capacity for workplace resistance and an increased sense of powerlessness have increased workers' susceptibility to right-wing propaganda.

We use two sets of data, daily realized volatility estimates taken from the Oxford Man RV library, running from the beginning of 2000 to October 2016, for the S&P500 and the FTSE, plus ten years of daily returns series for the New York Stock Exchange Index and the FTSE 100 index, from 3 January 2005 to 31 January 2015. Both data sets capture both the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the subsequent European Sovereign Debt Crisis (ESDC). The spillover index captures the transmission of volatility to and from markets, plus net spillovers. The key difference between the measures is that the spillover index captures an average of spillovers over a period, whilst volatility impulse responses (VIRF) have to be calibrated to conditional volatility estimated at a particular point in time. The VIRF provide information about the impact of independent shocks on volatility. In the latter analysis, we explore the impact of three different shocks, the onset of the GFC, which we date as 9 August 2007 (GFC1). It took a year for the financial crisis to come to a head, but it did so on 15 September 2008, (GFC2). The third shock is 9 May 2010. Our modelling includes leverage and asymmetric effects undertaken in the context of a multivariate GARCH model, which are then analysed using both BEKK and diagonal BEKK (DBEKK) models. A key result is that the impact of negative shocks is larger, in terms of the effects on variances and covariances, but shorter in duration, in this case a difference between three and six months.","[Allen, David E.] Univ Sydney, Sch Math & Stat, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Allen, David E.] Univ South Australia, Sch Business, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [McAleer, Michael] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Quantitat Finance, Hsinchu, Taiwan; [Powell, Robert; Singh, Abhay K.] Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Business & Law, Joondalup, Australia; [McAleer, Michael] Dhurakij Pundit Univ, Inst Social & Econ Sci, Bangkok, Thailand",University of Sydney; University of South Australia; National Tsing Hua University; Edith Cowan University,"McAleer, M (通讯作者)，Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Quantitat Finance, Hsinchu, Taiwan.;McAleer, M (通讯作者)，Dhurakij Pundit Univ, Inst Social & Econ Sci, Bangkok, Thailand.",michael.mcaleer@gmail.com,"Singh, Abhay/AAG-9813-2021; McAleer, Michael/K-8780-2019; McAleer, Michael/A-2407-2008; Allen, David/JTV-4098-2023; Allen, David/AAM-9744-2021",,"Australian Research Council; National Science Council, Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan","Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); National Science Council, Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan","For financial support, the first author wishes to thank the Australian Research Council and the second author wishes to acknowledge the Australian Research Council and the National Science Council, Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan.

Young people are among the least financially literate demographic groups. In this paper we present the results of a financial literacy survey conducted among high school students in Mexico City, the first effort to measure financial literacy among teenagers in Mexico. The survey is based upon the instruments developed by OECD and Lusardi and Mitchell's approach. Our results show low levels of financial literacy: 60% of the students surveyed understood the concept of inflation, 34.1% correctly answered the question about risk diversification, and only 31.7% correctly answered the question about compound interest. The OECD questions showed that less than 1 in 5 students understands basic financial concepts, around 57% get high scores on financial behavior, and about 70% have positive financial attitudes. We did not find generalized gender differences, though women score a bit higher on the OECD measure mostly due to a better financial behavior. We also did not find differences between private and public schools, or by household income. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The subject of this scientific research are the disadvantages of existing solutions of case law and legislative regulations and their possible improvements. The methods used during the preparation of this work are the most of basic methods of scientific knowledge, then statistical method and the method of content analysis. The issue of unpaid wages can be considered from several aspects - legal, moral, ethical and political, so, it is necessary to narrow it to the legal aspects, with particular attention to the impossibility of execution of court judgments that order the payment of salaries to employees. Research indicates that this subject is largely invisible, especially when it comes to employees in the private sector. Because of objective difficulties there is no record of how many employees managed to collect their earnings after the final judgment in their favor, neither the number of workers who remained unpaid, but they never launched a lawsuit against the employer. This invisibility significantly affects the indifference of the legislature and the judiciary to resolve this issue systemically. Experience shows that there is an objective problem of a serious nature, because many employees, despite they won their cases against their employers, they are punished by paying court costs, even though they failed to collect those costs and their salaries from the employers. It is therefore necessary to find solutions of this issue by changing the legislative framework, and thus jurisprudence.","[Bulatovic, Niksa] John Naisbitt Univ, Fac Law, Belgrade, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Bulatovic, N (通讯作者)，John Naisbitt Univ, Fac Law, Belgrade, Serbia.",bulatovicniksa@gmail.com,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,426,436,,,,,,11,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ2BZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418819000044,0

In the case of real ER depreciations, we find that the magnitude of the contractionary effect through balance sheets of firms with dollarized liabilities is significantly higher than the expansionary effect through trade competitiveness.

This study investigates whether information about working capital management is useful for financial analysts of Chinese firms. With a sample of listed companies from 2004 to 2014, we find that the efficiency of working capital management is positively associated with the number of analyst following and analyst forecast accuracy, and negatively associated with analyst forecast dispersion. Specifically, when the cash conversion cycle becomes longer, number of analyst following and the accuracy of their mean forecasts decrease, while the forecast dispersion increases. The findings of this study indicate a potential mechanism through which information about working capital management is incorporated in stock price in emerging markets such as China.","[Gao, Jie] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jiancai] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology; Beijing Institute of Technology,"Wang, JC (通讯作者)，Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",mswangjc@gmail.com,"wang, jian-cai/ABG-4612-2021",,,,,,27,4,8,1,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Statistica software is used for processing the data, namely advanced time series prediction methods, the ARIMA tool, and autocorrelation functions. First, the current stock development of CEZ, a. s., was graphically evaluated, and this was followed by a stock price prediction for the next 60 days in which the shares would be traded. Lastly, the prediction residues were analysed. It was confirmed that the calculation was done correctly, but with little accuracy.

It explores the impacts of market devices on sensory interactions between auctioneers and buyers that are essential to market transactions. Through ethnographic interviews and participant observations at Garak Market, Seoul, this study compares hand signal trading with electronic trading in agricultural produce auctions. It analyzes how the senses affect auction price estimation and formation, as well as their contribution to economic agency and social relationship among economic actors. The study then examines the impact of new market devices in electronic trading (e.g. trading screens, computer monitors, and wireless bidding terminals) on trading's sensory aspects of seeing or hearing. It argues that the devices change the modality of sensory interactions between auctioneers and buyers. This transforms power struggles, forming a looser but more equal relationship between auctioneers and buyers and decreasing the overall auction price in the market.","[Kim, Eun-Sung] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Sociol, 26 Kyungheedae Ro, Seoul 02447, South Korea",Kyung Hee University,"Kim, ES (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Sociol, 26 Kyungheedae Ro, Seoul 02447, South Korea.",eskim711@gmail.com,"Kim, Eun-sung/N-2807-2018; , 김은성/P-5612-2019",", 김은성/0000-0001-8567-524X",National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2015S1A5A8011106],National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea),This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea under [grant number NRF-2015S1A5A8011106].,,42,3,4,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

Examining the financial literacy of North Korean refugees and its changes over time after their settlement in a capitalistic society underscores the importance of institutional environments in developing financial literacy. We find that North Korean refugees, with very limited access to financial markets in their home country, are significantly less financially literate than native-born South Koreans. The gap is significant even after controlling for cognitive ability, which is also starkly different between the two groups. The financial literacy of the refugees increases over time during their settlement in South Korea, but the magnitude of such improvement is insubstantial. Our findings suggest that financial literacy is developed at the early life stages and cannot be easily modified at the later stages.","[Kim, Minjung] Seoul Natl Univ, BK Plus Res Grp Educ 21, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Minjung] Seoul Natl Univ, Res Program World Class Economists Leading Future, Seoul, South Korea; [Choi, Syngjoo; Lee, Jungmin] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU),"Kim, M (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, BK Plus Res Grp Educ 21, Seoul, South Korea.;Kim, M (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Res Program World Class Economists Leading Future, Seoul, South Korea.",dearmj@snu.ac.kr,"lee, jungmin/IXW-6580-2023","Choi, Syngjoo/0000-0003-4006-0377",National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2013S1A5A2A0304 4 461],National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government),This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2013S1A5A2A0304 4 461).,,59,7,7,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The 6-year mixed-integer-recursive programming model developed included traditional ponds, re-working existing ponds to make them more productive, converting traditional ponds to split ponds or adding additional aeration. Farm scenarios were developed that differed in the percentages of ponds that required reworking. The model selected primarily adoption of split ponds as the profit-maximizing strategy under current prices and unlimited availability of investment capital. Restricted availability of investment capital had a strong negative effect on those farms with greater percentages of older ponds that required re-working. Farmers that had reworked ponds more recently were able to invest the greater profits from the higher yields to transition more rapidly to new technologies. Larger farms could transition greater proportions of the farm to new technologies than could smaller farms. Higher feed prices and lower fish prices shifted the profit-maximization strategies from split ponds to intensively aerated systems and traditional single-batch systems. Results provide guidance to farms to make decisions related to the optimal investment pathway to transition farms to more productive and profitable technologies.","[Kumar, Ganesh] Thad Cochran Natl Warmwater Aquaculture Ctr, Delta Res & Extens Ctr, 127 Expt Stn Rd,POB 197, Stoneville, MS 38776 USA; [Engle, Carole] Engle Stone Aquat LLC, Strasburg, VA USA",,"Kumar, G (通讯作者)，Thad Cochran Natl Warmwater Aquaculture Ctr, Delta Res & Extens Ctr, 127 Expt Stn Rd,POB 197, Stoneville, MS 38776 USA.",gkk27@msstate.edu,"Karunakaran, Ganesh kumar/I-7881-2019","Karunakaran, Ganesh kumar/0000-0003-4765-5306","Southern Regional Aquaculture Center (SRAC) from the United States Department of Agriculture Cooperative States Research, Education, and Extension Services (USDA-CSREES) [2012-38500-19665]","Southern Regional Aquaculture Center (SRAC) from the United States Department of Agriculture Cooperative States Research, Education, and Extension Services (USDA-CSREES)","The authors would like to thank the Southern Regional Aquaculture Center (SRAC) Grant no. 2012-38500-19665 from the United States Department of Agriculture Cooperative States Research, Education, and Extension Services (USDA-CSREES) for funding this work.",,42,20,21,0,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

The empirical literature on the relationship between women's employment status and domestic violence is less clear-cut. Using quantitative data from Jordan in 2007, this study explores the effect of women's employment, as measured by their participation in paid work outside the home, on reported domestic violence, controlling for the potential endogeneity of women's employment, which might bias the relationship between employment and domestic violence. Without taking endogeneity into account, the regression results suggest that a woman's participation in paid work enhances violence by her husband. After controlling for endogeneity, these results turn out to be insignificant, which suggests that women's work status has no causal influence on marital violence. Differentiating between various types of domestic violence provides weak evidence that women's employment lowers sexual violence.","[Lenze, Jana; Klasen, Stephan] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Fac Econ Sci, Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Lenze, J (通讯作者)，Georg August Univ Gottingen, Fac Econ Sci, Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",jana.lenze@gmx.de; sklasen@gwdg.de,,,,,,,72,48,52,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

In doing so, we contribute to the theory of international environmental agreements, which has overwhelmingly assumed that governments make decisions based on a single set of public-interest motivations. Our results suggest that lobbying on emissions may affect the size of the stable coalition in counterintuitive ways. In particular, a powerful business lobby may increase the government's incentives to sign an agreement, by providing it with strong bargaining power with respect to that lobby at the emission stage. This would result in lower total emissions when the number of countries involved is not too large. We also show that things change radically when lobbying bears directly on the membership decisions, suggesting that both the object and timing of lobbying matter for the way in which membership decisions, emissions and welfare are affected.

However, respondents need to understand what they are valuing or they will make potentially wrong assumptions based on different experiences and frames of reference. Three-dimensional computer generated models or Virtual Environments (VE) have so far seen little use in economics research, probably due to the complexity and cost of developing and delivering them to study participants. The few studies that have used them find that VE are superior to static image presentations in helping people evaluate complex data. For this study we developed virtual environments for a choice experiment about coastal erosion management using free, easy-to-use software and Google Earth(C) satellite imagery and presented these to respondents as video tours. Our results indicate that the VE treatment reduced choice error, reduced left-right bias and improved respondent engagement and retention when compared with static images. There were also differences in WTP between the two groups. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Bulgaria, Romania, Finland and Sweden were subject to largest seasonal employment fluctuations whereas the United Kingdom, France and the Netherlands were least prone to such fluctuations. The largest seasonality was observed in construction and agriculture, forestry and fishing. The relationship between the seasonality of employment and the seasonality of the added value was varied depending on the section and the country. Generally results for construction and agriculture, forestry and fishing confirmed the positive link between employment and production.

The area of production of energy crops has reached 8 % of arable land in 2015 from 1.5 % in 2005.

Most textbooks, for example, ignore the ethical differences between Pareto efficiency (based on voluntary win-win outcomes) and the modern Kaldor-Hicks efficiency used in public policy assessments (in which winners gain more than losers lose). For the latter to be ethically palatable, society must have in place basic institutions of justice, transparency, and accountability. Normative economics thus requires a pluralist approach that includes considerations of virtue and duty, closer to Adam Smith's Enlightenment conceptions.

This paper presents a model for non-rival and excludable goods that aligns with the intuition conveyed in introductory microeconomics textbooks. The model enables students to develop a rigorous understanding of the theory of non-rival and excludable goods, and it includes an allocatively efficient outcome, a private outcome, and a second-best solution outcome to exhibit the relative prices, quantities, profits, and welfare results that emerge in different regulatory frameworks. A numerical exercise solidifies the concepts presented in the theoretical model. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Madhya Pradesh is the Second largest state by area and Sixth largest state by the population as per the Census 2011 of India. The main objective of the paper is to examine whether Tibetan sweater sellers are satisfied with the winter sweater selling business and to find out whether Tibetan sweater sellers want to shift to any other occupation. It also pays attention to livelihood patterns of the sweater traders. The other important objective is to identify the various challenges faced by the Tibetan Itinerant sweater traders as the economic stability of the Tibetan community in India depends on the success of itinerant sweater business which covers around 70% of the exile population in India (CTA). The data has been collected from the 14 different regions of Madhya Pradesh namely Ujjain, Indore, Gwalior, Sagar, Damoh, Katni, Satna, Rewa, Bhopal, Jabalpur, Seoni, Balaghat, Shahdol and Neemuch. Data analysis has been done through SPSS and MS Excel. The analysis reveals that Tibetan itinerant sweater traders are quite satisfied with the business but they don't want to continue with the same traditional business in the near future which raises the question whether those traders are prepared for the future or not. The analysis also shows that the weather plays a key role in their earning from the business but due to the global warming around the world, weather condition doesn't seem to be in favor of Tibetan winter sweater traders as it has been predicted that the weather will not be as cold as before in the coming years which can cause a serious damage in the winter sweater business. It also shows that a location for running the business is the major problem in every sweater selling region where the majority of the sweater traders are doing the business based on the experience alone. Most of them are illiterate and haven't received any business training. This lack of knowledge about the business is also reflected in the fact that not a single sweater seller has insurance on their stocks which will eventually make them vulnerable to potential losses and during unforeseen contingencies. Thus, it is utmost important to educate the sweater traders on running the business, adopting new techniques in doing the business and to make them aware of the current business issues so as to prepare them for the uncertain hindrances that are part of their business.","[Yeshi, Tenzin; Pradeep, Divya] Christ Univ, Bengaluru, India",Christ University,"Yeshi, T (通讯作者)，Christ Univ, Bengaluru, India.",,"Yeshi, Tenzin/ISA-8243-2023","Yeshi, Tenzin/0000-0003-0778-0575",,,,,9,0,0,0,0,"MASTERS INT CONSULTANCY RES PUBL, MIRDEC",KUCUKCEKMECE,"CINARLICESME SK, NO 21-13, KUCUKCEKMECE, ISTANBUL PK-34303, TURKEY",,,978-605-82290-3-7,,,,2017,,,,,,,75,92,,,,,,18,Area Studies; Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BJ5TI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426276100008,0

Many studies conclude that building and upgrading expressways increases pressure on cultivated land while others find expressways reduce the rate of cultivated land loss. In this paper, we use satellite remote sensing images of cultivated land in Shandong province of China to test whether the existence of expressway in 2005 affected the level of cultivated land in 2010 and the rate of change from 2005 to 2010. To account for expressway access for each of our 1 km(2) ('pixel') units of cultivated land we measure whether or not and what type of roads penetrate the 'watershed' in which the pixel lies. These watersheds allow more plausible measures of accessibility than those traditional 'crowfly' distance measures that ignore topography. To account for possible confounding we also use 24 additional covariates. Although simple univariate OLS regressions analysis show that cultivated land is always lower while cultivated land increasing rates are higher either when there is an expressway, these results are not robust. Controlling for all of the covariates and also using recently developed covariate matching techniques to estimate treatment effects, we find that expressway can most safely be described as putting a positive impact on cultivated land changes.","[Deng, Xiangzheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Deng, Xiangzheng; Jia, Siqi] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Deng, Xiangzheng; Gibson, John] Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Private Bag 3105, Hamilton, Waikato, New Zealand; [Jia, Siqi] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Fac Social Sci, Sha Tin 100053, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Waikato; Chinese University of Hong Kong","Deng, XZ (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Deng, XZ (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Deng, XZ (通讯作者)，Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Private Bag 3105, Hamilton, Waikato, New Zealand.",dengxz@igsnrr.ac.cn; jkgibson.waikato@gmail.com; jiasiqi@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Deng, Xiangzheng/N-1335-2018",,China National Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar [71225005]; National Natural Science Foundation [71533004]; National Natural Science Foundation of International/Regional Cooperation and Exchange Programs [71561137002],China National Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar; National Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Natural Science Foundation of International/Regional Cooperation and Exchange Programs,"This research was financially supported by the China National Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar (Grant No. 71225005), the Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation (Grant No. 71533004) and the National Natural Science Foundation of International/Regional Cooperation and Exchange Programs (Grant No. 71561137002).",,52,5,5,1,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

More importantly, limited effort is placed on the integrative effects of the BE and transportation policies. Using the data in Washington, D.C., this study applies a gradient boosting logit model to examine the influences of BE characteristics at both residential and workplace locations and commuting programs (transit/vanpooling subsidies and parking provision) on commute mode choice. We found that BE variables collectively contribute to 65% of the predicting power for mode choice. Although workplace BE variables are more important than residential BE elements, the difference is mainly due to distance to CBD (central business district). Furthermore, most variables show non-linear effects on car mode choice. There are also synergistic effects between BE variables and parking policy and between BE variables and transit/vanpooling subsidies. Therefore, land use policies will be more effective where supportive transportation policies exist.","[Ding, Chuan; Wang, Yunpeng] Beihang Univ, Sch Transportat Sci & Engn, Beijing Key Lab Cooperat Vehicle Infrastruct Syst, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Ding, Chuan; Cao, Xinyu; Wang, Yunpeng] Beihang Univ, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Big Data & Brain Comp, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Cao, Xinyu; Wang, Yunpeng] Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Humphrey Sch Publ Affairs, 301 19th Ave S, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",Beihang University; Beihang University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Cao, XY (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Humphrey Sch Publ Affairs, 301 19th Ave S, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",cao@umn.edu,"Cao, Jason/AAE-4374-2020; Ding, Chuan/P-5105-2016","Ding, Chuan/0000-0001-9560-8585; Cao, Xinyu/0000-0002-4403-9762","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71503018, 61773040, U1564212, U1664262, U1764265]; Young Elite Scientist Sponsorship Program by the China Association for Science and Technology [2017QNRC001]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Young Elite Scientist Sponsorship Program by the China Association for Science and Technology,"This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71503018, 61773040, U1564212, U1664262, and U1764265), and Young Elite Scientist Sponsorship Program by the China Association for Science and Technology (2017QNRC001).",,40,102,118,33,159,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

The estimations control for relative purchasing power parity of the source country and make use of a specific country dataset where domestic and foreign overnight stays are available over a longer period of time (Switzerland, 1934-2015). Results show that the income elasticity of foreign overnight stays peaks at approximately two in the early 1960s, drops to around one in the early 1980s and from then on remains stable until the end of the sample. Domestic income elasticity reaches its highest levels in the 1930s, then steadily falls towards one in the mid-1960s, and therefrom remains stable until 2015.

Building on the world polity literature, I hypothesize that opinions about Western actors affect opinions about the influence of NGOs because NGOs can act as vehicles for the diffusion of Western culture. Using Pew Research survey data, I find that the more unfavorable respondents' opinions are of the United States, the European Union, and the United Nations, the more likely they are to believe that NGOs have a bad influence on their country. While previous research finds evidence that a mechanism of guilt by association exists between opinions about states and opinions about IGOs (Johnson, The Review of International Organizations, 6, 57-84, 2011), this manuscript expands on these findings by investigating the relationship between opinions about states and opinions about NGOs. This research has important implications for NGO effectiveness because opinions about NGOs can affect the willingness of local populations to work with such organizations.","[Guarrieri, Thomas R.] Univ Missouri, Dept Polit Sci, Profess Bldg,909 Univ Ave, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Guarrieri, TR (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Dept Polit Sci, Profess Bldg,909 Univ Ave, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",tguarrieri@mizzou.edu,,,,,,,62,5,7,2,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

We analyze the effects of financial fragmentation on the monetary transmission mechanism through the traditional interest rate channel. To gauge the impact of changes in policy rates on the behavior of real variables such as aggregate output and employment we use a Smooth Transition VAR (VSTAR) model. Employing a nonlinear multivariate time series approach helps us capture the regime-dependent dynamics of the variables under study. The results obtained show that money market rates targeted by the central bank do not completely pass through to banks' lending rates to firms, particularly in a financially fragmented environment. This finding supports the hypothesis of an impairment of the monetary transmission mechanism as a result of financial fragmentation.

Secondly, the relationship between the scores of technical efficiency and farms size is analyzed. The results showed that the average of farms technical efficiency is about 85% which means there is a potential of production increase about 15%. This potential is higher for the medium size of farms. Therefore, the relationship between size of farms and technical efficiency is not linear but quadratic. Also, the results indicated that inefficiency of medium farms which represent 36% of the surveyed farms is mainly attributed to the region and farmers educational level.","[Rached, Zouhair; Khaldi, Raoudha] INRAT, Ariana, Tunisia; [Chebil, Ali] INRGREF, Ariana, Tunisia",Universite de Carthage; Universite de Carthage,"Rached, Z (通讯作者)，INRAT, Ariana, Tunisia.",rachedzouhair1@Gmail.com,,,,,,,17,2,2,0,3,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,DEC,2018,17.0,4,,,,,81,89,,10.30682/nm1804g,0.0,,,9,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,HJ8ZC,,gold,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000457487600008,0

This suggests a market inefficiency where these players were relatively underpaid.","[Roach, Michael A.] Middle Tennessee State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, MTSU Box 27, Murfreesboro, TN 37132 USA",Middle Tennessee State University,"Roach, MA (通讯作者)，Middle Tennessee State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, MTSU Box 27, Murfreesboro, TN 37132 USA.",michael.roach@mtsu.edu,,,,,,,35,5,5,0,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

Concerns have arisen over which policy is more effective and what are the potential gains from carbon emissions trading for industrial sectors. A Data Envelopment Analysis based linear programming technology is used to compare the industrial potential gains including both the economic potential gains and the environmental potential gains from the command and control and carbon emissions trading mechanisms. An empirical study containing the data set of 38 sub-industries in China from 2006-2014 is conducted. The empirical results show that the carbon emissions trading mechanism can produce more potential gains compared with the command and control mechanism, with an average of 69.6 and 92.0% economic potential gains and 49.1 and 21.0% environmental potential gains in terms of the overall level and industrial level, respectively. Additionally, the environmental potential gains of each sub-industry can provide theoretical support for the emission quotas allocation. Finally, several policy implications based on the empirical results are proposed.","[Yu, Yanni; Zhang, Weijie; Zhang, Ning] Jinan Univ, Coll Econ, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Yu, Yanni] Jinan Univ, Inst Resource Environm & Sustainable Dev, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Jinan University; Jinan University,"Zhang, N (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Coll Econ, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",yayabaobei@naver.com; zhangn@jnu.edu.cn,"zhang, weijie/JQX-1450-2023","Zhang, Ning/0000-0002-5634-4203","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41461118, 71603102]; National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFA0602500]; National Social Science Foundation of China [15ZDA054]; Research Center on Low-carbon Economy for Guangzhou Region",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key R&D Program of China; National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Research Center on Low-carbon Economy for Guangzhou Region,"We thank the financial support provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41461118, 71603102), National Key R&D Program of China (2016YFA0602500), National Social Science Foundation of China (15ZDA054) and Research Center on Low-carbon Economy for Guangzhou Region.",,31,18,20,7,61,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

It is uniquely able to provide credible micro-foundations of EU decision-making, which even theories ostensibly critical of LI borrow. It offers a richer set of innovative opportunities for forward-looking extension than is often thought. Compared to competitors such as Post-Functionalism and Historical Institutionalism, LI generates more consistently satisfying empirical accounts of recent EU policy-making, particularly with regard to the outcomes that ultimately matter most, namely substantive policies. And it remains a trustworthy guide to normative evaluation, for example on the issue of democratic legitimacy.

An information structure summarizes what each agent can observe before making her decision. Focusing on information structures where only aggregate information from past history can be observed, we characterize information structures that can lead to various (efficient and inefficient) Nash equilibria. When individual decision making can be rationalized using a process of iterative dominance (Moulin, Econometrica 47:1337-1351, 1979), we derive a necessary and sufficient condition on information structures under which a unique and efficient dominance solvable equilibrium outcome is obtained.

The Full Bayesian framework was employed to build the hierarchical models which accounted for three correlation structures at multiple levels: the correlation between speeds of adjoining lanes due to multivariate nature; spatially structured correlations between the adjacent segments, and spatially unstructured correlations among segments. The model estimates which influence the lane-mean speed indicated the directional variation of exogenous factors. For the westbound traffic, the afternoon and night hours were observed to be influential while eastbound traffic was more sensitive to the morning period. The segment length revealed a lane-varying correlation where longer segments influenced a speed reduction for the three lanes closer to the median while the speed in outermost lane exhibited a reverse trend as it increased with longer segments. Both models, with mean speed and speed deviations, demonstrated the significant presence of endogeneity due to mean speeds and speed deviations of adjacent lanes, respectively. This study also assessed the accuracy of predicted mean speed and speed deviations by calculating the measures of discrepancy between the observed and model predicted speeds. The Bayesian residuals, which incorporated the normal, multivariate, and spatial correlation structures, exhibited significant superiority at the prediction accuracy than the Normal ones. This discrepancy in prediction performance reflected the impact of consideration or exclusion of random effects.","[Cheng, Wen; Gill, Gurdiljot Singh; Sakrani, Taha; Ralls, Dennis; Jia, Xudong] Calif State Polytech Univ Pomona, Dept Civil Engn, 3801 W Temple Ave, Pomona, CA 91768 USA",California State University System; California State Polytechnic University Pomona,"Cheng, W (通讯作者)，Calif State Polytech Univ Pomona, Dept Civil Engn, 3801 W Temple Ave, Pomona, CA 91768 USA.",wcheng@cpp.edu; gurdiljotg@cpp.edu; tsakrani@cpp.edu; dbralls@cpp.edu; xjia@cpp.edu,"Gill, Gurdiljot/AAA-3881-2020; Cheng, Wen/AAY-6608-2021","Gill, Gurdiljot/0000-0002-5677-8714;",,,,,38,10,11,0,13,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

We merge a multiple discrete-continuous demand system for time allocation with a discrete choice model for destination and travel-mode choice. Accessibility enters the time allocation model through the logsum of the travel mode/destination choice stage. The model is estimated on data for the Netherlands, which was gathered through an activity diary approach that covers one entire year. Our model shows that personal characteristics, household characteristics, contextual variables and accessibility all augment the allocation of time to the set of natural environment types. The resulting estimates allow us to evaluate outdoor recreation policy initiatives, and we simulate the impact of changes in the availability of natural environment types with a constrained optimization approach. We show that time allocation changes are rather small with our simulated policy initiative, but have the intended effect on the group of consumers which the policy initiative aims for.","[Gosens, Tom; Rouwendal, Jan] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Rouwendal, J (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",j.rouwendal@vu.nl,"Rouwendal, Jan/G-2478-2011","Rouwendal, Jan/0000-0003-0070-086X",Netherlands Organization of Scientific Research (NWO),Netherlands Organization of Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"This paper is part of the project Sustainable accessibility of the Randstad area, financed by the Netherlands Organization of Scientific Research (NWO).

A central issue in ridesharing, which is also important in the general domain of cost-sharing in economics and computer science, is that the sharing of cost implies positive externalities and hence coordination problems for the network users. We investigate these problems experimentally in the present study. In particular, we focus on how sequential observability of transportation mode choices can be a powerful facilitator of coordination in ridesharing. Our study abstracts the essential issues of coordination in ridesharing into a directed network game with experimentally testable predictions. In line with the theoretical analysis, our experimental evidence shows that even a limited extent of sequential choice observability might lead to efficient coordination. However, convergence to efficiency is slower with more limited observability, resulting in a significant increase in travel cost.","[Mak, Vincent] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Judge Business Sch, Trumpington St, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England; [Seale, Darryl A.] Univ Nevada, Lee Business Sch, Box 456001,4505 S Maryland Pkwy, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA; [Gisches, Eyran J.; Rapoport, Amnon] Univ Arizona, Eller Coll Management, POB 210108, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Cheng, Meng; Moon, Myounghee; Yang, Rui] Univ Calif Riverside, Sch Business, 900 Univ Ave, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",University of Cambridge; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Las Vegas; University of Arizona; University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Gisches, EJ (通讯作者)，Univ Arizona, Eller Coll Management, POB 210108, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",eyran@email.arizona.edu; amnon@email.arizona.edu,,,NSF [SES-1418923]; University of Arizona,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of Arizona,"This research was supported by NSF Grant SES-1418923 awarded to the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and University of Arizona.",,37,3,4,1,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,OCT,2018,85.0,3-4,,,,,407,433,,10.1007/s11238-018-9663-y,0.0,,,27,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,GY3JH,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448446600008,0

An overall index for measuring the connectivity-accessibility of cities on the HSR network is proposed based on three indicators: (a) the Beta index, to reflect the connectivity of the HSR, (b) the number of reachable counties by HSR within the 500-km domain of a city, to reflect the location-based accessibility of the HSR, and (c) the population of the reachable places by HSR within the 500-km domain of a city, to reflect the potential-based accessibility of the HSR. Finally, the differences in the normalized connectivity-accessibility levels of different categories of cities are qualified to measure the impact of China's future national HSR network on the potential development of cities. It is found that Mid-to-Long-Term Railway Network Plan (Revised in 2016), if fully realized, would profoundly change the HSR connectivity/accessibility of different cities. Most notably, cities in the Yangtze River Delta would suffer the most whereas cities of the central and western regions would gain the most. This could potentially contribute to, or bring about new changes in, the socioeconomic landscapes in China. The methodological contribution of this paper is twofold. Firstly, an overall index to evaluate the comprehensive connectivity and accessibility levels of the HSR network is designed. Secondly, this paper investigates how to qualify the impact of the future HSR network on different tiers of cities in different time periods according to the change of the overall connectivity/accessibility index.","[Xu, Wangtu (Ato)] Xiamen Univ, Dept Urban Planning, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Jiangping] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Architecture, Dept Urban Planning & Design, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yang, Linchuan] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Architecture, Dept Real Estate & Construct, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Li, Ling] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Informat Technol & Decis Sci, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA",Xiamen University; University of Hong Kong; University of Hong Kong; Old Dominion University,"Xu, WT (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Dept Urban Planning, Xiamen, Peoples R China.;Zhou, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Hong Kong, Fac Architecture, Dept Urban Planning & Design, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Yang, LC (通讯作者)，Univ Hong Kong, Fac Architecture, Dept Real Estate & Construct, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",ato1981@xmu.edu.cn; zhoujp@hku.hk; u3003593@connect.hku.hk,"Zhou, Jiangping/AAA-9772-2020; Yang, Linchuan/ABF-1874-2021","Zhou, Jiangping/0000-0002-1623-5002; Yang, Linchuan/0000-0001-6070-9044; Xu, Ato/0000-0002-0790-821X",,,,,86,107,112,46,295,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,1879-2375,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Failure to adequately tailor the degree of cost sharing to the prevailing environment can raise procurement costs substantially.

We employ absolute magnitude restrictions on the impact matrix to identify the countries that were the main sources of spillovers. Despite the large size of shocks from euro area stressed countries, connectedness among sovereign yields declined between 2008 and 2012 due to financial fragmentation, particularly between countries with more divergent business and fiscal cycles. We show that none of the sovereign yields were insulated from foreign shocks and that shocks to the Greek bond market in 2010 explained 20-30% of the variance of sovereign yields in stressed countries, while in 2011-2012 Italy (not Spain) was the source of systemic risk.","[De Santis, Roberto A.; Zimic, Srecko] European Cent Bank, Sonnemannstr 20, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank,"Zimic, S (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Sonnemannstr 20, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany.",srecko.zimic@ecb.europa.eu,,,,,,,21,15,16,3,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0883-7252,1099-1255,,J APPL ECONOMET,J.

A three-stage procedure is proposed to estimate the parameters. In a first stage, the spatial lag panel data model is estimated using an instrumental variable (IV) estimator. In a second stage, a generalized moments (GM) approach is developed to estimate the SMA parameter and the variance components of the disturbance process using IV residuals from the first stage. In a third stage, to purge the equation of the specific structure of the disturbances a Cochrane-Orcutt-type transformation is applied combined with the IV principle. This leads to the GM spatial IV estimator and the regression parameter estimates. Monte Carlo simulations show that our estimators are not very different in terms of root mean square error from those produced by maximum likelihood. The approach is applied to European Union regional employment data for regions nested within countries.","[Fingleton, Bernard] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England; [Le Gallo, Julie] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CESAER UMR1041, AgroSup Dijon, INRA, 26 Blvd Petitjean, F-21000 Dijon, France; [Pirotte, Alain] Univ Paris II Pantheon Assas, CRED, 12 Pl Pantheon, F-75231 Paris 05, France",University of Cambridge; INRAE; Institut Agro; AgroSup Dijon; Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas,"Fingleton, B (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England.",bf100@cam.ac.uk; julie.le-gallo@agrosupdijon.fr; alain.pirotte@u-paris2.fr,"Fingleton, Bernard/GZA-5738-2022; Le Gallo, Julie/F-9167-2018","Fingleton, Bernard/0000-0001-7359-643X; Le Gallo, Julie/0000-0002-7296-2415",ESRC [ES/L011921/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,20,10,10,0,6,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Although the magnitude of this pure transfer penalty has been proven to be an essential element in the structural design of public transport lines, the scarce available research reveals a wide range of values. The aim of this paper is to develop and apply a framework to estimate the value perceived and assigned by commuters to this penalty. This framework includes all the other elements considered by users in the case of a trip involving (potential) transfers, in order to obtain the impact of each one. The framework is based on the discrete choices paradigm and applied to data collected in Madrid, Spain. The results show that the pure transfer penalty is comparable to a 15.2-17.7 equivalent increase in in-vehicle minutes; i.e. longer trips may be preferred to faster alternatives with transfers, even if the additional walking. and waiting times are zero. As well as the pure transfer penalty, the model also captures the effects of habit, crowding, walking, waiting and in-vehicle times, information, and the additional effect of intermodality on transfers.","[Garcia-Martinez, Andres; Cascajo, Rocio] Univ Politecn Madrid, Transport Res Ctr, TRANSyT, Prof Aranguren,3 ETSI Caminos,Canales & Puertos, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Jara-Diaz, Sergio R.] Univ Chile, Casilla 228-3, Santiago, Chile; [Chowdhury, Subeh] Univ Auckland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [Monzon, Andres] Univ Politecn Madrid, Prof Aranguren,3 ETSI Caminos,Canales & Puertos, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Universidad de Chile; University of Auckland; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Garcia-Martinez, A (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Madrid, Transport Res Ctr, TRANSyT, Prof Aranguren,3 ETSI Caminos,Canales & Puertos, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",andres.garciam@upm.es,"Jara-Diaz, Sergio/AAK-4221-2020; Alidadi, Mehdi/HJZ-0235-2023; Jara-Diaz, Sergio R/H-6705-2013; Monzón, Andrés/M-3803-2017; Cascajo, Rocio/K-5855-2017","Jara-Diaz, Sergio/0000-0002-0442-5490; Alidadi, Mehdi/0000-0001-5183-7829; Cascajo, Rocio/0000-0002-9962-4475; Garcia-Martinez, Andres/0000-0003-4745-4029; Chowdhury, Subeh/0000-0002-9619-705X","National Programme for Research, Development and Innovation oriented to Challenges in Society (TRANSFER Project) [TRA2013-45239-R]; Fondecyt, Chile [1160410]; Institute for Complex Engineering Systems [ICM: P-05-004-F, CONICYT: FB0816]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Research; [BES-2014-069223]","National Programme for Research, Development and Innovation oriented to Challenges in Society (TRANSFER Project); Fondecyt, Chile(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); Institute for Complex Engineering Systems; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Research;","The authors would like to thank the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Research and its National Programme for Research, Development and Innovation oriented to Challenges in Society (TRANSFER Project; TRA2013-45239-R) for providing the necessary funding.

We show that aeronautical revenue under welfare maximization is short of its costs, because the optimal airport charge must be set lower than the first best level, to counteract market power in the non-aeronautical market, which results in insufficient revenue. However, imperfectly competitive non-aeronautical service (side business) leads to a positive profit that the airport may share, thereby improving the chance to recover costs. We demonstrate that airport overall cost recovery, including the profit from side business, may be satisfied, depending on the profit from side business and the demand elasticity of side business. Our analysis further identifies the role of another good, which can be a substitute or a complement for non-aeronautical service, in cost recovery. We analyze both cases of exogenous and endogenous prices of another good. When the price of another good is exogenous, the price higher (lower) than the marginal cost in the another-good market makes cost recovery less (more) likely. When the price of another good is endogenous, cost recovery is more likely (unlikely) to hold when non-aeronautical service and another good are closer complements (substitutes) or/and the airport absorbs more (less) profits from side business. The possibility that a monopoly airport fails to satisfy cost recovery is also examined.","[Kidokoro, Yukihiro] Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies, Tokyo, Japan; [Zhang, Anming] Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, Vancouver, BC, Canada",National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies; University of British Columbia,"Kidokoro, Y (通讯作者)，Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies, Tokyo, Japan.",kidokoro@grips.ac.jp; anming.zhang@sander.ubc.ca,,"Zhang, Anming/0000-0002-9457-8414","JSPS KAKENHI [JP16H03610, JP17K18560]; GRIPS Policy Research Center; Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16H03610, 17K18560] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); GRIPS Policy Research Center; Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We would like to thank an anonymous referee for helpful comments and Robin Lindsey for helpful discussion.

Representing only 3% of the total number of registered vehicles and 8% of the total vehicle kilometers traveled, heavy vehicles are involved in 18% of fatal and serious injury crashes in Australia. Given the contributing role of vehicle defects in many heavy vehicle crashes, vehicle inspection schemes have been implemented to more effectively manage heavy vehicle safety. However, there is little empirical research about the impact of periodic heavy vehicle inspections on vehicle defects and crash casualties. Hence, this research investigates the efficacy and effectiveness of periodic heavy vehicle inspections by examining their impact on the factors contributing to heavy vehicle crashes as well as the severity of these crashes. Accordingly, a partial least squares path model (PLSPM) is proposed and evaluated using the data of periodic heavy vehicle inspections and heavy vehicle crashes in Queensland, for the period of 2011-2013. The PLS-PM results are also compared with the results of potential, alternative analysis methods to provide further insights about potential applications of PLS-PM in transportation research. Although the scheme cannot be evaluated completely through the proposed analysis approach, the findings of this study contribute to the causal theory and practice of heavy vehicle inspection protocols, especially in relation to vehicle defects and road safety outcomes.","[Assemi, Behrang; Hickman, Mark] Univ Queensland, Sch Civil Engn, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"Assemi, B (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Civil Engn, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",b.assemi@uq.edu.au; m.hickman1@uq.edu.au,"Assemi, Behrang/A-5864-2016","Assemi, Behrang/0000-0003-2043-8782","Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads (TMR), under the ASTRA; University of Queensland, Centre for Transport Strategy","Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads (TMR), under the ASTRA; University of Queensland, Centre for Transport Strategy","This research was funded by Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads (TMR), under the ASTRA agreement with the University of Queensland, Centre for Transport Strategy.",,47,19,20,1,21,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,1879-2375,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Many of the world's most productive agricultural basins depend on groundwater and have experienced declines in water table levels. The food consumers eat, the farmers who produce that food, and the local economies supporting that production are all affected by the availability of groundwater. Increasing competition for water from cities and environmental needs, as well as concerns about future climate variability and more frequent droughts, has caused policy-makers to look for ways to decrease the consumptive use of water. When designing groundwater management policies and institutions, it is important to consider any possible perverse consequences from the policy. In this paper, we discuss the economics of sustainable agricultural groundwater management institutions, including the possible perverse consequences of incentive-based agricultural groundwater conservation programs; the importance of dynamic management, conjunctive management, and spatial management; and property rights.","[Sears, Louis; Lim, David; Lawell, C. -Y.

While a mixture model of EUT plus heuristic rules will obviously fit data better than EUT only, given the small sample sizes, there is a danger of overfitting. Therefore, instead of goodness-of-fit measures, we focus on forecasting performance. Using two data sets of binary lottery choices and reasonable holdout subsets for testing forecasting performance, we find that the EUT-only model forecasts better than the toolbox mixture model with EUT. Even when the toolbox model with EUT fits the data significantly better, EUT-only forecasts better.","[Stahl, Dale O.] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Stahl, DO (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",,,,,,,,21,2,2,1,3,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

We use extensive data on production contract outcomes for processing tomato growers (including 3,740 coordinated contracts) to examine the performance of grower-processor vertical contracts. The results indicate that the tomato grower -processor vertical relationship undergoes some deficiencies resulted in social welfare losses and lower level in contractual performance. From the side of processors, the industry has an oligopsonic structure (with CR4: 57%). From the side of tomato growers, the results indicate a relatively higher contractual default (with 53% in average). These findings suggest that public policy should pay more attention for the performances levels of the used vertical coordination mechanism in order to provide more incentive instruments and by leveraging vertical contract for tomato growers' benefit.","[Benmehaia, Mohamed Amine; Brabez, Fatima] Ecole Natl Super Agron, Dept Econ Rurale, Ave Hassan Badi, El Harrach, Algeria",Ecole Nationale Polytechnique - Algeria,"Benmehaia, MA (通讯作者)，Ecole Natl Super Agron, Dept Econ Rurale, Ave Hassan Badi, El Harrach, Algeria.",m.benmehaia@st.ensa.dz,"ENSA - NHSA, Algiers/AAF-1768-2019","Benmehaia, Amine M./0000-0001-8110-1601",,,,,47,10,10,0,8,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,JUN,2018,17.0,2,,,,,3,14,,10.30682/nm1802a,0.0,,,12,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,GP3RX,,gold,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440772000002,0

Panel data for the country's commercial farms in 2001-2012 do not allow us to reject the hypothesis of constant returns to scale but point toward the importance of farms and rayon-(district) fixed effects.

We prove that, when no state can dictate the outcome of the election by commanding a voting weight in excess of one half, the probability of majority inversion increases with the size disparity among the states.","[Kaniovski, Serguei] Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Arsenal, Object 20, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Zaigraev, Alexander] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Fac Math & Comp Sci, Chopin Str 12-18, PL-87100 Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Kaniovski, S (通讯作者)，Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Arsenal, Object 20, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",serguei.kaniovski@wifo.ac.at; alzaig@mat.uni.torun.pl,"Zaigraev, Alexander/F-8984-2014","Zaigraev, Alexander/0000-0002-6261-031X",,,,,13,7,7,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,JUN,2018,84.0,4,,,,,525,546,,10.1007/s11238-018-9660-1,0.0,,,22,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,GF1IK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431687300002,0

Our results show that more productive firms have greater multinational activity in terms of both scope, the number of foreign markets where they invest, and scale, the volume of local sales by subsidiaries active in foreign markets. The estimation of gravity equations shows that country characteristics that encourage multinational activity successively induce the entry of less productive parent firms.

The paper measures the vulnerability of the codesharing network (CN) of Star Alliance, SkyTeam and oneworld, respectively, by applying the theory of complex networks. A normalized CN vulnerability metric is proposed. Using airline schedules data, a ranking of member airlines according to their share in the overall CN vulnerability is derived. The results for CNs are compared with the ones for the respective total network (TN) that includes routes with and without codesharing. The findings show that oneworld is the most vulnerable global airline alliance, SkyTeam ranks second followed by Star Alliance.

As part of a broad strategy to achieve sustainable urban mobility, bike-sharing services could contribute to car usage decrease, especially for short-distance trips. However, most of the developing countries have limited quantified evidence regarding the factors affecting bike sharing choice and this hinders policy makers from effectively promoting bike-sharing usage. The case study city is Taiyuan, which operates one of the most in demand bike-sharing schemes in China. This research investigates the factors affecting mode choice behavior with a focus on bike sharing, and explores the effectiveness of different policy options aiming at increasing bike sharing ridership. Nested logit and mixed nested logit models are developed using both stated preference and revealed preference data. Policy effectiveness is studied by examining modal split changes. The results reveal the significant negative impact of air pollution on bike-sharing choice. Nevertheless, improving air quality is found to be less effective in promoting bike-sharing ridership than improving bike-sharing service itself (e.g. through access time saving, travel cost saving); although it is more effective in suppressing private car usage.","[Li, Weibo; Kamargianni, Maria] UCL, UCL Energy Inst, Cent House,14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England",University of London; University College London,"Li, WB (通讯作者)，UCL, UCL Energy Inst, Cent House,14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England.",weibo.li.10@ucl.ac.uk; m.kamargianni@ucl.ac.uk,"Kamargianni, Maria/AAK-2234-2021","Kamargianni, Maria/0000-0003-1320-1031; LI, WEIBO/0000-0001-6607-7084",Shanxi Transportation Research Institute,Shanxi Transportation Research Institute,"We sincerely appreciate the support from Shanxi Transportation Research Institute in their funding and advice provided during the data collection.

In particular, cycling is more likely and more severely to be affected by inclement weather than the motorized modes as the cyclists are entirely exposed to outdoor environment. Understanding the weather-cycling relationship is of great importance to academics and practitioners for cycling activity analysis and promotion. This study contributes to an in-depth understanding of how the changes in weather conditions affect cycling on an off-road trail and an on-road (bridge) bike lane at both daily and hourly scales across four seasons. The paper compares the weather-cycling relationship based on day of week and time of day combinations. The autocorrelation effect of cycling itself and the lagging effect of weather elements are also examined. The findings indicate that cycling is significantly self-dependent especially at the finer temporal scales. Weather have a very different influence on bicycle usage of off-road trails versus on-road bike lanes. When it rains its negative impact not only continues but also significantly affects the cycling within previous one hour. At the daily level, weekend cycling on the trail is less likely to be affected by weather as compared to cycling on the bike lane, whilst inverse is true for weekday cycling. Cycling is most likely to be affected by weather conditions in spring and least likely to be affected in winter. Cycling pattern which is more unrelated to weather at the aggregated level tends to be more flexibly adjusted according to the real-time weather conditions at the disaggregated level. Cyclists on weekends especially during the weekend peak hours (11 AM-4 PM) tend to have more flexibility to adjust their cycling schedule before or after the adverse weather conditions than on weekdays. In addition, cyclists with utilitarian purposes are more likely to shift from cycling to other modes (e.g., transit) due to real-time bad weather conditions in weekdays than in weekends, especially during weekday peak hours (7-9 AM and 4-6 PM). The results provide weather officials, transport agencies and research institutions with valuable information for cycling activity analysis and promotion by considering the effects of weather events especially rainfall.","[Zhao, Jinbao; Xing, Zhaomin] Shandong Univ Technol, Sch Transportat & Vehicle Engn, 266 West Xincun Rd, Zibo 255000, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Jinbao; Luan, Xin] Southeast Univ, Sch Transportat, 2 Sipailou Rd, Nanjing 210096, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jian] Purdue Univ, NEXTRANS Ctr, Lyles Sch Civil Engn, 3000 Kent Ave, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA; [Jiang, Yang] China Sustainable Transportat Ctr, 19 Jianguomenwai Ave, Beijing 100004, Peoples R China",Shandong University of Technology; Southeast University - China; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Zhao, JB (通讯作者)，Shandong Univ Technol, Sch Transportat & Vehicle Engn, 266 West Xincun Rd, Zibo 255000, Peoples R China.;Zhao, JB (通讯作者)，Southeast Univ, Sch Transportat, 2 Sipailou Rd, Nanjing 210096, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",jinbao@sdut.edu.cn,"Wang, Jian/U-3959-2019; Wang, Jian/HII-8685-2022","Wang, Jian/0000-0002-0385-3645; Wang, Jian/0000-0002-0385-3645","National Science Foundation of China [51608313, 51508315]; Research Foundation of Shandong University of Technology [2017ZBXC015]",National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Research Foundation of Shandong University of Technology,"This study was funded by the National Science Foundation of China (51608313, 51508315) and the Research Foundation of Shandong University of Technology (2017ZBXC015).

Involvement of private firms in the implementation of privatization policies is encouraged by national governments, as it is believed that such engagement will help in producing more sustainable solutions. Transport is a key sustainability issue, where a sound privatization policy could positively affect the transport-related environmental efficiency and sustainability. In this context, the policy transfer process can provide a strong impetus for further growth of transport privatization. Little attention, however, in the literature and practice has been devoted to analyse factors affecting the policy transfer phenomenon in transport privatization policies. This paper, hence, aims to investigate the relationship between policy transfer and transport sustainability via privatization. The paper hypotheses that both economic and institutional determinants increase the effect of policy convergence. As the case study context, the EU is placed under the microscope, and a dyadic dataset on transport policies is analysed. The findings indicate that institutional and economic variables play a highly critical role for policy transfer in achieving transport sustainability in the EU.","[Arbolino, Roberta; De Simone, Luisa] Univ Naples LOrientale, Dept Social & Human Sci, Lgo San Giovanni Maggiore 30, I-80134 Naples, Italy; [Carlucci, Fabio] Univ Salerno, Dept Econ & Stat, Via Giovanni Paolo 2 132, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy; [Cira, Andrea; Ioppolo, Giuseppe] Univ Messina, Dept Econ, Piazza Pugliatti 1, I-98122 Messina, Italy; [Yigitcanlar, Tan] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, 2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia",University of Naples L'Orientale; University of Salerno; University of Messina; Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Carlucci, F (通讯作者)，Univ Salerno, Dept Econ & Stat, Via Giovanni Paolo 2 132, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy.",rarbolino@unior.it; fcarlucci@unisa.it; acira@unime.it; ldesimone@unior.it; giuseppe.ioppolo@unime.it; tan.yigitcanlar@qut.edu.au,"Yigitcanlar, Tan/J-1142-2012","Yigitcanlar, Tan/0000-0001-7262-7118; CARLUCCI, Fabio/0000-0003-2911-6528; Ioppolo, Giuseppe/0000-0003-0262-8435",,,,,74,5,5,1,19,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,1879-2375,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Our regression results show that, while the central government's notice negatively affects housing prices, the localized home-purchase limit measures have positive effects on housing prices in Guangzhou, which deviate far from the expectations the policy makers might have.

Furthermore, for those players with less than 6 years of service, the new contract typically extends beyond the player's arbitration-eligible years.","[Krautmann, Anthony C.] Depaul Univ, Dept Econ, 1 E Jackson, Chicago, IL 60604 USA",DePaul University,"Krautmann, AC (通讯作者)，Depaul Univ, Dept Econ, 1 E Jackson, Chicago, IL 60604 USA.",akrautma@depaul.edu,,,,,,,10,6,7,1,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

We examine the empirical impact of trade openness on the short-run underpricing of initial public offerings (IPOs) using city-level data. Particularly, we argue that urban economic openness (UEO) has a significant impact on the productivity and on prices of both direct and indirect real estate due to productivity gains of companies in more open areas. This in turn positively affects the firm's profitability, enhancing the confidence in local real estate markets and future company performance, hence decreasing the uncertainty of the IPO valuation. As a result, issuers have less incentive to underprice IPO shares. We use a sample of Chinese real estate IPOs, which offer a suitable laboratory thanks to their strong geographic investment patterns focused locally and a country with a highly heterogeneous openness across regions. Controlling for traditional firm- and issuing-specific characteristics of IPOs that are used for developed markets and Chinese-related features (i.e. listing location and state ownership), we find the evidence that companies investing in economically more open areas experience less IPO underpricing. Our results show great explanatory power and are robust to different specifications.","[Marcato, Gianluca; Milcheva, Stanimira; Zheng, Chen] Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, Real Estate & Planning, Reading, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Zheng, C (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, Real Estate & Planning, Reading, Berks, England.",g.marcato@henley.reading.ac.uk; s.milcheva@henley.reading.ac.uk; c.zheng@pgr.reading.ac.uk,"Zheng, Chen/JNS-6116-2023","Zheng, Chen/0000-0002-3480-0167; Marcato, Gianluca/0000-0002-6266-4676; Milcheva, Stanimira/0000-0002-7051-773X",,,,,47,4,4,0,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Under the assumptions closer to a real market, we reveal the relationships between the investor's price anticipation and equilibrium sustained state. If the mean value of price deviation anticipated by investors is a negative value, there is one equilibrium sustained solution. And if the mean value of price deviation anticipated by investors is a positive value, one equilibrium sustained solution or two equilibrium sustained solutions are likely to appear in our models. This research is beneficial to evaluate differences in revenues between rational traders and noise traders, to understand dynamic evolutionary process of trading strategies, and to find equilibrium sustained solution. In addition, financial crisis as an exogenous factor is introduced into the evolutionary model. Based on theoretical analysis and simulation experiment, the results show that case 3 in theoretical analysis does not occur in the simulation after the outbreak of financial crisis, and case 1 and case 2 in theoretical analysis correspond to the different regions of the anticipated price deviation curves. Moreover, the changes of two equilibrium sustained solutions show opposite tendency characteristics with an increasing of the mean value of price deviation of risk asset. Relative to the existing research results, this paper distinguishes the different yield between risk assets and riskless assets, and considers the existence of transaction cost, assumes investors having different risk aversion coefficient, and takes financial crisis as an example to research the impacts of exogenous variables on investors' trading strategies. Through comparative analysis, the conclusions drawn from simulation experiment are consistent with equilibrium sustained solutions in theoretical analysis.","[Wu, Binghui; He, Jianmin] Southeast Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing 211189, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wu, Binghui; Duan, Tingting] Lanzhou Univ Finance & Econ, Dept Finance, Lanzhou 730020, Gansu, Peoples R China",Southeast University - China; Lanzhou University of Finance & Economics,"Wu, BH (通讯作者)，Southeast Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing 211189, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Wu, BH (通讯作者)，Lanzhou Univ Finance & Econ, Dept Finance, Lanzhou 730020, Gansu, Peoples R China.",vcmd@163.com; duantingting417@163.com; hejianmin@seu.edu.cn,"Wu, Binghui/ABG-1377-2021","Wu, Binghui/0000-0003-0031-7529",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71371051]; Jiangsu Innovation Program Foundation of Graduate Education [KYZZ_ 0081],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Jiangsu Innovation Program Foundation of Graduate Education,The research described in the paper was financed by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.71371051) and Jiangsu Innovation Program Foundation of Graduate Education (No.KYZZ_0081).,,35,4,4,1,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Intermodal and multimodal passenger transport, unlike Intermodal freight transport, carry the unique combination of a requirement to transfer between vehicles, in addition to cargo (passengers) with the ability to choose other modes based on a wide variety of factors including difficulty of transfer, availability of automatic baggage transfer and comfort. Our research aims to shed light on the relative importance and interrelations of these transfer attributes by analysing the limited range of European studies that value transfer quality attributes and compare and contrast them with each other. To support this, we collect our own study data which are used to evaluate questions that arose out of the analysis. The few studies that value European intercity transfers vary widely in their valuations, and so taking into context the countries, methodologies, samples, question framing and other metrics specific to each study, we establish links between the valuations and other data not explicitly discussed in those studies to the end of presenting a framework for understanding passenger valuation of intercity transfers. We also suggest some driving factors that may affect one or more of the transfer quality attributes that have not been discussed in the literature, such as perceived trip difficulty and traveller expectations. This work illustrates and investigates the various elements that may affect how passengers perceive the connections required for travel across transport networks and how they make choices based on those perceptions.","[Allard, Ryan F.; Moura, Filipe] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, Dept Civil Engn Architecture & Georesources, CERis, Ave Rovisco Pais 1, P-1049 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico,"Allard, RF (通讯作者)，Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, Dept Civil Engn Architecture & Georesources, CERis, Ave Rovisco Pais 1, P-1049 Lisbon, Portugal.",ryan.allard@tecnico.ulisboa.pt; fmoura@tecnico.ulisboa.pt,"Moura, Filipe/I-8085-2012; Moura, Filipe Manuel Mercier Vilaça/AGF-2175-2022","Moura, Filipe/0000-0001-7749-8490; Moura, Filipe Manuel Mercier Vilaça/0000-0001-7749-8490",Portuguese National Infrastructure Company (Infraestructuras de Portugal); Portuguese National Science and Technology Foundation (FCT) [BD 51638],Portuguese National Infrastructure Company (Infraestructuras de Portugal); Portuguese National Science and Technology Foundation (FCT)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"The authors would like to thank Joao Abreu e Silva and Olga Petrik for their involvement in developing the survey and would also like to recognize the institutions that financially supported the research: The Portuguese National Infrastructure Company (Infraestructuras de Portugal) and The Portuguese National Science and Technology Foundation (FCT) under Doctoral Grant BD 51638.

Since, transport is one of the main sector responsible for EU's emissions; diffusion of Electric Vehicles (EVs) could allow immense reduction. Therefore, since the announcement of 2050 Roadmap in 2009, there has been a great increase in studies exploring the viability of transition to e-mobility in a Europe-wide context, identifying common factors and variables. However, it is usually not that straightforward when decision makers seek to transform these variables into policy implications that will actually help to achieve the EU goals on energy transition. At this point, the motivators and barriers are of utmost importance. Accordingly, this study is based on an extensive and up-to-date review of the existing literature on e-mobility in Europe, with the main aim of identifying and mapping the motivators and barriers for the diffusion of electric mobility through three levels of decision-making: Formal Social Units, Collective Decision-Making Units, and Individual Units. Results of the analysis identifies that the main barriers are lack of charging infrastructure; economic restrictions and cost concerns; technical and operational restrictions; lack of trust; information and knowledge; limited supply of electricity and raw materials; and practicability concerns. Thus, key motivators appear to be environmental, economic and technical benefits associated with EVs, as well as personal and demographic factors.","[Biresselioglu, Mehmet Efe; Yilmaz, Barbara Katharina] Izmir Univ Econ, Sustainable Energy Div, Sakarya Cad 156, Izmir, Turkey; [Kaplan, Melike Demirbag] Izmir Univ Econ, Business Sch, Dept Business Adm, Izmir, Turkey",Izmir Ekonomi Universitesi; Izmir Ekonomi Universitesi,"Biresselioglu, ME (通讯作者)，Izmir Univ Econ, Sustainable Energy Div, Sakarya Cad 156, Izmir, Turkey.",efe.biresselioglu@ieu.edu.tr; melike.demirbag@ieu.edu.tr; katharina.yilmaz@ieu.edu.tr,"Biresselioglu, Mehmet Efe/AAL-5650-2021; Demirbağ-Kaplan, Melike/JMP-9911-2023","Biresselioglu, Mehmet Efe/0000-0002-5961-4088",European Union's Horizon Research and Innovation programme [727470]; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [727470] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme,European Union's Horizon Research and Innovation programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)Horizon Europe Research Infrastructures); H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme),This work is a part of ECHOES project funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme under Grant Agreement No. 727470.,,90,205,212,20,256,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

The literature is not affected by publication bias, but the results vary systematically depending on the exact data and methodology applied. Using Bayesian model averaging we identify the most important factors driving the heterogeneity of the reported effects: data frequency, estimation technique (simulation vs. regression), and, importantly, the latitude of the country considered.

We analyse long- and short-run developments of price-level dispersion in the euro area and compare the results with price dispersion across US cities. We find that monetary and economic integration in Europe has been successful in establishing a major downward trend in price-level differences across countries since 1960. After the Global Financial Crisis and the European Sovereign Debt Crisis, diverging economic conditions across euro area countries led to higher income dispersion, which contributed to a widening of price-level differences again.","[Hoeberichts, Marco; Stokman, Ad] Nederlandsche Bank, Econ Policy & Res Div, Amsterdam, Netherlands",European Central Bank; De Nederlandsche Bank NV,"Hoeberichts, M (通讯作者)，Nederlandsche Bank, Econ Policy & Res Div, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",,,,,,,,12,1,1,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAR,2018,41.0,3,,,,,913,925,,10.1111/twec.12591,0.0,,,13,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,FY7DH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427021300013,0

Taking the case of EU Studies (EUS), this article examines the key practice of normative writing. I analyze the degree to which 70 highly-cited journal articles of political science writing in EUS explicitly or implicitly suggest that European integration or its institutions or policies are bad or good, flourishing or declining. I use this discourse analysis, plus biographical data on the authors of texts, to explain a major temporal pattern. Degrees of normativity in EUS articles progressively declined from the 1970s until the millennium, but then subsequently recovered. Factors external' to scholarship, such as the progressive intensification of European integration and crises faced by the EU help explain this pattern.

We design and implement a randomized control trial to quantitatively assess the role of communication between migrants and their international network on the extent and value of remittance flows. In the experiment, a random sample of 1,500 migrants residing in Ireland was offered the possibility of contacting their networks outside the host country for free over a varying number of months. We find a sizeable positive impact of our intervention on the value of migrant remittances sent. Larger remittance responses are associated with individuals who are employed and earn higher incomes. This evidence is consistent with the idea that the observed increase in remittances is not a consequence of relaxed budget constraints due to subsidized communication costs but rather a likely result of improved information, perhaps due to better migrant control over remittance use, enhanced trust in remittance channels due to experience sharing, or increased remittance recipients' social pressure on migrants.","[Batista, Catia] Univ Nova Lisboa, Nova Sch Business & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal; [Narciso, Gaia] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Trinity College Dublin,"Batista, C (通讯作者)，Univ Nova Lisboa, Nova Sch Business & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal.",catia.batista@novasbe.pt; narcisog@tcd.ie,"Narciso, Gaia/AAB-2955-2022","Narciso, Gaia/0000-0003-3532-6337; Batista, Catia/0000-0001-9057-0397","NORFACE Research Program Migration in Europe - Social, Economic, Cultural and Policy Dynamics; Department of Economics and the Arts and Social Sciences Benefactions Fund at Trinity College Dublin; Nova Forum at Universidade Nova de Lisboa","NORFACE Research Program Migration in Europe - Social, Economic, Cultural and Policy Dynamics; Department of Economics and the Arts and Social Sciences Benefactions Fund at Trinity College Dublin; Nova Forum at Universidade Nova de Lisboa","Catia Batista (corresponding author) is Associate Professor at Nova School of Business and Economics, Universidade Nova de Lisboa; her email address is: catia.batista@novasbe.pt.

The research consists of three parts. The first part of the research deals with indicators and causes of the current situation. This section presents as well as the literature review. OECD methodology of productivity measurement has been used in the paper. There are different productivity measures. Value-added based labour productivity is one of them. Labour productivity is a useful measure due to the fact that it reflects how efficiently labour is combined with other factors of production. Measurement of labour productivity is closely connected with the development of living standards. The choice among productivity measures depends on the purpose of productivity measurement. Second part of the research deals with problem of productivity growth in Latvia and in the EU is analysed based on empirical data and calculations. Productivity of Latvia has grown significantly during the past decades, but still far behind of OECD average level. Third part of the research is dedicated economic policy for faster productivity. There are different channels for productivity growth at country level: sustained innovation, well-functioning labour market and other markets, effective insolvency, a supportive business environment ect.

Using a gravity model approach for panel data, we estimate the influence of national, European and international standards on trade in value-added and gross trade flows within Europe. We find that national standards on their own hamper trade in European value chains while European and international standards foster trade. European standards have greater influence on trade in inner-European value chains whereas international standards have positive effects on imports into Europe from third countries. European standards therefore reduce information asymmetries between market actors in the value chains of the European Single Market. International standards serve as a means of global communication between international trade partners. In addition, we find a positive effect of an interaction term between national and European standards in European value chains confirming the necessity of national standardization. Furthermore, we consider our findings not only within international political economy's theoretical literature regarding the governance of GVCs but also, the subsequent policy implications of our findings in terms of economic growth and development.","[Blind, Knut; Mangelsdorf, Axel; Niebel, Crispin; Ramel, Florian] Tech Univ Berlin, Chair Innovat Econ, Berlin, Germany; [Blind, Knut] Fraunhofer Inst Open Commun Syst, Berlin, Germany",Technical University of Berlin; Fraunhofer Gesellschaft,"Blind, K (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Berlin, Chair Innovat Econ, Berlin, Germany.;Blind, K (通讯作者)，Fraunhofer Inst Open Commun Syst, Berlin, Germany.",,,,,,,,58,28,29,4,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Meeting of the needs of different types of investors makes legal regimes favourable and convenient, allowing implementation of various alternative investment strategies and permitting investments in a large variety of eligible asset classes. The current European aligning regulatory tendencies have not affected the stable functioning of AIFs, but on the contrary, offer conditions for more legally certain investment environment. The adoption of AIFMD on the level of EU brought the regulation of AIFMs at another level through the opportunities it has introduced. Many countries have placed AIFMD in operation fast and successfully. AIFMD regulates managers of AIFs, while regulation of AIFs remains at national discretion, that is why the mentioned draft may be significantly improved. Implementation of a comprehensive and consistent legal and regulatory framework for AIFs operation will offer a good tool for speeding-up and enhancing the quality of certain investment processes in Moldova. From the date of Republic of Moldova's independence proclamation in 1991, Moldova has evolved sufficiently so that organic necessity in appearance of AIFs has arisen. The first attempts to institute a national legal regime for AIFs started in 2008 and, currently, NCFM has prepared a draft of AIF Law which comes to compile into a single law transposition of AIFMD, ELTIF and EVCF Regulations.

Its financial consequences have also reduced the efficiency of the transfer of control right as well as the direct erosion of the financial interests of the small and medium shareholders. Based on the analysis of the existing research literature system at home and abroad, this paper applies the large-scale equity transaction premium method to the empirical evidence of the transfer of control rights of the large shareholder of China's A-share market from 2012 to 2016: The majority of the original large shareholder can gain positive private gains of control rights during the transfer of control rights, but there is a big gap in the ability of different listed companies to obtain private gains of control rights, showing that the transfer of control rights of the large shareholder will erode the interests of small and medium shareholders. Meantime, when state-owned listed companies transfer control rights of the largest shareholder, the private gains from obtaining control rights are smaller than those of non-state-owned listed companies and non-state-owned listed companies have implemented more erosion of interests in small and medium shareholders during the transfer of control rights. This research conclusion provides a brand-new governance perspective for the improvement of the investor protection system in China's capital market, especially the protection of small and medium investors.","[Deng, Xiaojun; Liu, Xiaofeng] Xian Shiyou Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Xian 710065, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Xi'an Shiyou University,"Deng, XJ (通讯作者)，Xian Shiyou Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Xian 710065, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",dxj0624@126.com,,,Xi'an Shiyou University [0109-290088283],Xi'an Shiyou University,The Research Achievements of The Stealth Financial Capital Research of Corporate Finance (Project number: 0109-290088283) Supported by Xi'an Shiyou University High-level Talent Support Project.,,7,0,0,0,2,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-521-4,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2018,182.0,,,,,,455,458,,,,,,4,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BM5RA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000465424800106,0

To analyse the principal mechanisms at work in what is an understudied tool of global governance, this paper compares the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's and the Financial Action Task Force's blacklisting of secrecy havens in the years 2000-2009. We show that blacklisting can be used to impose both reputational and financial costs on a state and highlight three factors that contribute to a blacklist's effectiveness: the stigma attached to the act that led to the blacklisting, the nature of any sanctions that it imposes and the blacklist's legitimacy. The blacklisting of Liechtenstein and Nauru highlight the interplay between these factors, but they also raise questions about the legitimacy of blacklisting itself.","[Eggenberger, Katrin] Univ St Gallen, Dept Polit Sci, St Gallen, Switzerland",University of St Gallen,"Eggenberger, K (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, Dept Polit Sci, St Gallen, Switzerland.",,,,Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs; Liechtenstein Institute on Self-Determination,Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs; Liechtenstein Institute on Self-Determination,"This paper benefited from comments and discussions with Patrick Emmenegger, Richard Woodward, Joseph E.

Uzbek values were presented as qualities springing from the country's supposedly unique civilizational heritage, cast as something distinct from Western civilizational norms and practice. This source of distinctiveness, however, soon gave way to a type of exclusionary discourse in the early 2000s, centered on clearly differentiating Uzbekistan from the West. This essay provides a lens through which to understand the phenomenon, arguing that international recognition of status partly accounts for the rise in the particularly anti-Western variant of Karimov's rhetoric. Authorities in Uzbekistan, not unlike in Russia, built their foreign policy on the need to secure the country's (allegedly) important status in the international arena; anti-Western rhetoric arose as a response to misrecognition, as it evaded appeals to equality of status and legitimized growing isolationism. The essay reviews the origins of that rhetoric, the meaning of recognition, and the backdrop against which anti-Western moralizing rhetoric arose in Uzbekistan's international engagement. It also concludes with a brief assessment of how that rhetoric might affect (or not) the foreign policy of Uzbekistan's new president, Shavkat Mirziyoyev.","[Fazendeiro, Bernardo Teles] Univ Coimbra, Ctr Social Studies, Coimbra, Portugal",Universidade de Coimbra,"Fazendeiro, BT (通讯作者)，Univ Coimbra, Ctr Social Studies, Coimbra, Portugal.",btfazendeiro@ces.uc.pt,,"Teles Fazendeiro, Bernardo/0000-0002-0816-1138",Fundacao de Ciencia e Tecnologia [5332],Fundacao de Ciencia e Tecnologia,This work was supported by the Fundacao de Ciencia e Tecnologia [grant number 5332].,,117,2,2,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

The second stage of studies was conducted in 2018 and concerned research into human capital in the period 2011-2016. On the basis of certain indicators, an evaluation was made of the effectiveness of the human capital possessed, through effective of management. The results of the study confirmed that, in the research period, there was an increase in the role of human capital in businesses dealing with the manufacture of food products and beverages. This capital has enabled increases in work quality and an increasing ability to generate profit. In addition, in the businesses studied, there were different levels of use of human resources through those years, which demonstrates that the production capital of food industry enterprises was not always fully used.","[Firlej, Krzysztof; Kubala, Sebastian] Cracow Univ Econ, Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Firlej, K (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Krakow, Poland.",krzysztof.firlej@uek.krakow.pl; kubalas@uek.krakow.pl,"Krzysztof, Firlej/ABH-8570-2020","Kubala, Sebastian/0000-0003-4021-9173",,,,,15,0,0,0,4,STANISLAW STASZIC UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES PILA,PILA,"UL PODCHORAZYCH 10, PILA, 64-920, POLAND",,,978-83-62617-89-0,,,,2018,,,,,,,275,287,,10.14595/CP/01/018,0.0,,,13,Development Studies; Economics; Multidisciplinary Sciences,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,BM3DE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000461899000018,0

This estimate is robust to a variety of alternative specifications in which we test for non-linearities and amplifying factors by interacting sunlight with a range of other influences.

Some advocate for the minimum role of the state, while others support a greater role of the state in social and economic development. Between these two extremes, there are many other, different, opinions, theories, models and ideologies. The size of public spending, the state budget deficit, the size of the public debt, the structure of state revenues and expenditures, both in absolute and relative terms are fundamentally economic and starting political indicators in analysing the size, role, and efficiency of the state. In this paper, the share of government spending as a percentage of GDP is analysed and compared for Croatia and selected peer countries. According to the empirical analysis, most EU Member States have public consumption of over 40% of GDP, where as in old (developed) EU member states, that number is about 45%, which puts Croatia within the EU average. In addition, the trend of public spending in EU countries clearly shows an increase with the beginning of the crisis in 2008. In addition, a decline is noticeable since 2010 when the crisis stopped. This has resulted in an increase of private consumption and investment, which is the reason why public spending could return to the pre-crisis period values. The efficiency of the public sector and public enterprises is not measured by the size of their profits, but by the growth rate of the economy, full employment, real income growth and its even distribution among the citizens, low inflation, budgetary equilibrium in the long-run, export and import balance and negligible external debt. The state is efficient, as far as it can efficiently organize the public sector in accordance with social goals.","[Jurcic, Ljubo; Ceh Casni, Anita] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Jurcic, L (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia.",ljjurcic@efzg.hr; aceh@efzg.hr,"Jurcic, Ljubo/I-1086-2018",,,,,,14,0,0,0,1,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2018,14.0,,,,,,579,592,,,,,,14,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9DQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470808300033,0

The paper describes the types of investment with the focus on direct foreign investment and its importance for the development of small towns as well as the development of the Croatian economy in general. The entrepreneurial infrastructure, which includes entrepreneurial zones and supporting institutions, plays a significant role in the development of small towns and the improvement of the investment climate. A large number of factors, location being the most important, helps investors make a decision in which city to invest. This paper describes ways of improving the investment climate by combining these different factors. The connectedness and quality of coordination between the national and local level is important for creating the conditions in which SMEs can further develop in small towns, which is the reason why the incentives and measures that help attract investment have been described in the paper. Strategy is a document that provides guidelines for the longterm progress of cities so the analysis of the investment environment as well as advice for its improvement have been made on the basis of the strategic documents of Slatina and Ivanec. This paper helps understand the definition of small towns and gives basic guidelines for the development of a stimulating environment for the development of SMEs, which affects the economic and social growth of small towns and their local communities.","[Hetrih, Josip] Coll Management Tourism & Informat, Virovitica, Croatia",,"Hetrih, J (通讯作者)，Coll Management Tourism & Informat, Virovitica, Croatia.",zeljka.tai@gmail.com; josip.hetrih@hotmail.com; mladena.bedekovic@vsmti.hr,"Kadlec, Željka/IWU-4599-2023","Kadlec, Željka/0000-0001-7484-4933",,,,,15,0,0,0,2,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2018,14.0,,,,,,44,63,,,,,,20,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9DQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470808300003,0

To satisfy growing public concerns about the environment, animal welfare, and personal health, animal product limiting (APL), e.g. flexitarianism, vegetarianism, and veganism, provides an alternative to the mainstream animal-based diets in the Western world. However, the exclusion of more or less animal products from the diet is done in a continual movement where the social practices of everyday life and institutionalized eating standards for (in) appropriate eating are thought to play a crucial role. The overall objective of this project is to examine how APL is done among a group of newly practicing (<12 months) flexitarians, vegetarians, and vegans in Denmark and how and why changes in dietary practices among these animal product limiters (APLs) occur over time. A practice theoretical perspective on food and eating is integrated as it opens up for a dynamic relation between the micro-social level and the material and discursive circumstances at the macro-level and emphasizes fundamental questions about how social practices are interconnected and change over time. The project builds on the claim, that more attention should be paid to the embedding of APL in social practices instead of only focusing on individual articulations of attitudes and choices in order to understand why dietary change occur among APLs.","[Kondrup, S., V] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Kondrup, SV (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",sak@ifro.ku.dk,"Kondrup, Sara Vincentzen/O-5749-2015","Kondrup, Sara Vincentzen/0000-0003-2285-6187",,,,,28,0,0,0,3,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,493,498,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_78,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000078,0

The sample affects the predictive power of these models. Usually indicated accuracy rate differs from the real predictive power of these models. The financial distress of certain businesses may be obvious even without the use of bankruptcy models. Apparent signs of financial distress may be insolvency, negative equity, VAT unreliability, negative economic result for several years in a row. Survey conducted by more than 270 companies has shown that more businesses with apparent signs of financial distress in the sample increase the reported accuracy of the bankruptcy model.

Due to a large portion of our survey air passengers (58.5%) being unwilling to pay any fee at all, the spike model was adopted with a triple bound dichotomous choice survey in order to avoid estimation errors. Two types of trip lengths, short and medium/long, were investigated to gain insights into the effects of distance on the willingness to pay (WTP) for choosing counter services.

Farmers' highest revenue was goat kid sales (70.71%), and the highest cost was female kid purchase (60.21%). Partial budget was conducted with assumed reduction in weaning period from 5.55 months to 3 months therefore the additional income was IDR 726,000. The added value from improved management was 21.94%. The overall research results showed that the reduction in weaning period was one of the techniques to improve livestock management. This can be used as a preliminary recommendation for increasing the income of Etawa crossbred goat farmers using breeding system.","[Kusumastuti, Tri Anggraeni; Widiati, Rini] Univ Gadjah Mada, Fac Anim Sci, Dept Livestock Sosio Econ, Yogyakarta, Indonesia; [Bintara, Sigit] Univ Gadjah Mada, Fac Anim Sci, Dept Anim Breeding & Reprod, Yogyakarta, Indonesia",Gadjah Mada University; Gadjah Mada University,"Kusumastuti, TA (通讯作者)，Univ Gadjah Mada, Fac Anim Sci, Dept Livestock Sosio Econ, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.",trianggraeni@ugm.ac.id; rini_w@ugm.ac.id; sigitbintara@ugm.ac.id,"Kusumastuti, Tri/HTM-3479-2023",,"Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education through Hibah Penelitian Berbasis Kompetensi (Competency Based Research Grant) [015/SP2H/LT/DRPM/II/2016]","Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education through Hibah Penelitian Berbasis Kompetensi (Competency Based Research Grant)","We thank the chairman of Agung Menoreh farmers group, Samigaluh Subdistrict, Kulon Progo Regency for their technical support throughout this study.

Today's marketing is in need of digital support in order to satisfy modern market's desires. Consumer behaviour trends and dynamic market require a specific e-approach to creating and delivering business activities: interactive communication with consumers, managing databases and information, personalized approach to consumers and integrated communication management, which requires specific know-how, therefore, marketing agencies' services are often used. Companies invest their budget in digital channels due to various benefits: results achieved, measurability, interactive communication - hence the importance of digital marketing integration in business - digital marketing provides value. The purpose of this paper was to research the role of digital marketing and agencies in modern business. As an important link between consumers and companies - agencies are involved in the process of creation and execution of creative concepts and activities in co-operation with its clients (companies). The results of aforementioned campaigns are also monitored and structured depending on client requests and needs, which are then analysed and presented, allowing companies to differentiate from its competitors - ultimately resulting in goal achievement. The study was conducted through a personal interview with the CEOs of two marketing agencies along with SWOT analyses, The results are an indication for further research of marketing agencies in Croatia. The results indicate an important role of agencies in the modern business, in terms of financial profitability when engaging experts for the campaign and expertise in creating the concept and implementation of strategies and activities - as basic benefits. Trends are in a state of constant change due to evolving technology and creative solutions that digital marketing offers, so we are seeking new know-how. Therefore, agencies are an important economic factor since they create new jobs for experts in respective fields. The quality of the agency delivered service directly affects the company's success through the better satisfaction of consumer's needs, which brings to the conclusion that they affect market relations and society.","[Lackovic, Ivana] Veleuciliste Baltazar Zapresic, Zapresic, Croatia; [Ferencek, Eugen] Oryx Grupa, Zagreb, Croatia",,"Lackovic, I (通讯作者)，Veleuciliste Baltazar Zapresic, Zapresic, Croatia.",ivanalackovic.bak@gmail.com; eugen.ferencek@gmail.com,,,,,,,21,0,0,1,11,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2018,14.0,,,,,,1276,1289,,,,,,14,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9DQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470808300069,0

We discuss first Georgescu-Roegen's neglected contributions to this subject, though he pioneered the definition of probabilistic preference in 1936 and came back on the subject intensively in the 1950s. We then present Marschak's (and his co-authors) attempts at axiomatising a probabilistic model of choice in the same period. The third contribution studied is that of Quandt, who provides a more operational style of modelling. This set of contributions is discussed against a general background of transformations of the theory of rational behaviour and of the methods proper to it.","[Lenfant, Jean-Sebastien] Univ Lille 1, Fac Sci Econ & Sociales, CLERSE, Villeneuve Dascq, France",Universite de Lille - ISITE; Universite de Lille,"Lenfant, JS (通讯作者)，Univ Lille 1, Fac Sci Econ & Sociales, CLERSE, Villeneuve Dascq, France.",jean-sebastien.lenfant@univ-lille1.fr,,,,,,,80,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

The major bilateral donors were the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Japan. A half of ODA was directed to ten African countries. Donors supported mainly social and economic sectors. In general, bilateral and multilateral foreign aid has been dominated in Africa. However, small triangular cooperation programmes, the majority of which focus on providing technical assistance in form of experts and training, have been observed in African countries. In the group of DAC donors, Japan is the most engaged in triangular development cooperation in Africa. The main pivotal countries are Brazil, China, and India.

This recent wave of work increasingly sees these institutional changes as the result of forces endogenous to the political and economic institutions of the post-war era, but it also continues to make use of the common practice of seeing history as an alternation between deterministic path dependence and contingent critical junctures. This review argues that when applied to these and similar endogenous arguments, the approach of path dependence and critical junctures is unable to empirically distinguish between deterministic and contingent processes, despite being conceptually predicated on the distinction between the two. This argument is demonstrated by showing that these arguments about the transformations of the 1970s can be flipped between deterministic and contingent explanations based on nearly the same empirical evidence. The review then addresses the recent development of gradualist' mechanisms of institutional change, like drift, layering, and conversion, to show that they do not resolve this difficulty. The review concludes by proposing a research agenda based on an alternative empirical approach specifically tailored to understanding endogenous institutional change.","[Peinert, Erik] Brown Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA",Brown University,"Peinert, E (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",erik_peinert@brown.edu,,,,,,,28,3,4,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

This article explores the distributive consequences of that strategy in Greece, Portugal, Italy, and Spain. We argue that standard measures of poverty do not capture the deterioration in living standards as fully as anchored poverty. Moreover, we show that inequality trends conceal considerable re-ranking within the income distribution: those who were rich in 2012 had got richer in 2009-12, but those who were rich in 2009 lost ground in 2009-12. We find that in all four countries the new poor include significantly fewer pensioners and more unemployed workers, and are considerably poorer than the old poor had been. We demonstrate that there was significant variation in the magnitude and design of austerity, with Italy imposing a far smaller adjustment than Spain, and Portugal achieving less inequality in spite of robust fiscal consolidation. Nevertheless, even when austerity measures were designed to reduce inequality by compressing incomes downward, their second-order macro-economic effects ultimately increased inequality (except in Portugal). In the last section, we explore the political reasons for this variation.","[Perez, Sofia A.] Boston Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Matsaganis, Manos] Politecn Milan, Milan, Italy",Boston University; Polytechnic University of Milan,"Perez, SA (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",sperez@bu.edu,"Perez, Sofia/GZL-4323-2022","Perez, Sofia/0000-0002-3294-9662; MATSAGANIS, EMMANUEL/0000-0002-0369-6280",Reconciling Economic and Social Europe project - European Research Council [340534]; European Research Council (ERC) [340534] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),Reconciling Economic and Social Europe project - European Research Council; European Research Council (ERC),"Manos Matsaganis would like to acknowledge financial support under the Reconciling Economic and Social Europe project (www.resceu.eu), funded by the European Research Council (Advanced Grant no. 340534).",,63,79,84,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

This project seeks to investigate the role of race in the context of austerity urbanism in Detroit following the subprime mortgage crisis in 2008. What is clear is that subprime lending in Detroit was explicitly a raced event. Analysis of austerity politics in Detroit demonstrates that the city is clearly spatially divided along racialised lines. Black city pensioners, former public sector employees, and deliquent taxpayers' were blamed for Detroit's municipal bankruptcy in narratives centering on their bloated and generous benefits during the city's financial decline. The policy outcomes of austerity programmes during the city's financial crisis impacted racialised, poor communities, specifically the outcomes of privatising the city's water services that led to state-sanctioned water shut-offs. This paper explores the ways in which race figures in the causes (race-based credit redlining/subprime super-inclusion lending practices) in the way the crisis was narrated to wrongly apportion blame to the racialised poor and city pensioners, and in the effects of the crisis, where water shut-offs wrought punishment on the racialised poor.","[Phinney, Sarah] Univ Manchester, Sch Environm Educ & Dev, Geog, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Phinney, S (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Environm Educ & Dev, Geog, Manchester, Lancs, England.",sarahmphin@gmail.com,,,,,,,59,17,20,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Having accepted the PS or ITA incentive, aquaculture farms are eligible to apply for ACA. The ACA on capital expenditure is to be depreciated fully within 3 years. The result showed IRR with PS and ACA has increased to 46 % on P. vannamei, 64 % on Grouper and IRR with ITA and ACA has increased to 40% on Barramundi.

In human medicine, clinical ethics support services have long been established with the purpose of assisting health professionals when they are confronted with ethical questions and concerns. These services help identify and analyse the value conflicts and uncertainties of the parties involved, which often originate from insecurities in regard to patient care, problems within the clinic team or financial issues. Two main methods for clinical ethics support services - 'Moral Case Deliberation' and 'Clinical Ethics Consultations' - can be distinguished. They differ in terms of the function and the aspired goal of the consultation. An Equine Hospital Ethics Working Group was established at the University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna in 2015. This group mainly follows the clinical ethics consultation in a small group, whereby an ethicist, veterinarians and animal caretakers participate in the meetings. The group meets when potentially problematic patients are identified, for whom questions regarding life-death, suffering and quality of life questions arise. Involved veterinarians, animal caretakers and the head of the equine clinic meet with an expert from the field of philosophy in order to explore and discuss a complex case from different points of view, identify and structure responsibilities and try to find a consensus or compromise regarding further diagnostics and therapies among all participants in the discussed clinical cases. Based on the experiences with this established working group, the paper demonstrates possibilities and used methods of clinical ethics support services at the equine hospital of the Vetmeduni, Vienna.","[Springer, S.; Grimm, H.] Messerli Res Inst, Unit Eth & Human Anim Studies, Vet Pl 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria; [Auer, U.] Vetmeduni, Clin Unit Anaesthesiol & Perioperat Intens Care M, Vet Pl 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria; [Jenner, F.] Vetmeduni, Univ Equine Hosp, Vet Pl 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria",University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna; University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna; University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna,"Springer, S (通讯作者)，Messerli Res Inst, Unit Eth & Human Anim Studies, Vet Pl 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria.",svenja.springer@vetmeduni.ac.at,,"Ulrike, Auer/0000-0003-0390-2678",,,,,12,5,5,0,4,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,308,313,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_48,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000048,0

Next, a Bayesian VAR model for the macroeconomy, with priors on the steady states, is augmented with these financial variables and estimated using Swedish data for 1989-2015. The results support three conclusions. First, the financial system is important and the strength of the results is dependent on identification, with the financial variables accounting for 10-25 % of the forecast error variance of Swedish GDP growth. Second, the suggested model produces an earlier signal regarding the probability of recession, compared to a model without financial variables. Third, the model's forecasts for the deep downturn in 2008 and 2009, conditional on the development of the financial variables, outperform a macro-model that lacks financial variables. Furthermore, this improvement in modelling Swedish GDP growth during the financial crisis does not come at the expense of unconditional predictive power. Taken together, the results suggest that the proposed model presents an accessible possibility to analyse the macro-financial linkages and the GDP developments, especially during a financial crisis.","[Ankargren, Sebastian] Uppsala Univ, Dept Stat, Box 513, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden; [Bjellerup, Marten] Swedish Natl Debt Off, S-10374 Stockholm, Sweden; [Shahnazarian, Hovick] Minist Finance, S-10333 Stockholm, Sweden",Uppsala University,"Ankargren, S (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, Dept Stat, Box 513, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden.",Sebastian.Ankargren@statistics.uu.se,,"Ankargren, Sebastian/0000-0003-4415-8734",,,,,65,6,6,0,12,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

We analyse a sample of 1079 Chinese firms in the materials and industrial sectors and find that higher ethnic heterogeneity negatively impacts on firm financial performance in these sectors.

Building on the extensive literature on conditional lending, we outline several pathways through which IMF program participation might affect the levels of democracy in borrowing countries - including a new variant that suggests the possibility of a positive association between lending program participation and democracy scores. In order to test the argument we assemble annual data from 120 low- and middle-income countries observed (at maximum) in each year between 1971 and 2007. We use three strategies - genetic matching, instrumental variables, and difference-in-differences estimation - to better estimate the direction and size of the statistical association between participation in IMF lending programs and the level of democracy. We find evidence for modest but definitively positive conditional differences in the democracy scores of participating and non-participating countries.","[Nelson, Stephen C.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Wallace, Geoffrey P.

To fill this gap, this article compares the impact of ambivalence and indifference on turnout with that of positive and negative attitudes. Using multilevel logit regression, it demonstrates that ambivalence increased the odds of turnout in the 2004 and 2009 European Parliament elections compared to both negative and indifferent attitudes. However, ambivalence only increases the possibility of turnout if the number of positive thoughts about the EU is equal to or higher than the number of negative thoughts. Having a greater number of negative thoughts, in contrast, does not discourage turnout. The paper concludes that one-dimensional measures of EU attitudes are over-simplistic and fail to provide a complete description of European voting behaviour.","[Kentmen-Cin, Cigdem] Izmir Univ Econ, Izmir, Turkey",Izmir Ekonomi Universitesi,"Kentmen-Cin, C (通讯作者)，Izmir Univ Econ, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Sakarya Cad 156, TR-35330 Izmir, Turkey.",cigdem.kentmen@ieu.edu.tr,"Kentmen-Cin, Cigdem/AAP-1086-2021","Kentmen-Cin, Cigdem/0000-0003-0081-8868",Turkish Academy of Sciences (TUBA) in the framework of the Young Scientist Award Program (GEBIP),Turkish Academy of Sciences (TUBA) in the framework of the Young Scientist Award Program (GEBIP),This work was supported by the Turkish Academy of Sciences (TUBA) in the framework of the Young Scientist Award Program (GEBIP).,,38,6,6,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

I use a semi-parametric regression model to aid identification of cost factors by decomposing time-varying and cross-sectional components. I find that the use of Chinese manufactured panels are associated with costs that are 6% lower. Economies of scale at the local level (number of yearly installations in a zip code) and at the installation level (size of the installation) are also associated with lower costs. Higher subsidies, and higher contractor market-share are associated with higher costs.

Different from earlier studies, we aim to gauge the impact of technical change on the overall inequality, not just a particular component of inequality. This is achieved by establishing that the labour share of income is negatively correlated with overall inequality as indicated by the popular Gini coefficient and by modelling the labour share of income as a function of technical change. The empirical model of labour share of income is estimated using 1978-2012 provincial panel data from China. The main estimation results show that technical change in China had been mostly capital-biased. It contributed to the successive reductions in China's labour share of income and thus rapid rises in income inequality.","[Zhang, Xun] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Stat, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xun] Shanghai Finance Inst, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wan, Guanghua] Asian Dev Bank, Manila, Philippines; [Wang, Chen] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Urban & Reg Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chen] Leiden Univ, Leiden, Netherlands; [Luo, Zhi] Wuhan Univ, Econ Dev Res Ctr, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Luo, Zhi] Wuhan Univ, Econ & Management Sch, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University; Asian Development Bank; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Wuhan University; Wuhan University,"Luo, Z (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ, Econ Dev Res Ctr, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.;Luo, Z (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ, Econ & Management Sch, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",,,"Zhang, Xun/0000-0002-1991-4975","Bairen Program of Yunnan Province; NSF of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [71133004, 71373186, 71603026]; National Social Science Foundation of China [15ZDA027, 16ZDA006]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2015M580055, 2016M591645, 2016T90048]; Youth Scholars Program of Beijing Normal University; Shanghai Pujiang Program [17PJC045]; [13JZD008]",Bairen Program of Yunnan Province; NSF of the National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Youth Scholars Program of Beijing Normal University; Shanghai Pujiang Program(Shanghai Pujiang Program);,"This paper was funded by Bairen Program of Yunnan Province and the NSF Projects 71133004, 71373186 and 71603026 of the National Natural Science Foundation of China.

A thorough understanding of the phenomenon promises to further our understanding as to the nature of performance production under pressure. In traditional home advantage studies, it is difficult to isolate the net crowd effect upon relative team performance. In a typical sports setting, multiple factors change at once for a visiting team. Experimental evidence suggests that supportive crowds may hinder task performance. In that it serves as home stadium to two National Basketball Association teams, the Staples Center in Los Angeles offers a rare natural experiment through which to isolate the crowd effect upon competitive output. Each team possesses equivalent familiarity with built environment, and teams face similarly sparse travel demands prior to games between one another. However, the team designated as home team in a contest enjoys a largely sympathetic crowd due primarily to season ticket sales. Moreover, crowd effects are sizable in motivating a home team win, raising the likelihood of such an event by between an estimated 21 and 22.8 percentage points. The point estimate implies that essentially the entire home advantage between the two teams is attributable to the crowd effect.","[Boudreaux, Christopher J.] Texas A&M Int Univ, Div Int Banking & Finance, 5201 Univ Blvd,WHTC 217c, Laredo, TX 78041 USA; [Sanders, Shane D.; Walia, Bhavneet] Western Illinois Univ, Dept Econ & Decis Sci, Macomb, IL 61455 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M International University; Western Illinois University,"Boudreaux, CJ (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Int Univ, Div Int Banking & Finance, 5201 Univ Blvd,WHTC 217c, Laredo, TX 78041 USA.",cboudreaux@tamiu.edu,,,,,,,31,22,24,5,34,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

Our theory shows that the elasticity of land price with respect to the floor area ratio (FAR), a building height indicator, is a measure of the regulation's stringency (the extent to which FAR is kept below the free-market level). Using a national sample, estimation allowing this elasticity to be city-specific shows variation in the stringency of FAR regulation across Chinese cities.

Comparatively little attention has been paid to understanding the usefulness of PSS for planning practice and studying its application in real-world planning situations. This paper aims to address this omission. Conceptually, usefulness is subdivided in seven dimensions, and explained by the usability and utility of the PSS. This framework is applied to a case study with Urban Strategy a PSS based on combined environmental and traffic models. A workshop with this PSS was studied using a questionnaire, interviews and observations. The findings indicate that in addition to the more commonly used concept of usability, utility (understood as task technology fit) is helpful to understand the usefulness of a PSS application. This concept, for instance, helps to indicate when a PSS has a negative effect on planning tasks. Moreover, in addition to usability and utility, context turned out to be critical to understand the usefulness of a PSS application.

We extend the empirical literature on the impact of sudden stops on GDP by proposing an alternative econometric approach which is multivariate, nonlinear and uses a novel way to identify sudden stops. We estimate a Markov switching vector autoregression with a latent variable indicating whether the economy is in a sudden stop regime. We use the maximum fraction of forecast error variance approach for partial structural identification of the vector autoregression model. Beyond confirming findings from the existing empirical literature on sudden stops, our results additionally show that (i) sudden stops are associated with regime switches (i.e., breaks in the behavior of economic variables), which have significantly negative and permanent effects on GDP; (ii) impulse responses to net capital inflow shocks are regime dependent with economies being more vulnerable to shocks during the sudden stop regime; and (iii) there were different main drivers of the output decline in historical sudden stop episodes.","[Bachmann, Andreas] Univ Bern, Dept Econ, Schanzeneckstr 1,POB 8573, CH-3001 Bern, Switzerland; [Leist, Stefan] State Secretariat Econ Affairs SECO, Holzikofenweg 36, CH-3003 Bern, Switzerland",University of Bern,"Bachmann, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, Dept Econ, Schanzeneckstr 1,POB 8573, CH-3001 Bern, Switzerland.",andreas.bachmann@vwi.unibe.ch,,,,,,,38,0,0,0,4,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

But homeowners do not know the value of their house for certain until they sell, so while they live in their home they must rely on local house price data to estimate its value. This article uses data from the recent housing boom and bust to demonstrate that changes in households' self-assessed home values are strongly consistent with the predictions of a model in which households optimally filter available house price data. Specifically, we show that self-assessed house prices did not increase as rapidly as house price indexes during the boom and did not decline as severely during the bust. A Kalman filter model nearly perfectly replicates these data. These findings have direct implications for economists studying asking prices during booms and busts, optimal default decisions and other key housing-related phenomena.","[Davis, Morris A.] Rutgers State Univ, Rutgers Business Sch, Dept Finance & Econ, 494 Broad St,3rd Floor Suite 300, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; [Quintin, Erwan] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Real Estate & Urban Land Econ, 5257 Grainger Hall, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Rutgers University Newark; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Davis, MA (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Rutgers Business Sch, Dept Finance & Econ, 494 Broad St,3rd Floor Suite 300, Newark, NJ 07102 USA.",morris.a.davis@rutgers.edu; equintin@bus.wisc.edu,,,,,,,18,11,11,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,FAL,2017,45.0,3,,,,,628,649,,10.1111/1540-6229.12168,0.0,,,22,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,FF9TJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000409359900003,0

The two applicants differ with respect to characteristics such as gender, age, education, work experience, ethnicity, religious beliefs, family situation, weight, and health, but otherwise have similar characteristics as the previous employee. Our results show that employers prefer not to recruit applicants who are old, non-European, Muslim, Jewish, obese, have several children, or have a history of sickness absence.

We compare these two policies under the assumptions that individuals are heterogeneous in their skill level as well as in their skill type, and that individuals of one skill type, say scientists, confer a positive externality on overall productivity whereas individuals of the other skill type, say managers, do not confer such an externality. We-find that a uniform entry fee encourages self-selection such that the migrants are only or mostly highly skilled managers. The (near) absence of migrant scientists has a negative effect on the productivity of the country's workforce. Under a quota: the migrants are (a) only averagely skilled managers if the productivity externality generated by the scientists is weak, or (b) only averagely skilled scientists if the productivity externality generated by the scientists is strong. In (a), a uniform entry fee is preferable to a quota. In (b), a quota is preferable to a uniform entry fee. If, however, the entry fee for scientists is sufficiently below the entry fee for managers, then migrants will be only or mostly highly skilled scientists, rendering a differentiated entry fee preferable to a quota even when the productivity externality is strong. Instituting a differentiated fee comes, though, at a cost: the fee revenue is not as high as it will be when migrants are only or mostly managers. We conclude that if maximizing the revenue from the entry fee is not the primary objective of the developed country, then a differentiated entry fee is the preferred policy.","[Stark, Oded] Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany; [Byra, Lukasz] Univ Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland; [Casarico, Alessandra] Univ Bocconi, CESifo, Milan, Italy; [Uebelmesser, Silke] Univ Jena, CESifo, Jena, Germany",University of Bonn; University of Warsaw; Bocconi University; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Ifo Institut,"Stark, O (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, ZEF, Walter Flex Str 3, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",ostark@uni-bonn.de,"Byra, Łukasz/ABB-1563-2020","Byra, Łukasz/0000-0003-1935-7264; Uebelmesser, Silke/0000-0001-5889-9061",,,,,30,2,3,1,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

Most studies have concentrated either on the factors determining compliance with Directives or on the processes leading Member States to applying soft law provisions. Little attention has however been paid to the determinants of the implementation of soft law. Hence the focus of this paper: why do Member States implement EU outputs if they have no legal obligation to do so? The present study delves into the implementation of a soft instrument, the European fund for the integration of foreigners, and explains Member States' response to it through a policy-specific mechanism. I show that when there is little possibility of oversight from above, government preferences are not constrained by Commission but by public opinion and organized civil society.

The behavior of truck deliveries is distinctly different from commuter parking: trucks do not cruise for parking spaces, and demand for goods delivery is driven by customers and is practically inelastic to the delivery costs. We generalize the downtown on-street parking model from Arnott and Inci (2006) to study the relationship between passenger vehicles' parking and truck delivery behaviors, and provide tools for policy makers to optimize the trade-offs in parking space allocation, pricing, and aggregate network congestion. The social optimum can be obtained by solving a nonlinear optimization problem. The parking model is able to replicate the commuter-only scenario as a special case. It is shown that ignoring truck delivery behavior can significantly overestimate travel speeds and cruising stock. We applied the model to a case study of downtown Toronto and found that compared to a baseline scenario representative of Toronto in 2015, increasing parking fees from CAD $4/h to nearly CAD $7.85/h and assigning 4.1% of parking spaces to truck deliveries would eliminate cruising and truck double-parking, resulting in a social surplus gain of over CAD $14,304/h/ mile(2). In a first-best allocation scenario where total parking spaces can also change, we found that increasing total parking spaces by 18%, having 3.5% truck delivery allocation, and reducing parking fees to CAD $2.47/h would eliminate cruising and double-parking while increasing social surplus by CAD $24,883 /h/mile(2). These model findings are along the same level of effect as demonstrated in the literature. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Significant negative associations were also observed in panel data, pooled OLS, and random effects models for community trust (-0.024; -0.010) and cohabitation (-0.040; -0.032). Fixed-effects models also showed significant negative effects for cohabitation (-0.018).

The reform brought in significant changes in the industrial structures for exporters from the south, including India. Has the labour-intensive high-employment textile and clothing industry in India benefited from this global move towards freer trade? For India, the industry has witnessed unprecedented market concentration of export-oriented firms. Firm-level empirical estimate illustrates that workers in the export-oriented firms in India are adversely affected due to withdrawal of quota. Accumulation of net fixed assets and growth of sales impart positive impact on firm-level wages that cannot outweigh negative impact due to fall in exports. We also find negative impact of profit on aggregate wage bill for the industry with firms spread over 11 major states in India.

However, energy efficiency improvements can lead to changes in the demand for energy services that offset some of the achieved energy savings in the form of rebound effects. Consequently, forecasts of energy savings can be overstated. This paper analyses the energy efficiency and rebound effects for road freight transport in 15 European countries during the 1992-2012 period. We use a recent methodology to estimate an energy demand function using a stochastic frontier analysis approach and examine the influence of key features of rebound effect in the road freight transport sector. We obtain, on average, a fuel efficiency of 89% and a rebound effect of 4%. Our results indicate that the achieved energy efficiencies are retained to a large extent. We also find, among other results, that the rebound effect is higher in countries with higher fuel efficiency and better quality of logistics. Finally, a simulation analysis shows significant environmental externalities costs even in countries with lower rebound effect. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

While a growing body of literature has sought to offer information on consumer stated preferences for EVs, to date no research has examined how preferences for hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and battery electric vehicles are shaped by vehicle body size or type. The automobile market is differentiated with vehicle attributes that respond to heterogeneous consumer demands. We hypothesize that each bundle of attributes as it relates to vehicle body size also shapes demand for EVs. Using a large primary dataset, we segment respondents according to their preferred next vehicle body type (economy, intermediate, full-size sedan, luxury, minivan, sport utility, and pickup). Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) results show significant differences in the socioeconomic, demographic, and psychological profile of consumers across the seven vehicle segments. From this, discrete choice models detail how vehicle type plays a significant role in the choicemaking behaviour of potential EV consumers. While factors like age, education, and the importance of fuel economy and reduced or eliminated emissions generally play a consistent role in improving the utility of EVs, our results also reveal significant heterogeneity in choice of powertrain across vehicle segments, with luxury and pickup buyers among the most distinct. The results offer useful information for marketing, policy, and research. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

How ego-centric anchoring biases experts' perceptions of travel patterns",TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Ego-centric anchoring; Heuristics; Travel behavior; Bias; Millennials; Baby boomer,MILLENNIALS,"Transport professional process an enormous range of information to help them accurately predict how, when and where people will use the transport system. Yet we know from a long-standing history of psychology research that people draw upon a range of mental shortcuts when making estimates about the world. Ego-centric anchoring and adjustment is a common example of a mental heuristic whereby people draw upon their own beliefs and experiences when estimating the behaviors and attitudes of others. Do transport professionals use ego-centric anchoring when estimating travel patterns? To find out we conducted a survey of transportation professionals (n = 247) who were asked to reveal their own travel patterns and residential location and to estimate the travel patterns of millennials, generation X, and baby boomers. We find that relative to the average American, transportation professionals in the US are more likely to use alternative transport modes and live in more urban neighborhoods. Transportation professionals systematically over-estimate the use of alternative modes (and under-estimate driving) among other Americans. This effect is strongest among transportation professionals who themselves are multi-modal. These results raise a note of caution for transport practitioners and policy-makers to be aware of one's initial 'anchor' of personal experience when judging the behavior and desires of the community. For example if practitioners overestimate the proportion of Americans that are already walking, biking, and using transit, they may under-estimate the policy and institutional barriers that have led the majority of Americans to follow the car-dominated path of previous generations.

This paper investigates the relationship between fiscal decentralisation and economy-wide disposable income inequality. Drawing on a dataset of up to 20 OECD countries and covering the period 1996 to 2011, the analysis links a set of income inequality indicators and a wide array of fiscal decentralisation indicators. Results indicate that decentralisation might actually reduce income inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, but the effect is rather small and unstable across specifications. Fine-graining the analysis by using income percentile ratios, in turn, produces more significant and stable results. As such, the effects of fiscal decentralisation are not the same along the income distribution. While decentralisation tends to be associated with a reduction in income inequality between high incomes and the median, it is linked to a divergence of low income groups from the median, notably via sub-central tax autonomy. Transfers between levels of government also tend to be associated with an increase in the gap between lower and middle incomes. Interpreting these effects jointly, it seems that mainly middle income earners benefit from fiscal decentralisation.","[Blochliger, Hansjorg] OECD, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, F-75775 Paris 16, France; [Stossberg, Sibylle] Bundesministerium Finanzen, Wilhelmstr 97, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Blöchliger, H (通讯作者)，OECD, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, F-75775 Paris 16, France.",sibylle.stossberg@bmf.bund.de; HansJoerg.BLOECHLIGER@oecd.org,,,,,,,48,6,6,0,19,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

The analysis finds that an increase in family income significantly raises children's height-for-age z-scores.

A recent convex optimization reformulation of the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator of Kiefer and Wolfowitz (Annals of Mathematical Statistics 1956; 27: 887-906) is employed to construct nonparametric Bayes rules for compound decisions. The methods are illustrated with an application to predict baseball batting averages, and the age profile of batting performance. An important aspect of the empirical application is the general bivariate specification of the distribution of heterogeneous location and scale effects for players that exhibits a weak positive association between location and scale attributes. Prediction of players' batting averages for 2012 based on performance in the prior decade using the proposed methods shows substantially improved performance over more naive methods with more restrictive treatment of unobserved heterogeneity. Comparisons are also made with nonparametric Bayesian methods based on Dirichlet process priors, which can be viewed as a regularized, or smoothed, version of the Kiefer-Wolfowitz method.

We propose the use of regime-switching models to address these issues. Our regime switching model uses price data to infer whether pricing is oil-driven (integrated) or gas-specific (decoupled). We find that UK natural gas (NBP) and oil (Brent) are cointegrated for the majority of the sample considered (1997-2014). UK gas prices tend to decouple during fall and early winter, when they increase relative to oil consistent with seasonal demand for natural gas creating gas-specific pricing. When evidence favors integrated markets, we find that the industry 10-1 rule-of-thumb holds (the value of one MMbtu of natural gas in the UK market is one tenth the value of one barrel of Brent oil), while the overall relationship, including decoupling periods, is 9.2-1.

This article offers the first systematic and comparative analysis of the role of electoral institutions in shaping county-level allocations of SIF. Drawing on theories of distributive politics and federalism, this article argues that electoral institutions provide politicians in the executive branch of national government with incentives to use at least a part of the SIF to buy votes in NUTS 3-level counties, whereby vote-buying is more common under majority voting than under proportional representation. The results of a statistical analysis of SIF allocations across 202 Italian and French NUTS 3-level counties during 2007-13 confirm this argument. The article concludes by discussing the findings and their implications for future research on EU budgetary implementation and cohesion policy.","[Dellmuth, Lisa Maria] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Schraff, Dominik] Univ St Gallen, St Gallen, Switzerland; [Stoffel, Michael F.] Univ Konstanz, Constance, Germany",Stockholm University; University of St Gallen; University of Konstanz,"Dellmuth, LM (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Dept Polit Sci, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",lisa.dellmuth@statsvet.su.se,"Schraff, Dominik/I-4939-2019; Dellmuth, Lisa/AFR-8126-2022","Schraff, Dominik/0000-0003-3386-1352; Dellmuth, Lisa/0000-0002-1298-8525",Regional Studies Association,Regional Studies Association,Earlier versions of this article were presented at the 8th Annual Conference on the Political Economy of International Organizations in Berlin 2014 and the ECPR Annual Conference in Glasgow 2014.

We find strong evidence for such a linkage, although the effect is small: at the average rate of services input intensity, a 10 per cent improvement in services productivity is associated with an increase in manufacturing productivity of 0.3 per cent. Services trade restrictiveness indices are found to be a statistically significant determinant of manufactured exports performance, a finding that is robust to the inclusion of the overall level of trade restrictiveness that is applied against manufactured exports directly. The main channel through which services trade restrictions negatively affect manufactured exports is through FDI, a finding that is consistent with the stylised fact in the literature that FDI is a key channel for trade in services and an important vehicle through which services technology and know-how is transferred across countries. At the sectoral level, restrictions on transport and retail distribution services have the largest negative impact on exports of manufactures.","[Hoekman, Bernard] EUI, Fiesole, Italy; [Hoekman, Bernard] CEPR, Fiesole, Italy; [Shepherd, Ben] Dev Trade Consultants, New York, NY USA",European University Institute,"Hoekman, B (通讯作者)，EUI, Fiesole, Italy.;Hoekman, B (通讯作者)，CEPR, Fiesole, Italy.",,,,,,,,37,44,48,4,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAR,2017,40.0,3,,,SI,,499,516,,10.1111/twec.12333,0.0,,,18,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,EP6OZ,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397500100002,0

Human rights law was designed for states, not for NGOs, and how it would be applied to NGOs is far from obvious.

The increasing demand for transport, the growing number of vehicles on the road, and the improvement of road infrastructure in large cities are some of the trends that need to be addressed by government agencies and society as a whole. Public transport services should play an important role, providing high quality services for users, being more attractive to potential users, and providing an efficient use of urban space. However it is necessary to understand how users evaluate the available services by evaluating the objective and subjective aspects involved in the perception of service quality. The present study aims to develop a multi-criteria model to assess urban public transport, with an approach centered on user perceptions. Through the use of multi-criteria evaluation, it is possible to identify the objective and subjective factors that determine a user's opinion of the service, enabling improvements.

We show how the discrete time proportional odds (DTPO) cancellation model can be rewritten as an equivalent fixed parameter discrete choice model that can be easily estimated using Bayesian methods and extended to random parameters that account for unobserved heterogeneity. The use of Bayesian methods allows us to address several limitations of existing airline cancellation models. First, because of the random parameter reformulation, it is possible to calculate individual specific cancellation probabilities. Second, unlike existing DTPO models that forecast average cancellation probabilities only, our model can be used to forecast both means and a measure of variance (credible intervals) associated with an individual's cancellation probability. We apply the Bayesian estimation method to a dataset of tickets purchased over a two-year period by employees of a university in Atlanta, Georgia. During this time period, the major carrier in Atlanta terminated an agreement in which it allowed employees to purchase discounted fares that could be refunded or exchanged without a fee. The data allow us to investigate how passenger cancellation behavior changed when these fares were discontinued. Cancellations are reduced on average 3.3% when customers must pay to exchange their tickets. For a simulated hypothetical flight the coefficient of variation of cancellation is 43% when the state rate was offered, and 83% without state rates. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet past studies have failed to distinguish among different types of social capital and have relied on inaccurate measures of economic health. This study reexamines what has become conventional wisdom by analyzing the social capital of American metropolitan areas and its impact on economic well-being. It improves on past studies by examining different types of social capital (i.e., trust, group membership, social networks) and substituting the change in competitive-advantage jobs from shift-share analysis for total job growth and other traditional economic development measures of wealth creation. The study finds that bridging social capital positively affects the economic welfare of communities with respect to job creation.","[Engbers, Trent] Univ Southern Indiana, 8600 Univ Blvd, Evansville, IN 47712 USA; [Rubin, Barry M.] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN USA; [Aubuchon, Craig] Anal Grp, Boston, MA USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Analysis Group Inc.,"Engbers, T (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Indiana, Dept Polit Sci & Publ Adm, 8600 Univ Blvd, Trent, IN 47712 USA.",taengbers@usi.edu,,,,,,,69,12,15,2,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

The phenomenon of underemployment has, however, received markedly less attention, although it too increased in extent following the start of the crisis. This article considers the consequences of underemployment for the subjective well-being of UK employees. Drawing on data from the 2006 and 2012 Employment and Skills Surveys, the article assesses how the Great Recession affected relationships between different dimensions of underemployment and well-being. The findings demonstrate that the negative well-being consequences of workers' dissatisfaction with opportunities to make use of their abilities became more substantial, as did the consequences of being hours constrained' and having an unsatisfactory workload. The article also shows that the economic crisis had a negative impact on the well-being of employees who work very long hours.","[Heyes, Jason] Univ Sheffield, Management Sch, Employment Relat, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Heyes, Jason] Univ Sheffield, Management Sch, WOERRC, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Tomlinson, Mark] Univ Sheffield, Sociol Studies Dept, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; Univ Sheffield, Human Geog, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield; University of Sheffield; University of Sheffield; University of Sheffield,"Heyes, J (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Management, Conduit Rd, Sheffield S10 1FL, S Yorkshire, England.",j.heyes@sheffield.ac.uk,,"WHITWORTH, ADAM/0000-0001-6119-9373",,,,,53,43,45,0,58,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

This article offers a supply-side explanation for this deviant debt trajectory by tracing the historical evolution of retail banking in the German political economy. It argues that at the end of the 1990s and in the light of European Monetary Union, profitability issues and banking fragmentation became severe enough to interrupt the path towards credit-based financialisation as prevalent among other capitalist economies. These factors interacted with a traditional lack of tools and incentives for rapid credit expansion, even though they were renegotiated in the processes of financial liberalisation, internationalisation and innovation. By employing historical-qualitative as well as statistical evidence for the argument, the paper's contribution becomes twofold. First, it introduces and conceptualises retail banking as a focal point in the analysis of national financial systems and their transformation. Second, it complicates the standard accounts of German non-financialisation and reveals the contested' character of financial reform.","[Mertens, Daniel] Goethe Univ, Inst Polit Wissensch, Theodor W Adorno Pl 6, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Mertens, D (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ, Inst Polit Wissensch, Theodor W Adorno Pl 6, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany.",mertens@soz.uni-frankfurt.de,,"Mertens, Daniel/0000-0002-2194-8293",,,,,77,24,24,0,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

In the specific context of vehicle weight permitting for highway bridges, past determinations have typically relied largely on bridge damage simulation using theoretical relationships between the loading and failure modes. Unlike the theory-based simulations, empirical data analysis uses observed field data and therefore are expected to yield more intuitive insights about the actual relationship between in-service loading patterns and their damage (and the cost of repair thereof). A few past studies have used such empirical approaches with some success but have generally been stymied by practical considerations including the lack of adequate translational relationships between the vehicles operating on the road and the vehicle classes typically considered in load analysis. Also, the overweight (OW) cost differences across different bridges attributes (material type, design type, functional class, and age) remain to be investigated. In a bid to overcome these limitations, this paper uses observed in-service data for vehicle loads and the life-cycle costs associated with bridge deterioration repair. The proposed methodology includes a technique that correlates AASHTO design vehicles to FHWA vehicle classes, estimates the total life-cycle cost of bridge upkeep, and allocates this cost to each user group (vehicle class) based on the axle configuration and usage frequency (vehicle-miles travelled) of that class. For each vehicle class, the marginal cost of bridge damage is determined on the basis of the incremental cost responsibility (as a result of adding that vehicle class to the traffic stream) and the typical traffic volume of that vehicle class, and were found to range from $0.01 to as much as $36.35 per ft. length per pass of bridge, depending on OW class, and bridge functional class, material type, and age. The paper quantifies the extent to which bridge damage cost due to an overweight truck is influenced by the attributes of the truck and the bridge. The results can be of help to agencies seeking to formulate, update, or evaluate current or future OW permitting policies from the perspective of highway bridge damage among other impacts. This effort is considered timely in the current era when several highway agencies are considering relaxation of their OW permitting policies as a part of efforts to project a business-friendly image in a bid to spur economic development in their states.

Finally, we investigate the economic value of our forecasts in a portfolio selection exercise and find that in certain cases an investor is willing to pay a considerable amount in order get access to our forecasts.

However, such models contain thousands of equations and cannot readily be incorporated into computerized systems to yield rapid estimates of economic impacts of various types of transportation system failures due to natural hazards, terrorist attacks or technological accidents. This paper presents a reduced-form approach to simplify the analytical content of CGE models and make them more transparent and enhance their utilization potential. The reduced-form CGE analysis is conducted by first running simulations one hundred times, varying key parameters, such as the magnitude of the initial shock, duration, location, behavioral responses, and resilience, according to a Latin Hypercube sampling procedure. Statistical analysis is then applied to the synthetic data results in the form of both ordinary least-squares and quantile regression. The analysis yields linear equations that are incorporated into a computerized system and utilized along with Monte Carlo simulation methods for propagating uncertainties in economic consequences. Although our demonstration and discussion focuses on aviation system disruptions caused by terrorist attacks, the approach can be applied to a broad range of threat scenarios. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In our study, we analyse the criteria of the lawfulness as found in the economic parts of Ibn Rushd's work entitled Bidayat al-mujtahid wa nihayat al-muqtasid (English translation: The Distinguished Jurist's Primer). Our thesis is inspired essentially by Raymond De Roover's studies on the economic thought in the Middle Ages. De Roover shows that the criteria for lawfulness are to be found in the nature of the contract between partners: a gain is lawful if the contract which generates it is lawful.

Our research is based on the qualitative research method particularly focused on a phenomenological approach. To conduct the survey, we used such methods of data collection as randomly face-to-face interviews with social entrepreneurs and an online Google questionnaire. Our findings show that the motives of social entrepreneurs are not completely similar across regions, but more different between age groups. Young people are looking for enjoyment, networking and to get experience. Adults are led by their passion and need for professional fulfillment (to apply their experience). The regions matter a lot for motives' prioritization. The research results may provide a basis for further empirical studies on social entrepreneurs' motives in the context of generation, gender and training.","[Fomina, Yulia] Dostoevsky Omsk State Univ, Omsk, Russia; [Fomina, Yulia] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Jena, Germany; [Basit, Shoaib Abdul] Tech Univ Chemnitz, Chemnitz, Germany",Dostoevsky Omsk State University; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Technische Universitat Chemnitz,"Fomina, Y (通讯作者)，Dostoevsky Omsk State Univ, Omsk, Russia.;Fomina, Y (通讯作者)，Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Jena, Germany.",Fomina-u-a@yandex.ru; shoaibkherani_iiui@yahoo.com,"Fomina, Yulia/JZD-6954-2024",,,,,,21,0,0,2,10,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,661,669,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8CX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427987300066,0

While there is an extensive literature assessing the successes and failures of international sanctions on the economies of both those imposing and targeted by sanctions on a macroeconomic level, we are more interested in trying to understand the corporate response - i.e. which firms evaluate the introduction and increasing scale of economic sanctions as a threat to their corporate strategy, and their possible reactions aimed at adjusting to a changing environment due to the geopolitical shock. Our research, based on a recent survey of manufacturing companies, provides evidence that over the last decade Russian manufacturing firms have become much more integrated into the global economy than is commonly assumed, through foreign direct investment, foreign trade (including imports of both technological equipment and raw materials and components), international partnerships, and by extensively supplying foreign companies that operate in Russia. Considering the self-selection effect of the top-performing firms in terms of foreign trade, we can state that sanctions could prove most harmful not only for the targeted firms, but for the entire population of better-performing and globalized firms involved in foreign trade with the EU and Ukraine. Thus, the impact of the sanctions on the prospects of the Russian manufacturing sector may be very strong over the medium-to-long term.","[Golikova, Victoria; Kuznetsov, Boris] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Inst Ind & Market Studies, Moscow, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Golikova, V (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Inst Ind & Market Studies, Moscow, Russia.",victoria@hse.ru,,,Basic Research Program at the National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE),Basic Research Program at the National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE),This work was financially supported by Basic Research Program at the National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE).,,39,23,26,3,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

We compare the performance of the SSA-based models with classical and Bayesian variants of the autoregressive (AR) and vector AR models. Using an out-of-sample period of 1979:8-2014:6, given an in-sample period of 1973:1-1979:7, we find that the UVVSSA is the best performing model for the aggregate US home sales, while the MV versions of the RSSA is the outright favorite in forecasting home sales for all the four census regions.

Organisational success depends largely on the quality of communication. The latter is built up by employees with their communication skills, which are crucial in all segments of company operations. It is important to develop these skills as they can have a significant impact on company performance. Disagreement between two or more participants can escalate into conflict. In organisations with large number of employees disagreement is to be expected.

To compensate for anticipated delays and improve on-time performance, Aircraft Operators usually embed a buffer time in their schedules. The current practice for allocating ATFM delays does not take into account if flights have any remaining schedule buffer to absorb ATFM delay and reduce delay propagation to subsequent flights. Furthermore, the policy presently employed is to minimize ATFM delays, an order of magnitude of half a minute per flight, while propagated delays are approximately ten times higher. In this paper, we explore the possibility to control ATFM delay distribution in a way so as to minimize delay propagated to subsequent flights, but also to increase flights' adherence to airport slots at coordinated airports. To this aim, we propose a two-level mixed-integer optimization model to solve en-route demand-capacity imbalance problem and further improve airport slot adherence. The rationales behind the research are drawn from practical experience, while the model proposed is compatible with the one currently being used by the NM, making it easy to implement. We test the model on two real-world case studies and conduct ex post analysis to test the effects of violation of model assumptions on results. The results show that it is possible to use the proposed methodology to lower delay propagated to subsequent flights and at the same time to improve airport slot adherence. In addition, they suggest that the current regulatory settings aiming to minimize ATFM delay minutes, as well as operational implementation thereof, are neither necessarily fully aligned with the desires and operating goals of Aircraft Operators, nor they improve the predictability of operations in the network.

After analyzing the data and satisfactory degrees, we prove that this teaching model is scientific and effective, and it can lead students from conscious imitating into unconsciously creative translating, and finally help them form a positive habit of translation learning.","[Jiang Xuelong] Northwest Minzu Univ, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China",Northwest Minzu University,"Jiang, XL (通讯作者)，Northwest Minzu Univ, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China.",,,,XBMU Undergraduate Education Program [2015XJJG16-1001670123]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [31920170050]; Scientific Research Funds for Universities in Gansu Province [2017B-86],XBMU Undergraduate Education Program; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Scientific Research Funds for Universities in Gansu Province,This paper is supported by 2015 XBMU Undergraduate Education Program (2015XJJG16-1001670123); 2017 Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (31920170050); and the Scientific Research Funds for Universities in Gansu Province (2017B-86).,,12,1,1,0,4,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-402-6,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2017,106.0,,,,,,440,443,,,,,,4,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BI9GR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416081200098,0

Using four applications I illustrate how combining this method with data from auctions and with a theoretical model can be used to answer various economic questions of interest. I start with the primary market for sovereign debt, focusing on treasury bill auctions of the USA and Canada. I show how auction data together with standard tools from Industrial Organization can be used to shed light on issues involving market structure, market power and front-running. I continue by looking at the Main Refinancing Operations of the European Central Bank, the main channel of monetary policy implementation in the Eurozone, and illustrate how auction data can be used to learn about typically opaque over-the-counter lending markets. I also discuss how to use these data indirectly to learn about dynamics of banks' financial health and of their balance sheets. I then turn to the discussion of recent progress on estimation of systemic risk.

The authors determined the role of the market in the agricultural economy of modern Russia and identified the need for rural development, aided by the development of agricultural machinery market. The authors concluded that the introduction of marketing logistics activities in the dealerships to ensure agricultural production and technical resources is an important task of the market for agricultural machinery, the solution of which can significantly improve the level of technical support of the rural areas. Application of marketing logistics activities of the participants in the supply of agricultural technology gives these companies a significant competitive advantage over other companies. These benefits are based on the possibility of obtaining timely information and certain values that are not available to other companies, as well as a number of joint actions in the interests of each link of the supply chain. The use of marketing principles in the system of territorial management promotes competition between regions. Increased competition in rural areas with other members of the social division of labor develops within the scope of scientific and technological progress, information, environmental standards of living, increased mobility of people, and capital.

There were compared shares of smoking, drinking too much alcohol, overweight and obese, and physically inactive among poor, middle class and rich people. The shares of leading a healthy lifestyle (no unhealthy characteristics) were also compared.

Using data on block level crimes by type of crime merged to detailed geographic data on individual public housing demolitions, I find evidence that Chicago's public housing imposed significant externalities on the surrounding neighborhood. Using a difference in difference approach comparing neighborhoods around public housing projects to nearby neighborhoods I find that crime decreases by 8.8% after a demolition. This decrease is concentrated in violent crime. I use an event study to show that the decrease occurs at the approximate date of the eviction of the residents and persists for at least 5 years after the demolition. Neighborhoods with large demolitions and demolitions of public housing that had been poorly maintained display the largest crime decreases.","[Sandler, Danielle H.] US Bur Census, 4600 Silver Hill Rd, Washington, DC 20233 USA",,"Sandler, DH (通讯作者)，US Bur Census, 4600 Silver Hill Rd, Washington, DC 20233 USA.",danielle.h.sandler@census.gov,"Sandler, Danielle/A-7702-2017","Sandler, Danielle/0000-0003-0416-9009",Institute for Governmental Affairs Dissertation Improvement Grant,Institute for Governmental Affairs Dissertation Improvement Grant,"I would like to thank Hilary Hoynes, Doug Miller, Scott Carrell, Marianne Page, Victor Stango, Mark Kutzbach, seminar participants at University of California-Davis, Sonoma State, the Conference on Urban Mass Housing, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and several anonymous referees for their helpful comments.

In doing so, we derive a risk-induced discount function that corresponds to a normalized expectation of that attribute. We provide several results characterizing this risk-induced discount function depending on the stochastic properties of the risk, which we model as a discrete Markov process. When it is well-defined, which we refer to as full approximation, the risk-induced discount function coincides with exponential discounting if the Markov process is stationary. However, a slight perturbation of the beliefs can trigger time-inconsistent discounting. When considering non-stationary Markov processes, time-inconsistency also emerges in situations where individuals' beliefs change in a non-anticipated fashion over time, as exemplified by quasi-hyperbolic discounting. Results are illustrated via several applications.","[St-Pierre, Marc] Univ South, Sewanee, TN 37375 USA",Sewanee: University of the South,"St-Pierre, M (通讯作者)，Univ South, Sewanee, TN 37375 USA.",mastpier@sewanee.edu,,,,,,,17,0,0,1,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,JAN,2017,82.0,1,,,,,13,30,,10.1007/s11238-016-9555-y,0.0,,,18,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,EK8BE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000394148100002,0

Firstly, following Whittle (Risk-sensitive optimal control, 1990), we show that the optimal risk-averse policy is identified via a pessimistic choice mechanism and described by simple recursive formulae. Secondly, we investigate the continuous-time limit and show that sufficient conditions for the existence of optimal solutions coincide with those which apply under risk-neutrality. Our analysis is conducted both under perfect and imperfect state observation.

Among other factors, differences in the measurement techniques may explain these mixed results on the valuation effects. In industrial organization, corporate diversification is commonly operationalized using business count measures, such as the number of business units or Berry-Herfindahl indices. Irrespective of their advantages for quantitative research, these measures are widely criticized for their dependency on segment data and Standard Industrial Classification codes. In this study, we introduce a market-implied diversification measure which uses standardized regression coefficients instead of industry classification schemes to identify the business activities that a firm is engaged in. The coefficients are obtained through forward stepwise regressions within which a firm's stock market return is regressed against a set of ten STOXX (R) EUROPE 600 sector indices. Thereby, we assume that the degree of diversification is likely to be a negative function of the amount of unsystematic variation. Using a representative sample of firms listed in the STOXX (R) EUROPE 600 index over the years 2010 to 2015, we compare our measure to commonly used business count measures.","[Zechser, Florian; Rojahn, Joachim] FOM Hsch, Isf Inst Strateg Finance, Leimkugelstr 6, D-45141 Essen, Germany",,"Zechser, F (通讯作者)，FOM Hsch, Isf Inst Strateg Finance, Leimkugelstr 6, D-45141 Essen, Germany.",florian.zechserl@fom-net.de; joachim.rojahn@fom.de,,"Zechser, Florian/0000-0001-7753-712X",,,,,26,0,0,0,2,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",,,978-83-65173-85-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,457,466,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ0TS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417167000047,0

In the literature, most vector auto-regression (VAR) and vector error correction (VECM) models of dry bulk freight markets assume that the coefficients are time-invariant. However, the relationships measured by the coefficients could change over time, e.g., due to changing market sentiments. Therefore, this study seeks a time-varying coefficient-error correction model (TVC-ECM) with backwardation degree coefficient driver, to unveil some hidden dynamic patterns. In advance, the presumption, that there are two distinct shocks, such as transitory and permanent ones, is suggested based on some recursive VAR model. Then, two empirical findings are derived. First, in the daily cases, the values of time-varying coefficients of the past spot and forward freight agreement (FFA) rates in the prediction equation increase when the market deviates more from the long-run equilibrium. Second, incorporating the information such as backwardation or contango into the traditional adjustment speed coefficient in the VECM framework marginally improves forecasting performance.","[Ko, Byoung-Wook] Korea Maritime Inst, 26,Haeyang Ro 301 Beon Gil, Busan 49111, South Korea",Korea Maritime Institute,"Ko, BW (通讯作者)，Korea Maritime Inst, 26,Haeyang Ro 301 Beon Gil, Busan 49111, South Korea.",valiance@kmi.re.kr,,,,,,,35,9,9,1,16,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,1879-2375,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

The shipping market is cyclic and uncertain, and the decision is whether to invest ships now or later. Theoretically, we found the trigger rates the necessary freight rates for profitable ship investment for both the net present value (NPV) and real option approach (ROA), assuming that future freight earnings follow a mean reverting stochastic process. The combination of these trigger rates provides the necessary and sufficient conditions for immediate investment. Empirically, we estimated the trigger rates for the whole sample from January 1976 to July 2014, as well as sub-samples that take into account structural changes in the shipping market. Both theoretical and empirical results show that ship investment decisions can be made based on the relationships between the current freight rate and the trigger rates from NPV and ROA. If the freight rate cannot make NPV positive, no investment should be considered. Immediate investment is only recommended when the freight rate is higher than the trigger rate using ROA. Sensitivity analysis shows that the trigger rate is most sensitive to changes in the long-run mean of the freight rate. A simple regression analysis indicates that our model can explain market driven ship investment activities in the past. In addition, results that incorporate structural breaks in the shipping market are closer to actual investment behavior in the market.","[Kou, Ying] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, SinoUS Global Logist Inst, 1954 Huashan Rd, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; [Luo, Meifeng] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Logist & Maritime Studies, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Luo, MF (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Logist & Maritime Studies, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",maggiekou@sjtu.edu.cn; Meifeng.Luo@polyu.edu.hk,"Luo, Meifeng/ABB-2204-2020; Kou, Ying/M-1326-2017","Luo, Meifeng/0000-0001-5044-2737; Kou, Ying/0000-0001-5557-5686; KOU, Ying/0000-0003-0272-8655",Hong Kong Research Grant Council General Research Fund [PolyU 5463/12H]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71603164]; Scientific Research Staring Fund for Young Teachers [16X100040011]; IMC-Frank Tsao Maritime Library and RD Center,Hong Kong Research Grant Council General Research Fund(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Scientific Research Staring Fund for Young Teachers; IMC-Frank Tsao Maritime Library and RD Center,"Thanks for the support of IMC-Frank Tsao Maritime Library and R&D Center during the preparation of this paper.

Our framework considers that activity-travel choices are consequences of individual, household, and work characteristics that are mediated by virtual accessibility and physical accessibility. As part of our analysis, we also analyze activity chaining characteristics during travel to study any fragmentation impacts caused by ICT use on activity engagement and scheduling. We use data from the 2011 and 2012 National Travel Survey in Great Britain and apply Bhat's (2015) generalized heterogeneous data model (GHDM) to jointly model multiple activity and travel outcomes. Our results provide important insights for social welfare, work-life balance, and equity policies, and suggest that decisions regarding virtual activity participations and in-person out-of-home activity participations are determined as a package.

However, many studies have reported that a typical consumer underestimates the benefits of energy-saving investment on the purchase of household electric appliances. To analyze this energy-efficiency-gap problem, many scholars have estimated implicit discount rates that consumers use for energy-consuming durables. Although both hedonic and choice models have been used in previous studies, a comparison between the two models has not yet been made. This study uses point-of-sale data about Japanese residential air conditioners and estimates implicit discount rates with both hedonic and choice models. Both models demonstrate that a typical consumer underinvests in energy efficiency.

These assessments occur pre-placement, then every 5?years to age 50, then every 2?years to age 60, and then every year. Despite some reported benefits to rail workforce health indicators since implementation, research suggests the assessments are not operating as effectively as they might. For example, the prevalence of obesity in drivers is higher than in the general population and continues to increase. To improve this, there is a need to understand the experiences of drivers undergoing workplace health assessments. The aims of this study were to examine train drivers perceptions and experiences of the assessments, understand how these experiences shape their engagement with the process, and to generate recommendations for improvement from a systems thinking perspective. A qualitative design was used, involving semi-structured interviews within five focus groups of train drivers (n?=?29) held across four Australian rail organisations. Questions addressed drivers backgrounds, their understanding of the National Standard, experiences of and attitudes towards health assessments, lifestyle risk factors, and personal approach to health and wellbeing. Transcript data were subjected to thematic analysis. Five factors were identified: drivers unmet information needs, perceived low reliability and validity of assessment, need for psychological wellbeing assessment and support, maladaptive threat avoidance strategies, and focus on short-term outcomes and compliance. The global theme was reactive organisational culture. Findings suggest that driver engagement with health assessment can be improved by proactively addressing the identified factors in occupational health initiatives and preventative interventions to tackle the burgeoning problem of train driver health impairment.","[Naweed, Anjum; Trigg, Joshua] Cent Queensland Univ, Appleton Inst Behav Sci, Adelaide, SA 5034, Australia; [Chapman, Janine] Flinders Univ South Australia, Flinders Ctr Innovat Canc, Flinders Dr, Bedford Pk, SA 5042, Australia",Central Queensland University; Flinders University South Australia,"Naweed, A (通讯作者)，Cent Queensland Univ, Appleton Inst Behav Sci, 44 Greenhill Rd, Wayville, SA 5034, Australia.",anjumnaweed@cqu.edu.au,"Trigg, Joshua/I-4392-2017; Naweed, Anjum/JPL-2837-2023; Trigg, Joshua/AAW-5492-2021","Trigg, Joshua/0000-0002-8173-5791; Naweed, Anjum/0000-0002-5534-4295; Chapman, Janine/0000-0002-9202-9788","Office of the National Rail Safety Regulator; Rail, Tram and Bus Union; Australasian Railway Association; Central Queensland University [HE0306]","Office of the National Rail Safety Regulator; Rail, Tram and Bus Union; Australasian Railway Association; Central Queensland University","The authors acknowledge the Office of the National Rail Safety Regulator, the Rail, Tram and Bus Union, and the Australasian Railway Association for supporting this research.

Using a unique dataset that covers the universe of tendering prices submitted by all developers for all residential land auction sales in Singapore, we find that a tenderer's bids are significantly higher where there was a previous land parcel sold within two years and located within four kilometers. The identified price margin decreases with time and geographic distance. Tracking sequential bids submitted by the same developer over time, we find that the incumbent winner of a previous auction is more likely to participate in subsequent nearby land sales as compared to the second-highest bidder of the same auction. However, it does not necessarily win the subsequent sites. We argue that the incumbent deliberately bids up the subsequent land prices to gain pricing advantages to their own parcels.","[Agarwal, Sumit] Georgetown Univ, McDonough Sch Business, 3700 O St NW, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Li, Jing] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, Singapore 178903, Singapore; [Teo, Ernie] IBM Res, 10 Marina Bay Blvd,41-01, Singapore 4101, Singapore; [Cheong, Alan] Savills Valuat & Profess Serv S Pte Ltd, 30 Cecil St 20-03,Prudential Tower, Singapore 049712, Singapore",Georgetown University; Singapore Management University,"Li, J (通讯作者)，Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, Singapore 178903, Singapore.",ushakri@yahoo.com; lijing@smu.edu.sg; ernieteo@smu.edu.sg,"Agarwal, Sumit/F-4836-2012; Li, Jing/H-6822-2013","Agarwal, Sumit/0000-0002-8305-3786; Li, Jing/0000-0001-5269-134X",Sim Kee Boon Institute for Financial Economics at the Singapore Management University,Sim Kee Boon Institute for Financial Economics at the Singapore Management University(Singapore Management University),"We would like to thank Nathaniel Baum-Snow, Thomas Davidoff, Ingrid Ellen, Christian Hilber, Ken Onishi, Stuart Rosenthal, Amanda Ross, and Will Strange for their comments and suggestions.

In particular, it examines the effect of the International Tropical Timber Agreement (ITTA) on tropical timber trade. The empirical analysis is based on a gravity equation in a difference-in-difference setting, which is estimated by a panel Heckman's selection model. This accounts for the potentially systematic selection of trading partners into timber trade activity. We then conduct a comprehensive comparative static analysis solving the structural gravity model with and without the ITTA. This allows us to determine the trade impact of an ITTA-induced increase in sustainability for participating as well as for third countries. We find that countries participating in the ITTA exhibit a significant and substantial increase in trade values ranging from 4% to 6%. Furthermore, we observe that this effect is more pronounced for smaller member countries. Non-ITTA countries are confronted with reduced values of tropical timber trade flows.","[Borsky, Stefan] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Wegener Ctr Climate & Global Change, Graz, Austria; [Leiter, Andrea; Pfaffermayr, Michael] Univ Innsbruck, Fac Econ & Stat, Innsbruck, Austria",University of Graz; University of Innsbruck,"Borsky, S (通讯作者)，Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Wegener Ctr Climate & Global Change, Graz, Austria.",,"Pfaffermayr, Michael/AAR-2786-2020","Pfaffermayr, Michael/0000-0002-8558-7757; Borsky, Stefan/0000-0002-0783-5882; Leiter, Andrea/0000-0002-8628-5072",University of Innsbruck,University of Innsbruck,"We are thankful to two anonymous referees as well as Charles Mason, to the participants of the Environmental Protection and Sustainability Forum, Exeter 2011, the EAERE 2011, the BIOECON 2011, the 16th Gottinger Workshop International Economics 2014 and of seminars at the University of Innsbruck, Basel and Southern Denmark for helpful and constructive comments.

However, the demand for and supply of different road types may change according to the level of urbanization, and this might have a significant impact on urban growth. The objectives of this study were twofold. First, to determine the investment level needed for different road types to facilitate urban growth at different levels of urbanization. Second, to understand how the development of different road types promotes export-led urban growth. We apply a fixed-effects panel linear regression analysis on a panel of 60 countries over the period of 1980-2010. The evidence presented in this study suggests that improvements in road mobility promoted export-led urban growth in countries with a low level of urbanization. This implies that policies to facilitate export should be executed in conjunction with high-mobility road network expansion to increase urbanization, especially in countries with a low level of urbanization that commonly suffer from low growth rates and that have a low level of high mobility road networks. Such expansion in road mobility is required to fulfil demands for long-distance travel to transport people from rural to urban areas. In contrast, in countries with a high level of urbanization, more investment is needed to develop roads with high accessibility. Such roads are needed to fulfil daily travel demands as a consequence of urban sprawl and decentralization of employment and populations. Moreover, the evidence shows that per capita education expenditure and physical capital stock per worker contributed to urban growth.","[Ng, Choy Peng] Univ Pertahanan Nas Malaysia, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Kuala Lumpur 57000, Malaysia; [Ng, Choy Peng; Law, Teik Hua; Jakarni, Fauzan Mohd] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Engn, Rd Safety Res Ctr, Serdang 43400, Malaysia; [Kulanthayan, S.] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Dept Community Hlth, Serdang 43400, Malaysia",Universiti Pertahanan Nasional Malaysia; Universiti Putra Malaysia; Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Law, TH (通讯作者)，Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Engn, Rd Safety Res Ctr, Serdang 43400, Malaysia.",cpng@upnm.edu.my; lawteik@upm.edu.my; fauzan.mj@upm.edu.my; kulan@upm.edu.my,"Ng, Choy Peng/AAV-9031-2020; Law, Teik-Hua/AAO-9999-2021; Ng, Choy Peng/HPE-1082-2023","Ng, Choy Peng/0000-0001-7817-9408; Law, Teik-Hua/0000-0002-1560-1672; Mani, Kulanthayan/0000-0002-5048-2410; Mohd Jakarni, Fauzan/0000-0002-6511-1794",,,,,91,10,10,5,54,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,1879-2375,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

In this paper, we propose a multi-objective programming model for Pareto-optimal decision in which the toll, quantity demanded, private firm's profit and social welfare are investigated, and compare the effectiveness of exclusivity guarantees and minimum demand guarantees in PPP contracts. Under certain assumptions, we find that for any government guarantee, the Pareto-optimal toll lies in between the toll set by private firms and socially optimal toll; in addition, the Pareto-optimal toll is higher and monopoly power is stronger under minimum demand guarantee if the relative negotiating power of private firms is sufficiently high. Both the private firm's profit and social welfare depend on relative negotiating power, buyback price, marginal social cost and minimum quantity demanded. In particular, if the minimum quantity demanded and the buyback price are sufficiently high, the government will tend to provide exclusivity guarantee but not minimum demand guarantee. A policy implication of this result is that it is not always the best choice for the government to provide a minimum demand guarantee to private firms.","[Song, Jinbo; Zhao, Yunpeng; Jin, Lulu] Dalian Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yan] Dalian Univ Technol, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China",Dalian University of Technology; Dalian University of Technology,"Zhao, YP (通讯作者)，Dalian Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China.",songjinbo@dlut.edu.cn; zhaoyun_p@126.com; jinlulu1226@126.com; sunyan@dlut.edu.cn,"Song, Jinbo/AAU-9013-2020","Song, Jinbo/0000-0003-0053-6561","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71734001, 71672018, 71472022]; Program for Liaoning Innovative Talents in University of China [WR2017001]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China [DUT17ZD208]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program for Liaoning Innovative Talents in University of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"The research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 71734001, 71672018 and 71472022), the Program for Liaoning Innovative Talents in University of China (Grant No. WR2017001) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China (Grant No. DUT17ZD208).",,44,24,25,3,113,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

We measure the latter using the World Bank's Country Policy and Institutional Assessments (CPIA) and consider only policy conditions targeted at improvements in those areas. Using a comprehensive country-year panel data set of aid-receiving countries, we find a significant concave effect of public-sector conditions on the quality of PSG. These findings are robust to the use of alternative measures of PSG and to lagging the variable of interest by 4 periods. Further evidence is provided by employing sample restrictions, adding more controls, and estimating a dynamic model with generalized method of moments (difference GMM). The optimal number of conditions estimated by our preferred GMM specification is 107, where the predicted policy score is about 0.96 points (1.33 SD) higher than with zero conditions. We show that conditions related to public financial management are more effective than those related to anticorruption or civil service and administrative reform, where progress requires changing the behavior of a larger set of deconcentrated actors. We also find evidence that the impact of PSG lending is larger in democracies than in nondemocracies.

We explain this difference via strategic interactions by giving two competing countries the possibility to design their export markets and select the level of competition they exert. In a first step, we test standard models and find that they fail to explain the multitude of observed behaviors: under the closed loop Nash equilibrium paradigm, the equilibrium is reached when countries completely open their export market. The Stackelberg game on the other hand concentrates the market in a plausible way but is not symmetric since it appoints a leader and follower. In a second step, we let countries choose between being strategic or passive in their interaction and demonstrate that the competitive outcome that we find in the closed loop Nash game rarely occurs.

This paper tests the old argument, whether depreciation of real effective exchange rates (REERs) raises exports. We differentiate the test with earlier studies by employing a new measurement of REER and incorporating the effect of GVCs. We measured REER at industry level with value-added trade weights. We analysed the topic with LSDV and system GMM for China, Japan and Korea since these counties are known to participate actively in GVCs. Our main finding is that exchange rate has significant impact on trade for three countries. However, the movement of elasticity of export to REER varies by country. While the elasticity in China decreased over time, Korea and Japan experienced increasing patterns between mid-1990s and mid-2000s and decreasing trends afterwards.

We use a static multicountry, multisector general equilibrium model to evaluate six modalities of three potential trade warsfor a total of 18 scenariosbetween the USA and China, between the USA and Mexico, and a combination of the two previous conflicts. In each case, we evaluate various forms of trade retaliation by the US partner(s): the same level of import duty as the one imposed by the USA, an import duty that minimises welfare loss, a duty that minimises terms-of-trade deterioration, a duty that generates the same amount of collected revenue, and finally a Nash equilibrium. We conclude that there is no scenario in which the US government augments its domestic welfare or GDP. There may be sectoral gains in value added in the USA, but they are small and to the detriment of other sectors. While losses for China are relatively small, potential losses for the Mexican economy are significant. There are also free riders of these trade wars. Finally, the way in which trade retaliations are designed matters greatly.","[Bouet, Antoine; Laborde, David] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Bouet, Antoine] Univ Bordeaux, GRETHA, Bordeaux, France",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Bordeaux,"Bouët, A (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA.;Bouët, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bordeaux, GRETHA, Bordeaux, France.",,,"Bouet, Antoine/0000-0002-8020-8877","CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets","CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets","This article was undertaken as part of the CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM) led by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI).

These contract-free jobs pay lower hourly wages, require longer weekly work hours, and provide less insurance or on-the-job training than regular jobs with contracts. We find that the co-villager networks play an important role in a migrant's decision on whether to accept such insecure and irregular jobs. By employing a comprehensive nationwide survey in 2011 in the spatial autoregressive logit model, we show that the common behavior of not signing contracts in the co-villager network increases the probability that a migrant accepts a contract-free job. We provide three possible explanations on how networks influence migrants' contract decisions: job referral mechanism, limited information on contract benefits, and the mini-labor union formed among co-villagers, which substitutes for a formal contract. In the subsample analysis, we also find that the effects are larger for migrants whose jobs were introduced by their co-villagers, male migrants, migrants with rural Hukou, short-term migrants, and less educated migrants. The heterogeneous effects for migrants of different employer types, industries, and home provinces provide policy implications.","[Baltagi, Badi H.] Syracuse Univ, Dept Econ, 426 Eggers Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Baltagi, Badi H.] Syracuse Univ, Ctr Policy Res, 426 Eggers Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Deng, Ying; Ma, Xiangjun] Univ Int Business & Econ, 10 Huixin East St, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China",Syracuse University; Syracuse University; University of International Business & Economics,"Baltagi, BH (通讯作者)，Syracuse Univ, Dept Econ, 426 Eggers Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.;Baltagi, BH (通讯作者)，Syracuse Univ, Ctr Policy Res, 426 Eggers Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",bbaltagi@maxwell.syr.edu; ydeng.econ@gmail.com; xm2e@virginia.edu,"Deng, Ying/I-3480-2015","Baltagi, Badi/0000-0003-0469-4479","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71503045, 71401038, 11671084]; Beijing Social Science Funding [15JGC158]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Social Science Funding,"This project was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China [71503045], [71401038], [11671084] and Beijing Social Science Funding [15JGC158].

Without denying its usefulness, this paper highlights two facts at odds with assumptions underlying the trilemma argument. First, conflicts between internal and external objectives were uncommon. Second, the use of quantitative credit controls allowed central banks to disconnect their interest rate from their monetary policy stance. This was considered by contemporaries as a way to escape international constraints. Capital controls were imposed to complement credit controls.

The bargaining correspondence is then defined as the intersection of players' compromise sets.

We employ unique longitudinal traffic offense data and exploit the introduction of a point-recording scheme in Denmark. We find that drivers who are assigned one or more demerit points reduce their frequency of traffic offenses and that these effects increase with the number of demerit points accumulated. However, these effects are short-lived, lasting only for the first two years post-reform and fading thereafter. In contrast, a stricter traffic punishment that conditionally suspends the driving license seems to have significant short-run and long-run effects. Our investigation into the types of offenses suggests that the deterrence effects are specific to the offense type for which they are imposed rather than generic improvements in driving behavior. These results imply that the effects of some of the existing traffic punishments are not only short-lived but also provide specific deterrence.","[Abay, Kibrom A.] Tech Univ Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark; [Kahsay, Goytom Abraha] Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark; University of Copenhagen,"Abay, KA (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark.",kaab@dtu.dk; Goytom@ifro.ku.dk,,"Kahsay, Goytom Abraha/0000-0001-8433-8575; Abay, Kibrom Araya/0000-0002-8658-2907",Danish Council for Independent Research (DFF) [1329-00007],Danish Council for Independent Research (DFF)(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF)),"This paper benefited from comments and discussions with Mette Ejrnms, Bertel Schjerning and conference participants at the IAAE2016 conference in Milan.

Concluding that the overstretched nature of concept has diluted its political effectiveness, the editors suggest instead a focus on precarization as a process, drawing from perspectives that focus on the objective conditions, as well as subjective and heterogeneous experiences and perceptions of insecure employment. Framed in this way, they present a summary of the contributions to the special issue spanning a range of countries and organizational contexts, identifying key drivers, patterns and forms of precarization. These are conceptualized as implicit, explicit, productive and citizenship precarization. These forms and patterns indicate the need to address precariousness in the realm of social reproduction and post-wage politics, while holding these in tension with conflicts at the point of production. Finally, the guest editors argue for a dramatic re-think of current forms of state and non-state social protections as responses to the precarization of work and employment across countries in both the Global North' and South'.","[Alberti, Gabriella] Univ Leeds, Leeds Business Sch, Work & Employment Relations, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Bessa, Ioulia] Univ Leeds, CERIC, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Hardy, Kate; Trappmann, Vera] Univ Leeds, Work & Employment Relat, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Umney, Charles] Univ Leeds, Business Sch, Maurice Keyworth Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",Leeds Beckett University; University of Leeds; University of Leeds; University of Leeds; University of Leeds,"Alberti, G (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Business Sch, Maurice Keyworth Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",g.alberti@leeds.ac.uk,"Bessa, Ioulia/GVS-9354-2022",,,,,,45,163,170,2,38,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

The community-based model developed by Haiti Outreach (HO) trains communities to operate and maintain wells and has clear efficiency gains over the status quo aid model in Haiti that gives communities wells: HO's wells were 8.7 percentage points more likely to be functioning after one year than similarly-constructed wells managed under the status quo model. Because HO's model includes user fees, which raise concerns about equity, I quantify the equity-efficiency tradeoff posed by community-based and aid interventions by determining the preferences of a social planner indifferent between these types of water infrastructure interventions. Since HO's user fees are only 0.6 percent of median income in rural Haiti, under most specifications the efficiency gains of the community-based model outweigh the equity concerns addressed by the aid model.","[Aliprantis, Dionissi] Interuniv Inst Res & Dev INURED, Port Au Prince, Haiti; [Aliprantis, Dionissi] Fed Reserve Bank Cleveland, Cleveland, OH 44114 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Cleveland,"Aliprantis, D (通讯作者)，Interuniv Inst Res & Dev INURED, Port Au Prince, Haiti.;Aliprantis, D (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Cleveland, Cleveland, OH 44114 USA.",dionissi.aliprantis@gmail.com,,,Inter-American Development Bank's Office of Evaluation and Oversight [A0009778-001],Inter-American Development Bank's Office of Evaluation and Oversight,"This work was supported by the Inter-American Development Bank's Office of Evaluation and Oversight [grant number A0009778-001] while the author was on unpaid leave from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.

Firms develop their service factors, to realise more values and increase their international competitiveness. China, as an important manufacturing centre of the world, has abundant manufacturers seeking for getting more involved in the international market. This paper makes use of detailed customs data and firm-level data from China, to find how the servitisation in China affects the export durations of Chinese manufacturers. The results demonstrate that manufacturing servitisation input in China contributes to export performance. The service factors have become the important production factors in Chinese manufacturing enterprises. However, China is still at the primary stage of manufacturing servitisation, and Chinese manufacturing enterprises should pay more attention to the whole value chain and seek the transformation from a pure manufacturing enterprise to a service manufacturing enterprise.","[Cui, Yaqiong] China Everbright Bank, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Cui, Yaqiong] Goethe Univ, GSEFM, Frankfurt, Germany; [Liu, Bin] Univ Int Business & Econ, China Inst WTO Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China",Goethe University Frankfurt; University of International Business & Economics,"Cui, YQ (通讯作者)，China Everbright Bank, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Cui, YQ (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ, GSEFM, Frankfurt, Germany.",,,,"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in UIBE of China [16YQ08, CXTD8-02]; Beijing Social Science Fund 'going out' development strategy research for Beijing enterprises from the perspective of global value chain [16YJC059]; National Natural Science Foundation of China Outward FDI, Two Margins of Export and Value Chain Upgrading [71503046]; National Social Science Foundation of China [17ZDA098]","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in UIBE of China; Beijing Social Science Fund 'going out' development strategy research for Beijing enterprises from the perspective of global value chain; National Natural Science Foundation of China Outward FDI, Two Margins of Export and Value Chain Upgrading; National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences)","The Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in UIBE of China, Grant/Award Number: 16YQ08, CXTD8-02; Beijing Social Science Fund 'going out' development strategy research for Beijing enterprises from the perspective of global value chain, Grant/Award Number: 16YJC059; the National Natural Science Foundation of China Outward FDI, Two Margins of Export and Value Chain Upgrading, Grant/Award Number: 71503046; the National Social Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 17ZDA098",,60,18,19,7,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUN,2018,41.0,6,,,,,1695,1721,,10.1111/twec.12614,0.0,,,27,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,GI6XL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000434646400009,0

I find that funds in districts worse affected by blight experienced higher failure rates and greater credit retrenchment and flight-to-quality than funds in less affected districts. Though greater leverage was generally associated with a higher predicted probability of institutional survival, the reverse was true where blight infection was more severe, and though more profitable funds were generally no more likely to survive, higher pre-famine margins were positive predictors of institutional survival where blight infection was worse. Results further indicate that the primary mechanisms by which pre-famine balance sheet metrics influenced survival probabilities were differential balance sheet contraction and flight-to-quality during the famine. The results of this study, therefore, suggest that optimal lending models in ordinary circumstances may render microfinance institutions (MFIs) more vulnerable to tail-probability aggregate shocks, with higher leverage, lower paid staff, lower economic rents, and more extensive liabilities limiting the scope for credit retrenchment and flight-to-quality. Results further indicate that one cost of MFI resilience to adverse environmental change is substantially reduced outreach to borrowers of lower credit quality.","[Goodspeed, Tyler Beck] Univ Oxford, Econ, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Goodspeed, TB (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Econ, Oxford, England.",tyler.goodspeed@economics.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,52,4,4,1,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

We find that it leads to lower domestic unemployment if the marginal task-specific offshoring cost in the service sector is sufficiently large. Under this condition, the jobs created due to enhanced productivity outweigh the jobs that are destroyed. The reduction in unemployment increases the cost of hiring domestic workers, thus encouraging firms in the manufacturing sector to increase their offshoring scale and productivity. This, in turn, increases their cost savings and may lead to a further decrease in unemployment. Hence, complementarity between two sectors' offshoring activities may emerge. We calibrate the model using economic parameters from Belgium, and the calibration results predict varied unemployment trends and impacts on manufacturing-sector offshoring activities with different task-specific offshoring cost schedules.","[Zhang, Rui] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Int Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",Capital University of Economics & Business,"Zhang, R (通讯作者)，Capital Univ Econ & Business, Int Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,,", Rui/0000-0003-2803-8820",Research and Innovation Centre of Metropolis Economic and Social Development (CUEB); NSFC [71601131],Research and Innovation Centre of Metropolis Economic and Social Development (CUEB); NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"I would like to thank Marti Mestieri, Yann Bramoulle, Thomas Chaney, Miaomiao Dong, Patrick Feve, Guido Friebel, Jieying Hong, Giammario Impullitti, Matthias Kredler, Shiyuan Pan, Franck Portier, Fabien Postel-Vinay, Gilles Saint-Paul, Konstantinos Tatsiramos and Robert Ulbricht for their helpful advice.

We employ a gravity framework on a country-industry-year-level panel data set that matches EXIM authorisations with US bilateral exports. Our results depict the general ineffectiveness of the Bank in promoting exports within and across industries. Some heterogeneities behind the general finding are also uncovered: industries other than aerospace parts and products are more likely to benefit from EXIM authorisations, and EXIM authorisations to larger businesses seem to be more effective in encouraging exports. Furthermore, we find no evidence that EXIM encourages US exports by offsetting foreign ECA competition. These results are neither affected by competing countries' membership to the OECD Arrangement nor by the size of American firms that received EXIM support. Our results cast doubt on the ubiquitously positive claims made by the Bank and its supporters, yetalso provide policy lessons for countries that are either in the inception stages of establishing their own ECAs or are now placing greater importance on ECA financing in encouraging exports.","[Agarwal, Natasha] World Educ Fdn, Oslo, Norway; [Wang, Zheng] De Montfort Univ, Fac Business & Law, Leicester, Leics, England; [Wang, Zheng] Univ Nottingham, GEP, Nottingham, England",De Montfort University; University of Nottingham,"Agarwal, N (通讯作者)，World Educ Fdn, Oslo, Norway.",,,"Wang, Zheng/0000-0001-6276-1831",,,,,39,5,7,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAY,2018,41.0,5,,,,,1378,1414,,10.1111/twec.12537,0.0,,,37,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,GF5VX,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000432037100010,0

We see an increasing number of studies using process heuristics such as attribute non-attendance, relative advantage maximisation, extremeness aversion and value learning. With some exceptions, the study of each heuristic has been undertaken in isolation from other candidate heuristics; the exceptions being joint investigation into a fully compensatory model defined by a linear additive in attributes and parameters specification and one process heuristic, commonly using latent class models. This paper investigates the role that two behaviourally appealing decision rules play jointly in explaining choice making, both of which reflect risk attitude in different ways. We jointly estimate a model that accounts for extremeness aversion and an extended expected utility transformation for an attribute that accounts for risk attitude and perceptual conditioning under fully compensatory attributes. We use a stated choice experiment associated with a car choice between tolled and non-tolled roads in Australia. The findings suggest that the mean VTTS from the multiple-rule model is higher than the mean estimates obtained from each of the stand-alone models.","[Hensher, David A.; Balbontin, Camila; Collins, Andrew T.] Univ Sydney, Business Sch, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Hensher, DA (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Business Sch, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",David.Hensher@sydney.edu.au; Camila.Balbontin@sydney.edu.au; Andrew.Collins@sydney.edu.au,"Balbontin, Camila/ECM-0598-2022","Balbontin, Camila/0000-0001-8985-9070; Hensher, David/0000-0003-0058-2242",ARC Discovery Project [DP140100909],ARC Discovery Project(Australian Research Council),"This research was funded by the ARC Discovery Project: DP140100909: Integrating Attribute Decision Heuristics into Travel Choice Models that accommodate Risk Attitude and Perceptual Conditioning.

The results in those plebiscites provide a detailed cross-departements (French main administrative units) measure of opposition to autocracy. This study uses the variations in the thriving French modernization to disentangle the effect of industrialization on the vote from the one of other dimensions of economic development. Doubling industrial employment in the Puy-de-Dome departement (median of the distribution) would have decreased support to autocracy by 2.5-5.0 percentage points. An IV strategy using distance to the first city having adopted steam engines, access to coal and waterpower as instruments suggests causality. The baseline results are robust to controlling for other explanations of the vote and to using alternative specifications and estimation methods.","[Lacroix, Jean] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Solvay Brussels Sch Econ & Management, Ctr E Bernheim, FD Roosevelt 21,CP 139-01, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Solvay SA,"Lacroix, J (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, Solvay Brussels Sch Econ & Management, Ctr E Bernheim, FD Roosevelt 21,CP 139-01, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",jean.lacroix@ulb.ac.be,,"Lacroix, Jean/0000-0002-9106-1110",People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme FP7 under REA grant [608129],People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme FP7 under REA grant(European Union (EU)),The research leading to these results has received funding from the People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme FP7/2007-2013/ under REA grant agreement no. 608129.,,55,2,3,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

Given the small total number of sales in SSUs and the even smaller number of repeat sales, traditional alternatives are few. A matching-based Fisher HPI is proposed as an alternative that provides more accurate estimations for SS-Us given that it both controls for housing characteristics and is not restricted just to repeated sales. This paper makes use of housing sales data from the state of Illinois, as an example of the application of the methodology to small MSAs and at the neighborhood level within larger MSAs. The results highlight some of the biases that have arisen from the use of median price indicators.","[Lopez, Esteban] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Business Sch, CEPR, Ave Padre Hurtado 750, Vina Del Mar, Chile; [Lopez, Esteban; Hewings, Geoffrey J.

Market production of services is efficient because customers effectively share land and other factors of production, leaving them idle for less time. The paper develops a theory in which market-based sharing causes residents of dense areas to purchase services on the market that their suburban counterparts produce at home. The model predicts that residents of dense areas spend more on local services, home produce less, work more, and pay higher land prices - conditional on residents' productivity and proximity to work. The paper presents evidence that these predictions are consistent with the data.","[Murphy, Daniel] Univ Virginia, Darden Sch Business, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",University of Virginia,"Murphy, D (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Darden Sch Business, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",murphyd@darden.virginia.edu,,,,,,,33,5,6,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

We use all publicly available and representative old age surveys with comparable information to assess inequalities of cognitive functioning for six distinctive age groups in 29 countries. We document that cognitive inequalities in old age are largely determined by earlier educational inequalities as well as gender differential survival rates. For example, a one percentage point increase in the Gini index of past education is associated with an increase of 0.45 percentage points in the Gini index of delayed recall and 0.23 percentage points in the Gini of immediate recall. Results are robust to a variety of alternative explanations and persist even after controlling for gender-related biases in survival rates. Furthermore, we find evidence that unequal opportunities for education -captured by differences in parental background and gender- also have significant effects on inequality of old age cognition.

Based on the indirect inference bias-corrected VAR estimates, we find that MSAs that are more regulated have (i) a higher variance in the log rent-price ratio, (ii) a larger share of the variance explained by real interest rate, and (iii) a stronger impulse response of house price to the real interest rate shock.","[Sun, Xiaojin] Univ Texas El Paso, Dept Econ & Finance, El Paso, TX 79968 USA; [Tsang, Kwok Ping] Virginia Tech, Dept Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas El Paso; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Sun, XJ (通讯作者)，Univ Texas El Paso, Dept Econ & Finance, El Paso, TX 79968 USA.",xsun3@utep.edu,,"Tsang, Kwok Ping/0000-0002-0045-6185",,,,,23,2,2,0,16,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

We distinguish between business, consumer and mortgage loans and investigate their differences with respect to their optimal predictors. The quasi-AIM approach (Carson et al. in Int J Forecast 27:923-941, 2010) is utilized in order to take into account heterogeneity across banks and minimize estimation uncertainty. In addition, we calculate a number of forecasting measures in order to take into account the policy makers' preferences. We find that market variables, specifically the supermarket sales, confidence indices for the services and construction sector and the business sentiment index represent good forecasting variables for most categories of NPLs. In addition, industrial production is the optimal predictor for consumer NPLs and imports for business NPLs. Finally, bank-specific variables represent top-performing leading indicators for business NPLs. Our results have significant implications for stress-testing credit risk in a top-down manner and for supervisory and macro-prudential policy design.","[Vouldis, Angelos T.] European Cent Bank, Directorate Gen Stat, Frankfurt, Germany; [Louzis, Dimitrios P.] Bank Greece, Econ Anal & Res Div, Athens, Greece",European Central Bank; European Central Bank; Bank of Greece,"Vouldis, AT (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Directorate Gen Stat, Frankfurt, Germany.",Angelos.Vouldis@ecb.europa.eu; dlouzis@bankofgreece.gr,,,,,,,34,20,20,2,20,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Monetary policy can deviate from active inflation stabilization, and agents conduct Bayesian learning about the nature of these deviations. Under constrained discretion, only short deviations occur, agents' uncertainty about the macroeconomy remains contained, and welfare is high. However, if a deviation persists, uncertainty eventually accelerates and welfare declines. Announcing that inflation stabilization will be temporarily abandoned raises uncertainty. However, these announcements lower policy uncertainty and curb inflationary beliefs at the end of the policy.

Econometric studies conducted by researchers from CMCA have mostly focused on studying inflation levels of these countries, making use of econometric tools such as VECM and cointegration. We expand the study of inflation stability in the member countries of the CMCA by adopting a long memory and fractionally integrated approach and implementing cointegration methods that have not yet been used in the study of the Central American Monetary Council. Our results first show that all the series of prices are nonstationary, with orders of integration equal to or higher than 1 in all cases. Looking at long-run equilibrium relationships among the countries, we only found strong evidence of a cointegration relationship in the case of Honduras with El Salvador. All the other vis-a-vis relationships seem to diverge in the long run. Policy implications of the results obtained are also derived in the paper.","[Carcel, Hector; Gil-Alana, Luis A.] Univ Navarra, NavarraCtr Int Dev, Fac Econ, ICS, Edificio Amigos, E-31080 Pamplona, Spain",University of Navarra,"Gil-Alana, LA (通讯作者)，Univ Navarra, NavarraCtr Int Dev, Fac Econ, ICS, Edificio Amigos, E-31080 Pamplona, Spain.",alana@unav.es,,,Ministry of Education of Spain [ECO2014-55236],Ministry of Education of Spain(Spanish Government),Luis A.

Hence, it has become one of the most crucial sub-sectors in the food industry, serving as a huge source of employment. Despite all these developments, land scarcity and energy capacity obstruct the procurement of input within the scope of the country. Therefore, certain substantial inputs needed by the poultry sector are provided by import. At this conjuncture, it is believed that the high cost of inputs and the external dependence on inputs have retarding effects on the sector's progress. The aim of this study is to identify the spillover effect on prices of imported inputs (energy and soybean), which are widely used to determine broiler prices in Turkey's broiler sector. In the research, the long-term correlation of monthly price data spanning the time period of 2003:1 and 2016:9 was analyzed as benefiting from VECM (Vector Error Correction Model). The findings, in the long term, the broiler prices increase by 2.60% in the face of 10% increase in energy prices, while it rises by 3.84% against a 10% increase in soybean prices. In addition to that, short-term one-way relation of causality from energy prices to soybean prices was determined. For the poultry sector, the results show that integrated strategic plans, including both energy and feed markets, must be designed.","[Cinar, Gokhan] Adnan Menderes Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, Aydin, Turkey; [Keskin, Berkay] Ankara Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, Ankara, Turkey",Adnan Menderes University; Ankara University,"Cinar, G (通讯作者)，Adnan Menderes Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, Aydin, Turkey.",gokhan.cinar@adu.edu.tr,"Keskin, Berkay/AAJ-4847-2021; Keskin, Berkay/AAG-8995-2020","Keskin, Berkay/0000-0003-2686-6171; Keskin, Berkay/0000-0003-2686-6171",,,,,43,6,6,0,8,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,2611-1128,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,MAR,2018,17.0,1,,,,,37,47,,10.30682/nm1801d,0.0,,,11,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,GF3HQ,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431836600005,0

Recently, research on EU institutions devotes increasing attention to analyzing structures and procedures of decision-making in EU institutions, most notably the EU Commission. Conventionally, the EU Commission is portrayed as a fragmented organization, divided along the lines of staff nationality, sectoral responsibilities and cabinets and General Directorates (DGs). The Secretariat General has long been viewed a weak actor that is hardly able or motivated to steer internal decision-making. However, recent research indicates a changing role of the Secretariat General as a pro-active broker and last arbiter. This article studies how the Secretariat General is perceived by the DGs in policy coordination and argues that this perception depends on the pattern of political authority, bureaucratic roles and the relevance and the alternatives prevailing in the policy field. The article is based on data from a survey among Commission officials.","[Hustedt, Thurid] Free Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Seyfried, Markus] Univ Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany",Free University of Berlin; University of Potsdam,"Hustedt, T (通讯作者)，Free Univ Berlin, Otto Suhr Inst Polit Sci, Berlin, Germany.",thurid.hustedt@fu-berlin.de,,"Seyfried, Markus/0000-0002-3885-9537; Hustedt, Thurid/0000-0001-9653-5306",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF),German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),This work was supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF).,,36,4,4,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

We compare three different categories of algorithms: (i) the conventional method with exogenous grids (EXOGM), (ii) the pure method of endogenous gridpoints (ENDGM) and (iii) a hybrid method (HYBGM). ENDGM comes along with Delaunay interpolation on irregular grids. Comparison of methods is done by evaluating speed and accuracy by using a specific model with two endogenous state variables. We find that HYBGM and ENDGM both dominate EXOGM. In an infinite horizon model, ENDGM also always dominates HYBGM. In a finite horizon model, the choice between HYBGM and ENDGM depends on the number of gridpoints in each dimension. With less than 150 gridpoints in each dimension ENDGM is faster than HYBGM, and vice versa. For a standard choice of 25-50 gridpoints in each dimension, ENDGM is 1.4-1.7 times faster than HYBGM in the finite horizon version and 2.4-2.5 times faster in the infinite horizon version of the model.","[Ludwig, Alexander] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, SAFE, Theodor W Adorno Pl 3, D-60629 Frankfurt, Germany; [Ludwig, Alexander] CMR, Theodor W Adorno Pl 3, D-60629 Frankfurt, Germany; [Ludwig, Alexander] MEA, Theodor W Adorno Pl 3, D-60629 Frankfurt, Germany; [Ludwig, Alexander] Netspar, House Finance, Theodor W Adorno Pl 3, D-60629 Frankfurt, Germany; [Schoen, Matthias] Univ Cologne, CMR, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt; University of Cologne,"Ludwig, A (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, SAFE, Theodor W Adorno Pl 3, D-60629 Frankfurt, Germany.;Ludwig, A (通讯作者)，CMR, Theodor W Adorno Pl 3, D-60629 Frankfurt, Germany.;Ludwig, A (通讯作者)，MEA, Theodor W Adorno Pl 3, D-60629 Frankfurt, Germany.;Ludwig, A (通讯作者)，Netspar, House Finance, Theodor W Adorno Pl 3, D-60629 Frankfurt, Germany.",ludwig@safe.uni-frankfurt.de; m.schoen@wiso.uni-koeln.de,,,Research Center SAFE; State of Hessen initiative for research LOEWE; German National Research Foundation [SPP 1578]; State of North Rhine-Westfalia,Research Center SAFE; State of Hessen initiative for research LOEWE; German National Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); State of North Rhine-Westfalia,"We thank the editor and four anonymous referees as well as Johannes Brumm, Christopher Carroll, Thomas Jorgensen, Michael Reiter and seminar participants at University of Cologne, the 2012 CEF and the Cologne Macroeconomic Workshop 2012 for helpful comments.

Using the firm-level data of Korean manufacturing industries for 2006-13, we distinguish between yearly RER movement and persistent RER depreciation during 2007-09 and analyse how each affects productivity. We find the positive effect of RER depreciation on productivity among exporters, and this positive effect increases with higher export exposure. However, the positive productivity gain disappears when the depreciation persists. Our findings suggest that while immediate depreciation leads to productivity upgrade via price competitiveness and scale expansion, persistent depreciation nullifies the productivity gain by slackening the innovation effort.","[Choi, Bo-Young] Korea Inst Int Econ Policy, Dept Northeast Asian Econ, Sejong, South Korea; [Pyun, Ju Hyun] Korea Univ, Sch Business, Seoul, South Korea",Korea Institute for International Economic Policy (KIEP); Korea University,"Choi, BY (通讯作者)，Korea Inst Int Econ Policy, Dept Northeast Asian Econ, Sejong, South Korea.",,,"PYUN, JU HYUN/0000-0001-6815-3976",ERIA; National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2008-362-A00001],ERIA; National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government),"We are grateful to Matilde Bombardini, Yong-Seok Choi, Chin Hee Hahn, Byungchae Jin, Dan Liu, Peter Morrow, Dionisius Narjoko, Nina Pavcnik, Shujiro Urata, Gregory Wright, Youzhi Yang, Miaojie Yu, an anonymous referee and other participants at seminars including Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SHUFE), Lipsey Memorial Panels, and Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) workshop Trade Policy Change and Firm Adjustment: A Search for the Underlying Mechanisms, for their helpful comments and suggestions.

We attempt to subject this position to empirical investigation. We exploit data on bilateral aid, trade and migration flows between developed and developing countries, for the period 2000-10, adopting an instrumental variable approach to address the endogeneity issue due to potential simultaneity bias. Our results establish that increasing aid and trade with developing countries is likely to fail to contain immigration, at least in the short run. The pattern of results is consistent with the hypothesis that promoting development in migrant-sending countries, or cooperating with such countries to control migration outflows, is not sufficient to lessen immigration. Increasing visa restrictions and controls at borders is generally controversial; still, the results imply that policymakers cannot attain their short-term immigration goals with the so-called smart solutions of aid and trade.","[Menard, Audrey] Univ Nantes, Econ, Nantes, France; [Gary, Aurore] Univ Paris 01, Econ, CES, Pantheon Sorbonne, Paris, France",Nantes Universite,"Menard, A (通讯作者)，Univ Nantes, Econ, Nantes, France.",,,,,,,,52,7,7,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,FEB,2018,41.0,2,,,,,431,456,,10.1111/twec.12550,0.0,,,26,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,FV9WU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000424941800004,0

Our results reveal significant increases in overweight and obesity (2.3, 3.1, and 7.6 percentage points for BMI-based overweight, BMI-based obesity, and abdominal obesity, respectively). Depending on the decompositional approach and obesity measure, our analysis explains between 13% and 51% of the rise in overweight and obesity, with most part attributable to changes in risky behavior, age, and education.

This relevant paradox states that the transitivity of the voters' preferences does not imply the transitivity of the collective preference. However, this collective preference disregards a considerable part of the information provided by the voters. Here, we propose a new way of comparing candidates-resulting in the supercovering relation-that, although it might not be complete, avoids the voting paradox and further restricts the ubiquitous covering relation. Thus the pairwise winner emerges, a new natural type of winner situated in between the Condorcet winner and the unanimous winner. This pairwise winner turns out to serve as a cornerstone of social choice theory that finally unites the Borda winner and the Condorcet winner. Moreover, we analyse an interesting superset of the uncovered set-the unsupercovered set-and we propose a method for selecting candidates from this set, resulting in the introduction of the notion of a P-optimal candidate.","[Perez-Fernandez, Raul; De Baets, Bernard] Univ Ghent, Dept Math Modelling Stat & Bioinformat, KERMIT, Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"Perez-Fernández, R (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Math Modelling Stat & Bioinformat, KERMIT, Ghent, Belgium.",raul.perezfernandez@ugent.be; bernard.debaets@ugent.be,"De Baets, Bernard/E-8877-2010; Pérez-Fernández, Raúl/L-6883-2014","Pérez-Fernández, Raúl/0000-0001-6966-1681",Campus of International Excellence of the University of Oviedo; BOF grant [01DI2816],Campus of International Excellence of the University of Oviedo; BOF grant,This research has been partially supported by the Campus of International Excellence of the University of Oviedo and by the BOF grant with code 01DI2816.

It argues that existing studies on the subject do not provide an adequate understanding of the mechanisms through which diffusion takes place, nor do they sufficiently address the roles specific organizations and individuals play in driving or determining the policy transfer process. We address these shortcomings by studying the diffusion of conditional cash transfer (CCT) programmes from Latin America to Ghana and the Philippines over the past decade. We use the concept of instruments constituency' to delineate and trace the various actors and channels involved in the diffusion of CCTs. The comparative case studies show that these constituencies, dedicated to the articulation, adoption, and expansion of particular policy instruments, are central players in transnational diffusion of policies. This finding has significant implications for the study of policy transfer and diffusion, identifying a heretofore neglected actor in these processes.","[Beland, Daniel] Univ Saskatchewan, Johnson Shoyama Grad Sch Publ Policy, Publ Policy Tier 1, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Foli, Rosina] Univ Ghana, Dept Polit Sci, Accra, Ghana; [Howlett, Michael] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Ramesh, M.] Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, Publ Policy, Singapore, Singapore; [Ramesh, M.] Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, Social Policy Design Asia, Singapore, Singapore; [Woo, J.

In contrast to existing centrality measures, this approach analyzes the consequences of tie failure (rather than node failure). Though not directly applied to the centrality issue, tie failures are the idea underlying the Position value (the Shapley value of the arc-game). In contrast, we allow for a whole class of allocation rules as a basis since the Shapley approach might be unreasonable in political applications, especially in networks with incompatibilities. Requiring additivity (A), equal treatment of equals (Symmetry S), and irrelevance of unproductive agents (nullplayer irrelevance N) for the underlying basis, we define the class of ASN-position values and provide axiomatic characterizations. To emphasize the crucial role of links, we refine this class to multiplicative ASN-position values and provide a monotonicity result with respect to links. We apply our approach to the case of the 2001 state parliament elections in Hamburg, Germany to use our allocation rule as a power index and further provide an example where we use our approach as a centrality measure to identify top key nodes. In both applications, the position value taking the Banzhaf value as a basis turns out to be more convincing than the Shapley-based approach.","[Belau, Julia] TU Dortmund Univ, Dept Econ Microecon, Vogelpothsweg 87, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany",Dortmund University of Technology,"Belau, J (通讯作者)，TU Dortmund Univ, Dept Econ Microecon, Vogelpothsweg 87, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany.",julia.belau@tu-dortmund.de,,,,,,,38,1,2,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JAN,2018,50.0,1,,,,,65,99,,10.1007/s00355-017-1074-4,0.0,,,35,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,FQ3YV,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418295500003,0

Achieving an optimal utilization with optimum absorption of the willingness to pay with a unit price is hardly possible in liberal economic environment. Therefore, different prices must be offered by means of price differentiation for diverse market segments, corresponding to the respective willingness to pay. Target is to define the right customers, to provide the right service at the right price at the right time at the right place. The services for the professional application of price differentiations (in hospitality industry called: revenue management) must be subject to greater fluctuations in demand and the requested goods must be price-elastic. The price differentiation itself can refer e. g. to the dimensions of time, place, space, quantity and purchaser. Typical examples of periods of high demand are holiday periods, trade fairs, the arrival days in a work week or even sporting and cultural events. The reactions of the product and pricing policy as reaction on volatility in demand leads to the question of this work. The research is based on relevant literature. First, examples of studies concerning other major sports events will be introduced, to gain information on the importance of sporting events in general. Then, the function of food and beverage supply will be explained. In addition, typical instruments and strategies are explained, that affect the hospitality product and pricing policy. With respect to the Grand Depart, the influences on the product and the price policy had been surveyed upon local catering businesses. Also examined whether and to what extent behavioral pricing effects were used consciously. Three months before the Grand Depart 160 catering establishments by e-mail were invited to participate in an online survey. 32 of these businesses gave a fully usable response, for which data were the basis of further evaluations. To interpret the investigation results better, criteria were defined that the restaurants were divided into different business types. The research showed, that some potentials are certainly not fully exploited because of lack of experience and the partial lack of knowledge about existing possibilities of price differentiation and effects of behavioral pricing.","[Corinth, Thomas] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Corinth, T (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,1,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-344-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,114,122,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP0MG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000535358500011,0

In our article, we want to focus on the institutional aspects and their role in attracting FDI. Hence, the objective of the paper is to assess the relationship between institutional efficiency (both public and private) in Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs) and FDI stock. We employed variables used in the leading global investment attractiveness ranking (Global Competitiveness Index by World Economic Forum). As the measures of institutional efficiency, we used several detailed and overall indicators from rankings focusing on, e.g., intellectual property protection, diversion of public funds, favouritism in decisions of government officials, transparency of government policymaking or the strength of investor protection. To examine the relationship we used statistical methods, such as Spearman's rank correlation and Pearson correlation. This study is structured as follows. First, it explores the existing literature on factors of investment attractiveness paying special attention to the importance of institutional efficiency. Then, we discuss institutional efficiency in the CEECs, based on the results of selected international rankings. The final part examines the correlation between individual institutional efficiency indices and the stock of foreign direct investment Detailed results of our analyses are presented in the final part of the study. At the end we present conclusions.","[Dorozynski, Tomasz; Kuna-Marszalek, Anetta] Univ Lodz, Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Dorozynski, T (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Lodz, Poland.",,,,,,,,43,0,0,0,0,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-344-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,143,154,,,,,,12,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP0MG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000535358500014,0

The integration of core state powers responds to similar demand factors as market integration (interdependence, externalities and spillover) but its supply is more tightly constrained by a high propensity for zero-sum conflict, a functional requirement for centralized fiscal, coercive and administrative capacities, and high political salience. We show how these constraints structured the initial design of Economic and Monetary Union and of Schengen, made them vulnerable to crisis, and shaped policy options during the crises: they made horizontal differentiation unattractive, re-regulation ineffective, centralized risk and burden-sharing unfeasible, and the externalization of adjustment burdens to non-EU actors necessary by default.

The study aims to analyse the fluctuations in the levels of household deposits and, in particular, to recognise regularities and irregularities in this respect. It applies regression models with time series data on household deposit totals for individual countries in the euro area. The results display considerable cross-country differences in the formation of deposit levels in the period analysed. For several member states, the trend could be recognised only in specified sub-periods. Only for some of the countries, the linear trend described a general long-term direction of changes in household deposit totals, confirming its stability in the entire period. In most member states, seasonal fluctuations in deposit totals occurred, but they related to various months. The study allowed identification of unexpected deposit outflows as well, which resulted, among other reasons, from financial problems of credit institutions. On the other hand, the adjustments in deposit guarantee schemes fostered households' confidence in these entities and led to the unexpected increases of the deposits in selected countries.","[Kochaniak, Katarzyna] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Finance, 27 Rakowicka St, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Kochaniak, K (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Finance, 27 Rakowicka St, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",katarzyna.kochaniak@uek.krakow.pl,,,National Science Centre in Poland [DEC-2013/11/D/HS4/04056],"National Science Centre in Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)",The paper presents the results of a study carried out under a research project financially supported by the National Science Centre in Poland (grant number: DEC-2013/11/D/HS4/04056).,,18,0,0,0,1,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8980-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,276,283,,,,,,8,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BM4AM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000462948800035,0

Using a sample of 28,972 Czech limited liability firms, and after controlling for firm size, age, and industry affiliation, we found that the presence of multiple owners has a negative effect on asset turnover. However, the number of shareholders as such seems to have no effect on profitability, debt use, and liquidity. Instead, sole proprietorships seem to be empirically different from firms with two or more owners, as they have a significantly greater liquidity.","[Machek, Ondrej; Kubicek, Ales] Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Strategy, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Machek, O (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Strategy, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",ondrej.machek@vse.cz; ales.kubicek@vse.cz,"Machek, Ondrej/L-4203-2018; K, A/JPY-0049-2023",,Czech Science Foundation,Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"This paper has been written with the support of the Czech Science Foundation, project no.

The first forms of pension insurance in Croatia were based on the so-called: old-age insurance, while the formal forms were developed in the 19th century. The crisis of the pension system, which was present at the end of the period of socialism, deepened even after Croatian independence. Therefore, at the end of the nineties began the reform of pension insurance, which was completed in 2002. The structure of this system has remained unchanged to date. The authors investigate the compatibility of Croatian pension insurance with the European social model, with the biggest challenges being related to the alignment of the second and third pillars of pension insurance related to the so-called vocational and voluntary insurance and their characteristics. In addition, there is important compliance with the distribution of pension income within the three pillars of insurance and the investment of individual pension fund portfolios. Such harmonization would contribute to the harmonization of the Croatian pension system with the European social model and ultimately the sustainability of pension insurance in the future.","[Matic, Branko] Fac Econ, Osijek, Croatia; [Vretenar Cobovic, Maja; Cobovic, Mirko] Coll Slavonski Brod, Slavonski Brod, Croatia",University of Slavonski Brod,"Matic, B (通讯作者)，Fac Econ, Osijek, Croatia.",matic@efos.hr; mvretenar@vusb.hr; mcobovic@vusb.hr,"Cobović, Maja Vretenar/AAB-6210-2020","Cobović, Maja Vretenar/0000-0002-7225-147X",,,,,8,0,0,0,1,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2018,14.0,,,,,,725,742,,,,,,18,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9DQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470808300040,0

To achieve this objective, the Shift-Share analysis methodology was applied to the most recent data on Panama-European Union trade available in the Statistical Office of the European Communities (Eurostat), comprehending the period between 2011 and 2016. Based on the analysis conducted, it was possible to observe that exports from Panama to the European Union experienced a slight average annual growth of 9.23%; and also that the main destination countries, which represent 96.48% of exports, were: Germany, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Spain, France, Grace, Holland, Italy, Poland, United Kingdom and Sweden. Furthermore, the products which represent 95.19% of Panama exports were: other vegetables, fresh or frozen, fresh fruit; beverages; stimulants and spices; perishable foodstuffs; animal feeding stuffs and foodstuff waste; oil seeds and oleaginous fruit and fats; other machinery apparatus and appliances; leather, textiles and clothing; other manufactured articles and miscellaneous articles. A decrease in the exports of the following products was captured: oilseeds and oil fats, transport equipment, miscellaneous items and other products. According to the static Shift-Share analysis made, exports from Panama to the European Union were mostly affected by decreases in exports to countries such as Belgium, Spain, Greece, Italy, Poland, and Sweden, due to regional effects. Other decreased have been found in other EU countries as well. Conversely, Panama's exports to Cyprus, Denmark and the Netherlands registered growth mainly due to the regional component (growth of exports from Panama to that country); France recorded growth due to the effects of the structural component (growth in products exported by Panama); Germany and the United Kingdom recorded growth due to the effects of the national component (growth of exports to the EU). Besides the evidence shown and discusse, this research can be regarded as a significant contribution to the existing statistics on exports from Panama to the European Union and can be more broadly used as a tool to delineate corporate or national strategies to boost trade between two regions.","[Mejia, Marian Morales] Inst Polytech Braganca, Braganca, Portugal; [Veloso, Claudia Miranda] Univ Aveiro, Inst Polytech Braganca, ESTGA, GOVCOPP,UNIAG, Aveiro, Portugal; [Duarte, Antonio] Inst Polytech Braganca, UNIAG, Braganca, Portugal; [Ribeiro, Humberto] Univ Aveiro, ESTGA, GOVCOPP, Aveiro, Portugal; [Alves, Sandra Raquel] Polytech Inst Leiria, CIC DIGITAL, Leiria, Portugal",Instituto Politecnico de Braganca; Universidade de Aveiro; Instituto Politecnico de Braganca; Universidade de Aveiro,"Mejia, MM (通讯作者)，Inst Polytech Braganca, Braganca, Portugal.",marian.moralesm@gmail.com; claudiamiranda@ipb.pt; aduarte@ipb.pt; humberto@alumni.dmu.ac.uk; raquel.alves@ipleiria.pt,"Ribeiro, Humberto/AAJ-9053-2020; Veloso, Cláudia Miranda/W-4239-2017","Ribeiro, Humberto/0000-0003-4747-1048; Veloso, Cláudia Miranda/0000-0001-6612-0580","research unit on Governance, Competitiveness and Public Policy - FEDER funds through COMPETE2020 - Programa Operacional Competitividade & Internacionalizacao (POCI) [POCI-01-0145-FEDER-008540]; FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia a Tecnologia","research unit on Governance, Competitiveness and Public Policy - FEDER funds through COMPETE2020 - Programa Operacional Competitividade & Internacionalizacao (POCI); FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))","This work was financially supported by the research unit on Governance, Competitiveness and Public Policy (project POCI-01-0145-FEDER-008540), funded by FEDER funds through COMPETE2020 - Programa Operacional Competitividade & Internacionalizacao (POCI) - and by national funds through FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia & a Tecnologia.",,23,1,1,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,512,526,,,,,,15,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540720300049,0

Harmonization is currently being promoted through EU directives that are changing national legislation. The aim of this contribution is to quantify the impact of important changes (in financial accounting between 2004 and 2017) on the financial position and performance of agricultural business. The impact of the changes was quantified using the average values of a sample of 100 selected entities across the Czech Republic (i.e., joint stock companies, limited liability companies and cooperatives with primary agricultural activity). Average values are presented in the tables so that the effect of the change on the balance sheet and profit can be demonstrated. The data wereobtained from the collection of commercial register documents. Important changes (specific for agriculture) have been found: valuation of assets, reporting of preferential limits, depreciation of permanent crops on foreign land and valuation of inventories of own production, reporting a change in their amount.","[Moravec, Lukas; Kukalova, Gabriela] Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Trade & Finance, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic; [Hinke, Jana; Ticha, Zuzana] Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Univ 22, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Moravec, L (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Trade & Finance, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic.",LukasGM@gmail.com; hinke@kfu.zcu.cz; kukalova@pef.czu.cz; susann.t@seznam.cz,"Moravec, Lukas/C-7042-2018; Kukalova, Gabriela/B-6171-2018","Moravec, Lukas/0000-0002-7713-4221;","Internal Grant Agency (IGA) of Faculty of Economics and Management, CULS Prague [SGS-2017-004, 20171032]","Internal Grant Agency (IGA) of Faculty of Economics and Management, CULS Prague","This article isthe partial result of the project of the Faculty of Economics at the University of West Bohemia entitled SGS-2017-004: Finance and Sustainable Development in Theory and Practice, as well as the partial result of the project No. 20171032 - Czech tax gap as a consequence of profit shifting quantification and its factors identification, supported by the Internal Grant Agency (IGA) of Faculty of Economics and Management, CULS Prague.",,12,1,1,1,9,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8980-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,436,444,,,,,,9,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BM4AM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000462948800056,0

Based on the results of the research, it is revealed that the level of the willingness was 44.65 %, meaning that farmers are still hesitant to continue the LIPM. Age, LIPM farmers and friendship predicted the willingness to continue LIPM. In other words, it is indicated that farmers will become more willing to continue LIPM Program if they believe that the program has a positive outcome. Nevertheless, the constraints in implementing the LIPM program, attitudes towards property rights, the contribution of farming income and farming experience make farmers less willing to continue the program due to the fact that the more experienced the farmers, especially those who rented out the land and had high farming income, the more impossible for them to avoid applying pesticides for fear that their rice farming will be at risk.","[Perwitasari, Hani; Irham; Hardyatuti, Suhatmini; Hartono, Slamet] Univ Gadjah Mada, Dept Agr Socioecon, Yogyakarta, Indonesia",Gadjah Mada University,"Perwitasari, H (通讯作者)，Univ Gadjah Mada, Dept Agr Socioecon, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.",hani.perwita@ugm.ac.id; irham@ugm.ac.id; suhatmini_h@ugm.ac.id; hartono.slamet@yahoo.com,"Perwitasari, Hani/AAY-7999-2021",,"faculty of agriculture Universitas Gadjah Mada; Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education","faculty of agriculture Universitas Gadjah Mada; Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education","Researchers would like to thank faculty of agriculture Universitas Gadjah Mada and Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education for the facilities and financial assistance provided.",,15,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5401,,978-94-6252-619-8,AER ADV ENG RES,,,2018,172.0,,,,,,15,19,,,,,,5,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BP7HZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000562072800004,0

The political debate flared up among by EU member states when the topic is the development of military programme under the EU security community. Security changes and challenges for the European security could force states to rethink about restructuring of national armies that might be transformed and interrelated into European army and put under the unified EU's command.

The comparison of share price performance and dividend payments in more than a hundred-year retrospective had allowed to find out the phenomenon of anomalous volatility for stock prices. The result had a powerful influence on the concept of risky asset evaluation. The authors of the paper proposed to study time series of stock prices and dividend payments in a somewhat different frame of reference. The aim of the paper is to examine investors' perception of growth prospects for equities based on the investigation of share price dynamics compared to annual dividend payments. The proposed theoretical model uses an original procedure of continuously growing dividend discounting with arbitrary investment period. The research deals, but not limited to, with the shares of American and Russian corporations from 1985 till 2016. The central issue of the research is to compare the observed price-dividend dependence for the share with the one corresponding to classical dividend discount model assuming that the growth of dividend is uniform and the period of investment is infinite. The result of the analysis carried out is that both in well-developed and in emerging markets authors' technique allows to gain an insight (for many securities) into the primary motive for representative shareholder to evaluate a security: is it an income from share price growth or a willingness to receive stock dividends. Similar diagnostics is of undoubted interest for portfolio management; it is more exact for developed markets that have longer history and are less volatile. We show in the paper that the proposed method makes it possible to define the concept of earnings shares and growth shares more concretely.","[Petrov, Sergey; Yashina, Nadezhda; Kashina, Oksana; Pronchatova-Rubtsova, Nataliya] Lobachevsky State Univ Nizhny Novgorod, Inst Econ & Entrepreneurship, Dept Finance & Credit, Bolshaya Pokrovskaya St 37, Nizhnii Novgorod 603000, Russia",Lobachevsky State University of Nizhni Novgorod,"Petrov, S (通讯作者)，Lobachevsky State Univ Nizhny Novgorod, Inst Econ & Entrepreneurship, Dept Finance & Credit, Bolshaya Pokrovskaya St 37, Nizhnii Novgorod 603000, Russia.",petrov_ss@list.ru; sitnicof@mail.ru; oksana_kashina@mail.ru; pronat89@mail.ru,"Kashina, Oksana/O-8961-2017; Petrov, Sergey/R-7564-2016; Pronchatova-Rubtsova, Nataliya/AAH-2583-2021; Pronchatova-Rubtsova, Nataliya/HIR-3846-2022","Pronchatova-Rubtsova, Nataliya/0000-0002-8924-2991; Pronchatova-Rubtsova, Nataliya/0000-0002-8924-2991",RFBR [18-010-00909],RFBR(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)),The reported study was funded by RFBR according to the research project No 18-010-00909.,,16,1,1,0,3,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8980-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,500,508,,,,,,9,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BM4AM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000462948800064,0

The current paper intends to assess the sustainable consumption behaviour of young generations in Romania with the aim to improve the education process related to sustainability at university level. The study was conducted on students enrolled in life sciences programs, using a face-to-face survey. Education for sustainable consumption behaviour, decision buying criteria, and awareness about the flow of products within the food value chain were the main topics included in the questionnaire. The approach was undertaken on individual and global level with the aim to emphasize the complexity of the phenomenon. Results indicate that students assign different importance to the production process, commercialization networks, environmental impact, and social aspects. Respondents claim that the benefits of food consumption on own health is more important than assuring the animal welfare within the production process. By grouping the main aspects that define sustainable consumption behaviour it was noticed that the individual concerns (health and safety) are more valuable than the global ones (socio-economic and environmental). Universities are ethically responsible for educating students towards sustainable consumption habits. Similarly, young people should be aware that individual actions have impact on the collective well-being, for the present and future generations.","[Pocol, C. B.; Dumitras, D.

Using a variety of identification approaches within a difference-in-differences framework and examining a wide range of economic indicators, this paper assesses whether the experiments have spurred growth in the states as promised by the governors and legislatures which enacted them into law. The overall conclusion from the paper is that the fiscal experiments did not spur growth, and if anything harmed state economic performance. Among the identification approaches used, the synthetic control method (Abadie and Gardeazabal, 2003; Abadie et al., 2010) is demonstrated to provide the most compelling evidence.","[Rickman, Dan S.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Econ & Legal Studies Business, 338 Business Bldg, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Wang, Hongbo] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Econ & Legal Studies Business, 410B Business Bldg, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,"Rickman, DS (通讯作者)，Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Econ & Legal Studies Business, 338 Business Bldg, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",dan.rickman@okstate.edu; hongbo.wang@okstate.edu,"Wang, Hongbo/I-5133-2019","Wang, Hongbo/0000-0001-5434-9337; Rickman, Dan/0000-0003-1233-7420",,,,,43,8,9,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

The existence of a natural rate of unemployment implies for Friedman that there is simply no room for discretionary policy. But Phelps builds the case of an intertemporal trade-off, implying that public authorities should adopt dynamic optimisation processes and seek accordingly for the optimal inflation-unemployment dynamic path. A first argument to explain these differences applies to the dynamics at work in a decentralised economy. Next, at the political level Friedman and Phelps show very different degree of confidence in the public authorities.","[Rivot, Sylvie] Univ Haute Alsace, F-68100 Mulhouse, France",Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Haute-Alsace (UHA),"Rivot, S (通讯作者)，Univ Haute Alsace, F-68100 Mulhouse, France.;Rivot, S (通讯作者)，Univ Lorraine, Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, BETA,UMR 7522, 61 Ave Foret Noire, F-67000 Strasbourg, France.",rivot@unistra.fr,,,,,,,56,3,3,1,4,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

This is due to the fact that after the Second World War the Baltic States as dependent on the Soviet Union and Poland under the influence of the Soviet Union were countries with irrational and ineffective socialist economy. At the end of the 1990s, the process of systemic transformation began in these countries, which although completed did not compensate for differences in the level of economic development of the countries of the Baltic Sea basin. With regard to a part of the national economy - the maritime economy, the issues of differences and delays are not so visible due to the nature of this sector. The maritime economy as the most globalized economic activity, even in socialist countries, was to a certain extent based on market principles. The European Commission, striving to achieve equal living standards in Europe, created development strategies on various levels (regional - the European Union Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region, EU - Europe 2020, sectoral - the Integrated EU Maritime Policy), whose task is to achieve continuous and sustainable development, inter alia, in sectors of the economy based on sea resources (maritime economy) of the European Union, including the Baltic Sea Basin region. The aim of the research was to compare and determine the level of development of selected types of maritime economic activity in the Baltic Sea Region countries in the period from the publication of the Integrated Maritime Policy (IMP) for the EU (i.e. from 2007) to 2016. In the paper the method of analysis and logical construction was used. An analysis of selected aspects of economic activity within the maritime economy was performed and then a synthesis was carried out. The relationships detected in this process were examined with the use of selected statistical measures.","[Skrzeszewska, Katarzyna] Gdynia Maritime Univ, Gdynia, Poland",Gdynia Maritime University,"Skrzeszewska, K (通讯作者)，Gdynia Maritime Univ, Gdynia, Poland.",k.skrzeszewska@wpit.am.gdynia.pl,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,361,368,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540723300042,0

Results provide evidence of self- selection biases with all-cash purchasers, distressed properties, and distressed and all-cash properties. Significant disparities in observed cash (-13% and -6.5%) and distressed property discounts (-1% and -6%) are documented in pre-and post-recessionary environments, Further, cash discounts are consistent for non-distressed transactions (-11%) during both periods; however cash discounts associated with non-distressed transactions are significantly reduced post-recession (-23.3% to -3.7%. This attenuation is attributed to a significant increase in the relative frequency of cash purchased distressed properties post-recession, i.e., larger percentage of cash buyers. Sub-sample counterfactual tests confirm prior results, and expand our understanding of all-cash and distressed discount determinants. These results provide insight into observed time variant all-cash, and distressed property discount affect sizes.","[Tidwell, Alan; Jauregui, Andres] Columbus State Univ, 4225 Univ Ave, Columbus, GA 31907 USA; [Sah, Vivek; Narwold, Andrew] Univ San Diego, 5998 Alcala Pk, San Diego, CA 92110 USA",University System of Georgia; Columbus State University; University of San Diego,"Tidwell, A (通讯作者)，Columbus State Univ, 4225 Univ Ave, Columbus, GA 31907 USA.",atidwell@columbusstate.edu; jauregui_andres@columbusstate.edu; viveksah@sandiego.edu; drew@sandiego.edu,,,,,,,33,7,7,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Despite this explicit statement, Norwegian animal husbandry involves numerous generally accepted practices that appears to be contrary to an everyday understanding of this concept. By analysing the moral terms used in the Act in light of central contributions to the animal ethics debate, we aim to bring some clarification to a certain use of this otherwise abstract and complex ethical concept of intrinsic value, and discuss its possible importance in future regulation of animal husbandry. According to the former Minister of Agriculture, the use of 'intrinsic value' is intended to be of symbolic value only and should not have consequences for animal welfare. We will argue that such symbolic use of moral concepts in animal welfare legislation could have two opposite effects, regarded from an animal rights or welfare perspective. It may undermine the meaning of the concepts and make them less valuable in promotion of animal rights, or they may be valuable as tools for long-term political change, despite their mere symbolic function. Although the argument is referring to Norwegian law and animal husbandry, it is also relevant for countries with laws using more or less similar expressions, such as Germany, Switzerland and Austria.","[Troite, M.

The fish's protein was hydrolyzed by biduri protease with a concentration of 1, 2 and 3% (v/w) for 3 hours. Afterwards, the resulted dry hydrolysates were observed to determine the degree of hydrolysis, antioxidant activity (DPPH and reducing power), amino acid composition, and molecular weight. The result shows that the protein hydrolysates derived from common barb and java carp fish had percent value of inhibition (%RSA) respectively of 42.70% and 53.21%, an IC50 value of 1159.76 ppm and 935.84 ppm, reducing power value of 0.508 and 0.524. The protein hydrolysates derived from java carp fish had 15 kinds of an amino acid such as glutamic acid, aspartic acid and lysine, respectively of 13.34%; 8.36%; and 8.20%.

This brought the lack of correlation between the growth in measured education and the growth in income in developing countries to broad attention. Empirical findings confirm that after World War Two, human capital-output ratios have tended to be higher in less developed countries than in developed countries. We explain this pattern using a dynamic general equilibrium model with signaling games that explicitly considers the following: (1) workers with different abilities have different costs when choosing their educational levels, (2) employers are unable to directly observe workers' abilities, and (3) worldwide governments broadly subsidize educational expenditure. Our simulation results suggest that modeling specifications with educational pooling and public subsidies to schooling could well mimic the related features of the data, and consequently these two factors could be especially important for explaining these features even though many other potential factors could also affect both economic growth and human capital accumulation simultaneously.","[Zhao, Hongchun] Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yanjie] Renmin Univ China, Beijing, Peoples R China",Peking University; Renmin University of China,"Zhao, HC (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhaohongchun@nsd.pku.edu.cn,,,,,,,29,2,2,1,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

I construct an instrument for electricity price as the interaction between coal price and the share of thermal generation in a state's total electricity generation capacity. I find that in response to an exogenous increase in electricity price, firms switch to less electricity-intensive production processes within narrowly defined industries, reduce their machine intensity, and have lower output and productivity growth rates. Thus, electricity constraints may limit a country's growth by leading firms to operate in industries with fewer productivity-enhancing opportunities.","[Abeberese, Ama Baafra] Wellesley Coll, Wellesley, MA 02181 USA",Wellesley College,"Abeberese, AB (通讯作者)，Wellesley Coll, Wellesley, MA 02181 USA.",,,,,,,,41,61,70,5,21,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

This is a topic that has so far received limited systematic attention by IR theorists, who have tended to regard secretariats as bit players in global affairs. Drawing on institutional design literature, I develop a detailed theoretical explanation for both secretariat leadership and state mastery of international organizations. Because powerful actors anticipate channels for informal influence when designing secretariats, they seek to maximize formal bureaucratic autonomy. I assess the explanatory power of this theory through an analysis of negotiations over the design of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). A detailed archival investigation reveals that powerful countries, led by the United States, sought to maximize the autonomy of the UNEP secretariat. Developing countries, which expected to exert less informal influence on the new secretariat, sought to ensure strong intergovernmental control over UNEP's secretariat. Since UNEP has been a frequently cited example of secretarial leadership and initiative, finding that the UNEP secretariat's ability to act autonomously was in significant part determined by past institutional design choices holds relevance for theory development.","[Manulak, Michael W.] Balsillie Sch Int Affairs, 67 Erb St West, Waterloo, ON N2L 6C2, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Manulak, MW (通讯作者)，Balsillie Sch Int Affairs, 67 Erb St West, Waterloo, ON N2L 6C2, Canada.",michael.manulak@gmail.com,,,,,,,60,21,22,2,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

Test 1 is whether the model provides reasonably new insights. Test 2 is on whether these have been properly applied to policy settings. Test 3 is whether they are corroborated by evidence. We exemplify by considering the cases of social interactions models, self-control models and, in relation to health message framing, prospect theory. Out of these sets of models, only a correctly applied prospect theory fully passes the tests at present. Specifically, in broad agreement with the evidence, a gain frame has positive implications for welfare encourages disease prevention activity, though this does not apply if the perceived probability of the bad health outcome is large enough. We see our tests as being useful to identify how much health policy weight policy makers should assign to specific behavioral economic models; they are also useful to verify what next steps would be most useful in further research.","[Nakamura, Ryota] Hitotsubashi Univ, Hitotsubashi Inst Adv Study, 2-1 Naka, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868601, Japan; [Suhrcke, Marc] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Zizzo, Daniel John] Newcastle Univ, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, 5th Floor,Daysh Bldg, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Zizzo, Daniel John] BENC, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Zizzo, Daniel John] Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England",Hitotsubashi University; University of York - UK; Newcastle University - UK; Newcastle University - UK,"Zizzo, DJ (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, 5th Floor,Daysh Bldg, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.;Zizzo, DJ (通讯作者)，BENC, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England.;Zizzo, DJ (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England.",daniel.zizzo@newcastle.ac.uk,"Suhrcke, Marc/AAE-9024-2019; Zizzo, Daniel John/H-7841-2016","Suhrcke, Marc/0000-0001-7263-8626; Zizzo, Daniel John/0000-0003-4830-4364; Nakamura, Ryota/0000-0002-3217-6452",Department of Health Policy Research Programme (Policy Research Unit in Behaviour and Health) [PR-UN-0409-10109]; UKCRC Centre for Diet and Physical Activity Research (CEDAR); ESRC (Network for Integrated Behavioural Science) [ES/K002201/1]; University of East Anglia; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K002201/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K002201/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17H02509] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Department of Health Policy Research Programme (Policy Research Unit in Behaviour and Health); UKCRC Centre for Diet and Physical Activity Research (CEDAR); ESRC (Network for Integrated Behavioural Science)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); University of East Anglia; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The study was funded by the Department of Health Policy Research Programme (Policy Research Unit in Behaviour and Health [PR-UN-0409-10109]), the UKCRC Centre for Diet and Physical Activity Research (CEDAR), the ESRC (Network for Integrated Behavioural Science, ES/K002201/1) and the University of East Anglia.

We analyse a new dataset on eighteenth-century book prices and author payments, showing that the legal changes were associated with no reduction in prices and only a temporary increase in payments to authors. Other economic factors led to a gradual reduction in the booksellers' mark-ups, but there is no evidence that the legal reforms diminished their monopoly power. It is, perhaps, not considered through how many hands a book often passes, before it comes into those of the reader; or what part of the profit each hand must retain, as a motive for transmitting it to the next.

However, some gaps in our understanding of the relationship between body size and wages remain. For example, given a height premium and an obesity penalty, due to forces working in opposite directions, the current literature is unable to provide clear answers to questions such as whether a tall obese woman or a short healthy weight woman would earn a higher wage premium. Using Australian data and iso-contour wage curves derived from a semi-parametric wage regression model, this paper illustrates the complex nature of the relationship between height, weight and wages and how the nature of these differences depends on gender and age. As adult height is fixed, a key focus of the paper is illustrating for various height ranges whether there are any wage benefits in the labor market to increasing or decreasing one's weight. For individuals aged 25-54 as a whole, I find that there are strong effects of weight reduction at lower ends of the height distribution for females (between 1.50-1.70 m) but not for males (<1.65 m). For relatively taller men (>1.85 m), a wage premium is found for being overweight. For relatively taller women (>1.72 m), no penalty for being overweight is discernible. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In the first tier, a stress-based location search model is developed by assuming that households search for a new location due to continual stress at different life-domains. The search model adopts a fuzzy logic-based modeling method that mimics the inter-dependencies between push and pull factors. In the second tier, a location choice model is developed that accommodates how location decisions interact with life-cycle events at different life-domains. The model utilizes a latent segmentation-based logit modeling technique to address the panel effect of the households' housing career. The model results suggest that households in general show preference for larger lots, and locations closer to work place, transit stop, and health service. Location choice is found to be significantly influenced by the life-cycle events as well as the lead and lagged effects. For example, the birth of a child magnifies the need of larger lots. The life-history effects, however vary across two segments. Suburbanite households in segment two prefer larger lots following a job change; whereas, urbanite households in segment one show a negative relationship. The adjustment period for a job change is longer than that of addition of a new job. A longer adjustment time is also found in the case of the first time vehicle purchase than acquisition of a vehicle. Presence of children influences suburbanite households to reside closer to work place. Urbanite households with children prefer to live closer to school. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Analyzing unique microlevel data from rural Ghana, I examine the influence of reference groups' economic characteristics on respondents' perceptions of their economic well-being. I find that the way a reference group is defined is strongly associated with whether respondents experience relative deprivation or positive effects. As in other studies, an increase in the economic status of spatially defined reference groups is associated with relative deprivation. In contrast, findings from reference groups defined with social network data on gift receipt or trust are more complex. Respondents are likelier to report higher levels of subjective well-being when their social networks' assets increase and expenditures decrease. That is, respondents feel better when the people they trust or the people they have received gifts from are wealthy but thrifty. This likely indicates that respondents hope to draw on members from these potential helper networks in times of need.","[Lentz, Erin C.] Lyndon B Johnson Sch Publ Affairs, Austin, TX 78712 USA",,"Lentz, EC (通讯作者)，Lyndon B Johnson Sch Publ Affairs, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",erinclentz@utexas.edu,,"Lentz, Erin/0000-0001-9934-9496",,,,,42,5,6,0,10,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0013-0079,1539-2988,,ECON DEV CULT CHANGE,Econ.

We use a large data set consisting of disaggregated sectoral industrial production indexes from selected countries in the region and employ a factor-augmented vector autoregression (FAVAR) approach to analyse the transmission of shocks in different industries. We find that a positive output shock in the entire Trans-Pacific region has positive effects on the majority of US manufacturing sectors. We also find that sectoral shocks in five sectors of the Trans-Pacific region have a large impact on the overall US economy. Three of the five sectors displayed strong same-sector responses relative to the overall response, suggesting that vertical production linkages might play a key role in the transmission of shocks. Our results highlight the importance of examining industrial sectors in studying the transmission of shocks in the Trans-Pacific region.","[Yagihashi, Takeshi; Selover, David D.] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Econ, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA",Old Dominion University,"Yagihashi, T (通讯作者)，Old Dominion Univ, Dept Econ, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.",,"Yagihashi, Takeshi/AAF-1254-2020","Yagihashi, Takeshi/0000-0001-9916-6008",,,,,67,0,0,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,OCT,2017,40.0,10,,,,,2097,2124,,10.1111/twec.12471,0.0,,,28,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,FK2XT,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413347400004,0

We provide a short survey of this literature, identifying potential causes for this empirical heterogeneity. Next, we replicate the results from two significant studies using six alternative measures of income inequality for an updated dataset of up to 112 countries over the period 1970-2010. Notably, we use the latest release of the Standardized World Income Inequality Dataset, which allows us to account for the uncertainty of the estimated Gini coefficients. We find that the results of previous studies are sensitive to the choice of country sample, time period and/or inequality measure used.

The empirical results show the relevance of the modeling approach and provide evidence of regime change in inflation persistence that contributes to a better understanding of the inflationary process in the US. Most importantly, these empirical findings remind us that a one-size-fits-all monetary policy is unlikely to work in all circumstances.

From a methodological point of view, this study is focused on the relationship between all operators involved in the governance of irrigation water (authorities, GDAs and irrigators) through an agreement between the stakeholders, taking into account private information held by the operator. The model developed is an incentive regulation contract where CRDA (the Regional Authority for Agricultural Development) is the principal and GDAs are the agents. Concerning information asymmetry, technical efficiency, with a stochastic cost frontier, is used to characterize the agent type (GDA) and consequently, the source of asymmetry between the principal and the agents. Simulation of optimal regulation contract demonstrates that the billed water volume and the network performance decrease according to the GDA efficiency level and that the volumes of water extracted and lost increase following the GDA type. Results highlight the trade-off between rent extraction and efficiency, that characterizes the theory of incentives: the authorization given to GDAs to produce a volume of water lost beyond the optimum volume allowed and the reduced trade volumes compared to the first rank optimum (complete information).","[Mahdhi, Naceur] Inst Reg Arides Medenine IRA, Rue Jorf Km 22-5, Medenine, Tunisia; [Mongi, Sghaier] Inst Reg Arides Medenine, Medenine, Tunisia; [Mongi, Sghaier] IRA, Medenine, Tunisia",Institut des Regions Arides; Institut des Regions Arides; Institut des Regions Arides,"Mahdhi, N (通讯作者)，Inst Reg Arides Medenine IRA, Rue Jorf Km 22-5, Medenine, Tunisia.",naceur.mahdhi@ira.rnrt.tn,,,,,,,26,2,2,0,2,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,2611-1128,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,SEP,2017,16.0,3,,,,,64,72,,,,,,9,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,FN8SR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416296300008,0

However, the housing market may not be efficient in the short run. Based on the correlation between housing returns and the economic growth rate, 3 distinct states can be discerned in the performance of the Chinese housing market. The first state is a bubble period, during which housing returns are excessively high and negatively correlated with the economic growth rate; the second state is a correction period, during which housing prices are corrected toward market fundamentals; and the third state is a calm market period, during which no substantial performance or trends manifest. This study determined that excess monetary liquidity significantly influenced the housing market states; however, no such effect was observed when the interest rate was adjusted. Thus, the findings implicate that if the People's Bank of China intends to avoid losing control of the housing market, it should exercise monetary control to avoid excess liquidity in the housing market.","[Tsai, I-Chun] Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Finance, 700 Kaohsiung Univ Rd, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan",National University Kaohsiung,"Tsai, IC (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Finance, 700 Kaohsiung Univ Rd, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan.",ictsai@nuk.edu.tw,"Tsai, I-Chun/H-6503-2018","Tsai, I-Chun/0000-0001-8277-2327",Ministry and Science and Technology of Taiwan [MOST-104-2410-H-390-028-MY3],Ministry and Science and Technology of Taiwan,I would like to thank Robert M.

A decision-maker associates a random utility U-j + m(j) to each alternative in a finite set j is an element of {1, ... , J}, where U = {U-1, ... , U-J} is unobserved by the researcher and random with an unknown joint distribution, while the perturbation m = (m(1), ... , m(J)) is observed. The decision-maker chooses the alternative that yields the maximum random utility, which leads to a choice probability system m -> (Pr (1 vertical bar m), ... , Pr (J vertical bar m)). Previous research has shown that the choice probability system is identified from the observation of the relationship m -> Pr (1 vertical bar m). We show that the complete choice probability system is identified from observation of a relationship m -> Sigma(s)(j=1) Pr (j vertical bar m), for any s < J. That is, it is sufficient to observe the aggregate probability of a group of alternatives as it depends on m. This is relevant for applications where choices are observed aggregated into groups while prices and attributes vary at the level of individual alternatives.","[Fosgerau, Mogens; Ranjan, Abhishek] Tech Univ Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark,"Fosgerau, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark.",mfos@dtu.dk; abhra@dtu.dk,"Fosgerau, Mogens/B-1455-2018","Fosgerau, Mogens/0000-0002-6452-5215; Ranjan, Abhishek/0000-0002-4293-5168",,,,,11,0,0,0,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,AUG,2017,83.0,2,,,,,283,292,,10.1007/s11238-017-9596-x,0.0,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,FB7FS,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406307100006,0

Data were collected at thirty locations on thirty different streets in Nanjing area in China. Pearson's Chi-square tests were conducted to make comparisons of the comfort perception among different cyclist groups. The factors that significantly affected the comfort perception of the cyclists included the age of the cyclists, the type of two-wheeled vehicles, the volume of two-wheeled vehicles, the width of mid-block bicycle lanes, the proportions of e-bikes and e-scooters in two-wheeled vehicles, the physical separation between motorized, bicycle and pedestrian lanes, the slope of bicycle lanes, the roadside access points and the roadside land use. Ordered probit models were developed to quantitatively evaluate the impacts of different contributing factors on the comfort perception of the riders of e-bikes, e-scooters and bicycles. The results showed that compared to the riders of bicycles, the riders of e-bikes and e-scooters were more likely to perceive a poor comfort level. The comfort perception of the cyclists increased with an increase in the width of the mid-block bicycle lane, whereas it decreased with an increase in the volume of two-wheeled vehicles. The proportions of e-bikes and e-scooters in two wheeled vehicles negatively affected the comfort perception of the cyclists. In addition, the presence of physical separation between the motorized, bicycle and pedestrian lanes significantly increased the comfort perception of the cyclists. With the comfort perception models, a procedure was developed and insights were gained to help transportation professionals estimate the BLOS of a mid-block bicycle lane with mixed two-wheeled traffic.

This strategy aims to constrain congestion, cater for future economic growth and make Nottingham a more attractive location for business investment and to live, visit and work. Literature reveals that the Nottingham WPL forms a relatively small proportion of a business' turnover and that the availability of an efficient public transport system is an important factor in business location decisions. Consequently, central to the WPL package is the expectation that an improved public transport network will prove sufficiently attractive to the business community to offset any perceived negativity of the WPL and hence make Nottingham an attractive business location relative to other UK and European Cities. This paper aims to evaluate the economic and inward investment impact of the Nottingham WPL package. The Theory of Change approach is used to analyse the impact complemented by bench marking against comparator Cities. A range of available indicators are used including economic output, employment, net business VAT registrations, the level of investment enquiries and successes and investment case studies. The paper concludes that there is strong evidence that the WPL is not having a significantly negative impact on inward investment. Additionally, strong growth in employment and output, combined with a positive movement of inward investment indicators, suggests that Nottingham remains relatively attractive to investors. There is emerging evidence from investment case studies that the public transport improvements are playing a role in this.

We analyse whether their state aid policies during and after transition challenged European state aid legislation, and whether these fit into the EU strategy of less but better targeted aid'. The data-based analysis is complemented with some indicative insights from state aid in the steel industry as well as the financial service sector to suggest that there is today no significant difference in state aid law application between East and West any more - the new EU members have further caught up by better aligning to the objectives of the State Aid Action Plan.","[Holscher, Jens] Bournemouth Univ, Bournemouth, Dorset, England; [Nulsch, Nicole] Univ Bremen, Bremen, Germany; [Stephan, Johannes] Univ Freiberg, Freiberg, Germany",Bournemouth University; University of Bremen,"Hölscher, J (通讯作者)，Bournemouth Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Execut Business Ctr, 89 Holdenhurst Rd, Bournemouth BH8 8EB, Dorset, England.",jholscher@bournemouth.ac.uk,"Stephan, Johannes Florian/ABN-2430-2022; Holscher, Jens/G-1834-2018","Stephan, Johannes Florian/0000-0003-3619-2537; Holscher, Jens/0000-0001-6689-8392",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M002462/1]; ESRC [ES/M002462/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M002462/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We wish to thank the two anonymous referees and the Editor, Michelle Cini, for their helpful comments and suggestions.

However, scholars argue that this crisis also presents an opportunity for the Europeanization of national public spheres as public attention regarding Europe has increased. Therefore, this study examines the media discourse on the crisis and the possible convergence of the national public spheres of Germany and Spain. It investigates how the issue is framed and who participates in the discourse during the crisis between 2010 and 2014 in German and Spanish online quality newspapers. Based on a content analysis of 7,256 statements in 961 articles, frames were identified in a data-driven approach. Results show that German and Spanish media have Europeanized their framing during the crisis and mainly support Europe's policy. This convergence has occurred despite a slight renationalization of discourse participants, indicating that Europeanization has been increasingly sustained by national actors.","[Kaiser, Johannes] Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Kleinen-von Koenigsloew, Katharina] Univ Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany",University of Zurich; University of Hamburg,"Kaiser, J (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, IPMZ Inst Mass Commun & Media Res, Andreasstr 15, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland.",j.kaiser@ipmz.uzh.ch,"Konigslow, Katharina Kleinen-von/G-5377-2012","Kaiser, Johannes/0000-0001-9888-2037; Kleinen-von Konigslow, Katharina/0000-0001-7700-9829",,,,,32,11,15,0,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

What is less well known, however, is whether (and how) self-generation influences households' willingness to pay (WTP) for service reliability. Using data collected from a sample of Nigerian households, the results reveal that engagement in self-generation is positively correlated with WTP for reliability. This is despite the fact that self-generation reduces the negative welfare impact of unreliability. Further analyses, however, show that backup households' decisions to pay a higher amount than non-backup households are influenced by the costs of self-generation: an increase of N1 (US$0.006) in self-generation's fuel cost per-hour is associated with WTP about N5.22 (US$0.032) more in the monthly bill. However, households' WTP US$0.15-0.16/kWh of improved reliability is smaller than the marginal costs of reliability from self-generation-US$0.27-0.41/kWh. We conclude by discussing the policy implications of our findings.","[Oseni, Musiliu O.] UCL, Bartlett Fac Built Environm, 1-19 Torrington Pl, London WC1E 7HB, England",University of London; University College London,"Oseni, MO (通讯作者)，UCL, Bartlett Fac Built Environm, 1-19 Torrington Pl, London WC1E 7HB, England.",musloseni@yahoo.com,,,"Cambridge Judge Business School, University of Cambridge; African Economic Research Consortium (AERC)","Cambridge Judge Business School, University of Cambridge; African Economic Research Consortium (AERC)","I would like to thank Michael Pollitt and Paul Kattuman for reading and discussing numerous drafts of this paper.

In addition, evidence on the differences between visitors and potential future visitors sheds new light on regional festival marketing. The sense of well-being associated with attending the festival, the acknowledgement of the festival's importance to the local community, and how it nurtures and supports new talent were also found to influence people's valuation. These findings highlight the need for a policy rethink towards increased government funding to sustain regional festivals.","[Mahadevan, Renuka] Univ Queensland, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",University of Queensland,"Mahadevan, R (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",r.mahadevan@uq.edu.au,"Mahadevan, Renuka/AAA-1046-2019","Mahadevan, Renuka/0000-0003-4105-2993",,,,,40,8,8,1,34,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Nonetheless, this has not always been the case. In 1873 a curious debate took place in Paris between a young Leon Walras and Pierre Emile Levasseur concerning the compatibility of mathematics, economics, and free will. It was the consequence of a Laplacian view of mathematics that Walras inherited from physics, a view that associated mathematics with a peculiar philosophical conception. We reconstruct the historical context of the debate, the particular view of mathematics that lead to it, and then analyse the attitudes of Cournot, Walras, and Levasseur on the issue. We show that the mathematisation of economics was deeply influenced by how physicists understood mathematics.","[Mueller, Thomas Michael] Ave Maurice Maeterlinck 17, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium",,"Mueller, TM (通讯作者)，Ave Maurice Maeterlinck 17, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.",thomasvismara@hotmail.com,"Mueller, Thomas/ACZ-4369-2022","Mueller, Thomas/0000-0002-8537-3302",,,,,47,3,3,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

This paper studies the impacts on consumption in rural India over a 17-year period, allowing for both internal and external (villagelevel) effects. Under our identifying assumptions, electrification brought significant consumption gains for households who acquired electricity for their own use. We also find evidence of a dynamic effect of village connectivity for households without electricity themselves. This is suggestive of an external effect, which also comes with a shift in consumption spending suggestive of status concerns among those still without electricity. Labor earnings were an important channel of impact. This was mainly through extra work by men. There was no effect on average wage rates.","[van de Walle, Dominique] World Bank, Res Dept, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Ravallion, Martin] Georgetown Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Ravallion, Martin] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Mendiratta, Vibhuti] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Koolwal, Gayatri] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank; Georgetown University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Paris School of Economics; The World Bank,"Ravallion, M (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20057 USA.;Ravallion, M (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",dvandewalle@worldbank.org; mr1185@georgetown.edu; vibhutim@gmail.com; koolwalg@gmail.com,,,World Bank's Gender Action Plan and Research Support Budget,World Bank's Gender Action Plan and Research Support Budget,"The findings, interpretations, and conclusions of this paper should not be attributed to the World Bank or any affiliated organization.

A monotonicity axiom states an increase in certain parameters of a game as a hypothesis and states an increase in a player's payoff as a conclusion. We focus on various parameters of a game and introduce new axioms. Combined with previous results, we prove that efficiency, symmetry and a monotonicity axiom characterize (i) four linear solutions in the literature, namely, the Shapley value, the equal division value, the CIS value and the ENSC value, and (ii) a class of solutions obtained by taking a convex combination of the above solutions. Our methodological contribution is to provide a new linear algebraic approach for characterizing solutions by monotonicity. Using a new basis of the linear space of TU games, we identify a class of games in which a solution that satisfies monotonicity is linear. Our approach provides some intuition for why monotonicity implies linearity.","[Yokote, Koji; Funaki, Yukihiko] Waseda Univ, Sch Polit Sci & Econ, Shinjuku Ku, 1-6-1 Nishi Waseda, Tokyo 1698050, Japan",Waseda University,"Yokote, K (通讯作者)，Waseda Univ, Sch Polit Sci & Econ, Shinjuku Ku, 1-6-1 Nishi Waseda, Tokyo 1698050, Japan.",sidehand@toki.waseda.jp; funaki@waseda.jp,,,"JSPS KAKENHI [JP26380247, JP23530231, JP24220033, JP26245026]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17H00761, 26245026] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The authors thank an associate editor and anonymous referees for their valuable comments and suggestions.

We find that the total return spillover risks account for about one-third of the total return variance, on average, in the four-asset system. When we add commercial real estate (CRE) to the system, but for a shorter sample period from February 1998 to September 2014, we estimate an average total return spillover risk of 28.0 %. In an extended Fama-French's five-factor CAPM framework, we find that the net return spillover risks have significant and negative effects on EREIT and MREIT returns, but positive effects on bond return. We infer that during the period of high oil price volatility from 1978 to 1986, bond market, as a net receiver of market risks, increased its risk premiums in response to high spillover risks from other market. However, in the post-subprime crisis period, large spillover risks from the stock market, which is a net transmitter of risks, decreased EREIT and MREIT returns. We also find that CRE return is not affected by spillover risks from other markets. Institutional investors should thus not neglect spillover risks when constructing asset allocation strategies that include assets other than CRE.","[Chiang, Ming-Chu] Natl Yunlin Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Finance, 123 Univ Rd,Sect 3, Touliu 64002, Yunlin, Taiwan; [Sing, Tien Foo] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Real Estate, 4 Architecture Dr, Singapore 117566, Singapore; [Tsai, I-Chun] Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Finance, 700 Kaohsiung Univ Rd, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan",National Yunlin University Science & Technology; National University of Singapore; National University Kaohsiung,"Chiang, MC (通讯作者)，Natl Yunlin Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Finance, 123 Univ Rd,Sect 3, Touliu 64002, Yunlin, Taiwan.",mingchuc@yuntech.edu.tw; rststf@nus.edu.sg; ictsai@nuk.edu.tw,"Tsai, I-Chun/H-6503-2018; Sing, Tien Foo/J-9381-2013","Tsai, I-Chun/0000-0001-8277-2327; Sing, Tien Foo/0000-0002-4101-851X","Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan, ROC [NSC101-2410-H-224-037-]","Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan, ROC","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan, ROC (Grant No. NSC101-2410-H-224-037-).

The paper finds that the oil boom between 1970 and 1980 was associated with a slower growth in the relative demand for skills in the oil and gas sector and regions where the sector had a large presence. The oil boom led to a sharp rise in real wages and a modest decline in college wage premium in oil-rich regions in the USA. Using a synthetic cohort approach, the paper finds that relative to cohorts who went to high school in the pre-oil boom period, the cohort reaching high school age during the oil boom was about 1-2% points less likely to have a college degree by 2000 and 2010.","[Kumar, Anil] Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, Res Dept, Dallas, TX 75201 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Dallas,"Kumar, A (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, Res Dept, Dallas, TX 75201 USA.",anil.kumar@dal.frb.org,,,,,,,32,20,25,0,10,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Some respond that the European Union should not bend to Russia's acts of aggression. Others blame the allegedly exclusionary and expansive nature of the Euro-Atlantic organizations for the conflict. This paper embeds these competing narratives in the functional approach of David Mitrany, specifically in his two distinctive forms of regional integration, one exclusive and one inclusive. At the same time, however, the paper cautions against drawing simplified conclusions based on the parallels between Mitrany's ideal types of regional integration and contemporary arguments about the place of Russia in European security governance. Indeed, a more inclusive approach to Russia can potentially be beneficial for European security order, but there are more problems with this vision than simply the short-sightedness of western institutions. Unfortunately, Mitrany's functional approach does not offer immediate solutions to these problems.","[Zwolski, Kamil] Univ Southampton, Southampton, Hants, England",University of Southampton,"Zwolski, K (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Polit & Int Relat, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",k.m.zwolski@soton.ac.uk,,"Zwolski, Kamil/0000-0001-6043-8790",,,,,47,5,7,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

In this article we propose a maximum likelihood estimator that deals with misreporting in a systematic way. We illustrate the methodology using dyadic data on interhousehold transfers from the village of Nyakatoke in Tanzania. We show that not taking reporting bias into account leads to serious underestimation of the total amount of transfers between villagers. We also provide suggestive evidence that reporting bias can affect inference about estimated coefficients.

We use public data on 73 airlines operating worldwide over the period 1996-2011. In estimating the impact of leasing on profitability, we control for potential endogeneity by applying robust instrumental variables estimation, while introducing a set of individual and macroeconomic factors. Our results are threefold. First, we identify a non-monotonic and concave effect of leasing on an airline's profit margin, suggesting decreasing marginal returns to leasing in this sector. This is an original finding for the industry. We also derive a confidence interval for the optimal level of leasing. Second, we show that the impact of leasing on an airline's operating profit is stronger for Low Cost Carriers than for Full Cost Carriers: deviating from the optimal level of leasing might be more harmful for a LCC than for a legacy carrier. Finally, we analyze how an airline's experience affects the relationship between leasing and profitability. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper employs a large cross section of bilateral trade data on aggregate cross-border goods and services sales and illustrates that the depth and overlap of two countries' services networks induce a positive direct impact on their services-trade volume. The evidence takes into account that goods trade flows and networks are potentially endogenous so that the estimated direct effects support a causal interpretation.

Existing fixed-effects estimators can potentially suffer from three limitations which are overcome by the proposed approach: (i) incidental parameters bias in nonlinear models with large N and small T; (ii) lack of efficiency; and (iii) inability to estimate the effects of time-invariant regressors. We conduct Monte Carlo simulations to assess the small-sample performance of the new estimators and provide comparisons of new and existing penalized estimators in terms of quadratic loss. We apply the technique to an empirical example of the estimation of consumer preferences for nutrients from a demand model using a large transaction-level dataset of household food purchases. We show that preferences for nutrients vary across the conditional distribution of expenditure and across genders, and emphasize the importance of fully capturing consumer heterogeneity in demand modeling.

The authors provide a synthesis of various frameworks for sustainable tourism indicators for subnational regions and cities, concluding that it is more feasible to analyse existing sustainable tourism indicators than to introduce new measures lacking in direct practical applicability for the organizations. The application of data envelopment analysis (DEA) for benchmarking urban tourism destinations is then demonstrated by assessing measures available in TourMIS. Findings include inefficiency scores that suggest both managerial and political implications. Furthermore, the concept of a virtual reference destination assisting managers and politicians to analyse their destination's strengths and weaknesses is introduced.","[Oender, Irem; Woeber, Karl; Zekan, Bozana] MODUL Univ Vienna, Vienna, Austria",,"Zekan, B (通讯作者)，MODUL Univ Vienna, Dept Tourism & Serv Management, Kahlenberg 1, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.",bozana.zekan@modul.ac.at,,,,,,,58,35,36,5,75,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

It also discusses Modigliani's contribution to the neoclassical synthesis, arguing that Modigliani's attention to the monetary origin of and solution to unemployment contrasts with the neoclassical synthesis neglecting of the monetary side of the system and its inclination towards fiscal policy.","[Rancan, Antonella] Univ Molise, Dept Econ, Campobasso, Italy",University of Molise,"Rancan, A (通讯作者)，Univ Molise, Dept Econ, Campobasso, Italy.",antonella.rancan@unimol.it,,,ESHET; Economists' Papers Project,ESHET; Economists' Papers Project,This article benefited of financial support from the ESHET and the Economists' Papers Project.

The performance of the firms is assessed for the period between 2011 and 2013. The weights of evaluation criteria are determined by applying entropy, which is an objective weighting method. In the analysis, the firms are ranked by integrating entropy-based MAUT method. According to the analysis results, Kartonsan has the highest performance rate for all the years, whereas Viking has shown the poorest performance except for the year 2011. During the period, Mondi and Olmuksan, which are acquired by foreign investors, have shown relatively stable performance; however, the performance rate of Kaplamin is unstable. The only firm that has a rising performance trend during the period is Alkim.

Estimating a Conservative Lower Bound,JOURNAL OF REAL ESTATE FINANCE AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,House prices; Trough; Lower bound; Trend; Financial stress testing,RISK; CYCLE; MODEL,"In risk management, the credit risk and required capital associated with mortgage assets is often estimated through stress testing where the house price path is an important determinant of the severity of the stress test. Specifically, the extent of credit-related losses is a function of how far house prices are above long-term trend and the extent to which they can fall below trend. Focusing on the latter, we develop a theoretically-based statistical technique to identify a conservative lower bound (CLB) for house prices. Leveraging a model based upon investor incentives, the CLB explains the depth of housing market downturns at both the national and state level over a variety of market environments. This approach performs well in several historical back tests and has strong out-of-sample predictive ability. When back-tested, the estimation approach does not understate house price declines in any state over the 1987 to 2001 housing cycle and only understates declines in three states during the most recent financial crisis. This latter result is particularly noteworthy given that the post-2001 estimates are performed out-of-sample. The CLB is attractive because it (1) provides a leading indicator of the severity of future downturns and (2) allows estimates of trough to recover or decrease in magnitude as markets return to baseline conditions. This estimation technique could prove helpful in measuring the credit risk associated with portfolios of mortgage assets as part of evaluating static or designing dynamic stress tests.","[Bogin, Alexander N.; Doerner, William M.] Fed Housing Finance Agcy, Off Policy Anal & Res, Capital Policy Branch, 400 7th St SW, Washington, DC 20024 USA; [Bruestle, Stephen D.] Penn State Erie, Sch Business, Jack Burke Res Ctr 0281, Erie, PA 16563 USA",Federal Housing Finance Agency; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University,"Doerner, WM (通讯作者)，Fed Housing Finance Agcy, Off Policy Anal & Res, Capital Policy Branch, 400 7th St SW, Washington, DC 20024 USA.",alexander.bogin@fhfa.gov; sdb8g@virginia.edu; william.doerner@fhfa.gov,"Bogin, Alex/AAA-1476-2019; Doerner, Work/Z-4203-2019","Doerner, Work/0000-0002-8082-2359",,,,,32,1,1,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Each service entity can play different roles in different contexts, and the value co-creation between service providers and service users becomes more and more complex. In order to understand the value co-creation in Smart Cities, it is important to model the value chain of smart services. Furthermore, understanding the service value co-creation process is critical to the stakeholders in Smart City. Therefore, this paper proposes an approach to model the service value process. By applying the approach to a real-world use case of smart mobility, we can see that our model can not only provide an overall modelling view to the service value process, but can also specify the possible role changes inside the value process. The modelling results further indicate that the proposed model can be used to discover new services and value propositions in Smart City.","[Caputo, Francesco] Univ Salerno, Fisciano, Italy; [Ge, Mouzhi; Walletzk, Leonard] Masaryk Univ, Fac Informat, Brno, Czech Republic",University of Salerno; Masaryk University Brno,"Caputo, F (通讯作者)，Univ Salerno, Fisciano, Italy.",fcaputo@unisa.it; mouzhi.ge@muni.cz; qwalletz@fi.muni.cz,"Walletzký, Leonard/GQI-2510-2022; Caputo, Francesco/G-5539-2018","Walletzký, Leonard/0000-0003-4415-7715; Caputo, Francesco/0000-0001-9583-7222",,,,,31,4,4,0,8,TRAUNER VERLAG,LINZ,"KOGLSTR 14, 4020 LINZ, AUSTRIA",,,978-3-99062-119-6,SCHRIFTEN INFORMATIK,,,2017,46.0,,,,,,375,382,,,,,,8,Economics; Information Science & Library Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Information Science & Library Science,BJ2HL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000419365600042,0

We argue that these location decisions are determined by the allocation of risk between state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and high-level politics. As such, the investment decisions made by NOCs change over time and according to who bears the risk of the investment: the firm or the state. An econometric analysis based on a novel data-set of Chinese NOCs' OFDI over a 14-year period supports this argument. Our findings challenge existing notions of Chinese exceptionalism: rather than making 'risk perverse' location decisions, we find that NOCs seek out host states with robust provisions for the rule of law, control over corruption, and that have a history of stability over the long run.","[Chalmers, Adam William] Kings Coll London, Dept European & Int Studies, London, England; [Mocker, Susanna Theresia] EU Asia Ctr, Brussels, Belgium",University of London; King's College London,"Chalmers, AW (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept European & Int Studies, London, England.",adam.chalmers@kcl.ac.uk,,,,,,,65,19,22,4,50,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

How has the study of money evolved in more recent years, and what is the understanding of international monetary politics today? The main message of this essay is - to be blunt - disappointment. Research has become increasingly insular and introspective, largely detached from what goes on in the real world. Two parallel developments are responsible, both reflective of wider trends in mainstream IPE. First is a steep decline of interest in broader systemic issues, as the pendulum has swung sharply toward the domestic level of analysis. And second is a marked loss of interest in practical policy solutions. In lieu of worries about problems to be solved, scholarship today tends to be driven more by curiosity about puzzles to be explained. The roots of these twin developments trace back, above all, to the framing effect of epistemology - the demanding methodological standards that mainstream IPE has set for itself. The fault lies, first and foremost, with the excessive priority given to formal scientific method.","[Cohen, Benjamin] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Polit Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Cohen, B (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Polit Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",,,,,,,,96,22,25,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The purpose of this paper is to show that an investment function based on the accelerator and integrated in a supermultiplier is able to shape the warranted rate in consonance with the autonomous trend.

Many scholars have started applying standard political economy models based on the distributional consequences of trade or the sociotropic sources of individual policy positions to understand voter preferences. In this essay, we move the conversation using the lever of the New Interdependence Approach to reflect on the referendum process more generally. Rather than viewing globalization largely as an exogenous shock that is filtered through national institutions and cleavages, we argue that it has the potential to alter the political issue space as well as the institutional opportunities available to political actors. In conclusion, we push scholars of both comparative politics and international relations to develop a research agenda for electoral politics in an age of interdependence.","[Farrell, Henry] George Washington Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Washington, DC USA; [Farrell, Henry] George Washington Univ, Elliott Sch Int Affairs, Washington, DC USA; [Newman, Abraham] Georgetown Univ, Edmund A Walsh Sch Foreign Serv, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Newman, Abraham] Georgetown Univ, Dept Govt, Washington, DC 20057 USA",George Washington University; George Washington University; Georgetown University; Georgetown University,"Newman, A (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Edmund A Walsh Sch Foreign Serv, Washington, DC 20057 USA.;Newman, A (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Dept Govt, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",aln24@georgetown.edu,,,,,,,52,20,21,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

NGOs have helped to increase the voice of the developing world, nullify some of the asymmetries in political power vis-a-vis the rich world, and provide trade analysis to bolster participation. What is less recognised is the growing importance of certain international governmental organisations (IGOs) that provide demand driven advocacy through the provision of knowledge and expertise to developing states that, at times, challenges the dominant neoliberal agenda at the WTO. Unlike NGOs, many of these organisations are able to hold observer status on WTO committees and write member state submissions. Yet, ideologically and in terms of their specific capacity-building functions, these organisations are also distinct from other IGOs operating in the area of global trade. Through everyday actions, 'insider' IGOs such as the South Centre and United Nations Conference on Trade and Development undertake work that redresses imbalances of power in global economic governance and transforms the 'common sense' underlying trade practices. In this paper, we develop a set of ideal types aimed at unpacking and illuminating the variegated degrees and types of 'resistance' exercised within the international trade system.","[Hannah, Erin] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Polit Sci, Kings Univ Coll, London, ON, Canada; [Ryan, Holly] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Dept Hist Polit & Philosophy, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Scott, James] Kings Coll London, Dept Polit Econ, Int Polit, London, England",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Manchester Metropolitan University; University of London; King's College London,"Hannah, E (通讯作者)，Univ Western Ontario, Dept Polit Sci, Kings Univ Coll, London, ON, Canada.",ehannah2@uwo.ca,,"Ryan, Holly Eva/0000-0003-3028-4852; Scott, James/0000-0003-3296-0375",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [430-2014-00370],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [grant number 430-2014-00370].,,105,17,17,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Our approach is based on two stages. In the first stage, we apply methods of unit root testing. Our econometric modelling exercise adopts a pair wise approach that is built on a probabilistic test for convergence based on all house price differentials across the Paris districts. We find that more than 50 % of the intra-city house price differentials that can be computed are stationary. In the second stage of our investigation, we analyse the drivers of convergence. The probability of stationarity is negatively affected by unemployment differentials across districts, demographics differentials and supply-side characteristics. Our findings further reveal that the half-life of a shock to long-run price equilibrium is affected positively by unemployment, distance and housing supply. Our analysis suggests that smaller distances between Parisian districts are associated with a faster speed of adjustment back towards long-run equilibrium.","[Holmes, Mark J.] Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Otero, Jesus] Univ Rosario, Fac Econ, Bogota, Colombia; [Panagiotidis, Theodore] Univ Macedonia, Dept Econ, Thessaloniki, Greece",University of Waikato; Universidad del Rosario; University of Macedonia,"Holmes, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand.",holmesmj@waikato.ac.nz; jesus.otero@urosario.edu.co; tpanag@uom.gr,"Panagiotidis, Theodore/C-2282-2014; Holmes, Mark/A-4117-2010; Otero, Jesus/G-1038-2011","Panagiotidis, Theodore/0000-0002-5328-3054; Holmes, Mark/0000-0002-1771-9324; Otero, Jesus/0000-0002-2551-0053",,,,,34,18,19,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

By analyzing the changes which influenced by the supply-side reform on the local government financial resources, we consider that the gap between local government's fiscal revenue and expenditure will widen. That will lead to three kinds of fiscal risks: local government debt risk, PPP project risk and local fiscal administrative risk. In order to solve these fiscal risks, we suggest the local governments need to improve the local government fiscal risk assessment system, speed up the establishment of local tax sources, reform the storage management mode of PPP project, and regulate the local government administrative departments.","[Hu Xinran; Lei Lianghai] Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol, Business Sch, Shanghai, Peoples R China",University of Shanghai for Science & Technology,"Hu, XR (通讯作者)，Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol, Business Sch, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,12,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-402-6,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2017,106.0,,,,,,1,4,,,,,,4,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BI9GR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416081200001,0

How are those losses distributed across the population? In this chapter we answer these questions using a canonical business cycle model featuring household income and wealth heterogeneity that matches micro data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). We document how these losses are distributed across households and how they are affected by social insurance policies. We find that the welfare cost of losing one's job in a severe recession ranges from 2% of lifetime consumption for the wealthiest households to 5% for low-wealth households. The cost increases to approximately 8% for low-wealth households if unemployment insurance benefits are cut from 50% to 10%. The fact that welfare losses fall with wealth, and that in our model (as in the data) a large fraction of households has very low wealth, implies that the impact of a severe recession, once aggregated across all households, is very significant (2.2% of lifetime consumption). We finally show that a more generous unemployment insurance system unequivocally helps low-wealth job losers, but hurts households that keep their job, even in a version of the model in which output is partly demand determined, and therefore unemployment insurance stabilizes aggregate demand and output.","[Krueger, Dirk] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Mitman, Kurt] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Perri, Fabrizio] Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, Minneapolis, MN 55480 USA",University of Pennsylvania; Stockholm University; Federal Reserve System - USA,"Krueger, D (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",,"Mitman, Kurt/IWH-5405-2023","Mitman, Kurt/0000-0003-3631-1073","NSF [SES 1123547, SES 1326781]; Mannerfelt Foundation",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Mannerfelt Foundation,Thanks to Tony Smith for an excellent discussion and to Simone Civale for outstanding research assistance.

While the relation between study field and current job of non-ICT students is influenced by several factors including social and demographic ones, for the ICT students there are just two significant factors identified by the logistic regression used as the main tool: financial situation of their parents and frequency of the paid job during study. ICT students who work during the whole study period more frequently work close to their study field comparing to ICT students who work just from time to time.

In this paper, we investigate the German pilot auction scheme for solar photovoltaics introduced in the Renewable Energies Act 2014 (EEG 2014) that serves as a pilot for the auction based promotion of the three major large-scale renewable electricity generation technologies (wind, solar, biomass) as of 2017. A strategic bidding model is used to determine the optimal bidding strategy and to determine the resulting project value. We consider pay-as-bid and uniform pricing and single and multiple bids. Moreover, we investigate the impact of investment cost uncertainty. In a sensitivity analysis we show how bid strategy adjustments affect the outcome. Specifically, higher uncertainty regarding the market clearing price increases the project value, as this additional uncertainty can be used to raise the probability of obtaining a higher level of remuneration by an adjusted auction strategy. The first price auction can generate additional profits by placing a second, higher bid with a low probability of success. Investment cost uncertainty can have either a positive or negative impact on the project value, depending on the auction parameter values chosen.","[Voss, Andreas] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Templergraben 55, D-52056 Aachen, Germany; [Madlener, Reinhard] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Future Energy Consumer Needs & Behav FCN, Sch Business & Econ, EON Energy Res Ctr, Mathieustr 10, D-52074 Aachen, Germany",RWTH Aachen University; RWTH Aachen University; E-ON,"Madlener, R (通讯作者)，Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Future Energy Consumer Needs & Behav FCN, Sch Business & Econ, EON Energy Res Ctr, Mathieustr 10, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.",RMadlener@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de,,,,,,,44,17,17,3,20,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2017,38.0,,,,1,,229,264,,10.5547/01956574.38.SI1.avos,0.0,,,36,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EW9PI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402851300015,0

The study presented in this paper contributes to this knowledge by empirically testing the influence of selected factors on research productivity of young business scholars working in Visegrad countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia). The research productivity is defined and measured through scholars' publication scores, including publications in journals with JCR's Impact Factor (IF). The study suggests that among key determinants of the success of a business scholar from Visegrad area, there are English language skills and teaching load. Surprisingly, productivity of young business scholars seems not to be leveraged much by the recognizability of their supervisors. Moreover, contrary to some other studies, teaching load correlates positively with research productivity.

However, it is necessary to use a conditional distribution that is flexible enough, allowing for separate modelling of tail asymmetry and skewness, which requires going beyond the skew-t form. Empirical analysis of 60 years of S&P500 daily returns suggests evidence for tail asymmetry (but not for skewness). Moreover, tail thickness and tail asymmetry is not time-invariant. Tail asymmetry became much stronger at the beginning of the Great Moderation period and weakened after 2005, indicating important differences between the 1987 and the 2008 crashes. This is confirmed by our analysis of out-of-sample density forecasting performance (using LPS and CRPS measures) within two recursive expanding-window experiments covering the events. We also demonstrate consequences of accounting for long-term changes in shape features for risk assessment.","[Mazur, Blazej; Pipien, Mateusz] Cracow Univ Econ, Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Mazur, B (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",blazej.mazur@uek.krakow.pl; eepipien@cyf-kr.edu.pl,"Mazur, Błażej/V-3905-2018; Pipień, Mateusz/ABC-8012-2020","Mazur, Błażej/0000-0001-5096-5175; Pipień, Mateusz/0000-0003-1007-3871","National Science Centre, Poland (NCN) [2013/09/B/HS4/01945, 2017/25/B/HS4/02529]","National Science Centre, Poland (NCN)","The research was supported by the National Science Centre, Poland (NCN) research grants (2013/09/B/HS4/01945 and 2017/25/B/HS4/02529).",,39,4,4,0,9,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

The ecotaxe originated from a political consensus and was designed with the collaboration of business stakeholders. However, unforeseen implementation difficulties resulted in a renouncement at a late stage, when the infrastructure was already deployed. According to a recent report from the French body in charge of auditing public expenses, it generated a cost of 953 million euros. In analysing what happened during the policy delivery stage, this paper provides insights to policymakers in countries where ETS is envisaged. The ETS system was piloted in summer 2013, and the go live date was 1st September 2014. Data was collected 'live', in March 2014, featuring 21 interviews, with the aim of better understanding the expected challenges and impacts on the business stakeholders. At the time, stakeholders accepted that the project would go ahead: while further implementation challenges remained, few anticipated them to fully derail the project within 6 months. Retrospective analysis of the data collected in March 2014 can help to deepen policymakers' insights into why the project ultimately failed and better understand the main lessons to be learnt. The findings show that the ecotaxe, presented as environmental taxation by policymakers, had been in reality perceived and accepted by business stakeholders as more of an infrastructure tax. Interestingly, this in itself does not explain the failure. The main explanation is to be found in the perceived inequities associated with the charging approach, excluding privately-operated motorways, and the failure of the ad valorem surcharging system designed as a means of passing the tax costs to shippers. These findings should be valuable for policymakers anywhere the introduction of a similar ETS system is being contemplated.","[Rigot-Mueller, Patrick] Maynooth Univ, Sch Business, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland",Maynooth University,"Rigot-Müller, P (通讯作者)，Maynooth Univ, Sch Business, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland.",patrick.rigotmuller@mu.ie,,"Rigot-Muller, Patrick/0000-0002-8858-261X",,,,,58,2,2,0,6,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

The econometric methodology used in this paper allows us to untangle the causal nexus between energy consumption and economic growth and helps us to discriminate between competing theories on which hypothesis is applicable to China. Among the main results, it is found that there is no causality in two out of twenty-nine provinces and bidirectional causality is observed in sixteen out of twenty-nine provinces. Unidirectional causality is observed in eleven out of twenty-nine provinces of China. When bootstrap critical values are used, our empirical findings indicate that there is an unidirectional causal link running from real output to energy use for China, implying that economic growth significantly affects energy consumption, and hence, the conservation hypothesis is applicable to China.","[Chen, Shyh-Wei] Tunghai Univ, Dept Int Business, Taichung 40704, Taiwan; [Xie, Zixiong] Jinan Univ, Coll Econ, Inst Resources Environm & Sustainable Dev, Dept Int Econ & Trade, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Liao, Ying] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat, Res Ctr Appl Stat, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",Tunghai University; Jinan University; Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics,"Xie, ZX (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Coll Econ, Inst Resources Environm & Sustainable Dev, Dept Int Econ & Trade, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",shyhwei.chen@gmail.com; txiezixiong@jnu.edu.cn; liaoying@jxufe.edu.cn,,,"National Social Science Fund of China [15ZDA054]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71663026, 71273122, 41461025, 71333007]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Postdoctoral Science Foundation Grant of China [2015M571981]; Jiangxi Social Science Fund [15YJ11]",National Social Science Fund of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Postdoctoral Science Foundation Grant of China; Jiangxi Social Science Fund,"We would like to thank the editor, Professor Robert M.

Using Colombia as a case study, we show that the impact of pre-announced daily interventions, adopted in 2008, is larger than the impact of dirty interventions adopted during 2004-2007. In terms of the former, we find that the impact of a change in daily interventions (from US$ 20 million to US$ 40 million) raises the exchange rate by approximately COP $2, implying that actual interventions of US$ 1000 million depreciate domestic currency by 5.5%.

This study offers a skill-centered, industry-level overview of this uneven landscape. Familiar data sources (input-output tables, industry-occupation matrices, and occupational skill profiles) are used to analyze skill demand across the U.S. automotive cluster. The author shows that the automotive industry depends on the high-level manufacturing skills of intermediate goods suppliers and highlights that the lower wages in these and lower-tier supply sectors may impede skill regeneration and upgrading. Economic and workforce development practitioners can use this analysis to begin or reinvigorate skill-centric conversations with employers in high- and low-skill sectors. Industry leaders can use it to demonstrate the extent to which larger firms rely on the skills of their supply network and to motivate investments in skill development across the supply chain.","[Forbes, Allison] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Forbes, A (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Dept City & Reg Planning, New East Bldg,CB3140, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",allison.forbes@gmail.com,,,Frank Hawkins Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise,Frank Hawkins Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise,"The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by the Frank Hawkins Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise.",,54,7,8,0,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

Time is partitioned into waiting and transfer time as well as in-vehicle time under different travel conditions (crowding and seat availability), which may vary along a journey and between days. The experienced service reliability gap (ESRG) index is introduced, defined as the difference between an upper percentile (e.g., the 95th) and the median perceived journey time across days for a particular OD pair and departure time. The metric is evaluated by tracing virtual trips from origin to destination with journey times and travel conditions based on automated vehicle location (AVL) and automated passenger count (APC) data and seated status modelled probabilistically. A study of a high-frequency bus line in Stockholm, Sweden shows that travel conditions co-vary only weakly with nominal journey time, and the ESRG index display patterns across the day not evident in existing reliability measures, such as a wider and later afternoon peak. The ESRG displays significant variation between OD pairs along the line. Correlation with headway variability suggests that measures improving bus regularity have additional positive effects on experienced service reliability.","[Jenelius, Erik] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Civil & Architectural Engn, Brinellvagen 23, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology,"Jenelius, E (通讯作者)，KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Civil & Architectural Engn, Brinellvagen 23, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden.",erik.jenelius@abe.kth.se,"Jenelius, Erik/GQZ-3686-2022; Alidadi, Mehdi/HJZ-0235-2023; Jenelius, Erik/P-2940-2019; Jenelius, Erik/I-8061-2017","Jenelius, Erik/0000-0002-4106-3126; Alidadi, Mehdi/0000-0001-5183-7829; Jenelius, Erik/0000-0002-4106-3126; Jenelius, Erik/0000-0002-4106-3126",TRENoP Strategic Research Area,TRENoP Strategic Research Area,"The author would like to thank the Stockholm City Council Transport Administration for kindly providing the data.

The mechanism is based on a planning model that considers generation investments as a response to transmission developments, and the Shapley Value from cooperative game theory. This method provides a unique allocation of benefits and costs considering each country's average incremental contribution to the cooperative agreement. The allocation satisfies an axiomatic definition of fairness. We demonstrate our results for three planned transmission interconnections in the North Sea and show that the proposed mechanism can be used as a basis for defining a set of Power Purchase Agreements among countries. This achieves the desired final distribution of economic benefits and costs from transmission interconnections as countries trade power over time. We also show that, in this case, the proposed allocation is stable.","[Kristiansen, Martin; Korpas, Magnus] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Power Engn, Trondheim, Norway; [Munoz, Francisco D.] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Fac Ingn & Ciencias, Santiago, Chile; [Oren, Shmuel] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Ind Engn & Operat Res, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Universidad Adolfo Ibanez; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Kristiansen, M (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Power Engn, Trondheim, Norway.",martin.kristiansen@ntnu.no,"Muñoz, Francisco/AHD-1365-2022",,FONDECYT [11150029]; SERC-CHILE [CONICYT/FONDAP/15110019]; CONICYT-Basal Project [FB0008]; Research Council of Norway through NTNU [81770725]; Research Council of Norway through NOWITECH,FONDECYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); SERC-CHILE; CONICYT-Basal Project; Research Council of Norway through NTNU(Research Council of Norway); Research Council of Norway through NOWITECH(Research Council of Norway),"The research in this article was supported by FONDECYT #11150029, CONICYT/FONDAP/15110019 (SERC-CHILE), CONICYT-Basal Project FB0008, and The Research Council of Norway through NOWITECH and NTNU #81770725.

It examines the Bangalore Metro and shows that the uplift from the metro rail was substantial in the 'catchment area' and 'across the city'. The analysis was based on the panel data hedonic price model for around 160,000 apartments over the period 2012-16 and a cross-sectional data hedonic price model for 314,000 apartments in 2016. The panel data resulted in a stronger model and show significant land value increases, even beyond the traditional 500 m catchment. A 'before' and 'after' from the commencement of the metro rail operations shows a price uplift of 4.5% across the whole city and indicates a major agglomeration economic event resulting in substantial willingness to pay of USD 306 million from the metro rail accessibility. Emerging cities can expect metro rail to substantially improve their economies and other co-benefits as long as finance can be obtained by capturing this value.","[Sharma, Rohit; Newman, Peter] Curtin Univ, Sustainabil Policy Inst, Bldg 209, Bentley, WA 6845, Australia",Curtin University,"Sharma, R (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ, Sustainabil Policy Inst, Bldg 209, Bentley, WA 6845, Australia.",rohitsharma16@gmail.com; p.newman@curtin.edu.au,,"Newman, Peter/0000-0002-8668-2764","Curtin University Sustainability Policy Institute, Curtin University","Curtin University Sustainability Policy Institute, Curtin University","Funding for research was provided by Curtin University Sustainability Policy Institute, Curtin University, through the provision of a PhD scholarship to Rohit Sharma.",,78,43,46,3,47,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,1879-2375,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

We show that, if sufficiently few governments merge, some common implications from the literature on single-tier tax competition no longer apply. First, we find that a merger party earns more tax revenue than a non-merger party. Second, given that the merged jurisdictions are regarded as the national government of a larger country, we establish that per capita tax revenue of the latter government is larger than that of a national government of a small country. Both findings are driven by sufficiently strong cross-tier tax competition of non-merged national governments with lower-tier jurisdictions. We also endogenize the merger decision via the formation of a tax coalition, and show that a stable tax coalition at the upper tier is always larger, and can mitigate tax competition considerably more than a stable tax coalition in the single-tier case.","[Siggelkow, Benjamin Florian] Univ Hagen, Dept Econ, Univ Str 41, D-58097 Hagen, Germany",Fern University Hagen,"Siggelkow, BF (通讯作者)，Univ Hagen, Dept Econ, Univ Str 41, D-58097 Hagen, Germany.",benjamin.siggelkow@fernuni-hagen.de,,,,,,,30,4,4,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

To this end, we rely on longitudinal data of Belgian graduates that track their careers up until the age of 29. We model the program choice, the transition to a good match and the preceding transition to a bad match simultaneously. To account for non-random selection into programs and into bad matches, the Timing of Events method is combined with an exclusion restriction. After accounting for observed and unobserved heterogeneity, we do not find evidence for a trade-off.

When applying our test to study property tax rates among adjacent municipalities in North Carolina, significant competing effects are found under both information structures.

Data came from a 2015 survey of post-secondary students across four universities in Toronto. The choices of owning a basic mobility tool (driver's license, car, transit pass, and bicycle) or combinations of basic tools (composite tools) are investigated through estimation of cross-nested generalized extreme value (GEV) models. Empirical models reveal that heterogeneity and complicated substitution patterns exist in the choices of mobility tool ownership of young adults (millennials) in Toronto. The paper proposes a parsimonious GEV model that drastically reduces the total number of parameters that are needed to be estimated while accommodating the full range of substitution patterns among the choice alternatives. The model clearly shows the systematic interaction of basic mobility tool ownership utility is more prevalent than the random correlation that a GEV model can capture. Students' personal and household related attributes influence the choice of owning combinations of mobility tools and influence multimodality. It is also found that older and male students are more multimodal than younger and female students are. High car ownership levels play a pivotal role in the choice of owning transit passes. These trends provide useful information for policymakers should these patterns continue as the student population enters the workforce.","[Habib, Khandker Nurul; Weiss, Adam; Hasnine, Sami] Univ Toronto, Dept Civil Engn, 35 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 1A4, Canada",University of Toronto,"Habib, KN (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Civil Engn, 35 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 1A4, Canada.",Khanker.nurulhabib@utoronto.ca; adam.weiss@mail.utoronto.ca; sami.hasnine@mail.utoronto.ca,,"Hasnine, Md Sami/0000-0003-4110-5047",NSERC Discovery grant,NSERC Discovery grant(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"The research was funded by an NSERC Discovery grant.

The concept of multiple remote tower operation is that air traffic controllers (ATCOs) can control several airfields from a distant virtual control centre. The control of multiple airfields can be centralised to a virtual centre permitting the more efficient use of ATCO resources. This research was sponsored by the Single European Sky ATM Research Program and the ATM Operations Division of the Irish Aviation Authority. A safety case was developed for migration of multiple remote tower services to live operations. This research conducted 50 large scale demonstration trials of remote tower operations from single tower operations to multiple tower operations for safety assessment by air navigation safety regulators in 2016. A dedicated team of air traffic controllers and technology experts successfully completed the safety assessment of multiple remote tower operations in real time. The implementation of this innovative technology requires a careful balance between cost efficiency and the safety of the air traffic control in terms of capacity and human performance. The live trial exercises demonstrated that the air traffic services provided by the remote tower for a single airport and two medium airports by a single ATCO with 'in sequence' and 'simultaneous' aircraft operation was at least as safe as provided by the local towers at Cork and Shannon aerodromes. No safety occurrence was reported nor did any operational safety issue arise during the conduct of the fifty live trial exercises.,"[Kearney, Peter] Irish Aviat Author, ATM Operat & Strategy, 11-12 Dolier St, Dublin, Ireland; [Li, Wen-Chin] Cranfield Univ, Safety & Accid Invest Ctr, Martell House, Cranfield MK43 0TR, Beds, England",Cranfield University,"Li, WC (通讯作者)，Cranfield Univ, Safety & Accid Invest Ctr, Martell House, Cranfield MK43 0TR, Beds, England.",wenchin.li@cranfield.ac.uk,"Li, Wen-Chin/GWM-7898-2022","Kearney, Peter/0000-0003-3236-9913; Li, Wen-Chin/0000-0002-8825-3701",Single European Sky ATM Research Program (SESAR) [LSD 02.04]; Irish Aviation Authority [P7883/ETE/WCL]; European Commission,Single European Sky ATM Research Program (SESAR); Irish Aviation Authority; European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"This work was supported by Single European Sky ATM Research Program (SESAR, LSD 02.04), and the Irish Aviation Authority (P7883/ETE/WCL).

We first compare the laissez-faire equilibrium with the ex post egalitarian optimum, where the realized lifetime well-being of the worst off (usually the short-lived) is maximized, and show that, unlike the laissez-faire, this social optimum involves an increasing working time age profile and equalizes the realized lifetime well-being of the short-lived and the long-lived. We then examine whether working time regulations can compensate the short-lived. It is shown that uniform working time regulations cannot improve the situation of the short-lived with respect to the laissez-faire, and can only reduce well-being inequalities at the cost of making the short-lived worse off. However, age-specific regulations involving lower working time for the young and higher working time for the old make the short-lived better off, even though such regulations may not fully eradicate well-being inequalities.","[Leroux, Marie-Louise] Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Sci Econ, CIRPEE, CORE, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Leroux, Marie-Louise] CESifo, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Ponthiere, Gregory] Univ Paris East ERUDITE, IUF, Paris Sch Econ, 48 Bd Jourdan,Off R3-66, F-75014 Paris, France",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Paris School of Economics,"Ponthiere, G (通讯作者)，Univ Paris East ERUDITE, IUF, Paris Sch Econ, 48 Bd Jourdan,Off R3-66, F-75014 Paris, France.",leroux.marie-louise@uqam.ca; gregory.ponthiere@ens.fr,,,,,,,18,3,3,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,OCT,2018,51.0,3,,,,,437,464,,10.1007/s00355-018-1123-7,0.0,,,28,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,GU4PG,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445265300003,0

By referring to Marx's original manuscripts on the reproduction schemes, the paper shows that Marx, due to erroneous calculations, never arrived at schemes of reproduction on an extended scale that exhibit steady-state growth. Moreover, it is suggested that Marx identified reproduction on an extended scale with an expansion path of undisturbed capital accumulation, irrespective of whether the latter proceeds in a steady or non-steady manner.","[Gehrke, Christian] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Dept Econ, Univ Str 15, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Gehrke, Christian] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Graz Schumpeter Ctr, Univ Str 15, A-8010 Graz, Austria",University of Graz; University of Graz,"Gehrke, C (通讯作者)，Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Dept Econ, Univ Str 15, A-8010 Graz, Austria.;Gehrke, C (通讯作者)，Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Graz Schumpeter Ctr, Univ Str 15, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",christian.gehrke@uni-graz.at,,,,,,,32,2,2,2,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

Obesity and BMI also have a strong genetic basis. Given these observations, we investigate whether more education can reduce obesity by attenuating the underlying genetic risk of being obese, through gene environment (GxE) interactions. We estimate associations between (i) education, (ii) a genetic risk score (GRS) and (iii) GxE interactions between education and the GRS through Ordinary least Squares (OLS) and twins fixed-effect regressions using data on female twins from the TwinsUK database. OLS estimates show that there are significant associations of education and genetics. Female twins with a university education are 14.3 percentage points less likely to be obese compared to twins with less than compulsory education, and a 1 standard deviation increase in the GRS increases the likelihood of being obese by 5.2 percentage points. The GxE interactions are statistically insignificant, suggesting that the marginal association of the GRS with obesity does not differ by educational attainment. When controlling for confounding through twins fixed-effects, we find a smaller role of genetics. The association of the GRS with obesity decreases to 0.040. Associations of educational attainment are substantially reduced and insignificant. GxE interactions also remain insignificant. Overall, we find little evidence of any GxE interactions.

One exception is a recent economics literature using the notion of incomplete markets to estimate the impacts of cattle ownership on children's milk consumption and growth outcomes in Eastern Africa. In addition to external validity concerns, an obvious internal validity concern is that dairy producers may systematically differ from non-dairy households, particularly in terms of latent wealth or nutritional knowledge. We re-examine these concerns by applying a novel double difference model to data from rural Bangladesh, a country with relatively low levels of milk consumption and high rates of stunting. We exploit the fact that a cow's lactation cycles provide an exogenous source of variation in household milk supply, which allows us to distinguish between a control group of households that do not own cows, a treatment group that own cows that have produced milk, and a placebo group of cow owning households that have not produced milk in the past 12 months. We find that household dairy production increases height-for-age Z scores by 0.52 standard deviations in the critical 6-23 month growth window, though in the first year of life we find that household dairy supply is associated with a 21.7 point decline in the rate of breastfeeding. The results therefore suggest that increasing access to dairy products can be extremely beneficial to children's nutrition, but may need to be accompanied by efforts to improve nutritional knowledge and appropriate breastfeeding practices.

This paper presents a unified approach to model spatial panels with endogenous time varying spatial weights matrices and unobserved common factors. We show that the proposed QML estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal. As its limiting distribution may have a leading order bias, an analytical bias correction is proposed.

This approach allows us to generalize the multiple-stage risk measures of value at risk and conditional value at risk for the feature-decomposed processes, and implement them into portfolio selection using high-frequency data of U.S. DJIA stocks. The overall empirical results confirm that our proposed method significantly improves the performance of dynamic risk assessment and portfolio selection.","[Chen, Yi-Ting] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Hsinchu, Taiwan; [Chen, Yi-Ting] Univ Mannheim, Sch Business Informat & Math, Mannheim, Germany; [Sun, Edward W.] KEDGE Business Sch, 680 Cours Liberat, F-33405 Talence, France; [Yu, Min-Teh] China Univ Technol, Dept Finance, Taipei, Taiwan",National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; University of Mannheim; Kedge Business School,"Sun, EW (通讯作者)，KEDGE Business Sch, 680 Cours Liberat, F-33405 Talence, France.",edward.sun@kedgebs.com,"Li, Wang/M-1612-2019; Yu, Min-Teh/ABB-7718-2021; Sun, Edward W./J-7488-2015","Yu, Min-Teh/0000-0003-4686-1327; Chen, Claire Yi-Ting/0000-0001-7924-5649; Sun, Edward W./0000-0001-6680-0738",German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD); CC-Tech Taiwan,German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); CC-Tech Taiwan,"Chen's research was supported by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) and CC-Tech Taiwan.

The Case of Bismarck's System of Social Insurance,EUROPEAN REVIEW OF ECONOMIC HISTORY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,BERLIN STOCK-EXCHANGE; HEALTH-INSURANCE; IMPERIAL GERMANY; KNAPPSCHAFTEN; PENSIONS; MARKET,"Imperial chancellor Bismarck's system of social insurance (with its three pillars health, accident and pension insurance) was an important role model for social security systems across Europe and in the USA. How the introduction of the German system changed economic expectations and decisions of the German workforce has not been researched, though. This article closes this gap by analyzing the development of Prussian savings banks' deposits in the late 19th century with the help of a difference-in-difference-like approach. We show that, in the Prussian case, social security crowded out private savings considerably. As counterfactual voluntary savings would have been far from sufficient, however, Bismarck's social insurance system might still have been needed to fight the misery workers and their families potentially faced in old age or times of sickness.","[Lehmann-Hasemeyer, Sibylle] Univ Hohenheim, Wollgrasweg 49, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany; [Streb, Jochen] Univ Mannheim, L 7,3-5, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany",University Hohenheim; University of Mannheim,"Streb, J (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, L 7,3-5, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",streb@uni-mannheim.de,"Villen Retamero, Andrea Maria/IAR-1667-2023","Lehmann-Hasemeyer, Sibylle/0000-0002-5645-5923; Streb, Jochen/0000-0001-7812-7923",German Science Foundation (DFG),German Science Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"This project was funded by the German Science Foundation (DFG), as part of the Priority Programme 1859 Experience and Expectation.

We focus on the non-limit case, and on the trade-offs between information quality and quantity when making a decision whether to cooperate or defect in a prisoners' dilemma game. In the best-case scenario, the information quality gains are strong enough so that agents can substitute information quantity with information quality. In the second best-case scenario, the information quality gains are weak and must be compensated for with additional information quantity. In this case, information quality improves but not quickly enough to dispense with the use of information quantity. For sufficiently large time intervals, information degrades and monitoring becomes mostly based on information quantity. The results depend crucially on the particular information structure and on the rate at which information quality improves or decays with respect to the discounting incentives.","[Osorio, Antonio] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, Reus, Barcelona, Spain; [Osorio, Antonio] CREIP, Reus, Barcelona, Spain",Universitat Rovira i Virgili,"Osório, A (通讯作者)，Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, Reus, Barcelona, Spain.;Osório, A (通讯作者)，CREIP, Reus, Barcelona, Spain.",superacosta@hotmail.com,"Osório, António M/L-6243-2014","Osório, António M/0000-0003-3376-0164",GRODE; Spanish Ministerio of Ciencia y Innovacion [ECO2016-75410-P],GRODE; Spanish Ministerio of Ciencia y Innovacion,"I would like to thank David Rahman, Juan Pablo Rincon-Zapatero and Ricardo Ribeiro, as well as several seminars and congresses participants for helpful comments and discussions.

Weighted averaging tells an agent how to update her priors on the basis of testimonial evidence, by changing to a weighted arithmetic mean of her priors and another agent's priors. We show that, in their respective settings, these two seemingly so different updating rules are axiomatized by essentially the same invariance condition. As a by-product, this sheds new light on the question how weighted averaging should be extended to deal with cases when the other agent reveals only parts of her probability distribution. The combination of weighted averaging (for the events whose probability the other agent reveals) and Jeffrey conditioning (for the events whose probability the other agent does not reveal) is a comprehensive updating rule to deal with such cases, which is again axiomatized by invariance under embedding. We conclude that, even though one may dislike Jeffrey conditioning or weighted averaging, the two make a natural pair when a policy for partial testimonial evidence is needed.","[Bonnay, Denis] Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre, Dept Philosophie, 200 Ave Republ, F-92001 Nanterre, France; [Bonnay, Denis] IHPST, 200 Ave Republ, F-92001 Nanterre, France; [Cozic, Mikael] Univ Paris Est Creteil EA LIS, Dept Philosophie, IUF, 61 Ave Gen Gaulle, F-94010 Creteil, France; [Cozic, Mikael] IHPST, 61 Ave Gen Gaulle, F-94010 Creteil, France",Universite Paris Saclay; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC),"Cozic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Est Creteil EA LIS, Dept Philosophie, IUF, 61 Ave Gen Gaulle, F-94010 Creteil, France.;Cozic, M (通讯作者)，IHPST, 61 Ave Gen Gaulle, F-94010 Creteil, France.",denis.bonnay@u-paris10.fr; mikael.cozic@u-pec.fr,,,Institut Universitaire de France; [ANR-10-LABX-0087 IEC]; [ANR-10-IDEX-0001-02 PSL],Institut Universitaire de France; ;,"Earlier versions of this work were presented at seminars and workshops in Paris, Munich and Stockholm, as well as at a symposium at PSA 2014 in Chicago.

The role of road networks in the LUCC is becoming increasingly important. Much of the upgrading in road networks is propelled by economy and population growth. However, the relationships between the road networks and the social-economic factors are poorly understood by using the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, which assumes that the estimated beta value holds the same everywhere within a given study area. To determine whether there is spatial variation in the relationship between the road networks and the social-economic drivers in a given region, we employed a local model, geographically weighted regression (GWR), that provides a regression coefficient (beta) for each sample location within the study area. Taking Fujian Province, one of the most developed regions in China, as a case, this paper firstly employed an Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) to identify the spatial patterns of the road networks at the different sizes of sampling units. We found that the spatial distribution of road networks had an obvious tendency toward the geographical dependency, with High-High clusters seated in the eastern coastal areas and Low-Low clusters distributed dispersedly in the study area. The spatial patterns of the road networks had highly consistency in the different sizes of sample units. Then, the GWR model confirmed that the relationships between the road networks and the socioeconomic factors varied by locations, with multiple relationships (both synergy and tradeoff) between them coexisting in the study region. These relationships were also visualized by sign and magnitude of the estimated coefficients of GWR for each sampling unit, which allow us to compare the different effects of the dependent variables on the road networks across locations. We also found that the variable of gross domestic product density (GDPD) is a preferred indicator over the variable of population density (PD) to analyze the associations with the road networks. Thus, this study provided useful information to develop differentiated strategies for road development at the finer level by using the more nuanced GWR models.","[Hu, Xisheng; Wang, Jiankai; Qiu, Rongzu] Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Transportat & Civil Engn, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Wu, Chengzhen] Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Forestry, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Wu, Chengzhen] Wuyi Univ, Coll Ecol & Resource Engn, Nanping 354300, Peoples R China","Fujian Agriculture & Forestry University; Fujian Agriculture & Forestry University; Wuyi University, Fujian","Qiu, RZ (通讯作者)，Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Transportat & Civil Engn, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, Peoples R China.",fjxsh@126.com,"Jia, Xiaoli/IST-0568-2023; 李, 李金煜/HGF-1891-2022","Jia, Xiaoli/0000-0001-5076-0604;",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41201100]; Social Science Planning Project of Fujian Province [FJ2017B090]; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province [2015J01606]; Science and Technology Major Project of the Hall of Science and Technology of Fujian Province [2012NZ0001],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Social Science Planning Project of Fujian Province; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province(Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province); Science and Technology Major Project of the Hall of Science and Technology of Fujian Province,"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.41201100) and the Social Science Planning Project of Fujian Province (No. FJ2017B090), to which we are very grateful.

However, planning of cycling infrastructures in large cities faces numerous challenges and requires better understanding of both the factors enabling cycling as well as barriers to it, determined by particular local context. While there is a growing body of research that tackle the bike transport related questions in Western Europe and the USA, there is relatively little research on that in Central Eastern Europe (CEE), in post-communist countries. In this study we used qualitative and quantitative methods to explore urban cyclists and non-cyclists opinions about the cycling, the perceived problems and obstacles, and perception of the on-going changes in bicycle transportation system in Warsaw, Poland. Although many people see potential advantages of cycling, it is mostly perceived as a leisure time activity. Those who do utilitarian cycling are more acutely aware of the benefits, such as rapidity and flexibility of this mean of transport. The main perceived barriers are linked to lack of good cycling infrastructure in the city, the feeling of insecurity linked to the behaviour of drivers, and to maintenance during winter. In conclusion, our research highlights both the opportunities and challenges linked to the development of improved cycle transportation system, suggesting the need for a range of policies, from the infrastructure improvements and comprehensive planning of the whole transportation system, to improving the driving culture that would support feeling of security of the cyclists.","[Iwinska, Katarzyna] Coll Civitas, PKIN, Pl Defilad 1, PL-00901 Warsaw, Poland; [Blicharska, Malgorzata] Uppsala Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Nat Resources & Sustainable Dev, Villavaen 16, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; [Pierotti, Livia; de Nazelle, Audrey] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Environm Policy, 13 G7 Princes Gardens, London SW7 1NA, England; [Tainio, Marko] Univ Cambridge, Sch Clin Med, MRC Epidemiol Unit, UKCRC Ctr Diet & Act Res CEDAR, Cambridge, England; [Tainio, Marko] Polish Acad Sci, Syst Res Inst, Ul Newelska 6, PL-01447 Warsaw, Poland",Uppsala University; Imperial College London; University of Cambridge; Polish Academy of Sciences; Systems Research Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences,"Iwinska, K (通讯作者)，Coll Civitas, PKIN, Pl Defilad 1, PL-00901 Warsaw, Poland.",kiwinska@collegium.edu.pl; malgorzata.blicharska@geo.uu.se,"Iwińska, Katarzyna/ABA-6131-2020; Iwińska, Katarzyna/AAC-7336-2022","Iwińska, Katarzyna/0000-0002-7337-915X; de Nazelle, Audrey/0000-0002-1092-3971; Tainio, Marko/0000-0002-0973-2342","Collegium Civitas, Warsaw; Coca-Cola Foundation; AGAUR; CREAL; British Heart Foundation; Cancer Research UK; Economic and Social Research Council; Medical Research Council; National Institute for Health Research; Wellcome Trust under UK Clinical Research Collaboration; MRC [MR/K023187/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Collegium Civitas, Warsaw; Coca-Cola Foundation; AGAUR(Agencia de Gestio D'Ajuts Universitaris de Recerca Agaur (AGAUR)); CREAL; British Heart Foundation(British Heart Foundation); Cancer Research UK(Cancer Research UK); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); Wellcome Trust under UK Clinical Research Collaboration(Wellcome Trust); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC))","This study was supported by Collegium Civitas, Warsaw.

Yet, after the election of a new French government in 2012, the Franco-German co-operation in the Economic and Monetary Union deteriorated. This article asks why the Franco-German tandem got stuck. Drawing on bargaining theory, it argues that Germany used Merkozy' as a negotiation strategy to further its aims in eurozone crisis management. However, when the preferences of the two countries were no longer reconcilable due to changes in France as well as in the negotiation environment, the strategy failed. Thus, while much of the literature has focused on the persistence of the Franco-German partnership, this approach accounts for variation in its functioning. The results provide an explanation for the rise and fall of Merkozy and bear implications for assessing the future Franco-German relationship.","[Schoeller, Magnus G.] Univ Vienna, Inst European Integrat Res EIF, Apostelgasse 23, A-1030 Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Schoeller, MG (通讯作者)，Univ Vienna, Inst European Integrat Res EIF, Apostelgasse 23, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",magnus.schoeller@univie.ac.at,,"Schoeller, Magnus G./0000-0002-5826-0900",,,,,44,20,21,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Besides including the standard demand factors like GDP, population and tourism, the effects of other determinants such as domestic traffic, low-cost carrier (LCC) activity and public service obligations are also estimated. The profound contribution of the paper lies in the inclusion of two innovative variables in the estimations: ethnic links and aviation-dependent employment. The econometric results show that both ethnic links between countries and the share of aviation-dependent employment increase passenger demand. Moreover, the results confirm that LCC presence leads to a significant increase in passenger demand, particularly on routes where Europe's largest LCCs, Ryanair and easyJet, are active.","[Boonekamp, Thijs; Zuidberg, Joost; Burghouwt, Guillaume] SEO Amsterdam Econ, Roetersstr 29, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"Boonekamp, T (通讯作者)，SEO Amsterdam Econ, Roetersstr 29, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",t.boonekamp@seo.nl,,,,,,,29,33,36,0,41,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

The study was designed to serve as veritable tool in designing food programs to proffer long-term remedies to growing food insecurity by addressing its underline causes which are the risks in various forms depending on the households and locations. Primary data collected with the aid of structured questionnaires from a total of 161 households selected by multistage random sampling technique were used. The findings showed that majority of the households representing 87 percent manifested various forms of food insecurity risks with food price hikes topping by 95 percent casting aspersion on the achievement of zero hunger target in Nigeria. The results of logistic analysis showed that five of the explanatory variables significantly influenced the presence or otherwise of food insecurity risks in the households at various levels. There was positive correlation between food insecurity risks and management strategies adopted by households.,"[Fawole, Wasiu O.] NOUN, Dept Agr Econ & Extens, Fac Agr Sci, Kaduna, Nigeria; [Ozkan, Burhan] Akdeniz Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, Antalya, Turkey",Akdeniz University,"Ozkan, B (通讯作者)，Akdeniz Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, Antalya, Turkey.",bozkan@akdeniz.edu.tr,"Ozkan, Burhan/C-9583-2016","Ozkan, Burhan/0000-0002-9799-654X",,,,,30,7,7,0,2,Bologna Univ Press,Bologna,"Via Saragozza 10, Bologna, ITALY",1594-5685,2611-1128,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,JUN,2018,17.0,2,,,,,29,42,,10.30682/nm1802c,0.0,,,14,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,GP3RX,,gold,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440772000004,0

In other words, we start from an arbitrary allocation and build a finite sequence of allocations leading to a stable outcome, with the special feature that each allocation can be obtained from the previous one by satisfying a unilateral or a bilateral blocking contract. As a consequence, we prove that the process of allowing randomly selected blocks to be satisfied eventually leads to a stable outcome.

We consider endogenous changes in fuel efficiency, and the impact of environmental policy such as the EU ETS is also included. Our results show the smaller short run RE, but much larger RE in a long run of air transport. The short-run RE for 1986-1999 is 2.9% and 2.1% for 2000-2013, while the long-run RE is 49% for 1986-1999 and 19% for 2000-2013, respectively.

Focus on the labour process shows how self-employment' is used to remove so-called unproductive' time from the remit of paid labour. Using Smith's concept of double indeterminacy the article captures the dynamic relationship between those on standard and non-standard contracts and interdependency of effort power and mobility power. It exposes the apparent mobility and autonomy of dependent self-employed drivers while suggesting that their presence, alongside the increased use of technology, reconfigures the work-effort bargain across contractual status.","[Moore, Sian] Univ Greenwich, Employment Relat & Human Resource Management, London, England; [Moore, Sian] Univ Greenwich, Work & Employment Res Unit, London, England; [Newsome, Kirsty] Univ Sheffield, Management School, Employment Relat, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Greenwich; University of Greenwich; University of Sheffield,"Moore, S (通讯作者)，Univ Greenwich, Business Sch, Pk Row, London SE10 9LS, England.",S.Moore@Greenwich.ac.uk,,,small British Academy/Leverhulme grant,small British Academy/Leverhulme grant,The research is part of wider research funded by a small British Academy/Leverhulme grant.,,42,48,52,0,34,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Furthermore, the incumbent's authority over the Commission is complicated by the Commission's internal fragmentation and specialization. Based on interviews with experienced policy-makers from the Commission, the Council and the EP, this article argues that Juncker's leadership inside the Commission, as well as his leadership within the EU system have been strengthened by his organizational reforms, such as the introduction of project-team leading Vice-Presidents and a stronger role of the Secretariat General.

Yet, reflecting an extremely fat-averse, thin-positive society, efforts to lose weight are now reportedly very common. Since the 1980s, South Korea has experienced an increasingly flexible and insecure labor market which was exacerbated by the 1997 economic recession. In this social and economic setting, body shape and weight status, as human capital, may have gained significant bargaining power in the labor market. Consequently, we propose that Koreans, particularly those who are employed in stable jobs (i.e., non-manual and regular jobs), would increasingly engage in intense weight management and reduction activities even when not technically overweight or obese as a means to job security and upward mobility. Using nationally-representative data from the Korean Nutrition and Health Examination Survey (KNHANES), we identify the changing role of weight concerns versus actual body weight in predicting South Korean efforts to lose weight between 2001 (KNHANES-phase 1) and 2007-2009 (phase 4). The patterns were examined by occupation type (manual and non-manual jobs) and status (regular and non-regular jobs). Oaxaca decomposition analysis supported that people's perception of being fat, rather than actual weight status, was crucial to explaining accelerated weight management efforts in South Korea over the decade (coef. = 0.062 and p-value <.0001 for male with regular work; coef. = 0.031 and p-value = .002 for female with regular work). Occupation status, rather than employment in itself, mattered. Job stability predicted increased effort; the pattern of change through time suggests efforts to invest high levels of effort in appearance positively impacts both employment opportunity and stability.

A number of studies have examined the link between residential relocation and changes in travel behavior focusing on the effects of the changes in built environment. However, very few studies are concerned with the relationship between residential relocation and changes in personal social networks and neighborhood social environments and the effects of these on travel behavior. On the basis of longitudinal panel data from a two-wave household travel diary survey conducted in Beijing from 2011 to 2013, the purpose of this study is to examine to what extent residential relocation will lead to changes in residential social environment and personal social network, which trigger adjustments to travel behavior. A structural equations model is developed to empirically verify the hypothesized link. The findings highlight the importance of changes in social environments and personal social networks for explaining travel changes induced by residential relocation. The present study offers an application of using real panel data to investigate the role of social network and social environment in the relationship between residential relocation and travel behavior change. The study contributes to both the literature on life events and travel behavior and that on social networks and travel behavior.","[Lin, Tao; Wang, Donggen; Zhou, Meng] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Geog, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lin, Tao] China Acad Urban Planning & Design, Western Branch, Chongqing, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Baptist University,"Wang, DG (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Geog, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",dgwang@hkbu.edu.hk,,,"GRF from the Hong Kong Research Grant Council [HKBU247813, HKBU12656716]; NSFC from the National Natural Science Foundation of China [41371181]",GRF from the Hong Kong Research Grant Council; NSFC from the National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This research is supported by the following grants: two GRF grants (HKBU247813 and HKBU12656716) from the Hong Kong Research Grant Council and a NSFC grant (41371181) from the National Natural Science Foundation of China.

PM have transformed to hybrid organizations mostly disassociated from operational activities and port services provision. Still, they maintain a key role as managing bodies advancing the prospects of respective port and associate clusters. Marketing is among the functions working towards this end. Aiming to advance theoretical constructs and related empirical research, the paper employs business marketing perspectives and their applications in hybrid organisations to introduce a novel conceptualization of PA marketing strategies. Within this theoretical angle, the study builds a multi-dimensional framework on PA strategic positioning that combines (a) PAs' marketing objectives in various Strategic Business Areas (SBAs), (b) the multifaceted geography of the targeted salient stakeholders, and (c) the induced portfolio of marketing actions, whose ramifications unveil virtuous cross-fertilization effects (CFEs) and fuel the success of PA marketing strategies.

In order to examine the effectiveness of our method we estimate the model for the Greek economy and run some counterfactual policy experiments. These experiments indicate that, for the Greek economy in the beginning of the crisis in early 2010, expansionary fiscal policy would have been able to stimulate growth and reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio.","[Kostarakos, Ilias; Kotsios, Stelios] Univ Athens, Dept Econ, Athens, Greece",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens,"Kostarakos, I (通讯作者)，Univ Athens, Dept Econ, Athens, Greece.",hkostarak@econ.uoa.gr; skotsios@econ.uoa.gr,"KOTSIOS, STYLIANOS/ABI-6763-2020; Kostarakos, Ilias/AAO-5871-2020","Kostarakos, Ilias/0000-0003-0815-4381",,,,,23,2,2,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Shocks to monetary variables explain a substantial share of US GDP deflator inflation shocks over time, particularly in the late 1980s and early 1990s but also in recent years, a time when quantitative easing was employed by the Federal Reserve. Monetary factors, and not oil shocks, underlie price developments in the 1970s and early 1980s. Monetary shocks' influence on oil prices has become noticeably stronger over the past ten years or so, supporting the greater attention being paid of late to the impact of the monetary environment on commodity markets. Shocks to the velocity-of-money variable affect output developments, with the exception of the 1970s and early 1980s when inflation shocks and, to a lesser extent, oil inflation shocks dominate the cross-variance share of output gap shocks. After the Volcker disinflation, the influence of both inflation and oil price shocks on the output gap wane and those of velocity gap shocks increase.","[Cronin, David] Cent Bank Ireland, Financial Stabil Div, POB 559,Dame St, Dublin 2, Ireland",European Central Bank; Central Bank of Ireland,"Cronin, D (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Ireland, Financial Stabil Div, POB 559,Dame St, Dublin 2, Ireland.",dave.cronin@centralbank.ie,,,,,,,37,2,2,0,3,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

To untangle this we propose a GARCH (generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity) common features approach, where systemic risk emerges from a common factor source (or indeed multiple factor sources) with contagion evident through possible changes in the factor loadings relating to the common factor(s). Within a portfolio mimicking factor framework this can be identified using moment conditions. We use this framework to identify contagion in three illustrations involving both single and multiple factor specifications: to the Asian currency markets in 1997-1998, to US sectoral equity indices in 2007-2009 and to the CDS (credit default swap) market during the European sovereign debt crisis of 2010-2013. The results reveal the extent to which contagion effects may be masked by not accounting for the sources of changed volatility apparent in simple measures such as correlation.","[Dungey, Mardi] Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Sch Business & Econ, Private Bag 84, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Renault, Eric] Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Providence, RI 02912 USA",University of Tasmania; Brown University,"Dungey, M (通讯作者)，Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Sch Business & Econ, Private Bag 84, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",mardi.dungey@utas.edu.au,,,IdR QUANTVALLEY/Risk Foundation Development,IdR QUANTVALLEY/Risk Foundation Development,IdR QUANTVALLEY/Risk Foundation Development,,55,19,20,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0883-7252,1099-1255,,J APPL ECONOMET,J.

They may be displaced sooner if they are taxed to internalize negative externalities. Currently, wind generation or nuclear power, supplemented by bulk electricity storage, are the most feasible alternatives to fossil fuels for electricity generation. The ERCOT ISO in Texas provides a realistic model for examining the costs of replacing fossil fuels by wind generation and storage, and for comparing wind power with generation based on nuclear and storage. ERCOT is relatively isolated from neighboring grids, and wind power was almost a quarter of its total generating capacity at the end of 2016. Using the ERCOT example, we also discuss how the long-run configuration of the electricity supply system affects evolution away from a system dominated by natural gas.","[Hartley, Peter R.] Rice Univ, Dept Econ, MS22,6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Hartley, Peter R.] Rice Univ, James A Baker III Inst Publ Policy, Houston, TX USA; [Hartley, Peter R.] Univ Western Australia, Dept Econ, Nedlands, WA, Australia",Rice University; Rice University; University of Western Australia,"Hartley, PR (通讯作者)，Rice Univ, Dept Econ, MS22,6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",hartley@rice.edu,,"Hartley, Peter/0000-0003-4967-720X",,,,,17,3,3,1,17,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,MAR,2018,39.0,2,,,,,233,258,,10.5547/01956574.39.2.phar,0.0,,,26,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FZ4RB,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427578400011,0

Within the last few decades, the cultivation of organic products presented a rising trend, due to consumer preferences for safe products, produced by environmentally friendly procedures. The improvement and development of organic agriculture in the European Union was supported through various agri-environmental programs of the Common Agricultural Policy. The present study surveys the producers' motivation for the adoption of organic farming, highlighting the most important ones. Primary data were obtained through a quantitative survey (structured questionnaire) to a sample offarmers from the region of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace and were analyzed via multivariate techniques, namely factor analysis and ANOVA. Results indicate that the farmer's decision to implement organic farming is determined by their attitude towards organic farming and to a lesser extent by economic reasons closely related to subsidies.","[Papadopoulos, Sotirios; Zafeiriou, Eleni; Karelakis, Christos; Koutroumanidis, Theodoros] Democritus Univ Thrace, Dept Agr Dev, Orestiada, Greece",Democritus University of Thrace,"Papadopoulos, S (通讯作者)，Democritus Univ Thrace, Dept Agr Dev, Orestiada, Greece.",sotpap23@gmail.com,"Karelakis, Christos/AAF-2873-2020","Karelakis, Christos/0000-0002-4426-7044",,,,,39,10,10,5,44,Bologna Univ Press,Bologna,"Via Saragozza 10, Bologna, ITALY",1594-5685,2611-1128,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,MAR,2018,17.0,1,,,,,13,22,,10.30682/nm1801b,0.0,,,10,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,GF3HQ,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431836600003,0

Economists are split as to whether it reflects the advent of jobless recoveries or just reflects slow recoveries in which both output and employment are slow to recover. We estimate a version of Friedman's plucking model to investigate this issue. We find evidence suggesting that employment does have its own dynamic response after a recession. Some of the slow growth in employment can be ascribed to the slow output growth, but there is a remaining portion which is consistent with the jobless recovery hypothesis. We then produce evidence relative to four different hypothesis of why jobless recoveries have occurred.","[Bradley, Michael D.] George Washington Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Jansen, Dennis W.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",George Washington University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Bradley, MD (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",mdbrad@gwu.edu,,,Private Enterprise Research Center at Texas AM University; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2014S1A3A20444],Private Enterprise Research Center at Texas AM University; National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea),"The authors thank Neil Ericsson, Tara Sinclair and participants at the Southern Economic Association Meetings and the Society for Nonlinear Dynamics and Econometrics Symposium for helpful comments.

Our findings indicate that, overall, higher local unemployment is negatively related to individuals' health conditions. A one percentage point increase in the province-level unemployment rate is associated with a significant increase in the probability of experiencing diabetes (0.03 percentage points), infarction (0.01), ulcer (0.06), cirrhosis (0.01) and nervous disorders (0.07), with a time lag that differs across individual health conditions. Employment status and educational level play a significant role as moderators of these relationships. Eating habits, in addition to economic stress, play a key role as mediators, by enhancing the negative relationship between macroeconomic conditions and health outcomes, while physical exercise is found to play a dampening role.

A large threshold effect leads to a poor approximation of the profile likelihood in finite samples such that the conventional approach to constructing confidence intervals excludes the true threshold parameter value too often, resulting in low coverage rates. We propose a conservative modification to the standard likelihood-ratio-based confidence interval that has coverage rates at least as high as the nominal level, while still being informative in the sense of including relatively few observations of the threshold variable. An application to thresholds for US industrial production growth at a disaggregated level shows the empirical relevance of applying the proposed approach.","[Donayre, Luiggi] Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, 1318 Kirby Dr, Duluth, MN 55812 USA; [Eo, Yunjong] Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Morley, James] Univ New South Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Duluth; University of Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Donayre, L (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, 1318 Kirby Dr, Duluth, MN 55812 USA.",adonayre@d.umn.edu,"Morley, James C/J-9166-2012; Eo, Yunjong/J-4319-2012","Eo, Yunjong/0000-0002-9172-2265; Morley, James/0000-0003-2380-6747",,,,,15,4,4,0,3,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

Usually real-world mechanisms are noisy and imprecise, that is, which we call 'fuzzy'. We therefore conducted a novel type of voluntary contributions experiment where we test a mechanism by varying its fuzziness. We focus on a range of fuzzy mechanisms we call 'meritocratic matching'. These mechanisms generalize the mechanism of 'contribution-based competitive grouping', and their basic function is to group players based on their contribution choices-i.e. high contributors with high contributors, and low contributors with low contributors. Theory predicts the following efficiency-equality tradeoff as a function of the mechanism's inherent fuzziness: high levels of fuzziness should lead to maximal inefficiency, but perfect equality; decreasing fuzziness is predicted to improve efficiency, but at the cost of growing inequality. The main finding of our experimental investigation is that, contrary to tradeoff predictions, less fuzziness increases both efficiency and equality. In fact, these unambiguous welfare gains are partially realized already at levels where the mechanism is too fuzzy for any high-efficiency outcome to even be a Nash equilibrium.","[Nax, Heinrich H.; Helbing, Dirk] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Computat Social Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Balietti, Stefano] Northeastern Univ, Network Sci Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Balietti, Stefano] Harvard Inst Quantitat Social Sci IQSS, Cambridge, MA USA; [Balietti, Stefano] Northeastern Univ, DAmore McKim Sch Business, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Murphy, Ryan O.] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Northeastern University; Northeastern University; University of Zurich,"Nax, HH (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Computat Social Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.",hnax@ethz.ch; s.balietti@neu.edu,,/0000-0003-1261-8134,European Commission through ERC [324247],European Commission through ERC,"HHN and SB contributed equally to the manuscript overall.

The aim of the case study subject to the current research was to identify the social and economic values of volunteerism in a rural Romanian commune, as they are perceived by three major community leaders - mayor, school principle and priest. Data were collected using key informant interview method, and then analysed using content analysis. The findings of the research showed that the concept of volunteerism is more understood at an informal level. Additionally, no management processes and practices of volunteerism were identified.

In such circumstances, an interesting research problem related to business ethics arises - to explore mutual dependence between ethical behavior of companies, internal relations with employees and external with customers. The paper contains a brief literature review of the issue that makes the background for the empirical analysis. This analysis is based on the data for European Union countries derived from The Global Competitiveness Report database in the period of 2007-2017. The study shows the strong positive correlations between three important aspects of the firms' stakeholders relations: ethical behavior of firms toward other firms and institutions, labor-employer cooperation and customer-centric approach. However, the absolute level of these aspects is moderate in EU countries and significant differences are noticed between old (exhibiting higher scores) and new (presenting lower scores) EU countries.

As subjects of international relations, sea trade ports occupy a leading place in ensuring the safety of navigation in the territorial sea and inland waters of Ukraine. To meet the current market conditions for the functioning of the transport system, ports need to constantly develop and improve their activities, reducing the cost of work, which is impossible without the implementation and modernization of information systems. For a complete understanding of the processes taking place in the port, it should be considered as a set of production nodes and software complexes that allow automating the work of operators. The detailed analysis of the access system as one of the most important components of the transport infrastructure of the port was carried out in the work. As a model for automation of the access system was chosen a single-channel queuing system. There are calculated the time limits, which the operator can spend on the issuance of one pass. This calculation was based on data of loading of the port's checkpoints for 2016-2017y and the planned growth of the traffic flow. Was estimated the time necessary for each operation to maintain a single vehicle. In article were studied the features of the construction of a data exchange model between different ISs, ensuring stable operation of the port.

For many years, the prime stimulus for continued research of Asian regionalism was the relative scarcity of regional institutions in the East Asia region but in 21st century, a decidedly reverse trend can be observed. The main objective of the paper is to characterize the role of Association of South East. Asian Nations in the Asian regionalism of the 21st century. The main thesis of this article is that ASEAN is dominant regional institution in Fast Asia with large potential to generate the prospective East Asian Community in 21st century. The following research methods were used: primary source analysis, descriptive and critical analysis, starting with research papers and legal documents published by ASEAN. Personal visits of the Author in head office of ADB, in Manila were also very important sources of knowledge. The ASEAN is an example of a regional institution characterized by consistent and persistent strife for improved economic cooperation of its members. The development of regionalism under ASEAN auspices has increased incrementally since the early 1990s. In 2007, members of the ASEAN agreed on adopting a new approach to the process of regional cooperation through the so-called ASEAN Charter, intended to form a basis for setting up a formal ASEAN Community. The ratification of the Charter (2009) has opened up a path to a regional grouping based on three pillars: military security, economic union, and socio-cultural community. The observed progress of regional integration of the ASEAN member countries attests to the fact that the nations involved in the process are well-aware of not only the potential benefits offered by close integration, but also of the potential risks associated with increased globalization and international competition on world markets.","[Drelich-Skulska, Boguslawa] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Drelich-Skulska, B (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Wroclaw, Poland.",,"Drelich-Skulska, Boguslawa/P-4518-2018",,,,,,37,0,0,0,1,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-344-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,167,176,,,,,,10,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP0MG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000535358500016,0

As it was observed in previous studies resident's place satisfaction increased with the age and length of residency: newcomers were more critical while those who had lived in their residence since birth were the most satisfied. In order to evaluate how time lived in the residence influences people life satisfaction the data of survey Quality of Life in cities were analysed, which was conducted by Central Statistical Bureau of Latvia in year 2017, when respondents from the biggest cities of Latvia (Daugavpils, Rezekne, Jelgava, Jurmala, Jekabpils, Ventspils, Liepaja, Valmiera) were questioned about their satisfaction with life and life quality dimensions in their residence. All respondents were divided in 4 groups considering the time period they have lived in the city and their satisfaction level with life in the residence was compared with statistical methods. The results showed that the time lived in residence slightly influenced person's satisfaction with individual life, city of residence and its life quality dimensions, but statistical significance in major part of indicators was comparatively small. Newcomers were the most satisfied respondent group, while persons who had lived in city 5 to 10 or even more years were less satisfied with city life and its life quality dimensions compared with other respondent groups.","[Feldmane, Liga] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Feldmane, L (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,,,National Research Program [5.2.4],National Research Program,The research was funded from the National Research Program [grant number 5.2.4].,,25,0,0,1,3,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-344-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,212,221,,,,,,10,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP0MG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000535358500020,0

It offers a fresh critical perspective on the history of the interaction between humans and animals. Recognizing the deep influence animality has on the human realm, HAS can help in broadening our knowledge about human beings, seen not as an alien species with respect to nature but as an interacting part of it. Overall, by discussing the intersections of human and nonhuman animals in society, HAS offers the opportunity to expand humans' views regarding other living beings, while helping humanity to understand its relationships with nonhuman animals and to work out the implications of those relationships. Hence the importance of bringing the discipline of human-animal studies into the realm of scholarly inquiry and the educational system. However, there is some evidence of a lack of HAS instruction in European academic curricula, particularly in the provision of programmes and curricula by faculties of veterinary medicine. Based on this premise, the Authors have investigated the state of HAS in the curricula and teaching programmes offered by European faculties of veterinary medicine, in order to assess the trend in the field. Furthermore, for the purpose of completing the framework, the project Cibo: la vita condivisa ('Food: shared life'), an innovative cycle of Summer Schools designed to enhance teaching and debating activities in the field of HAS within academia, is presented. In their conclusion, the Authors argue that the format of this project is a pioneering instrument to incorporate this subject in veterinary curricula, from which new specific courses and other forms of educational offerings on the issue might be developed.","[Fossati, P.] Univ Studies Milan, Dept Hlth Anim Sci & Food Safety, Via G Celoria 10, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Massaro, A.] Via Assarotti 23-8, I-16122 Genoa, Italy",University of Milan,"Fossati, P (通讯作者)，Univ Studies Milan, Dept Hlth Anim Sci & Food Safety, Via G Celoria 10, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",paola.fossati@unimi.it,"Fossati, Paola/CAF-6421-2022",,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,323,328,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_50,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000050,0

This is the first study to examine the motivations and characteristics of homeowners that utilize concessions. It also examines the impact concessions have on transaction prices and marketing durations. While the literature has attempted to determine if concessions can reduce marketing durations or increase transaction prices, the evidence is tainted by endogeneity and sample issues. Additionally, we find that relative bargaining power between buyers and sellers has a fundamental effect on how concessions alter prices and marketing durations. This aspect has been considered only narrowly in the extant literature. Our results demonstrate that when sellers have bargaining power, transactions including concessions exhibit higher prices and shorter marketing durations. Conversely, when buyers have greater negotiation leverage, transactions including concessions experience lower prices and longer marketing periods.","[Hayunga, Darren K.] Univ Georgia, Dept Insurance Legal Studies & Real Estate, Terry Coll Business, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Hayunga, DK (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Dept Insurance Legal Studies & Real Estate, Terry Coll Business, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",hayunga@uga.edu,,,,,,,26,5,5,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Assuming that the political-economic heterogeneity of the Eurozone will not vanish in the foreseeable future, the move to a more flexible exchange rate regime might therefore be economically advantageous. However, a purely economic view ignores the huge political maintenance costs' of negotiable realignments, costs that the EMS members aimed at overcoming when they opted for the euro.

Costs are a regular occurrence in the operations of each business system and it is not possible to perform any activity on a project and avoid costs. Costs are the center of economics, and in the literature of economics they occupy a central place because the notion of economics is closely related to the cost-dependent business performance. It can be concluded that all economic decisions are based on costs, so the special attention should be given to cost management. Practical experience shows frequent delays in the fulfilment of obligations towards the end customer, regarding the fulfilment of obligations by the unplanned engagement of additional work with increased production costs.

IN05 is a well-known model in Slovakia that gives a high percentage of reliability in predicting the financial health of Slovak companies. The Gulka's model was created in 2016 and its popularity is rising. The aim of this paper is to compare IN05 and Gulka's models and determine which of them is more suitable for Slovak enterprises. Analyses were based on real data from the latest available financial statements of industrial enterprises for five industries typical of Slovakia: Automotive, Electricity, Agriculture and Forestry, Construction, Mechanical Engineering. We have selected private domestic companies with limited liability. In the case of companies in bankruptcy or restructuring, we used the latest available financial statements before the date of bankruptcy or, respectively, management of restructuring. Using contingency tables, we compared the number of correct predictions for both models - the Gulka's model, created by the logistic regression method (LOGIT model) and the IN05 index created by the Multidimensional Discrimination Analysis (MDA method). We predicted the correct forecast when the company was actually in bankruptcy and the model rated it or if the company was not bankrupt and the model ranked it as prosperous. Both models are very useful in the conditions of the Slovak Republic. For Slovak industrial enterprises, the Gulka's model is more reliable. In general, the model's highest ability to leverage is in the country where the model was created or for the industry for which it was created.","[Klempaiova, Natalia; Bohdalova, Maria] Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Dept Informat Syst, Odbojarov 10, Bratislava 82005, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Klempaiová, N (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Dept Informat Syst, Odbojarov 10, Bratislava 82005, Slovakia.",natalia.klempaiova@fm.uniba.sk; maria.bohdalova@fm.uniba.sk,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8980-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,259,266,,,,,,8,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BM4AM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000462948800033,0

In theoretical point of view, export is considered to be independent on domestic product, and economically weak countries are usually considered to be more dependent on export (in terms of GDP development). This fact has been proved during analysis, where especially V4 countries are strongly dependent on export. However, the final impact of net balance of foreign trade on GDP is relatively weak in all V4 countries, which is relatively surprising fact again.

Various conventional banks create the space for the special products and possibilities for the connection of conventional banking with the non-conventional and innovative one. The accelerating demand for Islamic banking directly influences the offer of services of this type of banking, i.e. the increase of number of branches with islamic principles resp. the increase of specialized branches focused on the products of Islamic banking in the world. Currently, more than 450 islamic financial institutions in more than 20 countries in the world offer products of Islamic banking.

Currently, Government Ordinance no. 2/2001 stipulates the minimum and maximum limits of the civil fine, depending on the category of normative act, and determines the destination of the amounts resulting from the application of the civil fines. The amounts paid by the legal entities are, as a rule, revenue to the state budget, and the amounts resulting from the fines imposed on the natural persons according to the legislation in force are integral revenue to the local budgets.

For this reason, the subject of this paper is based on internal audit in insurance companies. On the other band, the main objective of the paper is to highlight the significance of performing internal audit within the aforementioned non-banking financial institutions, investigating the level of impact of implementation of internal audit on the quality of overall business operations of insurance companies in the Republic of Croatia, by assessing the degree of contribution of internal audit to individual indicators of the quality of business operations of insurance companies, namely: level of capital adequacy, quality of calculation of technical provisions, generation of profit from underwriting results, quality and continuity of investment income, and amount of return on invested own funds. From the results of the empirical study conducted on a sample of sixteen insurance companies, which are licensed by HANFA to conduct insurance business and are members of the Croatian Insurance Bureau (CIB), it can be concluded that, although internal audit in insurance companies, with branch offices in the Republic of Croatia, is functionally and organisationally separated from other parts of the joint stock company, it is to a significant extent marked by subordination to the management, which negatively affects the efficiency of implementation of internal audit in insurance companies. Furthermore, it can be said that in insurance companies, which are licensed to carry out insurance activities in the Republic of Croatia, it is usual to perform audit of operations, but because management begins to perceive the usefulness of internal audit in the management process, the management audit, in contemporary notions, is gaining extraordinary importance. Finally, it can be seen that, in general, conducting internal audit activities significantly contributes to individual indicators of quality of business operations of insurance companies, and accordingly increases the quality of overall business operations of insurance companies in the Republic of Croatia.","[Mijoc, Ivo; Brocic, Biljana] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia; [Iles, Marija] Poduzetnicki Inkubator BIOS Doo, PODUKA Zadruga Poduku & Savjetovanje Poduzetnistv, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Mijoc, I (通讯作者)，Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.",imijoc@efos.hr; ile.marija38@gmail.com; biljana.brocic@gmail.com,,,,,,,11,0,0,1,6,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2018,14.0,,,,,,1356,1381,,,,,,26,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9DQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470808300073,0

However, not all crises immediately produce such great transformations'. Why do some ideas result in incremental rather than abrupt change after crisis? To identify mechanisms potentially explaining this variation, I conduct an exploratory process tracing of an understudied case of incremental institutional change: post-independence Syria. Competing political actors in Syria converged on identical policy responses to crisis despite their very different interpretations of its causes. Although power oscillated between these increasingly bitter rivals in the early 1950s, their ideational consensus on economic issues nevertheless led to a decade of steady institutional change that transformed previously fragile government institutions into powerful vehicles of statism. I derive from this analysis the potential causal significance of two new variables - crisis narrative and crisis response - and hypothesise that their configuration can explain variation in post-crisis patterns of institutional change. Ideas can explain not only the new direction of economic governance after crisis, but also the speed and scale of its movement.","[Neep, Daniel] Georgetown Univ, Edmund A Walsh Sch Foreign Serv, Ctr Contemporary Arab Studies, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Georgetown University,"Neep, D (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Edmund A Walsh Sch Foreign Serv, Ctr Contemporary Arab Studies, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",dn230@georgetown.edu,"Neep, Daniel/AAB-2534-2021","Neep, Daniel/0000-0003-0247-0076",British Academy; Edmund A.

In this context, there is a pressing need for a better understanding of the economic impacts of irrigation restrictions, including their microeconomic and broad economic repercussions. This paper connects a multi-attribute Revealed Preference Model working at an agricultural district level with a regionally calibrated supply and use model that combines nonlinear programming and input-output modeling techniques to address water allocation issues. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time these two modeling approaches are combined in this fashion. Methods are illustrated with an application to the Lower Po River Basin (LPRB) in the Emilia Romagna Region, Italy. Results show that irrigation restrictions generate rising incremental losses in the agricultural districts of the LPRB, which are amplified through negative inter-sectorial feedbacks at a regional level.

The aim of this paper is to ascertain whether the selected insurance companies experience lower expense ratio of their insurance portfolio than what is the average expense ratio of insurance portfolios on the Czech insurance market. The reason for doing this research is in the fact that the insurance companies CSOB and Komecni pojistovna are entities with a developed bancassurance model. As the authors discovered in their earlier research, insurance companies using this model experience lower expense ratio. This paper analyzes the selected insurance companies on Czech insurance market considering the cooperation between the bank and insurance company. It analyzes the volume of premium written concluded through the distributional channel of bancassurance, and eventually compares expense ratios of the selected insurance companies with the average value on Czech insurance market between 2012 and 2016. Expense ratio of life insurance in both insurance companies shows lower values than the average value on the Czech insurance market. The same applies to total insurance. The research confirms that Komercni pojistovna shows lower average value of expense ratio than CSOB pojistovna.","[Preckova, Lenka] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Finance & Accounting, Univ Nam 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic; [Vavrova, Eva] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Finance, Lipova 507-41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava; Masaryk University Brno,"Precková, L (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Finance & Accounting, Univ Nam 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic.",preckova@opf.slu.cz; eva.vavrova@econ.muni.cz,"Přečková, Lenka/AAR-4460-2020; Vavrova, Eva/D-9670-2014","Přečková, Lenka/0000-0002-1973-3293;",Czech Science Foundation [16-17796S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),Research behind this paper was supported by the Czech Science Foundation within the project 16-17796S 'Affiliation with financial conglomerate as a determinant of performance and risk of banks'.,,18,1,1,0,0,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8980-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,550,558,,,,,,9,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BM4AM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000462948800071,0

Its main finding is that millionaires are substantially more right-wing than the public on economic issues and somewhat more internationalist on foreign affairs, though a number of areas of agreement can be found as well, particularly assessments of the problems facing the country. Most surprisingly, the opinions of the public appear more likely to correspond with policy than those of millionaires.

The survey data map the parallel processes of a self-reported polarization of identities and the preservation or strengthening of civic identities. Language categories matter for current self-identification, but they are not cast in narrow ethnolinguistic terms, and feeling more Ukrainian and Ukrainian citizenship include mono- and bilingual conceptions of native language (i.e. Ukrainian and Russian).","[Sasse, Gwendolyn] Univ Oxford, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Oxford, England; [Sasse, Gwendolyn; Lackner, Alice] Ctr East European & Int Studies ZOiS, Berlin, Germany; [Lackner, Alice] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Sociol, Berlin, Germany",University of Oxford; Free University of Berlin,"Sasse, G (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Oxford, England.;Sasse, G (通讯作者)，Ctr East European & Int Studies ZOiS, Berlin, Germany.",gwendolyn.sasse@politics.ox.ac.uk,,,Centre for East European and International Studies (ZOiS),Centre for East European and International Studies (ZOiS),The survey on which this paper is based was funded by the Centre for East European and International Studies (ZOiS).,,55,62,62,0,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

The new regulatory requirements, the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB), is a reaction of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and should create transparency based on a unification of market risk criteria to be met by all banks. One of the novelties is the move from Value at Risk (VaR) to Expected Shortfall (ES) as the standard for measuring risk and calculating capital. It is motivated by better theoretical properties of ES as a risk measure. Especially, VaR doesn't account for tail risk. ES in contrast captures high-value low-probability events and has other advantages too. At the same time, ES has been criticized for unavailability of simple tools for its validation, for possibilities of backtesting. Because backtesting is one of the key quantitative tools used to assess the conservativeness of the risk measurement methodology, estimation techniques are being constantly improved. This article shows the current, new methods for backtesting ES reviewed in literature and discuss which methods are appropriate to implement in middle-sized banks. ES will be necessary for internal validation and for regulatory control. Hence, practical methods for backtesting the ES are of particular interest.","[Schmitt, Eugenia] FinRiskConsult, Hammersbacher Str 18, D-81377 Munich, Germany",,"Schmitt, E (通讯作者)，FinRiskConsult, Hammersbacher Str 18, D-81377 Munich, Germany.",eugenia.schmitt@finriskconsult.de,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,1,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8980-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,621,628,,,,,,8,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BM4AM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000462948800080,0

The aim of this paper is to describe and systematize theoretical background of economic security as part of life quality framework and to analyse the economic security in the Baltic States in context of life quality. The authors have done literature review about life quality and economic security and created a framework for analysing economic security in context of life quality, drawing attention to the main applicable statistical indicators. Authors have also analysed these economic security indicators in the Baltic States based on the above mentioned framework for the last nine years. Authors have concluded that there are differences in the economic security situation between the Baltic States. Authors have described and analysed the various situation in different aspects of economic security in Latvia, Lithnania and Estonia. Authors have indicated the fields where improvements are necessary to advance economic security and life quality of individuals in the Baltic states.

In comparison to other digital payment solutions, Bitcoin is based on a peer-to-peer electronic cash system using 'the blockchain'. This innovative technology allows for decentralised storage and movement of currency in a fully anonymous way, introducing advantageous methods for encrypted security and faster transactions (Hagiu and Beach, 2014). Scepticism regards Bitcoin's foundation, energy consumption and price volatility, however, did not take long to arise (Holthaus, 2017). Ten years from its white paper release, Bitcoin is further supported by the same drivers which could sustain its growth as the future of digital payments (Russo, 2018). In order to investigate the key drivers and feasibility of acceptance, a London based survey was used to understand the desirability of Bitcoin as a day-to-day tool for digital payments. Additionally, this research analysed Bitcoin's stakeholders and forecast drivers of sustainability for its application to become the future of the payment industry. A space which relies on policies that involve multiple layers of society, governments, regulators and tech-firms, all on a global scale. The findings confirmed how the increasing lack of trust of political and financial institutions, coupled with the increasing cases of data-breaches by tech-firms, encouraged over 70% of respondents to consider more decentralised and anonymous methods for their day-to-day actions; like payments. Policy makers need to cope with societies increasingly separating politically but gathering together digitally (LBS, 2017). For Bitcoin to truly establish itself as a global digital payment solution, key stakeholder acceptance must converge alongside the introduction of more robust regulation.","[Valente, Andrea; Atkinson, David; Clifford, John] Pearson Coll London, 190 High Holborn, London WC1V 7BH, England",,"Valente, A (通讯作者)，Pearson Coll London, 190 High Holborn, London WC1V 7BH, England.",av150@pearsoncollege.com; david.atkinson@pearsoncollege.com; john.clifford@pearsoncollege.com,,,,,,,26,0,0,2,9,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,206,217,,,,,,12,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540723300025,0

In both countries, media corporations and private citizens are liable to up to three years' imprisonment for publishing photographs or recordings depicting the conditions of animals on farms or at slaughter. Controls on the publication of information documenting animal use have compromised transparency in the food chain, eroded the accountability of those involved in the management of animals and undermined the case for enhanced legislation and policy reform.

The new challenges that Europe is facing, first of all the decision of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to exit the European Union, as well as the need to finance new priorities, point to the fact that the budget of the European Union will be the main focus of conversations regarding the future of European Union consisted of twenty seven Member States after the finalization of the Brexit process, As part of planning the new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), it is of importance for Croatia to maintain the status of traditional policies such as cohesion and common agricultural policy. The Ministry of Regional Development and EU funds has drafted the National Position of the Republic of Croatia in relation to the future of cohesion policy after 2020, where national standpoints and priorities are presented. Given the importance of the topic, this paper will address the weaknesses and elements needed for reaching a higher level of synergy and complementarity between European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) and other EU funds. Furthermore, we shall also address the elements which are necessary for the improvement of the effectiveness of cohesion policy implementation and for a simpler transition between program periods and a faster start of the new financial period to ensure the continuity of investments. In conclusion, this paper demonstrates the need for stronger efforts in keeping the cohesion policy as one of the key priorities of the European Union's budget after 2020, taking into consideration its effects across all European regions in terms of reducing disparities and investment for growth and new jobs.","[Zalac, Gabrijela; Odak, Ana] Minist Reg Dev & EU Funds, Zagreb, Croatia; [Banozic, Mario] State Adm Vukovar Srijem, Vukovar, Croatia",,"Zalac, G (通讯作者)，Minist Reg Dev & EU Funds, Zagreb, Croatia.",gabrijela.zalac@mrrfeu.hr; ana.odak@mrrfeu.hr; mario.banozic@gmail.com,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,3,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2018,14.0,,,,,,1147,1161,,,,,,15,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9DQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470808300062,0

Specifically, we examine the extent to which enhanced air service availability to a peripheral destination will translate into greater number of tourists. By using choice experiments, the research design addresses the generative effect of new air services on tourism demand, as well as the broader tourism context in which the air itinerary choices are made. In the context of Koreans travelling to Australia, the market share effects of the changes in the factors both external and internal to aviation policy are simulated. Although the results suggest that changes in the flight itinerary attributes can generate additional tourists for peripheral destinations, the extent to which the aviation attributes can generate tourism is strongly dependent on the tourists' length of stay in Australia. The key implication is that institutional changes such as the length of leave entitlements or visa arrangements for foreign travellers are important contextual factors that can significantly enhance or depress the effect of the destination's aviation policy and air service attributes designed for tourism development.","[Koo, Tay T.

The master data was processed using the primary data obtained from 2,029,116 farms. Farmers are registered with the Farmer Registration System and 640 are registered with the Farmer Accounting Data Network. Farms were classified based on farm type and cropping system. Results showed that the education level of farmers is low and household size is high, farm holdings are small and fragmented and there is an imbalance in land distribution. These characteristics affect negatively the utilisation of credit, although 56% of farmers utilise credits and the equity ratio is very high (97.3%). The new regulations on the Inheritance Law will help both increase farmland and solve the problem of fragmentation in Turkey. The institutions and organizations concerned should satisfy this demand taking into account the specific characteristics of the sector (by facilitating utilisation of credit, supporting small businesses and providing additional loan opportunities, renewing machine fleet and regulations on land acquisition) in order to contribute to its advancement.","[Kusek, Gursel; Turker, Metin] Republ Turkey Minist Food Agr & Livestock, Agr Reform, Eskisehir Yolu 9 Km, Lodumlu Ankara, Turkey; [Akdemir, Sinasi; Hayran, Seyit] Cukurova Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, TR-01330 Adana, Turkey","Gida Tarim Ve Hayvancilik Bakanligi; Prime Ministry Turkey; Ministry of Food, Agriculture & Livestock - Turkey; Cukurova University","Akdemir, S (通讯作者)，Cukurova Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, TR-01330 Adana, Turkey.",sinasi.akdemir@gmail.com,"Akdemir, Sinasi/G-7733-2018; hayran, seyit/G-7522-2018","hayran, seyit/0000-0002-0223-8034",,,,,14,7,8,0,7,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,DEC,2017,16.0,4,,,,,66,72,,,,,,7,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,FX4EX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426026600008,0

This paper presents a unique policy experiment in Guangzhou, China, where lotteries and auctions are used in conjunction to allocate vehicle licenses. Guangzhou introduced vehicle license regulations to control the monthly quota of local automobile growth in 2012. To obtain a license, residents are required to choose between the lottery and auction method. Since the introduction of the regulations, there has been heated debates on the distributional effects of lotteries and auctions; however, the debates have not been grounded in empirical studies. We analyze the distributional effects of such mixed mode of resource allocation in a positive manner based on individual behavioral choices. We conducted a survey in January 2016 (n = 1000 people * 12 months), and used mixed logic models to analyze how socio-economic status, including income and household automobile ownership, determined people's choices among lottery, auction, and non-participation alternatives. We find that income increased participation, but did not influence non-car owners' choices between lotteries and auctions, which contrasts with the common notion that lotteries benefit the poor. Additionally, the positive impact of car ownership on participation indicates a car-dependent trajectory for automobile growth. The significant socio-economic differentiators between lotteries and auctions were age, gender, and education. Proxies of mobility needs were insignificant overall. The program attributes had a much larger impact than all other variables people were more likely to choose lotteries with higher winning rates and more participants and more likely to choose auctions with higher prices and more participants. We concluded that for those who participated, the choice between lotteries and auctions did not depend on their income or mobility needs but, rather, the probability of winning plates and the opportunity for speculation.","[Wang, Shenhao; Zhao, Jinhua] MIT, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Zhao, JH (通讯作者)，77 Massachusetts Ave,7-523, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",shenhao@mit.edu; jinhua@mit.edu,"Wang, Shenhao/ABD-4771-2020; Zhao, Jinhua/GYV-4433-2022","Zhao, Jinhua/0000-0002-1929-7583",Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Samuel Tak Lee (STL) Real Estate Entrepreneurship Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Samuel Tak Lee (STL) Real Estate Entrepreneurship Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,We thank Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART) and the Samuel Tak Lee (STL) Real Estate Entrepreneurship Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for partially funding this research.,,38,15,15,3,27,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

We find that the unemployment rate of an education group in a given state is positively related to mortality in that group. A 1% increase in the group-specific unemployment rate is associated with an approximately 0.015% increase in the group-specific mortality rate, which is consistent with the hypothesis that, while state-level unemployment may have indirect health benefits, being personally affected by a recession has a detrimental effect on health.

Using annual time series data for the period 1965-2013, we find that stock market shocks have had a short-run causal effect on real GDP per capita only after 1991, a result that is consistent with standard Granger causality tests; however, the contribution of stock market shocks to output growth dynamics has been small.

Considering the critical role of crisis and shocks in the integration process within the region, we determine whether GCC countries are characterised by a common business cycle. We suggest a different empirical approach that, unlike previous studies, allows one to endogenously detect structural changes in the comovement process between outputs. We apply a new measure for this region that is based on the time-varying coherence function. Such a measure not only detects comovement dynamics but also distinguishes these dynamics in terms of short- and long-term cycles. Additionally, we can test whether certain countries tend to be more synchronised. The main finding of this study is that not all GCC countries share a common short-term business cycle. However, in the long term, all country-pairs indicate a medium-level synchronisation in the most recent subperiods. The new role of the United Arab Emirates' regional trade platform allows it to strengthen long-term business cycle comovement, thus differentiating it from other GCC country-pairs that have shown a decline in the last two subperiods.","[Essaadi, Essahbi] Univ Tunis, SEPAL, Tunis, Tunisia; [Essaadi, Essahbi] Umm Al Qura Univ, Mecca, Saudi Arabia",Universite de Tunis; Umm Al Qura University,"Essaadi, E (通讯作者)，Univ Tunis, SEPAL, Tunis, Tunisia.;Essaadi, E (通讯作者)，Umm Al Qura Univ, Mecca, Saudi Arabia.",,"Essaadi, Essahbi/AAO-9669-2021","Essaadi, Essahbi/0000-0003-4770-3785",,,,,40,0,0,1,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,OCT,2017,40.0,10,,,,,2153,2171,,10.1111/twec.12490,0.0,,,19,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,FK2XT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413347400006,0

Rather tautologically, this is when decision-makers are satisfied with achieving some objective, rather than in obtaining the best outcome. The term was coined by Simon (Q J Econ 69:99-118, 1955), and has stimulated many discussions and theories. Prominent amongst these theories are models of incomplete preferences, models of behaviour under ambiguity, theories of rational inattention, and search theories. Most of these, however, seem to lack an answer to at least one of two key questions: when should the decision-maker (DM) satisfice; and how should the DM satisfice. In a sense, search models answer the latter question (in that the theory tells the DM when to stop searching), but not the former; moreover, usually the question as to whether any search at all is justified is left to a footnote. A recent paper by Manski (Theory Decis. doi:10.1007/s11238-017-9592-1, 2017) fills the gaps in the literature and answers the questions: when and how to satisfice? He achieves this by setting the decision problem in an ambiguous situation (so that probabilities do not exist, and many preference functionals can therefore not be applied) and by using the Minimax Regret criterion as the preference functional. The results are simple and intuitive. This paper reports on an experimental test of his theory. The results show that some of his propositions (those relating to the 'how') appear to be empirically valid while others (those relating to the 'when') are less so.","[Hey, John D.; Permana, Yudistira; Rochanahastin, Nuttaporn] Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 4GA, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Hey, JD (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 4GA, N Yorkshire, England.",john.hey@york.ac.uk; yhp504@york.ac.uk; nr708@york.ac.uk,"Permana, Yudistira Hendra/AAF-6329-2021","Permana, Yudistira Hendra/0000-0002-9300-6932",,,,,37,12,12,1,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,OCT,2017,83.0,3,,,,,337,353,,10.1007/s11238-017-9600-5,0.0,,,17,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,FI6IP,,"hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412098600003,0

The first phase, on which preparations commenced in 2007, relied on incorporating existing road-based operators in a bus rapid transit (BRT) system. The municipality underestimated the cost and level of effort involved in the wholesale corporatisation of paratransit operators while concurrently equipping them to become BRT operators. Learning from this experience, it developed a more incremental transition approach in the second phase, the first fruit of which was a pilot express bus service launched in mid-2014. The pilot service contract also provided for a training programme for paratransit operators in the affected parts of the city to build their managerial and technical capacity. It was envisaged that programme participants would ultimately manage and run the long-term operating companies and contracts that would be established by the end of the three-year interim period. This article provides a critical review of the programme's context, content and participant experiences after the conclusion of its first year. In broad terms the programme has made a positive contribution to paratransit participants' understanding of the shortcomings of their current operations and why reform might be necessary, but much still remains to be done to enable them to fill their envisaged roles in future public transport operations. In view of growing interest in BRT installation in Sub-Saharan Africa lessons from Cape Town's reform process offer both cautionary evidence and a potential mechanism for drawing existing operators in as partners in reform.","[Schalekamp, Herrie] Univ Cape Town, Dept Civil Engn, Ctr Transport Studies, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Schalekamp, H (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Dept Civil Engn, Ctr Transport Studies, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa.",herrie.schalekamp@uct.ac.za,,,,,,,33,27,29,0,6,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

I show that not reacting to the exchange rate yields better outcomes in terms of a standard loss function.

It argues that researchers have not fully accounted for the changes underway in the Union's take on mediation. By elucidating the differences between this approach and the already existing literature on EU mediation, the article advocates a practice turn and develops a framework for studying EU mediation as an assemblage of practices. It builds on Latourian assemblage thinking and complements it with the Foucauldian notion of political rationality and techne. This approach is then explored through examining the practices of EU mediation support in Myanmar, which draws attention to the contradictions and a specific set of knowledge claims on peace and conflict, and traces dissident voices and how they inform the use of mediation instruments. In so doing, it demonstrates how a practice-oriented approach allows us to provide new insights into EU external action.","[Brandenburg, Natalie C.] Univ Kent, Canterbury, Kent, England",University of Kent,"Brandenburg, NC (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Brussels Sch Int Studies, Blvd Louis Schmidt 2A, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",ncg25@kentforlife.net,,,,,,,41,7,7,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The structural dynamics of farms are assessed through the micro-data from the sixth Italian agriculture census, identifying six typologies of market-oriented farms that face in different ways the pressures and opportunities of peri-urban environments. The article shows that, although in the main Italian urban poles there is a significant share of farms passively absorbed by the urban forwarding, the most reactive farms are supplying an increasing number and variety of social and economic services to the urban population. Since diversification is becoming a specific business strategy developed by the most structured and market-oriented peri-urban farms, it can turn out to be a relevant asset to enhance the resilience of metropolitan areas and, more generally, to improve the connections between urban and rural areas.","[Henke, Roberto; Vanni, Francesco] CREA Res Ctr Agr Policies & Bioecon, Rome, Italy",,"Vanni, F (通讯作者)，CREA Res Ctr Agr Policies & Bioecon, Rome, Italy.",francesco.vanni@crea.gov.it,"Vanni, Francesco/R-6068-2018","Vanni, Francesco/0000-0003-4009-3013",,,,,30,10,12,1,21,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,2611-1128,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,SEP,2017,16.0,3,,,,,11,18,,,,,,8,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,FN8SR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416296300002,0

This vehicle choice behavior involves choosing multiple vehicle types simultaneously and allocating continuous amounts of budget to the chosen vehicles. The recent developed multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) modeling framework provides a suitable platform for allocation of continuous amounts of a consumer good (expenditure) to different discrete outcomes (different vehicle types). In this study, we develop three MDCEV models considering travel time, mileage, and monetary expenditure as the continuous consumption constraints. The three models estimate the impacts of a set of socio-demographic attributes on user's vehicle choice and capture the satiation effect with increasing the consumption for each vehicle type. The study also employs an efficient simulation procedure to obtain the simulated results of the three models, and compare the results to the observed data using normalized RMSE and correct ratio to determine the best-fitted model. The estimation results suggest that user age, income level, driving license country, insurance plan, membership plan, and origin location have impacts on users' vehicle utilization patterns. The comparison results indicate that travel time, mileage and expenditure affect users' vehicle utilization patterns in the same way, and all three models can provide accurate predictions for the vehicle choice behavior. These findings can be referred to by operators when determining the most efficient allocation of resources within carsharing systems. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Even though NTMs are imposed de jure to protect consumers from unhealthy products, they increase trade costs de facto. So, when tariff protection lowers, NTMs become effective barriers to trade and the exporting countries can complain at the dedicated committee at the WTO (STCs). Therefore, we study whether STCs are raised by exporting countries as a consequence of tariff reductions in importing countries, that is when non-tariff measures become barriers to trade. Using a recent database on STCs over the period 1996-2010, we find empirical evidence that SPS and TBT concerns are raised by exporting country as a consequence of importer's tariff cut.","[Orefice, Gianluca] CEPII, Paris, France",,"Orefice, G (通讯作者)，CEPII, Paris, France.",,,,,,,,19,33,36,3,50,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,SEP,2017,40.0,9,,,,,1807,1835,,10.1111/twec.12447,0.0,,,29,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,FG5AD,,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000410299900005,0

Our empirical strategy relies on long-term changes in poverty and access to bus transit at the neighborhood level in the Atlanta metropolitan area. We estimate the effect of bus transit access on poverty using fixed effects models to control for time-invariant unobservable characteristics. Furthermore, we undertake several robustness checks using a combination of instrumental variable regression, subsample analysis, and propensity score matching. Our results indicate that, on average, after controlling for neighborhood characteristics, census tracts with better access to public bus transportation have a higher proportion of low-income households - in both the central city and the suburbs. Thus, policies that improve access to transit in underserved areas can plausibly expand residential opportunities for the poor and reduce spatial inequities in urban centers.","[Pathak, Rahul] CUNY, Baruch Coll, New York, NY 10010 USA; [Wyczalkowski, Christopher K.; Huang, Xi] Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, 14 Marietta St NW,3rd Floor, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Baruch College (CUNY); University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Wyczalkowski, CK (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, 14 Marietta St NW,3rd Floor, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",rahul.pathak@baruch.cuny.edu; cwyczalkowski@gatech.edu; xhuang67@gatech.edu,"Huang, Xi/ABC-8953-2020",,,,,,53,40,50,1,44,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

It focuses on retailers that play a fundamental role in the decision making process often determining delivery times. It explores their preferences for three off-hour delivery prototypes and inquires retailers' willingness to adopt them, both with and without the provision of dedicated incentives. Finally, it analyses retailers' reactions to a hypothetical scenario where a mandatory off-hour delivery policy is imposed. The overall results show a good inclination towards off-hour deliveries. This induces optimism with respect to their potential introduction as well as skepticism about the lack of attention local decision makers have, so far, paid to this policy option.

The first 6th wave (2009-14) of the 09 sample' from the Korean Labour and Income Panel Study (KLIPS) is used. The results show that average level of job satisfaction of non-standard workers is lower than that of standard workers and the change in employment type from standard to non-standard leads to a decrease in job satisfaction. Examining the internal heterogeneity of non-standard workers shows job satisfaction did not decrease for those who voluntarily choose non-standard contracts but did decrease for the involuntary group. Moreover, external heterogeneity did not affect those who involuntarily chose non-standard contracts, but the outcome varies for the voluntary non-standard workers.","[Park, Mihee] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Social Welf, Seoul, South Korea; [Kang, Joonmo] Washington Univ, Brown Sch Social Work, St Louis, MO USA",Seoul National University (SNU); Washington University (WUSTL),"Park, M (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Social Sci, Dept Social Welf, 16-331,599 Kwanak Ro, Seoul 151742, South Korea.",parkmh@snu.ac.kr,"Kang, Joonmo/GYU-3827-2022",,,,,,54,6,8,4,32,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Achieving sustainable urban development requires including freight systems in strategic urban development plans. In this context, joint efforts involving academia and public- and private sector to collect the right data and develop suitable models, can contribute toward a better understanding of establishments' freight needs, the quantification of freight's traffic impacts and the development of appropriate methods to support decision making and strategic plans. This paper studies urban commercial establishments' freight needs and impacts on traffic using data collected from establishments in the City of Gothenburg (Sweden). The data cover different zones of the city and include commercial sectors found typically in urban cores (e.g., retailers, food services, health care, public sector offices and education). The paper introduces a set of statistical models developed based on regression analyses and discrete choice models-to estimate the number of freight trips produced and attracted per week, and the attraction of weight and volumes of freight. In addition to shed light on the factors determining establishments' freight- and freight trips generation, the models are designed with the purpose of assisting planning and policy design efforts, thus the explanatory variables are selected based on suitability and availability. The results show that retailers of perishable goods have the highest freight trip generation per establishment, followed by public sector offices and education establishments, retailers of non-perishable goods and restaurants. The results also reveal a heterogeneity between sectors, and a differential business size effect across commercial sectors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigate the implications of dropping BB and OE. Dropping BB yields no mechanism which never runs a budget deficit but allowing for a bound on the budget deficit yields positive results. Dropping OE yields only fixed-price trading or constant mechanisms when there are two agents but there are additional mechanisms when there are more agents.

This procedure allows the influence of a possible trend to be removed without restricting the model specification, and allows model and trend selection based on statistical criteria. The trend is modeled deterministically using linear or cubic spline functions of time. The results show that storage models with trend are always preferred to models without trend. They yield more plausible estimates of the structural parameters, with storage costs and demand elasticities that are more consistent with the literature. They imply occasional stockouts, whereas without trend the estimated models predict no stockouts over the sample period for most commodities. Moreover, accounting for a trend in the estimation implies price moments closer to those observed in commodity prices. Our results support the empirical relevance of the speculative storage model, and show that storage model estimations should not neglect the possibility of long-run price trends.

Nevertheless, economists have rarely investigated the causes of crowding discomfort. Furthermore, most evidence on the costs of PT crowding is based on trade-offs between crowding, travel time and money. First, this paper assesses discomfort with PT crowding at various density levels across heterogeneous individuals using a different methodology. Based on a survey of 1000 Paris PT users, the negative relationship of in-vehicle density on reported satisfaction is similar to previous studies investigating PT crowding costs and stable across most individual characteristics. We also find a sensitive increase in crowding costs over users' income. Second, we investigate the causes of this discomfort effect. We identify three key drivers: (a) dissatisfaction with standing and not being seated; (b) less opportunities to make use of the time during the journey; (c) the physical closeness of other travelers per se.

The paper develops an index measuring the average market form of a country's exports. This index produces a positive and statistically significant coefficient in conventional growth regressions. A one standard deviation increase is suggested to raise growth by 0.885 percentage points.

Using data from 98 administrative cities in Eastern China from 2004 to 2012 and spatial modelling techniques, this study examines the spillover effect of attractions, including natural, cultural and man-made attractions. The spillover effect refers to the impact attractions in the regions surrounding a specific destination have on tourist arrivals at that destination. The results show that, although the spatial substitution effect exists among the same type of attractions in adjacent regions, the size of this effect is too low to counteract the positive spillover effect of attractions. This study advances research on spillover phenomena in the tourism field and supports the strategy of interregional tourism collaboration centred on attractions.","[Zhou Bo; Yang Bi] Xiamen Univ, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Li Hengyun] Univ South Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Qu Hailin] Oklahoma State Univ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",Xiamen University; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,"Zhou, B (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Sch Management, Dept Tourism & Hospitality Adm, 422-25 South Siming Rd, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.",friendzhoubo@xmu.edu.cn,"Li, Hengyun/ABE-6467-2020","Li, Hengyun/0000-0002-2369-1567",Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71172048],Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Zhou Bo appreciates the funding from Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) whose project number is 71172048.",,25,35,37,8,83,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

While aggregate ridership figures have generally been positive, little is known about the drivers behind these changes because of a lack of travel information on individuals before and after implementation of such systems. The current paper presents analysis from a naturalistic travel behaviour study of inner-city Sydney residents that coincided with the phased introduction of the Opal smartcard system. Using a differences-indifferences methodology, results indicate significant reductions in car use of around 10 min/day with commensurate increases in train use and incidental walking. This trend holds across income groups and is more pronounced for older residents. Results add further weight to the merits of simplifying ticket purchasing as part of a package of policy measures designed to increase public transport usage. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Employing a Bourdieusian perspective we find that all six firms privilege candidates with the same narrow forms of cultural capital, while acknowledging that this contradicts their professed commitment to social inclusion and recruiting the best 'talent'. We find that this behaviour is enshrined within the habitus of elite firms. We argue that it represents an organizational strategy generated by a compulsion to achieve legitimacy in a specific field of London-based elite PSFs. We identify a 'professional project' of sorts, but argue that this can no longer be mapped on to the interests of a discrete occupational group. As such, we contribute to studies of elite reproduction and social stratification by focusing specifically on the role of elite professional organizations in the reproduction of inequality.","[Ashley, Louise] Royal Holloway Univ London, Org Studies & HRM, Egham, Surrey, England; [Empson, Laura] City Univ London, London, England",University of London; Royal Holloway University London; City University London,"Ashley, L (通讯作者)，Royal Holloway Univ London, Egham Hill, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England.",louise.ashley@rhul.ac.uk,,,,,,,46,57,66,3,31,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Large Transport Infrastructure Projects (TIPs) are amongst the most controversial and are often delivered late, over budget, and providing less benefit than expected. While there is a growing theoretical body of literature addressing TIPs, empirical research is still required to determine which TIPs characteristics affect TIPs schedule & cost performance. This paper addresses this issue, applying an empirically based methodology to a dataset of 30 European TIPs. The results highlight the importance of financial support from the government and the strong influence of both external and internal stakeholders, mainly in relation to their early engagement and to their nationality. Technological characteristics and the presence of Special Purpose Entities are also correlated with the TIPs performance. These key findings both support and contradict the literature, and are relevant for both policy makers and project managers during the decision making process, planning and delivery of TIPs.

Hourly parking pricing is a common parking management strategy where vehicles pay based on their parking duration (dwell time). In this paper, we derive comparative static effects for a small network to show that road pricing and hourly parking pricing are structurally different in how they influence the traffic equilibrium with elastic demand. Whereas road pricing strictly reduces demand, hourly parking pricing can reduce or induce demand depending on the parking dwell time elasticity (to the hourly parking price). When dwell time is elastic, demand always increases with parking price. However, when dwell time is inelastic, demand may increase or decrease with the parking price. Hence, hourly parking pricing can actually cause higher congestion and decay social welfare if imposed imprudently. For larger networks, we present a Variational Inequality model that characterizes the emergent equilibrium. Numerical experiments on a large network validate our analytical findings from a smaller and stylized case study. Our results also show a lower standard deviation in the parking search time (i.e., time to find a parking spot) when dwell time is highly elastic to the hourly parking price. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

NSP rehabilitations aim to bring foreclosed and abandoned properties back to productive use. Very few quantitative studies have evaluated NSP and provided policy suggestions for future stabilization. Furthermore, there is some ambiguity about the channels through which foreclosures influence neighboring properties. This study fills the gap in the literature by evaluating the effects of NSP acquisition and rehabilitation in terms of the impact on elevating neighboring property values. In addition, it provides evidence that disamenity effects are a source of the negative impacts of foreclosures on their neighbors. Using a 2008-2014 repeated cross-section dataset for housing sales in the city of Chicago, the difference-in-differences estimates reveal that the average sales prices of homes within 0.1 miles of the NSP projects increased by 14.3% and these effects do not appear until the completion of the rehabilitation. Furthermore, large program effects are found for normal homes but not for foreclosure-related homes. The results vary under different contexts of NSP implementation, but the analytical approach presented in this study is reproducible for NSP studies in other regions.","[Bak, Xian F.] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Chicago, IL 60680 USA; Univ Illinois, Reg Econ Applicat Lab, Chicago, IL 60680 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Bak, XF (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Chicago, IL 60680 USA.",fang21@illinois.edu,"Hewings, Geoffrey John Dennis/B-2058-2014","Hewings, Geoffrey John Dennis/0000-0003-2560-3273",,,,,26,13,16,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

For each solution, we show how its associated likelihood function can be constructed by using a 'backward-forward' algorithm. We illustrate the techniques with two examples. The first considers an inflationary program in which beliefs about the inflation target evolve differently from the inflation target itself, and the second applies the techniques to estimate a new Keynesian model through the Volcker disinflation. We compare our methodology with the alternative in which structural change is captured by switching between regimes via a Markov switching process.

There is also little research on how to align the decision areas when applying AMP and how to improve the inclusive effectiveness. Hence, the paper focuses on examining the challenges and prospects of applying AMP in a highway maintenance agency or department. An exploratory research method was used through an extensive review of literature and an industry survey. The findings from the literature and case study review were used to design a questionnaire and conduct the survey. The survey results revealed that the AMP are only being implemented ineffectively in maintaining highways, and a strong commitment is required to improve the asset management capability for effective use of the asset data. It is highly recommended that the Highway Agency should issue a guideline for implementing asset management policy and also encourage associate departments to achieve asset management maturity level 3 so that 15055000 certification can be achieved. The study concludes that there is still substantial work needed within the asset management process, particularly in highway maintenance before its effectiveness can be realised and measured.

The authors use tourism trade-weighted exchange rate indices and foreign income derived from country-based tourism trade. They employ Johansen's maximum likelihood technique to estimate the long-run effects of the exchange rate and income on tourism, and employ an error correction model to analyse the short-run effects. The empirical results suggest that income is the most significant variable in explaining tourism TB in the long run. The exchange rate and foreign income positively affect the TB, while domestic income negatively influences it. In the short-run, however, domestic income is the only significant factor. The authors also find no evidence of a J-curve effect in the Turkish tourism TB. These findings are robust to using nominal values.","[Akay, Gokhan H.; Cifter, Atilla] Istanbul Kemerburgaz Univ, Istanbul, Turkey; [Teke, Ozdemir] Yildiz Tech Univ, Istanbul, Turkey",Altinbas University; Yildiz Technical University,"Akay, GH (通讯作者)，Istanbul Kemerburgaz Univ, Dept Int Trade, IIBF Mahmutbey Dilmenler Cad 26 Bagcilar, TR-34217 Istanbul, Turkey.",gokhan.akay@kemerburgaz.edu.tr,"Akay, Gokhan/AAI-2289-2019","Cifter, Atilla/0000-0002-4365-742X",,,,,19,8,9,3,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The authors analyze the impact of such changes on labor market outcomes of program participants using data for the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) participants. The authors find that the demand for TAA services increases substantially when local unemployment increases. A 5% to 10% increase in unemployment raises training enrollment through the TAA program by nearly 13 percentage points and increases participation duration by more than 9 weeks. Our results do not support the concern that a sudden rise in the demand for AJC services might deteriorate the quality of service delivery and outcomes. In fact, although increases in local unemployment are generally harmful to displaced workers, occupational training during this time is effective at reducing the size of wage loss by at least 46%, resulting in a 3.4% average increase for wage replacement rates.","[Barnette, Justin; Park, Jooyoun] Kent State Univ, Econ, Kent, OH 44242 USA",University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Kent; Kent State University Salem,"Park, J (通讯作者)，Kent State Univ, Dept Econ, Coll Business, Kent, OH 44242 USA.",jpark8@kent.edu,,,,,,,17,2,3,0,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

That support, and hence the existence of such lifeline services, is often questioned by stakeholders and policy makers. While the value of these services is high to the passengers and businesses that are located in regional, rural and remote areas, there is only anecdotal and no robust evidence available on the value of such services to people who live in metropolitan areas. This paper applies mixed logit choice models to a large sample of the Sydney metropolitan area to establish, for a first time, empirical evidence on the value of travel time savings (VTTS) and the willingness to pay for regional air services. While car is the most preferred option for regional travel (chosen most), we find a median willingness to pay of $99 per hour for leisure travel via plane and $153 per hour for business travel. Additional analysis on VTTs for different modes across leisure versus business travel is also conducted, providing for a more detailed understanding of each traveller type and willingness to pay differences between the various groups. The findings are of substantial value to regional airlines, airports, regulators, funding bodies and policy makers as they show that regional aviation is not only invaluable to the regions but also of high value to residents and business travellers residing in metropolitan areas.

This should mean that LNG and oil prices are cointegrated. However, statistical evidence for cointegration using Japanese data is not strong. To resolve this puzzle, I examine 16 Japanese, South Korean, Taiwanese, and Spanish LNG import price series and allow for multiple, unknown structural breaks in the relationship to oil prices. This resolves the puzzle, and I provide estimates for the timing of breaks and the underlying average pricing terms. I relate these to count, volume, and duration data on long-term contracts and discuss how to interpret econometric estimates in light of contract data. This paper complements existing work on global gas market integration, which largely ignores how discrete changes in oil-indexed long-term contracts will affect empirical relationships.","[Agerton, Mark] Rice Univ, Dept Econ, MS-22,6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Agerton, Mark] Rice Univ, James A Baker Inst Publ Policy 3, Houston, TX 77251 USA",Rice University; Rice University,"Agerton, M (通讯作者)，Rice Univ, Dept Econ, MS-22,6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",magerton@rice.edu,,"Agerton, Mark/0000-0002-7225-4697",Center for Energy Studies at Rice University's James A.

My-AHA proposes a holistic view of age-related frailty, comprising frailty across interrelated domains of: cognition, physical function, mood, social isolation and sleep. Age-related frailty represents a major burden to older adults and social and health care systems. Early detection and intervention are crucial in sustaining active and healthy ageing (AHA) and slowing or reversing further decline. The main aim of My-AHA is to reduce frailty risk in older adults at risk of becoming frail by improving physical activity and cognitive function, psychological state, social resources, nutrition, sleep and overall well-being. It will empower older citizens to better manage their own health, resulting in healthcare cost savings. My-AHA will use state-of-the-art analytical concepts to provide new ways of health monitoring and disease prevention through individualized profiling and personalized recommendations, feedback and support. An ICT-based platform will detect defined risks in the frailty domains early and accurately via non-stigmatising embedded sensors and data readily available in the daily living environment of older adults. When risk is detected, My-AHA will provide individually tailored ICT-based interventions with a scientific evidence base of efficacy, including vetted interventions from established providers of medical and AHA support. These interventions will be deployed in a manner designed to motivate users to participate in exercise, cognitively stimulating games and social networking to achieve long-term behavioural change, sustained by continued end user engagement with My-AHA. By this, different platforms (Smart Companion, iStoppFalls, etc.) will be connected by the My-AHA Middleware and combine information and data from different sources with a decision support system for choosing the personal interventions. The My-AHA platform will be tested in a multi-centre randomized controlled trial involving centres across Europe, Japan, South Korea and Australia. The project is currently in Alpha phase testing. Following alpha wave testing, the RCT will commence including feasibility and manageability testing of the pre-post design. During the first project year, interventions were defined and analysed for their proven effectiveness and their chance for combination. Selection of the platforms has been completed with middleware development approaching completion. The prototype setup has been deployed with the first participants in the Alpha Wave. During this time, experience on the new data protection regulation for EU countries was gained as well as for business opportunities for the developed interventions and results of the trial. This paper provides a short overview of the projects approach and current status.","[Aumayr, Georg] Johanniter Oesterreich Ausbildung & Forsch Gemein, Vienna, Austria",,"Aumayr, G (通讯作者)，Johanniter Oesterreich Ausbildung & Forsch Gemein, Vienna, Austria.",georg.aumayr@johanniter.at,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,9,TRAUNER VERLAG,LINZ,"KOGLSTR 14, 4020 LINZ, AUSTRIA",,,978-3-99062-119-6,SCHRIFTEN INFORMATIK,,,2017,46.0,,,,,,211,216,,,,,,6,Economics; Information Science & Library Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Information Science & Library Science,BJ2HL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000419365600024,0

In highly interconnected and digitalised environments, non-democratic states need to legitimise their policies in order to maintain and cultivate the support of their populations. While democracies are more likely to pursue legitimation through enhanced policy performance, authoritarian states are likely to legitimise their actions through repression and control mechanisms: information control, enhancement of popular sentiments, and narrative shaping. The article elucidates these arguments by focusing on Russia's actions in three specific contexts, namely Crimea's annexation, the destruction of sanctioned food products, and military involvement in the Syrian crisis.","[Babayan, Nelli] Foreign Policy Res Inst, 1528 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19102 USA; [Babayan, Nelli] Free Univ Berlin, Ihnestr 22, D-14195 Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin,"Babayan, N (通讯作者)，Foreign Policy Res Inst, 1528 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19102 USA.;Babayan, N (通讯作者)，Free Univ Berlin, Ihnestr 22, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",nelli.babayan@fu-berlin.de,,,,,,,84,4,4,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2017,69.0,7,,,,,1090,1105,,10.1080/09668136.2017.1369495,0.0,,,16,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,FL1AT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413946100005,0

Many of the constructs of this market model are widely used in investment, but the simple assumptions of a constant beta coefficient and variance in the original market model are not convincing from the empirical viewpoint. In this paper we propose a general asymmetric market model embedding both the leverage effect of market news and the previous return to express the instability of beta and the error with heteroskedasticity to capture the time-varying conditional variance. Because extreme values occur quite frequently in financial markets, the quantile regression is employed to explore the different behaviors in the market beta and lagged autoregressive effect for different quantile levels. We analyze fifteen stocks, which are heavily traded in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, to demonstrate the empirical performance of our methodology. The evidence indicates that each market beta and impact of negative news vary with different quantile levels, capturing different states of market conditions.","[Chen, Cathy W. S.; Nguyen, Nga T.

The model generates new implications related to acquiring firms' leverage dynamics along with method of payment choice. Specifically, the model indicates that the post-merger integration duration is negatively associated with the market leverage of newly-merged firms at the time of merger completion and during the integration period. Further, acquirer managers are more likely to use equity to finance amerger when the integration duration is likely to be lengthy.

Yet there is no consensus on which direction causality operates between these two phenomena. This impasse has been widened by the lack of attention paid to the role of statecraft strategies in mediating possible causal mechanisms. This article contributes to rectifying this shortcoming by focusing on the governance advantages granted to states through financial deregulation. By presenting archival evidence on Britain's 1971 Competition and Credit Control deregulation, this article lends support to financialisation accounts that argue that weaknesses in the productive economy spurred financial expansion, yet it also indicates that the state's desire for depoliticised forms of governance played a crucial role in mediating this relationship. This further suggests that International Political Economy should focus on the strategic manner in which states relate to markets.","[Copley, Jack] Univ Warwick, Polit & Int Studies, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Copley, J (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Polit & Int Studies, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",j.d.copley@warwick.ac.uk,,"Copley, Jack/0000-0002-0113-5877",Economic and Social Research Council [1501603]; Economic and Social Research Council [1501603] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"I would like to thank Matthew Watson, Ben Clift, Maria Eugenia Giraudo, Chris Rogers and the anonymous referees for their very insightful advice.

In other words, the value decision practice of enterprise capital structure is difficult to gage the financial value contributing degree towards relationship capital, customer capital and reputational capital. However, its result is directly related to the noise and capital structure puzzle of the financial value contributing degree of recessive financial capital, such as the relationship capital, customer capital and reputational capital.

However, there are indications that every knowledge has both tacit and explicit elements that cannot exist one without the other-they are complementary and create synergy for the knowledge management. The aim of this paper is to explore relevance of knowledge distinction between the tacit and explicit knowledge for technology transfer purposes. Brief review of literature, draft discussion, and one-on-one interviews were performed in order to find the answer to the research question: Does distinction between tacit and explicit knowledge have place in the exploring of knowledge for technology transfer purposes? Content analysis was performed to process qualitative data that were collected through interviews. The research results show that the distinction between tacit and explicit knowledge is not suitable for technology transfer purposes. Knowledge consists of both tacit and explicit components. There is also an explanation for many contradictions in knowledge management studies exploring knowledge explicitness in this paper. The paper provides a better understanding of the issues related to tacit versus explicit knowledge dichotomy within technology transfer.

It is shown that the trade policies play a crucial role in the shape of the competitive structure in the export market. In fact, within a network industry, under free trade, the intensity of the consumption externalities works to deter entry for medium network effects; however, for sufficiently intense network effects, the entry of a firm is always favoured. On the other hand, under strategic trade policy, a single exporter monopoly may be more often the rule, and for sizable network effects, the persistence of a monopolistic market is always preserved. In line with the early intuitions of the strategic trade policy theorists, this means that such an activism is strongly effective in protecting one's own monopoly firm when network industries are considered. However, those policies show a rather interesting and somewhat paradoxical result for exporter countries jointly considered. In fact, by trying to sustain the profitability of their exporters, countries induce not only a reduction of their social welfare at equilibrium (the well-known prisoner's dilemma situation) in the short run, but also in the long run. Through the effects on the design of the market structure, such countries may obtain a sizable further reduction (resp. further increase) of their social welfares, depending on whether the product variant of the entrant is slightly or highly differentiated.","[Fanti, Luciano] Univ Pisa, Dept Econ & Management, Pisa, Italy; [Buccella, Domenico] Kozminski Univ, Dept Econ, Warsaw, Poland",University of Pisa; Kozminski University,"Fanti, L (通讯作者)，Univ Pisa, Dept Econ & Management, Pisa, Italy.",luciano.fanti@unipi.it; buccella@kozminski.edu.pl,"Buccella, Domenico/F-8981-2019","Buccella, Domenico/0000-0002-9594-0630",,,,,22,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,48,59,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8CX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427987300006,0

In both Gazeta and Lenta, editorial changes were accompanied by a move away from core news areas such as domestic and international politics, toward lifestyle and human interest subjects.

But is his popularity real, or are respondents lying to pollsters? We conducted a series of list experiments in early 2015 to estimate support for Putin while allowing respondents to maintain ambiguity about whether they personally do so. Our estimates suggest support for Putin of approximately 80%, which is within 10 percentage points of that implied by direct questioning. We find little evidence that these estimates are positively biased due to the presence of floor effects. In contrast, our analysis of placebo experiments suggests that there may be a small negative bias due to artificial deflation. We conclude that Putin's approval ratings largely reflect the attitudes of Russian citizens.","[Frye, Timothy] Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Gehlbach, Scott] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Polit Sci, Madison, WI USA; [Marquardt, Kyle L.] Univ Gothenburg, V Dem Inst, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Reuter, Ora John] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Polit Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Frye, Timothy; Reuter, Ora John] Natl Res Univ, Int Ctr Study Inst & Dev, Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia",Columbia University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Gothenburg; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Frye, T (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA.;Frye, T (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ, Int Ctr Study Inst & Dev, Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia.",tmf2@columbia.edu,"Frye, Timothy/T-2968-2019; Reuter, Ora John/V-3170-2019; Marquardt, Kyle Lohse/W-7081-2019","Marquardt, Kyle Lohse/0000-0003-2043-5880; Frye, Timothy/0000-0001-8633-2046",National Science Foundation [SES 13424291]; Government of the Russian Federation for the implementation of the Global Competitiveness Program,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Government of the Russian Federation for the implementation of the Global Competitiveness Program,This work was supported by the National Science Foundation [grant number SES 13424291].

The solution need not exist or it is not unique or it is unstable. All these bad properties of a mathematical model reflect the complexity of the real problem we are to solve. Such difficult problems are called ill-posed problems. It is not surprising that we also meet these problems in time series analysis. In this area the ill-posedness is demonstrated by the non-stationarity of a stochastic process. In economics it is well-known that the time series of logaritms of GDP or the price of overall market portfolio are almost certainly non-stationary.

This structural move is radically distinct from the very framework which inspired the tenets of early Latin American structuralist thought in the post-war period. Whereas seminal structuralism neglected the role of social policy, Brazilian social developmentalism reframed it to broaden access to consumer credit and other financial services, such as insurances. In this new financialised framework, social policy has been used to underwrite a financial inclusion model that overturned classic tenets of social policy. As a result, not only household debt has abruptly escalated, but also social insurance and welfare benefits have been partially absorbed as financial rents, deepening economic insecurity and social vulnerability.","[Lavinas, Lena] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Econ, Welf Econ, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,"Lavinas, L (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Econ, Ave Pasteur 240, BR-21941901 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",lenalavinas@gmail.com,,,Centro Nacional de Pesquisa Cientifica (CNPQ),Centro Nacional de Pesquisa Cientifica (CNPQ)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"I am also most grateful to Centro Nacional de Pesquisa Cientifica (CNPQ), whose research grant has been crucial for my research project on the Financialisation of Social Policies.",,48,14,17,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Every employee is interested in its value. It is interesting to compare one's own wages with those of others, or with the effects of other economic changes. Is my real wage rising or falling? Can I buy more this year than last year? Comparison with other countries is also interesting. For these reasons, we will try in this article to compare wages and their development during the most recent few years in the Czech Republic and Poland. Because each country has a different currency and inflation rate, we will have to convert the wages to the same currency (EUR) for the same periods, and adjust our data to eliminate the inflation. We will also be interested in the time evolution.

The cross-sectional results provide strong evidence that real estate firms are more likely to take a smaller stake in larger assets when investing abroad. The penchant for large assets holds when controlling for economic activity, real estate investment opportunities, depth and sophistication of the capital markets, investor protection and the legal framework, administrative burdens and regulatory limitations, and the socio-cultural and political environment at both the property nation and headquarter nation levels. In general, foreign ownership is less likely with industrial, office, retail, and self-storage properties.

Therefore, the following research problem has been formulated: What features and behaviours, according to the students of business fields, are characteristic for men and women in management positions. The problem has been found to be cognitively interesting and significant in the perspective of the practice of management since the attitudes of managers in business relations with other managers as well as human resources policy they lead (especially the policy of promotion) are often conditioned by their beliefs about management predispositions of the representatives of a given gender. For this reason, it is worth studying the behaviours, features and inclinations attributed to men and women as typical for the representatives of their gender since they can become the foundations of mental barriers that significantly hinder effective relations with business partners and co-workers. The article presents the results of a questionnaire research carried out among 420 students of business fields: from Poland (Bialystok University of Technology) and from Ukraine (Poltava National Technical Yuri Kondratyuk University), who, due to the education they are getting, can be treated as future managers in business and public entities. The studies are also important from the perspective of economic co-operation between both countries.

The authors use the method of time rows analysis to analyze the sense, dynamics, and global consequences of entrepreneurial activity crisis by the example of the financial crisis that started in 2008 on the basis of experience of the USA, Germany, Japan, Russia, and the global economy on the whole. The authors determine and analyze existing approaches to the global crisis management with the help of methods of systematization, classification, and comparative analysis and evaluate their effectiveness by the example of modern Russia at the macro-level with the help of the proprietary method. Three levels of the global crisis management are distinguished: microlevel, at which certain enterprises take measures for preparation for future crises and increase of sustainability of business to influence the global economic recession; macro-level, within which certain countries realize state policy on protection of domestic entrepreneurship from the influence of global crisis; and global level, at which efforts of groups of countries and international organizations are aimed at stabilization of international economic situation. As a result of the research, the authors came to the conclusion that diversification approach is the most effective one, which is followed by insurance and political approach; however, effectiveness of these approaches is rather low. As a perspective direction of increase of effectiveness of global crisis management of entrepreneurial activities in the context of the countries' orientation at building postindustrial economy, this work offers an innovation-oriented model.","[Natsubidze, Alexander S.] Moscow Int Acad, Moscow, Russia; [Likholetov, Evgeny A.; Malofeev, Alexander V.] Volgograd State Agr Univ, Volgograd, Russia; [Zabaznova, Tatiana A.; Patsyuk, Elena V.] Volgograd State Univ Architecture & Civil Engn, Mikhaylovka, Russia",Volgograd State Agrarian University,"Natsubidze, AS (通讯作者)，Moscow Int Acad, Moscow, Russia.",nacubidze28@mail.ru; deisi79@mail.ru; malofeev_1981@mail.ru,,,,,,,17,3,3,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",1431-1933,,978-3-319-60696-5; 978-3-319-60695-8,CONTRIB ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,515,521,,10.1007/978-3-319-60696-5_65,0.0,,,7,Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ5OF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426114200065,0

I analyze speech acts to show how moves to securitize SMV spread from the political fringe to the center of power, and from individual sectors to the strategic level. This moral turn in Russian politics is not merely a superficial attempt of the elite to distract the masses and rally the conservative electorate. The securitization of SMV has wider implications: It is, in the most direct way, the regime's way of preventing a color revolution. By introducing a state of siege to the sphere of fundamental moral values, this securitization aids the construction of a national identity that is incompatible with basic human rights. An existential threat is constructed in order to justify extraordinary measures and establish a new social contract in which modernization is sacrificed at the altar of security.","[Ostbo, Jardar] Univ Oslo, NEPORUS Project, Fac Humanities, Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Ostbo, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, NEPORUS Project, Fac Humanities, Oslo, Norway.",j.n.ostbo@ilos.uio.no,,"Ostbo, Jardar Nuland/0000-0001-5132-5938",Norwegian Research Council [228205],Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),This work was supported by the Norwegian Research Council under [grant number 228205].,,75,49,52,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

Critics argue that heightened labour flexibility exacerbates inequality without expanding employment. From this perspective, precarious employment and inequality are remedied by strengthening labour's bargaining power. Chile's maintenance of flexible labour reforms adopted during the dictatorship make it appropriate for evaluating these competing perspectives. Based on flexibility proponents' predictions, we should expect increased formal sector employment over time, particularly among the least skilled Chilean workers, as well as reduced wage inequality. Yet, the rate of unemployment among least skilled workers in Chile remains essentially unchanged since the democratic transition as does income inequality. These conditions persist despite a high degree of labour market flexibility. Thus, Chile's continued adherence to a flexibilised labour market should be understood not in terms of its capacity to reduce inequality or generate employment. Rather, it should be understood as the product of several interrelated factors: (1) the business sector's ability to protect its interests; (2) the Concertacion's conscious limitation of threats to the business sector's interests and (3) the weakness of organised labour, resulting from the perpetuation of the Pinochet-era labour regime.","[Posner, Paul W.] Clark Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Worcester, MA 01610 USA",Clark University,"Posner, PW (通讯作者)，Clark Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.",pposner@clarku.edu,,,,,,,65,9,9,2,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The reasons for establishing close cooperation as part of a regional union included: geographical proximity, similar historical backgrounds and compatible foreign policy goals. In the early 1990s, joining the European Union and NATO were considered top priorities. Initially, the political and economic initiative was launched by three countries: Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Hungary. Since the 1993 division of Czechoslovakia into the Czech Republic and Slovakia, the group has consisted of four countries. The name of the organisation refers to the place of meeting of presidents of Poland and Czechoslovakia and the prime minister of Hungary - a castle in Visegrad, located north of Budapest. The event took place on 15th February 1991. In October of the same year, at a summit of prime ministers in Krakow, it was agreed that the cooperation would cover areas such as foreign policy, economy, transport, environmental protection and science. After the success of the Visegrad Four's members in integrating with the European Union and NATO, the group set new directions for itself. Cooperation with the closest neighbours, i.e. Ukraine, Croatia, Slovenia, Lithuania, and Austria, was extended. Contacts were also established with institutions of Western European states, including the Benelux and the Nordic Council states. However, it seems that the most important goal of Visegrad Group today is to have a more significant and consistent influence on the policy of the European Union. In particular, this includes opposing authoritarian inclinations of the German and French politicians to force their points of view on others. Successes in this respect have made V4 a permanent and important driver of European policy and an effective instrument of regional policy of Central European states.","[Przygoda, Miroslaw] Univ Warsaw, Fac Management, Ul Szturmowa 1-3, PL-02678 Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Przygoda, M (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Management, Ul Szturmowa 1-3, PL-02678 Warsaw, Poland.",miroslawprzygoda@wp.pl,,,,,,,20,1,1,1,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,274,288,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8CX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427987300028,0

The emphasis is put on fortified and former military heritage as a specific category of a common European heritage, which is still waiting for an integrated approach forits proper protection and valorization, especiallyin the Central Europe and SEE region. As a living witness to the dramatic history- of conflicts between European nations, fortified heritage is today often neglected and abandoned, waiting for an opportunity for a new life and function.

This does not only put a major strain on European resources, but puts at risk the health and lives of the people being trafficked or smuggled. Furthermore, security personnel are unable to cope with the high influx of people illegally entering Europe. There is thus a current demand for rapid analytical systems that can detect people who are hidden or locked in special containers. The key objective of the DHS-AS project is the development of a portable device for the rapid detection of volatile chemicals that can provide a chemical fingerprint for the presence of humans. That fingerprint combined with an infrared camera to look for the heat signature of the presence of humans provides an extremely powerful technology to combat the illegal movement of people. This detection of volatiles coming from humans is similar to the way a dog detects the presence of buried people. Our planned sensor system will be trained to recognize humans by detecting trace gases released from skin, sweat, and urine or in breath. The backbone of the system we are proposing to achieve this is an aspiratory ion mobility spectrometer. Preliminary measurements show that this instrument has sufficient sensitivity for detecting volatiles coming from humans. To enhance selectivity, a newly developed aldehyde sensor will be integrated, which will be characterized and tested with gas mixtures. The prototype instrument will then be trained to detect the presence of humans through trials with volunteers to provide human samples that contain the volatiles of interest (from urine, breath, sweat, etc.) Measurements of the surrounding air, containing air pollutants and fragrances, will be also undertaken to understand the effects of confounding factors. The prototype instrument will be validated in field trials with the partners, namely the Austrian Federal Ministry of Defense and Sports, the Austrian Ministry of Interior and Johanniter Unfall-Hilfe. The instrument will be designed in such way that allows for connectivity to currently used detection systems.","[Ruzsanyi, Veronika; Wiesenhofer, Helmut; Ager, Clemens; Mayhew, Cristopher] Univ Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria",University of Innsbruck,"Ruzsanyi, V (通讯作者)，Univ Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.",veronika.ruzsanyi@uibk.ac.at,,"Ager, Clemens/0000-0003-3592-2059; Mayhew, Chris/0000-0002-5014-7241",,,,,12,0,0,0,6,TRAUNER VERLAG,LINZ,"KOGLSTR 14, 4020 LINZ, AUSTRIA",,,978-3-99062-119-6,SCHRIFTEN INFORMATIK,,,2017,46.0,,,,,,127,133,,,,,,7,Economics; Information Science & Library Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Information Science & Library Science,BJ2HL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000419365600014,0

Since 2009 the Azerbaijani leadership has adopted a set of laws and policy regulations designed to restrain Islamism and Islamic activism. In spite of heavy-handed state control and legal restrictions, there has been a visible increase of religiosity within Azerbaijani society, particularly amongst religious organisations and parties. The article aims to decode the underlying reasons behind the persistent upsurge of religiosity in Azerbaijan and further our understanding of the social-political implications of this trend. The article also argues that, since restrictions were imposed on religious expression in 2009, the revival of Islam in Azerbaijan has become much more visible while serving as an alternative avenue for the emergence of social movements within the country.","[Ter-Matevosyan, Vahram; Minasyan, Nelli] Amer Univ Armenia, 40 Baghramyan Ave, Yerevan 0019, Armenia",,"Ter-Matevosyan, V (通讯作者)，Amer Univ Armenia, 40 Baghramyan Ave, Yerevan 0019, Armenia.",termatevosyan@aua.am,"Ter-Matevosyan, Vahram/M-4267-2017","Ter-Matevosyan, Vahram/0000-0002-2212-0391; Minasyan, Nelli/0000-0002-7795-7340",,,,,69,3,3,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2017,69.0,5,,,,,819,837,,10.1080/09668136.2017.1333086,0.0,,,19,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,FB8IO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406382900006,0

Working capital is a buffer that protects the company against the loss of liquidity. It should be positive for the safety of the operation of businesses. However, its too high the level means unnecessary costs that are incurred by the company. Therefore, the determination of the optimal level of net working capital has a large impact on the profitability of the company and its capabilities of current liabilities regulation. Bankruptcies of large enterprises, payment backlogs and increasing competition in the markets makes it difficult to define a strategy of working capital which will let managers determine the optimal level of safety in order to keep safety in the market. In addition, the management process of net working capital hinders the operation of enterprises in the purchasing groups. The specificity of the functioning of purchasing groups is based on joint purchasing. Therefore, common operation has a large impact on the management of various elements which shape the level of net working capital, i.e. inventories, receivables and short-term and long-term liabilities The aim of this paper is to analyze the level of net working capital in 32 commercial companies operating in the Polish purchasing organizations. To perform the analysis the financial data derived from financial statements for 2013-2015 were analyzed. For the research the selected financial indices were applied and a preliminary financial analysis of the selected items was conducted. The analysis is expected to provide information if the units tested have an excess or deficiency of the optimal size of net working capital. Research also aims to answer what management strategies of working capital the commercial enterprises pursue, and in which areas of management of net working capital the managers of enterprises should introduce measures leading to optimize the level of working capital.","[Zimon, Grzegorz] Rzeszow Univ Technol, Rzeszow, Poland",Rzeszow University of Technology,"Zimon, G (通讯作者)，Rzeszow Univ Technol, Rzeszow, Poland.",gzimon@prz.edu.pl,"Zimon, Grzegorz/V-5509-2018","Zimon, Grzegorz/0000-0002-2040-4438",,,,,17,3,3,1,5,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,531,537,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8SX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428763000055,0

The government controls the degree of reliability of the entire transportation system by combining two types of infrastructure, namely, unstable infrastructure, whose capacity decreases when a disaster occurs, and stable infrastructure, whose capacity is constant regardless of the occurrence of disaster. Under the assumption of risk-averse preferences of households, the theorem of cost recovery does not hold even if the congestion toll is controlled in a completely flexible manner, given any incidents. The optimally designed unstable (stable) infrastructure is (not) cost recoverable because the benefit of investment mitigating the risk premium in social welfare is not covered by the revenue of the congestion toll. We also show that if the transportation cost is specified by a linear function, The entire transportation infrastructure is not cost recoverable, if price elasticity of transport demand is less than one, as many empirical studies have shown.","[Itoh, Ryo] Univ Tohoku, Aoba Ku, Aramaki Aza Aoba 6-3-09, Sendai, Miyagi 4678579, Japan",Tohoku University,"Itoh, R (通讯作者)，Univ Tohoku, Aoba Ku, Aramaki Aza Aoba 6-3-09, Sendai, Miyagi 4678579, Japan.",itoh@se.is.tohoku.ac.jp,,,"JSPS [24730216, 516420007]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24730216] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The author expresses his heartfelt gratitude to Se-il Mun, Achim Czeny, Masamitsu Onishi, Oliver Feng Yeu SHYR, Anming Zhang, and participants of the Urban Economic Workshop in Kyoto University, the 4th Asian seminar in Regional Science, the 61st North American Regional Science Council, the ITEA conference in Barcelona for their helpful comments.

Why do voters support transit? We use a survey-framing experiment (n?=?1200) to evaluate the persuasive effects of common arguments for public transit. We study how different arguments change not just peoples attitudes toward transit, but also their willingness to become politically active on its behalf. Our findings are twofold. First, arguments that transit will reduce congestion or improve environmental outcomes (specifically, mitigate climate change) make people more supportive of public transportation, while arguments about making travel more convenient, helping the poor, or satisfying other peoples desire for transit do not. Second, congestion-based arguments are self-undermining with respect to activism: they make people more likely to support transit, but less likely to become activists for it. Congestion-based arguments are persuasive because they remind people of wasted time, but in reminding people of time-scarcity they reduce peoples willingness to become involved. Overall, our results suggest that the common reasons people use transit are not powerful political arguments for supporting it, and that one powerful political argument for supporting it, in addition to being inaccurate, might undermine efforts to organize on its behalf.","[Manville, Michael] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Urban Planning, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Levine, Adam Seth] Cornell Univ, Dept Govt, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Cornell University,"Manville, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Urban Planning, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",mmanvill@ucla.edu; asl22@cornell.edu,,,Cornell University's Institute for the Social Sciences,Cornell University's Institute for the Social Sciences,We thank Cornell University's Institute for the Social Sciences for generous funding.,,57,12,13,0,8,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Using 26 different Chinese public transport operators in 13 cities across China for the period 2008-2014 as research objects, we integrate public transport industry regulations, and transport operation and passenger requirements to construct an evaluation indicator system based on satisfaction and efficiency. We evaluate comprehensive effectiveness based on a combined evaluation method (CEM) consisting of information entropy theory and data envelopment analysis (DEA), and then take into consideration the truncated regression model to assess the effects between them. Conclusions drawn from the study are summarized as follows: (1) The effects of organizational forms on the comprehensive effectiveness of public transport services are confirmed. (2) Public transport services franchised to public ownership offer higher comprehensive effectiveness than those franchised to private ownership and mixed ownership. (3) Public transport services regulated by gross cost contracts incite more comprehensive effectiveness than those regulated by net cost contracts and management contracts.","[Zhang, Chunqin; Liu, Yong; Yu, Feng] Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Architecture, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Guangnian] Shanghai Maritime Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China",Zhejiang Sci-Tech University; Shanghai Maritime University,"Zhang, CQ; Yu, F (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Architecture, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",cqzhang@zstu.edu.cn; jhly1007@sjtu.edu.cn; pokfulam@zstu.edu.cn,", 张春勤/ABE-1367-2020","zhang, chunqin/0000-0001-5257-1268; Liu, Yong/0000-0003-0172-9867","Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, China [LQ18E080010]; Philosophy and Social Science Project of Zhejiang Province, China [19NDQN361YB]; MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences [17YJCZH124]","Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, China(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); Philosophy and Social Science Project of Zhejiang Province, China; MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences","The authors would like to thank the respondents at each of the 13 cities and the staff at the 26 public transport operators in China for providing data and information that were essential for this work.

Flows on existing cross-border lines are often assessed as suboptimal, which may be due to the light regulation that often prevails in these cases. This paper studies the impact of market power on HVDC interconnections as a determinant of imperfect arbitrage. We assess the impact of Physical Transmission Rights (PTRs) allocation on the management of an HVDC interconnection between a thermal and a hydroelectricity market, assuming dynamic water management. We use a two-stage game formulated as an Equilibrium Problem with Equilibrium Constraints (EPEC) to model the strategic trade between the New York (US) and Quebec (Canada) systems. The numerical model is calibrated with public data. We find that although the interconnection can create wealth, a high concentration of PTRs can destroy value because of dumping strategies. The impact of trade on local price levels may be of concern and calls for the functional unbundling of traders and generators.","[Debia, Sebastien] Gerad, HEC Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Pineau, Pierre-Olivier] HEC Montreal, Chair Energy Sect Management, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal,"Debia, S (通讯作者)，Gerad, HEC Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",sebastien.debia@hec.ca; david.benatia@ensae.fr; pierre-olivier.pineau@hec.ca,,,HEC Montreal's Chair in Energy Sector Management,HEC Montreal's Chair in Energy Sector Management,The authors wish to thank Professor Ben Hobbs for his suggestions and his invitation to work on this research at John Hopkins University.

Four EMR instruments combined to revolutionize the sector; stimulating unprecedented technological and structural change. Competitive auctions for both firm capacity and renewable energy have seen prices far lower than predicted and the entry of unexpected new technologies. A carbon price floor displaced coal, whose share fell from 46% in 1995 to 7% in 2017, halving CO2. Renewables grew from under 4% in 2008 to 22% by 2017, projected at 30+% by 2020 despite a political ban on onshore wind.

The author finds that full-time manufacturing workers with a certification or license earn close to $200 more in median weekly earnings compared to those without. However, this does not account for differences in pay that are associated with worker endowments, such as education and gender. A Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition is used to distinguish the portion of the earnings gap that is attributable to the credential from the portion associated with endowments. Endowments explain 62% of the total earnings gap, meaning that the actual returns to a certification or license are closer to $70 per week. The author also finds that workers with no high school or college education receive a relatively larger increase in weekly earnings, compared to those with more advanced degrees.","[Renski, Henry] Univ Massachusetts, Reg Planning, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Renski, H (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Landscape Architecture & Reg Planning, 210 Design Bldg,551 North Pleasant St, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",hrenski@umass.edu,,,,,,,66,1,2,2,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

There is little evidence to show that branching increased the stability of Australian banking. During the 1893 crisis, banks with more extensive branch networks, particularly those that had rapidly expanded their networks during the long boom of 1866-89, were more likely to suspend payments. However, it is shown that branching increased the availability of capital and provision of banking services in rural areas. This occurred because, unlike unit banks, which were tied to a specific location, branch banks could internally reallocate capital from urban to rural regions at low cost.","[Seltzer, Andrew J.] Royal Holloway Univ London, London Sch Econ, Egham, Surrey, England; [Seltzer, Andrew J.] Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Econ Hist, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Seltzer, Andrew J.] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Royal Holloway University London; Australian National University; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Seltzer, AJ (通讯作者)，Royal Holloway Univ London, London Sch Econ, Egham, Surrey, England.;Seltzer, AJ (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Econ Hist, Canberra, ACT, Australia.;Seltzer, AJ (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.",A.Seltzer@rhul.ac.uk,,,University of London Central Research Grant; Arthur Cole Grant in Aid,University of London Central Research Grant; Arthur Cole Grant in Aid,"I wish to thank David Choa and David Varney for research assistance and David Merrett for introducing me to the Union Bank data.

However, it is largely unknown what factors determine whether employers and employees adopt the bicycle-leasing program or not. In the case study, the authors analyzed relevant documents as well as interviewed 22 employer representatives and 22 employees and analyzed their responses to explore both the adoption drivers and barriers. Informed by Diffusion of Innovations Theory, categories of perceived innovation characteristics as well as categories that go beyond this conceptualization were identified. In particular, the study explored various facets in relation to relative advantage and complexity, providing insights into how benefit-and-cost trade-offs determine the perceived value of the concept as well as how difficulties in usability may either postpone or hinder the adoption of the concept. Categories relating to compatibility, trialability, and observability as well as additional categories such as involvement of key stakeholders (employer and employee level) and seasonality (employee level) were explored. The case study derives several policy and managerial implications that should help promote the adoption of company-bicycle leasing bicycles in particular and cycling as a means of active transportation in general.","[Synek, Stefan; Koenigstorfer, Joerg] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Sport & Hlth Managemen4, Georg Brauchle Ring 60-62, D-80992 Munich, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Koenigstorfer, J (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, Chair Sport & Hlth Managemen4, Georg Brauchle Ring 60-62, D-80992 Munich, Germany.",joerg.koenigstorfer@tum.de,"Koenigstorfer, Joerg/G-3338-2013",,,,,,109,4,4,1,16,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,1879-2375,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Regression analysis reveals that when A8 migrant workers first arrive in the UK, they record substantially lower absence than native workers, but that these migrant absence levels assimilate within two to four years.

To address this issue, we construct a game-theoretic model. A basic assumption underlying the model is that the airline maximizes its own profit whereas the HSR operator maximizes a weighted sum of profit and social welfare due to the government regulation. We assume a two-stage game in which the government sets the weight to maximize social welfare in the first stage and the HSR operator and the airline maximize their respective objective functions in the second stage. The central result from our model is that partial public regulation arises as a subgame perfect equilibrium unless the benefits to consumers from using the HSR are sufficiently large or sufficiently small compared to the benefits to consumers from using air transportation. The result provides a theoretical foundation for the public policies of joint investments by both governments and HSR operators in HSR networks in European and Asian countries. In addition, our results suggest that the optimal regulation by the government depends on the benefits for consumers using each mode of transport and the difference between the levels of benefits.","[Tsunoda, Yushi] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Business Adm, Nada Ku, 2-1 Rokkodai Cho, Kobe, Hyogo 65708501, Japan",Kobe University,"Tsunoda, Y (通讯作者)，Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Business Adm, Nada Ku, 2-1 Rokkodai Cho, Kobe, Hyogo 65708501, Japan.",143b012b@stu.kobe-u.ac.jp,"Tsunoda, Yushi/GSD-9984-2022","Tusnoda, Yushi/0000-0001-5202-5670",,,,,25,21,22,2,39,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Although such falls are more common for the elderly and increase the cost of medical care, they also reduce younger passengers' satisfaction for the service. This study investigates the differences between natural gait and that resulting from the bus environment. Twenty-nine regular bus users, between 20 and 80 years old, were invited to participate in a series of experiments. Their natural gait whilst walking on a flat surface was monitored in a static laboratory and was compared to their gait whilst walking on the lower deck of a moving bus. A medium level of acceleration (1.5 m/s(2)) was examined, which falls in the range of accelerations experienced by passengers on the real bus service in London. A new method of measuring and analysing gait in dynamic environments was established. Chi-square tests were conducted on measures of changes in gait (step type), which encloses important information about body balance, considering participants' age and gender and the bus acceleration. The statistical analysis has shown that as acceleration increases bus passengers use more three-peak steps, which denote that the entire foot is under pressure and in full contact with the ground, thus increasing balance. This is the first study investigating people's gait inside moving vehicles, hence the gait of healthy people was examined so that the differences in walking patterns would be unaffected by health-related conditions, and to increase understanding of the real challenges passengers experience during bus journeys. The presented methods and outcomes can be used to improve research around eliminating risk of falling for people with mobility difficulties.","[Xenia, Karekla; Nick, Tyler] UCL, Ctr Transport Studies, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London,"Xenia, K (通讯作者)，UCL, Ctr Transport Studies, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",x.karekla@ucl.ac.uk,,"Karekla, Xenia/0000-0001-7889-361X; Tyler, Nick/0000-0001-7079-1301",,,,,27,2,2,0,8,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Marx formulated this concept for the first time in Value, Price, and Profit (1865), and extrapolated upon it further in the first edition of the first volume of Capital (1867). It signified an appreciable alteration to Marx's original historical theory. Indeed, in his writings, preceding the publication of volume 1 of Capital, such as The Communist Manifesto or The German Ideology, Marx had presented a more straightforwardly linear conception of the evolution of human society, consisting of various stages, capitalism being the penultimate stage, and communism, the last. Within this framework, the most advanced nations, such as Great Britain and Germany, were assumed to be those closest to being on the pre-revolutionary cusp of realising socialism. However, from the publication of volume 1 of Capital onwards, Marx embraced a less deterministic conception of progress, focussing more than previously on economically backwards countries or societies at the margins (Anderson 2010) and envisaging for them possibilities for historical development that did not inevitably entail the sort of industrialisation that Great Britain had experienced. This was particularly true regarding Russia, where volume 1 of Capital was welcomed and discussed precisely in light of these questions, as has been underscored by many scholars, notably Shanin, Wada, White, and Stedman Jones.","[Eyguesier, Nicolas] GATE Lyon St Etienne, Maison Univ,10 Rue Trefilerie, F-42023 St Etienne, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; Universite de Bourgogne,"Eyguesier, N (通讯作者)，GATE Lyon St Etienne, Maison Univ,10 Rue Trefilerie, F-42023 St Etienne, France.",nicolas.eyguesier@univ-st-etienne.fr,,,,,,,35,2,2,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

This method is then applied to the analysis of export-market participation of 1451 Chinese firms between 2002 and 2006 in the prefecture-level city of Wenzhou in the province of Zhejiang. Empirical results show that two of the three forms of the hypothesized spatial autocorrelation are significant, namely the spatial lag for the dependent variable and the time-invariant firm-specific shocks, but not the time-variant shocks. Ignoring any of these significant spatial effects would lead to misspecification.","[Baltagi, Badi H.] Syracuse Univ, Dept Econ, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Baltagi, Badi H.] Syracuse Univ, Ctr Policy Res, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Egger, Peter H.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CESifo, GEP, CEPR, Zurich, Switzerland; [Kesina, Michaela] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland",Syracuse University; Syracuse University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Baltagi, BH (通讯作者)，Syracuse Univ, Dept Econ, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.;Baltagi, BH (通讯作者)，Syracuse Univ, Ctr Policy Res, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",bbaltagi@maxwell.syr.edu,,"Kesina, Michaela/0000-0002-3223-0973; Baltagi, Badi/0000-0003-0469-4479; Egger, Peter/0000-0002-0546-1207",,,,,38,3,4,0,10,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Similar issues in the context of spatial ARMA models for the disturbance of the regression, however, remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we discuss the problems of testing no spatial dependence in the disturbances against the alternative of spatial ARMA process incorporating the possible presence of spatial dependence in the dependent variable. The problems of conducting such a test are twofold. First, under the null hypothesis, the nuisance parameter is not identified, resulting in a singular information matrix (IM), which is a nonregular case in statistical inference. To take account of singular IM, we follow Davies (Biometrika 64(2):247-254, 1977; Biometrika 74(1):33-43, 1987) and propose a test procedure based on the supremum of the Rao score test statistic. Second, the possible presence of spatial lag dependence will have adverse effect on the performance of the test. Using the general test procedure of Bera and Yoon (Econom Theory 9:649-658, 1993) under local misspecification, we avoid the explicit estimation of the spatial autoregressive parameter. Thus our suggested tests are entirely based on ordinary least squares estimation. Tests suggested here can be viewed as a generalization of Anselin et al. (Reg Sci Urban Econ 26:77-104, 1996). We conduct Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the finite sample properties of the proposed tests. Simulation results show that our tests have good finite sample properties both in terms of size and power, compared to other tests in the literature. We also illustrate the applications of our tests through several data sets.","[Kao, Sheena Yu-Hsien; Bera, Anil K.] Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Champaign, IL 61820 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Bera, AK (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",kao21@uiuc.edu; abera@uiuc.edu,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,3,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

We first attempt a comparative economics of physical water transfer (between water-rich regions of eastern India to water-scarce regions of peninsular India) and the virtual water transfer alternative, considering the anecdotal evidence of various direct and indirect costs and benefits. The direct costs included economic cost of infrastructure, and various damage costs and transaction costs. The indirect costs covered economic, social and environmental costs. These cost components are several and are also more pronounced for physical water transfer. The benefits considered in the analysis included direct economic benefits, and various indirect benefits that are social, economic and environmental in nature. These benefits are several and also more pronounced for physical water transfer. The analysis showed that the net benefits of physical water transfer outweigh virtual water transfer.

In high private debt episodes, more government purchases even reduce the ratio of government debt to gross domestic product.

Prior studies, however, have largely overlooked the possibility that homeowners' self-reported house value may be more accurate due to private information. Previous research has also neglected the possibility that there could be discordance between what homeowners know and what they report as their house value. Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, this study examines how the choices of households reveal their knowledge of the true home value. In so doing, we find that that post move housing choices reveal that market estimates are accurate assessments of the housing value. Further, we find evidence that these underwater homeowners are aware of the actual house value, but are reporting them incorrectly. The results show that misreporting underwater homeowners are as likely to be late on their mortgage payments as homeowners that are reporting negative equity. Underwater homeowners' reluctance to admit their losses accords with the theory of loss aversion.","[Choi, Jung Hyun; Painter, Gary] USC Sol Price Sch Publ Policy, Ctr Social Innovat, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",,"Choi, JH (通讯作者)，USC Sol Price Sch Publ Policy, Ctr Social Innovat, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",choijung@usc.edu; gpainter@usc.edu,,,,,,,37,10,10,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,SUM,2018,46.0,2,,,,,487,520,,10.1111/1540-6229.12199,0.0,,,34,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,GI1ZR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000434169800006,0

In urban economics, this is the principal driver of the bid-rent gradient and is a key determinant of housing prices and land values. However, little is known about the causal effect of employment on housing prices, due to the problem of identification. This study presents the first causal estimates of employment changes on housing prices, both sales and rental. It does this by using a purpose-built spatially granular dataset of 1.4 million housing prices and FDI employment, covering Ireland 2007-2013. Identification rests on a combination of rich spatio-temporal variation due to the abundance of FDI in Ireland, a rich set of location controls and an inelastic housing supply in the period covered. The main results show that 1-2 years after 1000 extra jobs have been created, monthly rents in nearby properties will be between 0.5% and 1% higher. The effect on prices is at least 2% but less consistent across specifications. On average, net job creation in export-oriented FDI firms 2009-2013 added roughly 648 million to the stock of wealth of owner occupied real estate and 8 million to the stock of wealth of the rental sector. We also estimate that the aggregate effect of the stock of FDI jobs in 2013 on Irish housing prices is 440 million, or just over 1%.","[Agnew, Kerri; Lyons, Ronan C.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Econ, Dublin, Ireland; [Lyons, Ronan C.] London Sch Econ, Spatial Econ Res Ctr, London, England",Trinity College Dublin; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Agnew, K (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Econ, Dublin, Ireland.",kagnew@tcd.ie,,"Lyons, Ronan/0000-0001-5342-987X; Agnew, Kerri/0000-0003-0804-3868",,,,,33,17,17,4,45,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

We present a set of arguments addressing this question and test them on the case of the eurozone debt crisis. Distinguishing between actors' capacity and willingness to avoid defaults, we argue that the crisis was marked by a lack of capacity at the national level, and limited or uncertain willingness at the European level. Accordingly, we find that European-level efforts to reassure markets had considerably stronger effects than similar efforts at the national level. Furthermore, national efforts appear to have mattered the least in countries with the least capacity.

Using 4,780 detached housing sales between 1984 and 2002, this paper explores potential price effects of the seller's choice of marketing system. Specifically, a log price model is estimated based on transactions under both marketing systems acknowledging endogeneity in the choice of marketing system.

Unlike the majority of previous studies, the analysis is based on international panel data and includes several methodological novelties: By arguing that trade flows of dirty goods to less dirty sectors may also be influenced by changes in policy stringency, trade information on primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors are included. In order to clearly differentiate between dirty sectors and sectors with high pollution abatement costs, separate measures for pollution intensity and policy stringency are implemented. For the former, two intensities, namely the sectors' carbon dioxide emission intensity and the emission relevant energy intensity, are used to identify dirty sectors. For the latter, an internationally comparable, sector-specific measure of climate policy stringency is derived by applying a shadow price approach. Potential endogeneity between climate policy stringency, trade openness and the trade balance is controlled for by employing a dynamic panel generalized method of moments estimator. The results provide evidence for a pollution haven effect that is also present for non-dirty sectors, i.e., a sector's net imports rise in general if the sector faces an increase in climate policy stringency. Moreover, a stronger pollution haven effect regarding carbon dioxide intensive and emission relevant energy-intensive sectors is revealed. However, no support for the stronger pollution haven hypothesis can be found.","[Hille, Erik] HHL Leipzig Grad Sch Management, Jahnallee 59, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany",HHL Leipzig Graduate School of Management,"Hille, E (通讯作者)，HHL Leipzig Grad Sch Management, Jahnallee 59, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany.",Erik.Hille@hhl.de,,"Hille, Erik/0000-0002-2134-406X",German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF),German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"Financial support by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) in the framework of the project Climate Policy and the Growth Pattern of Nations is gratefully acknowledged.

This article employs the New Empirical Industrial Organization approach. The empirical analysis was based on the autoregressive distributed lag approach to cointegration and on the Toda-Yamamoto Granger causality tests to validate the standard version of the theoretical formulation of the standard Cournot model, and its theoretical extension, to encompass the hypothesis of the presence of bid interdependence for electricity quantities sold and bought in the Spanish electricity wholesale market. The results of cointegration and causality analysis reinforce the empirical results of the extended Cournot model with the inclusion of the two main bidding variables that solved the optimization problem of profit maximization for each of the four firms analyzed.","[Moutinho, Victor F.; Moreira, Antonio C.; Bento, Joao Paulo C.] Univ Aveiro, Dept Econ Management Ind Engn & Tourism, GOVCOPP, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal",Universidade de Aveiro,"Moreira, AC (通讯作者)，Univ Aveiro, Dept Econ Management Ind Engn & Tourism, GOVCOPP, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.",vmoutinho@ua.pt; amoreira@ua.pt; jpbento@ua.pt,"Bento, João/AFF-8431-2022; Moreira, Antonio/K-4259-2017","Bento, João/0000-0002-1145-9664; Moreira, Antonio/0000-0002-6613-8796; Moutinho, Victor/0000-0003-0811-9033",Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [UID/CPO/04058/2013] Funding Source: FCT,Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),,,40,3,3,2,14,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

In the experiment, subjects often start with diffuse uniform beliefs and update them in view of observations. However, the speed of updating is influenced by the strength of initial beliefs. An interesting result is that beliefs about the prior distribution of types are updated slower than posterior beliefs, which incorporate Senders' strategies. In the medium run, for some specifications of game parameters, this leads to outcomes being significantly different from the outcomes of the game in which a common prior is induced.

Craniofacial structures develop symmetrically under ideal circumstances; however, during periods of developmental stress random deviations from perfect symmetry, or FA, can occur. It is hypothesized that the UBC sample would represent individuals of a lower socioeconomic status (SES) who experienced higher stress levels during development, and that these individuals would consequently have higher levels of FA. Three-dimensional cranial landmarks were collected from 509 individuals representing the three resident groups. Geometric morphometric methods were used to calculate an FA score for each individual. The FA score provides a distance measure that is a scalar measure of the magnitude of FA in each individual. The results show that the difference in the means of the FA scores between UBCs and U.S. residents is 0.43(p = 0.02), with UBCs showing significantly higher levels of FA compared to U.S. residents. Moreover, Mexican residents' FA levels are intermediate between and not significantly different from the other two samples. These results suggest that levels of FA may prove useful for reconstructing individuals' social and economic circumstances, and that craniofacial asymmetry provides a suitable biological marker for analyzing differences in SES among different groups.

The prevailing view of most economic historians is that the southern planter elite was able to retain its relative status despite these shocks. Previous studies have been hampered, however, by limits on the ability to link individuals between census years, and scholars have been forced to focus on persistence within one or a few counties. Recent advances in electronic access to the Federal Census manuscripts now make it possible to link individuals without these constraints. In this paper, we exploit the ability to search the full manuscript census to construct a sample that links top wealth holders in 1870 to their 1860 census records. Although there was an entrenched southern planter elite that retained their economic status, we find evidence that the turmoil of the 1860s opened greater opportunities for mobility in the South than was the case in the North, resulting in much greater turnover among wealthy southerners than among comparably wealthy northerners.

Using a large sample of commercial property acquisitions, we show that REITs are 4-8% less likely to use secured (mortgage) debt when acquiring properties in their primary markets than elsewhere. The documented evidence supports a demand-side story for the relation between investment characteristics and financing. Moreover, the evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that REITs avoid mortgage financing in their primary markets to preserve operational flexibility in those markets.","[Conklin, James] Univ Georgia, 206 Brooks Hall, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Diop, Moussa] Univ Wisconsin, 5253 Grainger Hall, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Qiu, Mingming] Univ Missouri, 403 Cornell Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Conklin, J (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, 206 Brooks Hall, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",jnc152@uga.edu; mdiop@bus.wisc.edu; qiumi@missouri.edu,"Conklin, James/HKF-3240-2023",,,,,,34,4,4,1,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,SPR,2018,46.0,1,,,,,120,159,,10.1111/1540-6229.12212,0.0,,,40,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,FW8OK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000425595600004,0

We apply the methodology to a novel dataset and use it to assess whether changes in voting weights in the Lisbon Treaty influence the odds of whether countries get what they want when decisions are taken in the Council.

To make it viable, it is not enough to approach educational tourism solely from a technical viewpoint, we also need to approach it from the aspect of the operator's identity, a factor that has not been addressed fully in the arena of either rural tourism or tourism economics. Thus, by presenting a conceptual economic framework that explains the connection between a farmer's identity and the level of diversified activity including tourism, this article has evaluated, based on a questionnaire survey of next-generation successors working on-farm at Educational Dairy Farms in Japan, the hypothesis that those farmers who have enlarged their identity will be able to successfully develop diversified activities. The results clarify factors that lead to enlarged identity, including formation of both a wider perspective and more extensive human networks from social learning opportunities, and female initiative within the activity. In this context, the issue of identity formation should be properly positioned in the field of innovation-oriented capability building of farm management.","[Ohe, Yasuo] Chiba Univ, Matsudo, Chiba, Japan",Chiba University,"Ohe, Y (通讯作者)，Chiba Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Matsudo, Chiba 2718510, Japan.",yohe@faculty.chiba-u.jp,"Ohe, Yasuo/K-1096-2019",,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS); Japan Milk Association (J-milk); Japan Dairy Council; [26283017]; [16K14996]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K14996] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Japan Milk Association (J-milk); Japan Dairy Council; ; ; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported by the Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research, no. 26283017 and no. 16K14996; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS); and the original survey was financed by research projects by Japan Milk Association (J-milk) and Japan Dairy Council.",,50,21,25,9,85,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

As consumption habits are changing gradually, which can be reflected in the consumption habits of the tourists, we concentrate on the characteristics of visitor expenditure to analyze the factors that drive up the consumption. This article analyzes the relative statistical indicators from 2010 to 2016 in Macao using the ordinary least squares method. According to empirical analysis of this study, 1 Macanese Patacas (MOP) of visitor expenditure can create 7.896 MOP in additional gross domestic product (GDP) in Macao. Moreover, transportation and shopping present obvious equal status on the pulling function to the visitor expenditure, which indicates that a better transportation system can increase more consumption opportunities. The items of shopping and cosmetics and perfume have a distinctively high pulling function to the visitor expenditure. This indicates that the power of female consumer group should be emphasized. Compared with other commodities, we observed the obvious pulling function of local food products, which shows that the culture-based tourism experience will be helpful to promote the visitor expenditure.

Econometric models using both operator cost and revenue (fares plus subsidy) data show that larger operators under Transantiago had higher average operating costs than the smaller ones; we obtain a similar conclusion when analysing production and the efficiency of firms: we estimate decreasing returns to scale in production, and that larger operators would be more inefficient than smaller operators. The model results also indicate that cost per passenger carried for longer, articulated buses is greater than for shorter, conventional vehicles. These findings are important considerations for the design of the industry and its regulatory framework.","[de Grange, Louis] Univ Diego Portales, Sch Ind Engn, Santiago, Chile; [Troncoso, Rodrigo] Univ Desarrollo, Sch Govt, Santiago, Chile; [Briones, Ignacio] Univ Adolfo lbanez, Sch Govt, Santiago, Chile",University Diego Portales; Universidad del Desarrollo,"Troncoso, R (通讯作者)，Univ Desarrollo, Sch Govt, Santiago, Chile.",louis.degrange@udp.cl; rtroncoso@udd.cl; ignacio.briones@uai.cl,"Troncoso, Rodrigo/AAW-5842-2021","Troncoso, Rodrigo/0000-0002-9449-5678",,,,,56,5,5,1,32,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

The focus of our analysis is on changes at the extensive and intensive firm-level margins of trade, as well as on performance differences (jobs, productivity and firm survival) across firms that differ in their export status. We find no adverse effects of the financial crisis on foreign market entry or exit, but a considerable increase in the export intensity of firms after the financial crisis. Moreover, we find that exporters were more resilient to the crisis than non-exporters. Finally, while exporters showed a significantly more favourable development of total factor productivity after 2009 than non-exporters, aggregate productivity declined substantially in a large number of industries in Spanish manufacturing. We also briefly explore two factors that might help explain the surprisingly strong export performance of Spain in the aftermath of the great trade collapse: improved aggregate competitiveness due to internal and external devaluation and a substitutive relationship between domestic and foreign sales at the firm level.","[Eppinger, Peter S.] Univ Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany; [Meythaler, Nicole] Univ Tubingen, Inst Appl Econ Res IAW, Tubingen, Germany; [Sindlinger, Marc-Manuel] Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany; [Smolka, Marcel] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus, Denmark",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; University of Bonn; Aarhus University,"Eppinger, PS (通讯作者)，Univ Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.",,,"Eppinger, Peter/0000-0002-8460-544X",Volkswagen Foundation,Volkswagen Foundation(Volkswagen),"This paper is part of the research project Europe's Global Linkages and the Impact of the Financial Crisis financed by the Volkswagen Foundation.

Even if unconscious bias training' has the theoretical potential to change behaviour, it will depend on the type of racism: symbolic/modern/colour-blind, aversive or blatant. In addition, even if those deemed racist are motivated to change behaviour, structural constraints can militate against pro-diversity actions. Agency is overstated by psychology-inspired unconscious bias training' proponents, leading them to assume the desirability and effectiveness of this type of diversity training intervention, but from a critical diversity perspective (sociologically influenced) the training looks pointless.","[Noon, Mike] Queen Mary Univ London, Human Resource Management, Sch Business & Management, London, England",University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Noon, M (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.",m.a.noon@qmul.ac.uk,,,,,,,45,122,173,7,96,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

This paper is a case study of practice in one Croatian company, which already successfully uses agile principles for software development, applying SCRUM principles to daily operations in their Information Technology (IT) service desk. IT service desk was considered as a main IT support capability in the organization on the operational level of IT service management (ITSM), which refers to the entirety of activities that are performed by the organization to design, plan, deliver, operate and control IT services offered to customers. Describing specific adaptation of basic SCRUM elements to daily IT service management requirements, the paper explores the impact of a used operational framework for team performance. Specifically, whether it is applicable for that purpose use of Software Development Performance Index (SDPI index) across the key dimensions of Quality, Productivity, Predictability and Responsiveness.

This strong amount of research was defined as a renaissance of old institutionalism developed by Commons, Veblen, Ayres and Mitchell. This study analyses contributions by development economists on institutions. The reason that prompted this investigation is twofold. Firstly, as it emerges from the seminal contributions of Hirschman, Rostow and Lewis, development economists offer an in- depth analysis of the role played by institutions in the development processes. Secondly, the common features between the institutional analysis elaborated by development economists are highlighted as well as that offered by Old Institutional Economics. Such analytical convergence originated from the necessity to study complex processes - the structural changes in many countries after the World Wars and the promotion of economic development in poor countries - where noneconomic factors play a crucial role and a holistic and historical approach is needed.","[Gigante, Anna Azzurra] Soprintendenza Beni & Attivita Culturali Reg Auto, Aosta, Italy; [Sunna, Claudia] Univ Salento, Dipartimento Sci Econ, Ctr Ecotekne, Lecce, Italy",University of Salento,"Sunna, C (通讯作者)，Univ Salento, Dipartimento Sci Econ, Ctr Ecotekne, Lecce, Italy.",a.azzurragigante@gmail.com; claudia.sunna@unisalento.it,"SUNNA, Claudia/N-3471-2019; Sunna, Claudia/N-2448-2013","SUNNA, Claudia/0000-0003-4645-8490;",,,,,104,0,0,0,8,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"VIA SANTA BIBBIANA 28, PISA, I-56127, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

Therefore this research aims is to identify the approaches to the interpretation of the company's SD principles and objectives, typical spheres and areas of activities in the field of SD for Russian companies. As a basis of theoretical framework we used concepts associated with the issues of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and SD, as well as research approaches applied within this field. The object of the study is Russian companies, declaring their adherence to the ideas and principles of SD. The sample (focus group) included 12 companies of various industry affiliations, publishing corporate reports on SD on regular basis. Their activities in the field of SD, the results of which are reflected in corporate reports, strategies and policies in the SD field, materials posted on the company's websites became the subject of our analysis. We used methods of qualitative analysis of companies' activity applying a set of parameters reflecting the economic, environmental, social and management aspects of SD activities. The results of the study make it possible to conclude that, in general, the transition to a SD in Russia is unreasonably slow. At the same time, major Russian companies are trying to follow the global trend and to integrate SD principles into activities, corporate strategies, corporate governance, which allows us to observe gradual transition to SD model.","[Kanaev, Alexander; Kanaeva, Olga; Belousov, Konstantin] St Petersburg State Univ, St Petersburg, Russia",Saint Petersburg State University,"Kanaev, A (通讯作者)，St Petersburg State Univ, St Petersburg, Russia.",,"Kanaev, Alexander/N-4237-2013; Kanaeva, Olga/H-1511-2015; Belousov, Konstantin Y/N-2499-2013",,,,,,42,1,1,0,1,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-344-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,302,313,,,,,,12,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP0MG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000535358500028,0

Particular attention was paid to the role of representatives in the management of the company. The essence of a family business means that it has a strongly focused shareholding. If the owners do not hold the board directly, this may exacerbate the conflict typical of the agency's problems. 845 listed family owned companies in selected Central and Eastern European countries were analyzed in period of 2006-2016. Within this group, family businesses were separated by directly managed by family members. Data was obtained from Amadeus database. The analysis was mainly focused on the problem of capital structure. To take into account the economic context of the researched entities, their profitability and liquidity were also analyzed. Beside the descriptive statistics the significance difference test were used. The research was conducted in a general and sectoral contexts. The results show that family businesses managed by family members compared to others apply conservative financing policies. They are less indebted and generally keep higher financial liquidity. It must be stressed, however, that the results obtained are not entirely clear. This may be caused both by the sectoral conditions of financing strategy and the differences in the family business development stage in particular country.

In the process of exploitation of road assets, the excessive impact of transport vibrations, water-heat and low-temperature loads, soil washing leads to a significant reduction in the regulatory criteria for their safety, premature technical wear of surface plates, cracks, unevenness, lowering. Increasing the number of seismic fluctuations and floods violates the integrity and stability of road systems. Inadequate and untimely financing leads to increased costs for the prevention and rehabilitation of road systems. The purpose of the survey is to analyze problems and trends in the management of infrastructure road assets; correcting the content of educational programs in a new global context and principles of sustainable development. Methods of research - Review of scientific and applied information in the public domain about the organizational mechanism of infrastructure assets management in the context of global tasks and problems. The subject of the study is knowledge management in the field of infrastructure of the road assets. Results - This study does not have a specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or non-profit sectors. It is expected that the transitional results of interdisciplinary research will contribute to the implementation of global programs aimed at improving knowledge management in the field of infrastructure asset management, including the road system. Conclusions - In general, the trends in the implementation of the principles of global programs for transforming the economy based on digital technologies show a positive trend. For example, innovative proposals by scientists and business practitioners have helped to reduce the infrastructure gap of assets in many countries. However, factors of negative impact, including natural disasters, economic instability, slow processes of transformation of human capital and organizational culture have been revealed.","[Mitinskiy, Vasiliy; Vashchynska, Olena; Shyriaieva, Nataliya; Khmaruk, Olha] Odessa State Acad Civil Engn & Architecture, Odessa, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Odessa State Academy of Civil Engineering and Architecture,"Mitinskiy, V (通讯作者)，Odessa State Acad Civil Engn & Architecture, Odessa, Ukraine.",mitinskiy.v@gmail.com; vashin2989@gmail.com; n.shyriaieva@ogasa.org.ua; nowolya@gmail.com,"Shyriaieva, Nataliya/AAF-7869-2019","Shyriaieva, Nataliya/0000-0002-2233-3581",,,,,20,0,0,0,10,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,111,117,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540723300013,0

Internationally it is debated if gene-edited organisms should be subjected to the same risk assessment requirements as GMOs. Sweden has decided that gene-edited plants with no foreign genetic element should not count as GMOs, arguing that they are similar to plants altered through conventional breeding or plant mutagenesis. This regulatory discussion is not decided yet in the EU, but we will here argue that even if gene-edited plants and animals are exempt from GMO risk assessment, an approval procedure should include a broad assessment of such plants and animals. We take our point of departure from the Norwegian Gene Technology Act (GTA) which states that risk assessment of GMOs should be supplemented by an assessment of the sustainability, ethical and societal impact prior to regulatory approval of the novel products. Even if gene-edited organisms are considered comparable to non-GMOs in terms of risks, the technology has impacts that calls for an assessment of the kind required in the GTA. With NBTs it may possible to develop plants that have increased drought and saline tolerance relevant for the developing world. Such gene-edited plants can have positive, stable long-term effects on environment, economic and social conditions, and hence be argued to contribute to sustainability. Conversely, the same plants may also have adverse long-term environmental effects. Social benefits are such that are good, or at least not harmful, for small scale producers and consumers, not merely for patent holders and industrial farming. Possible examples are blight resistant potatoes and virus resistant pigs. The assessment of ethical impact becomes increasingly important when dealing with powerful technologies such as genome editing. One example is the potential for developing virus free pigs to be used growing human organs or other alterations that increase the usefulness of animals for industrial production. Questions related to welfare and protection of integrity needs to be evaluated. A wide assessment as required by the GTA will ensure that the NBTs will be beneficial for society in general.","[Myhr, A., I] SIVA Innovat Ctr, Genok Ctr Biosafety, PB 6418, N-9294 Tromso, Norway; [Myskja, B.
