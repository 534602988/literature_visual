According to the human capital theory, probability of personnel training is positively related to expected return on training. According to available data, most employees in different countries are trained with the employer's financial support. In this context, young workers and workers in high-tech industries as well as workers with a higher level of education in positions of managers and specialists should be trained more often. The study tested hypotheses about the impact of characteristics of country, company and employees' individual characteristics on the probability of training. The main source of information is 8th round of studies of the European Social Survey (2016) in 18 countries. Research methods are descriptive and regression analysis. The probability of on-the-job training has a significant cross. The results show that workers are more likely to be educated in countries with better conditions for doing business. Training of employees is positively influenced by gender, age, organization size, its membership in public sector, employment in education, health care and some other areas of activity. The work reveals differences in training between countries of Northern and Western Europe, Eastern Europe and Russia.","[Stuken, Tatiana; Korzhova, Olga] Dostoevsky Omsk State Univ, 55-A, Omsk 644077, Russia",Dostoevsky Omsk State University,"Stuken, T (通讯作者)，Dostoevsky Omsk State Univ, 55-A, Omsk 644077, Russia.",Stuken@mail.ru; olishb@yandex.ru,"Korzhova, Olga/G-2441-2017; Stuken, Tatiana/H-6777-2016",,,,,,13,0,0,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,1718,1726,,,,,,9,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400170,0

The survey included questions about the profession that students would like to pursue after graduation, prospect salary, work properties for which students would be willing to devote some of their earnings, what they expect from their future employment. Students expect to work as accountants (60%) and bank clerks (25%). Their salary expectations are realistic, furthermore most of them would accept a reduction in salary in favour of the possibility of development.

Contemplating over meat and fish delights on restaurant menus, hunting for sport and leisure purposes, and the presence of safaris and zoos have aspects in common, significantly animals are central to their existence and tourists are key consumers. Importantly, these pastimes, social activates, and leisurely pursuits have their ancestral roots that pre-date modern society. Humans have long been associated with eating meat, hunting animals and holding animals in some form of captivity for recreation and education. Distinctively, this paper explores animal cloning and how it could support the extension and existence of these tourism pursuits in the future, focusing on the year 2070. The paper applies a scenario planning approach as its methodological approach to research. The study contributes innovative and original concepts to the future tourism landscape. Through rigorous analysis and discussions in the fields of animal cloning and its relationship with tourism and tourists in potential future settings, a gap in the future market is presented.

Harvested wood products (HWP) are an important part of the forest-atmosphere carbon cycle. On the one hand, HWP can retain the carbon for various periods of time, depending on the end uses. On the other hand, using HWP in place of more GHG-intensive materials and using wood bioenergy to substitute for fossil fuels result in reduced fossil fuel emissions. However, critical methodological differences exist in existing literature in assessing the GHG effects of HWP and wood bioenergy substitution, and large diversity in system boundary, substitution scenario, study period, and reference baseline results in large difference in reported GHG effects of wood substitution. In the present study, we conducted a comprehensive literature review to (a) clarify the methodological issues in GHG effects assessments of HWP and wood bioenergy substitution, (b) summarize and compare the reported GHG effects, and (c) identify knowledge gaps to inform future research. We support the conclusion that to accurately assess the GHG effects, HWP and wood bioenergy life-cycle carbon analysis needs to be integrated with forest carbon balance analysis. Substituting HWP for non-wood materials appears to be more effective in reducing GHG emissions than substituting wood for fossil fuels. The time required to obtain net emission reduction for wood bioenergy in place of fossil fuels can be 0 years, decades or more than a century, depending on forest biomass sources (e.g., harvest residue, standing live trees) and fossil fuels displaced. For HWP used to replace non-wood material, however, the time required to obtain net emission reduction largely remains a future research need. Overall, HWP and wood bioenergy originated from sustainably managed forests can significantly contribute to GHG emissions reduction in the long term.","[Geng, Aixin; Yang, Hongqiang] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing 210037, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Yang, Hongqiang; Hong, Yinxing] Nanjing Univ, Ctr Yangtze River Deltas Socioecon Dev, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Geng, Aixin; Yang, Hongqiang] Res Ctr Econ & Trade Forest Prod State Forestry A, Nanjing 210037, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jiaxin] Ontario Forest Res Inst, Minist Nat Resources & Forestry, 1235 Queen St East, Sault Ste Marie, ON P6A 2E5, Canada",Nanjing Forestry University; Nanjing University; Ministry of Natural Resources & Forestry,"Yang, HQ (通讯作者)，159 Longpan Rd, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",yhqnfu@gmail.com,"Yang, Hongqiang/AAV-2376-2021","Yang, Hongqiang/0000-0002-6598-2936",National Social Science Foundation of China [14AJY014]; China Ministry of Education Project of Humanities and Social Sciences [13YJAZH114]; China Post-doctoral Science Foundation [2012M521058]; Jiangsu Province Qinglan Project of China [2012JSQLP],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); China Ministry of Education Project of Humanities and Social Sciences; China Post-doctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Jiangsu Province Qinglan Project of China,"This study was supported by the key program of the National Social Science Foundation of China (Program No. 14AJY014), the China Ministry of Education Project of Humanities and Social Sciences (Project No. 13YJAZH114), the China Post-doctoral Science Foundation (Grant No. 2012M521058), and the Jiangsu Province Qinglan Project of China (Grant No. 2012JSQLP).

Using survey data from three countries, we analyze how personal values, general CSR support, and four background variables (nationality, gender, age, and study field) are related to student perceptions of overall sustainability and specific social and environmental sustainability performance in the forest industry. Our findings indicate that nationality and study field are strongly associated with student CSR perceptions. In addition, students build their CSR perceptions on their personal values and their overall support for CSR. We additionally explored how respondents perceive the future of the forest industry. The results underline the complex and context-dependent nature of sustainable forest use in a future bioeconomy as an issue that cannot be managed at the corporate level, but is dependent on perceptions, values, and levels of industry knowledge among stakeholders.","[Patari, S.; Arminen, H.; Puumalainen, K.] Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Sch Business, Lappeenranta, Finland; [Albareda, L.] Lappeenranta Univ Technol, LUT Sch Business & Management, POB 20, FI-53851 Lappeenranta, Finland; [Toppinen, A.] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, Helsinki, Finland",Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT; Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT; University of Helsinki,"Toppinen, A (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, Helsinki, Finland.",anne.toppinen@helsinki.fi,"Puumalainen, Kaisu/IUM-9269-2023","Toppinen, Anne/0000-0003-0910-1505; Arminen, Heli/0000-0003-3890-4737; Patari, Satu/0000-0003-4003-0346; Albareda, Laura/0000-0002-1558-5262",,,,,88,29,32,1,30,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,DEC,2017,85.0,,1.0,,,,201,215,,10.1016/j.forpol.2017.10.009,0.0,,,15,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,FR3SG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418986200020,0

In this article, we argue that financialisation in Australia has advanced inequality, but in a particular way. Charting several features of financialisation of the macroeconomy', we accept that this process has contributed to increased inequality in the sense that the wealthy have increased their wealth faster than households and individuals at the lower end of the wealth distribution. However, there is limited Australian evidence to suggest that income redistribution has occurred as a result of the financialisation of the firm'. At the level of the firm, increased inequality of wealth can be attributed directly to financialisation if firm practices are oriented to increasing shareholder value at the expense of returns to other stakeholders such as workers or suppliers, and increased income inequality can be linked specifically to financialisation through increases in earnings to financial agents. We suggest several reasons for the relative absence of a firm-level dimension of financialisation but caution that such a trend remains possible, particularly if regulation of the labour market is weakened.","[Westcott, Mark] Univ Sydney, Sch Business, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Murray, John] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm, Sweden",University of Sydney; Stockholm University,"Westcott, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Business, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",mark.westcott@sydney.edu.au,,"Murray, John/0000-0002-5216-5208; Westcott, Mark/0000-0003-3895-9439",,,,,57,4,4,2,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Data sources/Study setting: Primary data collected from a survey with 277 referring physicians (response rate = 26.2%) in Nuremberg, Germany (03-06/2016). Study design: Cluster-randomised controlled trial at the practice level. Physician practices were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: (1) physicians in the control arm could become aware of the performance reports via mass media channels (Mass Media, n(MM)(pr) =132, n(MM)(ph) =147); (2) physicians in the intervention arm also received a printed version of the report via mail (Mass and Special Media, n(MSM)(pr) =117; n(MSM)(ph) =130). Principal findings: Overall, 68% of respondents recalled hospital performance reports and 21% used them for referral decisions. Physicians from the Mass and Special Media group were more likely to be aware of the performance reports (OR 4.16; 95% CI 2.16-8.00, p < .001) but not more likely to be influenced when referring patients into hospitals (OR 1.73; 95% CI 0.72-4.12, p > .05). On a 1 (very good) to 6 (insufficient) scale, the usefulness of the performance reports was rated 3.67 (+/- 1.40). Aggregated presentation formats were rated more helpful than detailed hospital quality information. Conclusions: Hospital quality reports have limited impact on referral practices. To increase the latter, concerns raised by referring physicians must be given more weight. Those principally refer to the underlying data, the design of the reports, and the lack of important information.","[Emmert, Martin; Meszmer, Nina; Jablonski, Lisa; Zinth, Lena; Schoffski, Oliver] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Sch Business & Econ, Hlth Serv Management, Lange Gasse 20, D-90403 Nurnberg, Nuremberg, Germany; [Taheri-Zadeh, Fatemeh] Univ Appl Sci & Arts, Media Informat & Design Dept Informat & Commun, Hannover, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg; Hochschule Hannover-University of Applied Sciences & Arts,"Emmert, M (通讯作者)，Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Sch Business & Econ, Hlth Serv Management, Lange Gasse 20, D-90403 Nurnberg, Nuremberg, Germany.",Martin.Emmert@fau.de; Nina.Meszmer@fau.de; Lisa.Jablonski@gmx.de; Lena.Zinth@fau.de; Oliver.Schoeffski@fau.de; fate.taheri@gmail.com,,"Emmert, Martin/0000-0002-0154-6641","Hans Frisch Foundation at the Friedrich Alexander University of Erlangen, Nuremberg","Hans Frisch Foundation at the Friedrich Alexander University of Erlangen, Nuremberg","This study was partly financed by the Hans Frisch Foundation at the Friedrich Alexander University of Erlangen, Nuremberg.",,43,7,7,0,2,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

Price-regulating and reimbursement mechanisms for prescription drugs among OECD countries were reviewed. National health expenditure indices for 2008-2012 were extracted from OECD statistical sources. Possible associations between characteristics of different systems for regulation of drug prices and reimbursement and health expenditures were examined. In most countries, reimbursement mechanisms are part of publicly financed plans. Maximum price regulation is composed of reference-pricing, either of the same drug in other countries, or of therapeutic alternatives within the country, as well as value-based pricing (VBP). No association was found between price regulation or reimbursement mechanisms and healthcare costs. However, VBP may present a more effective mechanism, leading to reduced costs in the long term.

Using structural and reduced-form estimations, we find that pollution havens are not a popular myth for European firms, laxer environmental standards significantly explain the location choice of polluting affiliates. We analyze in depth the role of trade costs (using various bilateral and multilateral measures), a 1% increase in access to the European market from a pollution haven fosters relocation there by 0.1%. We also find that corruption lowers environmental standards, which strongly attract polluting firms: a 1% increase of corruption fuels relocation by 0.28%. We test the economic significance of these empirical findings via simulations.

A variety of environmental impacts are reported in these programs and often this information is aggregated into a composite environmental index (CEI) for easier communication. The challenge is to create a meaningful index that allows environmental performance to be compared over time and space without ambiguity. In this paper, we argue that it is important to develop a cardinally meaningful and standardized CEI and use a nonparametric frontier approach to constructing such an index. This approach has the advantage to handle issues associated with data irregularity and the mixed measurability of underlying variables. We apply this approach to constructing a CEI for evaluating the environmental performance of manufacturing facilities in different industrial sectors in Los Angeles based on data from the toxic release inventory. We show how the CEI can be used to improve facility-level environmental performance. A sensitivity analysis is conducted with respect to the uncertainty in data accuracy, which demonstrates the robustness of the nonparametric frontier approach in constructing meaningful environmental indices.

Post normal science promotes the idea of extended peer communities, through which citizens participate with knowledge and insights in urgent and complex societal issues with conflicting stakes. Meanwhile, critical mathematics education is a philosophy of mathematics education that includes attention to the central role of mathematics in a technological society, the effects of this role, and the need for epistemic dialogue in learning and teaching mathematics. We argue that a mathematics education based on these ideas can prepare students to participate in extended peer communities. We focus particularly on the uncertainty that characterises post-normal situations. Post-normal science distinguishes various characteristics of uncertainty and highlights its centrality to post-normal situations. A critical mathematics education should prepare citizens who are able to deal with the different ways in which uncertainty matters in such situations. We illustrate these ideas through brief descriptions of three classroom studies in which students discuss issues of uncertainty and risk. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Models are estimated with financial information from Datastream, including R&D investment, and the number of new drugs authorized by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considering the time effect. The relative performances of these firms-taking into consideration the strategic importance of R&D-suggest that the pharmaceutical industry is a highly competitive sector given that there are many laboratories at the efficient frontier and many inefficient laboratories close to this border. Additionally, we use data from S&P Capital IQ to analyze 2071 financial transactions announced by our sample of laboratories as an alternative way to gain access to new drugs, and we link these transactions with R&D investment and DEA efficiency. We find that efficient laboratories make on average more financial transactions, and the relative size of each transaction is larger. However, pharmaceutical companies that simultaneously are more efficient and invest more internally in R&D announce smaller transactions relative to total assets.","[Gascon, Fernando] Univ Oviedo, Dept Business Adm, Fac Econ & Business, Campus Cristo S-N, Oviedo 33006, Spain; [Lozano, Jesus; Ponte, Borja; de la Fuente, David] Univ Oviedo, Dept Business Adm, Polytech Sch Engn, Campus Viesques S-N, Gijon 33204, Spain",University of Oviedo; University of Oviedo,"Ponte, B (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Dept Business Adm, Polytech Sch Engn, Campus Viesques S-N, Gijon 33204, Spain.",ponteborja@uniovi.es,"de la Fuente, David/D-7089-2013; Gascon, Fernando/H-2243-2015","de la Fuente, David/0000-0001-7591-2600; Gascon, Fernando/0000-0002-6075-7895; Ponte, Borja/0000-0003-3985-0400",Government of Spain [ECO2012-31772]; Government of the Principality of Asturias [BP13011],Government of Spain(Spanish Government); Government of the Principality of Asturias(Principality of Asturias),Fernando Gascon would like to acknowledge financing from the Government of Spain through national research project ECO2012-31772.

However future scenarios of extreme uncertainty such as those characterising the Anthropocene may require a more flexible and interactive approach, drawing on a wider range of knowledge. The role of the practitioner in this is often highlighted, but little understood. This paper therefore seeks to contribute to empirical understanding of forest practice and its implications for adaptive forest governance. In the UK, devolved forest administrations are addressing new structures and politics, reduced budgets and staff, and several high impact tree health disasters. In the absence of scientific and operational guidance, foresters are finding new spaces in which to use their silvicultural knowledge, and work flexibly, generating new knowledge and practice through observation and local experiments. The capacity of state forestry organisations to learn and adapt is constrained by resource cuts, reorganisation, poor record keeping, increasingly top down policy control, and de facto pre-eminence given to timber as the management objective. Individual relationships and personalities can nevertheless support communication and learning. The new circumstances are stimulating an approach which is both creative and grounded in silvicultural knowledge and experience. Important parts of the adaptive process lie with practice and innovation in the forest, rather than hierarchical, science led approaches, but reality does not present us with a simple dichotomy between deterministic, reductionist forest management, and indeterministic, adaptive, ecosystem approaches. Further attention to practitioners' realities and contribution to knowledge is needed.

In the past decade, research has proliferated on global forest governance and the international forest regime (IFR), yet the academic literature on the IFR is just as dispersed and fragmented as the IFR itself. An emerging body of literature now suggests the key role of domestic actors in international forest governance, questioning an implicit top-down logic of global arrangements. In spite of all the resources at its disposal, the IFR is characterised by complexity, fragmentation and ineffectiveness regarding its main objective of reducing global deforestation. Based on an extensive literature review, the authors' long-standing observations and selected own empirical findings, this review article aims to provide an updated historical account of the IFR and proposes a from-below approach for analysing the IFR from the viewpoint of domestic actors. In this bottom-up perspective the IFR is conceptualised as a set of resources that key domestic actors can pick and choose from according to their interests and in the light of domestic politics. Using illustrative empirical examples from recent research and own observations, the article finds that the IFR is being hollowed-out by (i) the growing policy links between forests and climate change - a process referred to as climatization - and (ii) domestic influences. We conclude that our from-below approach is instrumental in further explaining why deforestation has largely continued, despite the emergence of the IFR some three decades ago. Our findings about the importance of domestic actors illustrate that global governance arrangements cannot operate effectively, relative to their ambitious mandate and for tackling policy issues relating to the Anthropocene, unless they are granted adequate resources and support by key domestic actors.

We consider five different scenarios, each referring to an alternative level of wood harvests (due to changing rotation lengths or setting forest areas aside). The cost calculation is done within a framework that accounts for both financial impacts on downstream industries and impacts on the values of non-market goods and services of forests. To gauge the market-based costs of the scenarios in the national forest-based industries, different input-output methodological concepts are combined and applied in a novel fashion. A physical input-output table (PIOT) that shows the wood-based fiber flow through the forest-based industries of Germany forms the core of the model. The market-based costs of the mitigation measures are estimated as the aggregate of the value added losses in the German forest-based industries. Additionally, we include monetary value estimates of environmental costs and benefits based on a comprehensive choice experiment at the national level. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We demonstrate a new bottom-up approach to developing socially relevant C & I using social analysis and psychology-based concepts and methods. Our conceptual framework links the concepts of valued attributes and environmental cues with, respectively, criteria and indicators. We illustrate our approach using thirty-six semi-structured interviews of individual members of the general public and of stakeholder groups in Victoria, southern Australia. The interviews included a modified cognitive mapping task to identify attributes of forests valued by the interviewees, as well as cues used by them to know if a valued attribute was present or had changed. Seven broad valued attributes of forests were identified: Natural; Experiential; Productive; Setting; Social/Economic; Learning; and Cultural. Four broad categories of cues were identified: Biophysical; Social/Psychological; Economic; and Management/Planning. Cues were translated into a set of measurable 'socially relevant' indicators of forest management. Comparison with existing frameworks revealed some similarities, but that an important component of public evaluations, Experiential and Setting valued attributes, was largely absent from C & I used in Victoria, which are based on the Montreal Process framework. Some socially relevant indicators aligned with existing indicators, but others were poorly represented, particularly sensory indicators that are concerned with subjective experiences of forests.

However, the robustness of business models (BM) is seldom tested vis-a-vis the fast and unpredictable changes in digital technologies, regulation and markets. The evaluation of the robustness of a BM raises several issues, such as how to describe the business model in a structured way, how to determine a relevant set of changes to test against, how to assess their impact on business model components, and how to use the results of the assessment to strengthen the business model. In this paper, we propose business model stress testing as a practical approach to evaluate the robustness of business model components. The method builds upon concepts from business model innovation and scenario planning. We illustrate our approach using a case example. Our approach enables testing individual business model components as well as the interrelation between components. The approach visualizes challenges and suggests ways to increase the robustness of BM. The stress testing approach is particularly useful in a stage of business model experimentation, i.e. if a company has to choose between alternative business models or still has to implement the business model. The underlying software tool is openly available for reuse and further development. The paper contributes to futures research literature by delivering the first method that allows to test the robustness of business models against future uncertainties.","[Haaker, Timber; de Reuver, Mark] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Jaffalaan 5, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands; [Haaker, Timber; Bouwman, Harry; Janssen, Wil] Innovalor BV, Brouwerijpl 20, NL-7523 XD Enschede, Netherlands; [Bouwman, Harry] Abo Akad Univ, Joukahaisenkatu 3-5 A, FIN-20520 Turku, Finland",Delft University of Technology; Abo Akademi University,"Haaker, T (通讯作者)，Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Jaffalaan 5, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands.",t.i.haaker@tudelft.nl; w.a.g.a.bouwman@tudelft.nl; wil.janssen@innovalor.nl; g.a.dereuver@tudelft.nl,"de Reuver, Mark/N-4848-2016; de Reuver, Mark/ABF-6649-2021","de Reuver, Mark/0000-0002-6302-7185; de Reuver, Mark/0000-0002-6302-7185; Bouwman, Harry/0000-0002-7874-8671",European Commission; European Union's [645791],European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); European Union's(European Union (EU)),We acknowledge the generous support of European Commission.

Immigrants are screened, and some are treated, for latent TB infection (LTBI) to prevent TB disease (reactivation). In this study, we estimated the costs of both treating and screening for LTBI and TB disease, which has not been done previously in Norway. We developed a model to indicate the cost-effectiveness of four different screening algorithms for LTBI using avoided TB disease cases as the health outcome. Further, we calculated the expected value of perfect information (EVPI), and indicated areas of LTBI screening that could be changed to improve cost-effectiveness. The costs of treating LTBI and TB disease were estimated to be a,notsign1938 and a,notsign15,489 per case, respectively. The model evaluates four algorithms, and suggests three cost-effective algorithms depending on the cost-effectiveness threshold. Screening all immigrants with interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA) requires the highest threshold (a,notsign28,400), followed by the algorithms IGRA on immigrants with risk factors and no LTBI screening. EVPI is approximately a,notsign5 per screened immigrant. The costs for a cohort of 20,000 immigrants followed through 10 years range from a,notsign12.2 million for the algorithm screening and treatment for TB disease but no LTBI screening, to a,notsign14 million for screening all immigrants for both TB disease and LTBI with IGRA. The results suggest that the cost of TB disease screening and treatment is the largest contributor to total costs, while LTBI screening and treatment costs are relatively small. Increasing the proportion of IGRA-positive immigrants who are treated decreases the costs per avoided case substantially.","[Haukaas, Fredrik Salvesen; Arnesen, Trude Margrete; Winje, Brita Askeland] Norwegian Inst Publ Hlth, Domain Infect Control & Environm Hlth, POB 4404 Nydalen, Oslo, Norway; [Haukaas, Fredrik Salvesen; Aas, Eline] Univ Oslo, Inst Hlth & Soc, Dept Hlth Management & Hlth Econ, Postboks 1089, N-0317 Blindern, Norway",Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH); University of Oslo,"Haukaas, FS (通讯作者)，Norwegian Inst Publ Hlth, Domain Infect Control & Environm Hlth, POB 4404 Nydalen, Oslo, Norway.;Haukaas, FS (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Inst Hlth & Soc, Dept Hlth Management & Hlth Econ, Postboks 1089, N-0317 Blindern, Norway.",fredrikhaukaas@gmail.com,,,,,,,30,10,11,1,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The historical roots and political dynamics between key actor coalitions, as well as their key concerns around sustain ability in forest policy are first outlined. After this contextualisation, we identify the current dominant pathway by analysing recent official policy documents (2010-2015) that focus on the future challenges for Finnish forestry. Additionally, we analyse the implementation of the pathway through the revision of the Forest Act (2011-2013). Our analysis shows that the dominant pathway to sustainability in Finnish forest policy aims at reconciling the different dimensions of sustainability by producing more of everything. Yet there are underlying conflicts and priorities between different goals within this pathway, Which are not openly addressed. The dominant pathway has co-aligned with the global bioeconomy meta-discourse that has contributed to the re legitimisation of policy goals from previous industrial forestry eras. Prioritisation of production over ecological concerns are, however, challenged by the environmental coalition and in conflict with the views of the general public that has become more conscious about conservation, biodiversity and recreation. This resulted in intense struggles during the revision of the Forest Act, however with the production goals persisting over conservation. Our analysis concludes that the dominant pathway aims to safeguard increased timber production, and the studied period saw a political shift back towards more hierarchical policymaking that promotes a productivist forest policy under the guise of a forest bioeconomy.

As performance-based contracting grows in developing countries, it is critical to better understand not only intended program impacts on rewarded outcomes, but also unintended program impacts such as multitasking and heterogeneous program effects in order to guide program design and scale-up. We use two waves of data from the Rwanda Demographic and Health Surveys collected before and after the quasi-experimental rollout of Rwanda's national pay-for-performance (P4P) program to analyze impacts on utilization of health-care services, health outcomes, and unintended consequences of P4P. We find that P4P improved some rewarded services, as well as some services that were not directly rewarded, but had no statistically significant impact on health outcomes. We do not find evidence that clearly suggests multitasking. We find that program effects vary by baseline levels of facility quality, with most improvements seen in the medium-quality tier.","[Sherry, Tisamarie B.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Bauhoff, Sebastian] Ctr Global Dev, Washington, DC USA; [Mohanan, Manoj] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA",Harvard University; Brigham & Women's Hospital; Duke University,"Sherry, TB (通讯作者)，Brigham & Womens Hosp, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",tsherry@partners.org,"Mohanan, Manoj/E-3068-2012","Bauhoff, Sebastian/0000-0001-6017-4991; Mohanan, Manoj/0000-0001-7028-6479",,,,,54,19,23,0,15,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",2332-3493,2332-3507,,AM J HEALTH ECON,AM.

This article argues that a key reason why TTIP has become so controversial has to do with the nature of the arguments used by each side. The main arguments in favour of TTIP emphasize the economic and geostrategic benefits. The main criticisms of TTIP focus on its alleged negative impact on product safety and public policies. Identifying the foundational assumption(s) behind these arguments, we show that this debate is special because opponents and supporters' premises emerge from assumptions based on different perspectives: while opponents assume that the EU will succumb to neoliberal American preferences, supporters focus on the US-EU combined market power vis-a-vis third countries. Since these assumptions do not necessarily contradict each other, the debate is less whether benefits outweigh costs and more whether such costs are probable, leaving the supporters with a defensive position. This is an important distinction in explaining why opponents dominate the public debate. Our findings also indicate, however, that opponents' thesis has been successful because the US is the partner; such public mobilization is less probable on other trade agreements.","[Garcia-Duran, Patricia] Univ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [Eliasson, Leif Johan] East Stroudsburg Univ, East Stroudsburg, PA USA",University of Barcelona,"Garcia-Duran, P (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.",patriciagarciaduran@ub.edu; jeliasson@esu.edu,"Garcia-Duran, Patricia/P-9113-2019","Garcia-Duran, Patricia/0000-0002-4038-4892",,,,,70,13,14,0,10,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Some of the reasons that will be presented in this paper relate to the growing number of demands of the various stakeholders operating in the international market, because globalization can significantly reduce costs in international business transactions, enabling companies to expand their activities outside the domestic market. Also, a strategic investment in new technologies and innovations, often creates regulatory challenges, which require political reactions, which can affect the rate of emergence of new technologies and their level of acceptance, sustainability and profitability of which depends largely on the success of companies operating in the international market.

Unprocessed coldwater shrimp leads the market in northern Europe. Downstream, prices adjust within a few months, indicating that a shrimp is a shrimp. In the short-run, the coldwater value chain seems to be protected from competition, but provides opportunities for a shift in consumer demand towards warmwater in the long-run.

In terms of policy implications, the USA should try to reduce production costs of shrimp in the US market instead of imposing antidumping petitions, and the shrimp exporting countries should maintain their comparative advantage and diversify into new markets.","[Chang, Chia-Lin] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Taichung, Taiwan; [Chang, Chia-Lin] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung, Taiwan; [McAleerz, Michael] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Quantitat Finance, Hsinchu, Taiwan; [Dang-Khoa Nguyen] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Int Master Program Argriculture, Taichung, Taiwan; [McAleerz, Michael] Dhurakij Pundit Univ, Inst Social & Econ Sci, Bangkok, Thailand",National Chung Hsing University; National Chung Hsing University; National Tsing Hua University; National Chung Hsing University,"McAleerz, M (通讯作者)，Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Quantitat Finance, Hsinchu, Taiwan.;McAleerz, M (通讯作者)，Dhurakij Pundit Univ, Inst Social & Econ Sci, Bangkok, Thailand.",michael.mcaleer@gmail.com,"McAleer, Michael/A-2407-2008; Chang, Chia-Lin/B-2679-2010","Chang, Chia-Lin/0000-0001-8835-760X","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan; Australian Research Council; Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","For financial support, the first author wishes to thank the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, and the second author is grateful to the Australian Research Council and Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan.

The model is estimated by means of Kalman filtering, using a rich data set of contracts with different maturities traded at Fish Pool between 01/01/2010 and 24/04/2014. The results are then discussed in the context of other commodity markets, specifically live cattle, which is a substitute. We show that the seasonally adjusted model proposed in this article describes the behavior of salmon price very well. More importantly we show that seasonality exists in the salmon futures market.

By testing the cross-sectional dependence for FIIs' stocks in two adjacent months, we demonstrate that the FIIs' cascades mainly result from their herding. We find little evidence that FIIs' herding behavior is driven by habit investing. The momentum trading of FIIs is found to account for little of their herding. Moreover, investigative herding, rather than informational cascades is the main reason for FIIs' herding. One of our contributions may be to find that FIIs' cascades mainly resulting from their herding does not change in the bullish and bearish Taiwan stock market.

Starting point of estimating credit worthiness is analysis of historic information through analysis of financial statements and ratio analysis, but most important process is estimating available and sustainable cash flow considering that loans can be repaid solely from cash. Given that DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio) uses EBITDA as proxy for available cash flow author focused on influence of EBITDA as predictor variable. Theory and practice uses different models, different ratios and their combination for the purpose of estimating credit worthiness of the company. The paper gives overview of several existing credit rating models pointing out influence of used variables on the final model outcome. In this paper the author wanted to test her assumption that one variable EBITDA margin, measured as EBITDA/revenues, has significantly higher impact on estimation result than all other considered variables. Such presumption is generated from practical experience of the author, while in this paper assumption is tested with statistical methods. The paper includes credit worthiness prediction model developed by the author. For the purpose of this paper credit worthiness is measured as 30 days delay in loan repayment, meaning that companies which are in delay with their loan obligations longer than 30 days have deteriorated credit worthiness and increased credit risk. Model is developed using data provided by one commercial Croatian bank on the sample which includes 354 companies in Croatia. Developed model has 81,4% accuracy of prediction and the most influential variable proved to be EBITDA margin.","[Jakasa, Petra] Imex Banka Dd, Tolstojeva 9, Split, Croatia",,"Jakasa, P (通讯作者)，Imex Banka Dd, Tolstojeva 9, Split, Croatia.",pjakasa@gmail.com,"Jakaša, Petra/T-6363-2018",,,,,,10,0,0,0,9,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,458,465,,,,,,8,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6MR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426857700049,0

Standards-takers are typically countries with little bargaining power, who cannot affect their terms of trade, and, thus, even if they possess domestic antitrust laws, will find it hard to persuade standard-setters to take account of their interests. Our concern is to bring more of these standards within the normative framework of the trade regime - that is, we worry that these private forms of social order can conflict with the fundamental norms of transparency and non-discrimination. The WTO membership has consumed itself in endless discussions regarding mundane, legalistic issues, and has not moved at all towards addressing the real concerns of developing countries. We discuss one aspect of the problem: How reclusive should the WTO allow product standards to be? We argue that the WTO should adopt a `Reference Paper' that would encourage its members to apply WTO rules for adopting those standards that already come under the aegis of the WTO to private standards. In the absence of centralized enforcement, utopia in the WTO legal paradigm, transparency disciplines imposed on standard-setters is the best the WTO could offer to those who are negatively affected by private standards.","[Mavroidis, Petros C.] Columbia Law Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Mavroidis, Petros C.] EUI, Fiesole, FI, Italy; [Wolfe, Robert] Queens Univ, Sch Policy Studies, Kingston, ON, Canada",Columbia University; European University Institute; Queens University - Canada,"Mavroidis, PC (通讯作者)，Columbia Law Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA.;Mavroidis, PC (通讯作者)，EUI, Fiesole, FI, Italy.;Wolfe, R (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Sch Policy Studies, Kingston, ON, Canada.",petros.mavroidis@eui.eu; robert.wolfe@queensu.ca,,,,,,,61,23,25,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JAN,2017,16.0,1,,,,,1,24,,10.1017/S1474745616000379,0.0,,,24,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,EN9YV,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000396356400001,0

While there is evidence of its capacity to promote management activities, it still remains open whether cost sharing induces additional private investments or whether it substitutes public funds for private capital. This study re-examines the latter issue in the case of Finnish family forest owners' pre-commercial and restoration thinnings using data from a nation-wide survey (n = 3801). A two-step model of cost-share participation and stand improvements is used to account for the endogeneity of cost-share participation. Cost-share participation was related to personal assistance and clearly encouraged forest owners' engagement in and extent of stand improvements. The inducement or crowding out of private capital is analytically shown to depend on the relative magnitude of forest owners' response to cost-share incentives in each specific situation. In the present case evidence suggests that cost sharing has had an inducement effect on private investment. This is likely related to the advanced personal assistance that has promoted the knowledge of and participation in cost sharing. The findings suggest that cost sharing can be a useful component in a balanced policy mix especially when combined with informational instruments. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Most studies find a wage penalty associated with caring occupations. This study extends the feminist research on care work beyond caring occupations by identifying specific caring skills and activities derived from the 2014 O*NET job-evaluation data. Four caring skills - (1) Assisting and Caring for Others, (2) Establishing and Maintaining Interpersonal Relationships, (3) Service Orientation, and (4) Social Perceptiveness - were used in ordinary least-squares and quantile wage regressions for 623 occupations in the United States. Findings indicate that the return to caring and assisting skills results in a wage penalty for low-wage workers but a wage premium for workers in high-wage and male occupations. By identifying the impact of gender and class on the economic return to particular caring skills, the study broadens the understanding of care work, especially in relation to US wage inequality.","[Pietrykowski, Bruce] Univ Michigan, Social Sci Econ, 4901 Evergreen Rd, Dearborn, MI 48128 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Pietrykowski, B (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Social Sci Econ, 4901 Evergreen Rd, Dearborn, MI 48128 USA.",bpie@umich.edu,,,,,,,56,14,14,2,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Moreover, the suicide rate in Spain went up by more than 9 % with respect to the previous year. This increase could be related to the serious economic recession that Spain has been experiencing in recent years. In this sense, there is a lack of evidence to help assess to what extent these suicides have a social cost in terms of losses in human capital. Firstly, this article examines the relationship between the variables related to the economic cycle and the suicide rates in the 17 Spanish regions. Secondly, an estimate is made of the losses in labour productivity owing to these suicides. In this article, panel data models are used to consider different variables related to the economic cycle. Demographic variables and the suicide rates for regions across Spain from 2002 to 2013 also come into play. The present and future production costs owing to premature death from suicide are calculated using a human capital model. These costs are valued from the gross salary that an individual no longer receives in the future at the very moment he or she leaves the labour market. The results provide a strong indication that a decrease in economic growth and an increase in unemployment negatively affect suicide rates. Due to suicide, 38,038 potential years of working life were lost in 2013. This has an estimated cost of over 565 million euros. The economic crisis endured by Spain in recent years has played a role in the higher suicide rates one can observe from the data in official statistics. From a social perspective, suicide is a public health problem with far-reaching consequences.","[Rivera, Berta; Casal, Bruno] Univ A Coruna, Dept Appl Econ, Fac Econ & Business, La Coruna, Spain; [Casal, Bruno] Univ A Coruna, Univ Coll Labour Relat, La Coruna, Spain; [Currais, Luis] Univ A Coruna, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ Anal & Business Adm, La Coruna, Spain",Universidade da Coruna; Universidade da Coruna; Universidade da Coruna,"Rivera, B (通讯作者)，Univ A Coruna, Dept Appl Econ, Fac Econ & Business, La Coruna, Spain.",berta@udc.es,"Casal, Bruno/HJZ-4664-2023; Casal, Bruno/AAU-9018-2020; Rivera, Berta/AAQ-4015-2021; Currais, Luis/AAO-6682-2021","Casal, Bruno/0000-0003-4888-2527; Rivera, Berta/0000-0002-0687-9883; Currais, Luis/0000-0001-8488-8921",[ECON2013-48217-C2-2R],,"The authors would like to acknowledge the support received from the research project ECON2013-48217-C2-2R Impacto economico, sanitario y social de las enfermedades y los problemas de salud: informacion y herramientas para la evaluacion de politicas publicas.",,86,20,20,2,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Additionally, it provides a review of using open access software matching procedure using modern quantitative approach towards evaluating employment program. The availability of open access software matching procedures nowadays makes it possible to estimate the causal effects for the employment programs. The usual critique on the effectiveness of the employment programs is that such programs are not effective and are not meeting the goals (the most evident goal is exits into employment and termination of unemployment benefits). What is more, the culture of program evaluation is on very low level and the need is to develop independent evaluation. Therefore, the implementation of impact evaluation in practice can help strengthen the evidence base for development policies and programs and adds to more effective spending of resources and improve people's lives.","[Rotar, Laura Juznik] Fac Business Management & Informat, Novo Mesto, Slovenia",,"Rotar, LJ (通讯作者)，Fac Business Management & Informat, Novo Mesto, Slovenia.",laura_juznik@yahoo.com,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,216,221,,,,,,6,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6MR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426857700022,0

Since gold market always has been interesting for traders, many of traders with various beliefs were highly active in gold market. The competition among two agents of traders, namely trend followers and rational agents, to gain the highest profit in gold market is formulated as a dynamic evolutionary game, where, the evolutionary equilibrium is considered to be the solution to this game. Furthermore, genetic algorithm is being used to find the unknown parameters of the model, so that we could maximize the fitness of the proposed multi agent model and the gold market daily price data. Besides the evolutionary game dynamic, we proposed a new method for modeling rational expectations using recurrent neural network. The evolutionarily stable strategies is proven despite the prediction error of the expectation.

Many studies have demonstrated that women-led farms perform less well as a result of less access to production factors, but no studies focus on how women perform without this constraint. This study fills that gap by analyzing the case of cotton cropping, which is known for its high labor requirements, high production inputs, and need for technical knowledge. Using primary data collected in northern China over the 2006-9 period, it uses the concept of Daily Crop Management (DCM) and identifies DCM farms managed by women whose husbands were engaged in off-farm activities on a long-term basis. The study finds that one-third of all farms were female-DCM farms, that these were smaller than those of their male counterparts but had equal access to production factors and achieved equal if not better technical and economic performances.","[Wang, Guiyan] Agr Univ Hebei, Agron, Baoding, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Fok, Michel] CIRAD, Montpellier, France",Hebei Agricultural University; CIRAD,"Wang, GY (通讯作者)，Agr Univ Hebei, Agron, Baoding, Hebei, Peoples R China.",guiyanwang@sina.com; michel.fok@cirad.fr,"Yang, Min/JPY-3791-2023","FOK, Michel/0000-0001-8709-5687","CIRAD; Hebei Agricultural University; Education Department of Hebei province, China [SZ124019]","CIRAD; Hebei Agricultural University; Education Department of Hebei province, China","The research has been conducted in the framework of the cooperation between CIRAD and Hebei Agricultural University since 2003.

The central issue of the puzzle is how to reconcile volatile short-term movements of real exchange rates (defined as nominal exchange rates adjusted for differences in national price levels) with very slow convergence to the parity condition. The main emphasis of this article is to show that the slow adjustment of the natural exchange rate is responsible for the well-known slow convergence of the real exchange rate to the long-run parity condition. The novel element of this article is to identify the relative importance between the financial channel and output gap channel of the purchasing power parity puzzle. The empirical findings of this article suggest that the financial channel is a dominant factor to explain persistent deviations of the real exchange rate from its long-run level.","[Yun, Tack] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Yun, T (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",tackyun@snu.ac.kr,,,National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2014S1A3A2044637],National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government),I acknowledge that this work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government (number NRF-2014S1A3A2044637).,,33,0,2,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

It was a long process, in which both foreign managers and Chinese businessmen learned a lot. Since the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949 until 1978, there was no presence of foreign companies and investments at the Chinese market. During this period, China was focused on domestic development with domestic resources along with the state planned economy. So it was difficult to completely change the way of functioning of the Chinese economy and to have a successful cooperation with foreign companies and investors, when China opened its market to foreign investments. Since the opening of Chinese market, foreign companies used the only possible way to enter this market and that was joint venture. After Chinese Government pulled out this restriction for operating on its market, international companies used many different strategies to operate in China. Then, ten years ago, a reverse process began, in which now strong Chinese companies started to enter different international markets. Chinese companies are increasingly becoming important international business competitors, having enterprises or subsidiaries in countries such as the United States of America, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Sweden etc. In their process of growing and going abroad, the Chinese companies are using different strategies for doing their business - such as mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures or, if possible, direct investments. The aim of this paper is to show how Chinese companies from different business fields first succeeded in China and after that to reveal what type of strategies they were using when entering global markets. It will be shown that, besides direct export, which was the most important strategy of Chinese companies in former times, they are changing their approach and nowadays they are becoming more versatile in doing their business abroad.","[Zakic, Katarina] John Naisbitt Univ, Belgrade, Serbia",,"Zakic, K (通讯作者)，John Naisbitt Univ, Belgrade, Serbia.",kzakic@naisbitt.edu.rs; bojan.radisic87@gmail.com,,"Zakic, Katarina/0000-0002-6091-8433",,,,,7,0,0,0,8,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,169,180,,,,,,12,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ2BZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418819000018,0

In 2011, Wisconsin enacted the Budget Repair Bill, or Act 10, which significantly limited the power of teachers' unions in the state by restricting their fundraising abilities and limiting the scope of collective bargaining. Exploiting plausibly exogenous variation in the timing of exposure to Act 10 due to differences in the expiration dates of pre-existing collective bargaining agreements across school districts, I find that the law reduced average test scores on the state's standardized exam by approximately 20% of a standard deviation. Results from quantile regressions indicate that this effect was largely driven by declines in the lower half of the student achievement distribution. Lastly, the study explores plausible mechanisms behind the observed decline in achievement, and presents evidence that the law led to a significant increase in teacher turnover and a large reduction in teacher salaries.","[Baron, E.

Our identification strategy is based on some institutional features of the Italian educational system establishing a minimum number of students per class. Classes that do not reach the minimum number of pupils are organized in multigrade classes. In addition, the Italian law also establishes a maximum number of students for multigrade classes, which implies that class size in multigrade classes is very similar to class size in small single grade classes with a number of students just above the minimum size. Using census data on 5th grade Italian students, we find that pupils in multigrade classrooms obtain worse test scores both in literacy and numeracy standardised tests compared to comparable pupils in single grade classroom. While the effect is small and not always statistically significant for the literacy score, we find a large and highly statistically significant effect on the numeracy score. We also find that pupils placed in multigrade classes tend to have a more external centred locus of control. Our results are robust to different specifications including controls for class size and a number of student and school characteristics.","[Checchi, Daniele] Univ Milan, Milan, Italy; [Checchi, Daniele; De Paola, Maria] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [De Paola, Maria] Univ Calabria, Dept Econ Stat & Finance, Calabria, Italy",University of Milan; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Calabria,"De Paola, M (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.;De Paola, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calabria, Dept Econ Stat & Finance, Calabria, Italy.",m.depaola@unical.it,"Checchi, Daniele/AAN-2075-2020; Checchi, Daniele/AAL-7289-2020","Checchi, Daniele/0000-0001-7466-8562;",,,,,32,5,6,2,10,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0272-7757,1873-7382,,ECON EDUC REV,Econ.

We argue that spatial planning must be understood broadly to discern its effects on community resiliency, with resiliency understood as the coordination of spatial organization. Planning, then, is crucial at two stages of development: in the choice of a settlement model and afterwards in the spatial embodiment of that model.

This paper mainly examines the role of participatory tools and techniques with the potential to identify the level of vulnerability and likely adaptation measures to increase the forest resilience capacities of communities where CAPA has been prepared (i.e. CAPA group). In total, 13 participatory qualitative tools were evaluated against 15 criteria for identifying their performance in nine CAPA groups representing three geo-graphical regions of Nepal. Multivariate analyses of the participatory tools and their performance allowed for selecting the most similar and dissimilar CAPA groups. The results indicated how CAPA groups are evaluating the likelihood of climate change impact, determining the vulnerability of specific ecosystem services and understanding the possible local adaptation measures. Many methods do not offer conditions for exploiting new innovative opportunities, assessing scenarios or identifying ecosystem services in the CAPA process. Tools are required that consider qualitative and quantitative evaluation methods, measure vulnerability and ecosystem functions and services. Although many issues related to local conditions and vulnerabilities have not been tapped adequately, it is difficult to generalize individual case study results within the different geographical contexts of Nepal. The integration of adaptation planning in local institutions, in order to deal with different ecosystem-based adaptation options, along with identification of climate change scenarios, impacts, trade-offs, synergies and the sensitivity of management problems, is highly recommended.","[Khadka, Chiranjeewee; Edwards-Jonasova, Magda; Cudlin, Pavel] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Global Change Res Inst, Lipova 9, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; [Aryal, Keshava Prasad; Upadhyaya, Anju] Nat & Org Resource Management Serv NORMS Pvt Ltd, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Dhungana, Nabin] CARE Nepal Cent Off, 4-288 SAMATA Bhawan,POB 1661, Lalitpur, Nepal; [Vacik, Harald] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Dept Forest & Soil Sci, Inst Silviculture, Vienna, Austria","Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Khadka, C (通讯作者)，Acad Sci Czech Republic, Global Change Res Inst, Lipova 9, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic.",khadka.c@czechglobe.cz,"Khadka, Chiranjeewee/E-2163-2015; Vacik, Harald/B-1185-2009","Dhungana, Nabin/0000-0001-8112-7537; Vacik, Harald/0000-0002-5668-6967","CARE/Nepal; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of Czech Republic within the National Sustainability Program I (NPU I) [LO1415]","CARE/Nepal; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of Czech Republic within the National Sustainability Program I (NPU I)","The authors would like to thank for the valuable comments of anonymous reviewers which helped to shape the key messages of the manuscript.

Both tests reject the hypothesis that the distribution of damages is thin tailed at the 95% confidence level, even after correcting for inflation and growth in population and per capita income. Our point estimates of the shape parameter of the damage distribution indicate that the distribution has finite mean, but infinite variance. In the second part of the paper, we develop a microfoundations model of insurance and storm size that generates a fat tail in aggregate tropical cyclone damages. The distribution of the number of properties within a random geographical area that lies in the path of a tropical cyclone is shown to drive fat tailed storm damages, and we confirm that the distribution of coastal city population is fat tailed in the US. We show empirically and theoretically that other random variation, such as the distribution of storm strength and the distribution of damages across individual properties, does not generate a fat tail. We consider policy options such as climate change abatement, policies which encourage adaptation, reducing subsidies for coastal development, and disaster relief policies, which distort insurance markets. Such policies can reduce the thickness of the tail, but do not affect the shape parameter or the existence of the fat tail. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Optimal harvesting selectivity aims to direct fishing towards age classes that are preferable to catch given information on fish growth, natural mortality, and recruitment in addition to implications on harvesting cost. We analytically show that maximum sustainable yield (MSY) leads to potentially serious and previously unrecognized deviation from economic optimality, as it neglects the dependence of harvesting costs on gear selectivity. We further show that the steady-state population level may fall below the MSY population even with zero discounting and stock dependent harvesting costs. We quantify our results using empirical data for Baltic cod. Applying the age-structured model with endogenous harvesting selectivity, we find large differences between maximum sustainable yield and the economic optimum, although the classic biomass model suggests that these differences should be unimportant.

In other European countries, such ways of non-profit making work in non-governmental organisations are summarised under the term civil sector. The paper sets out to examine the specific challenges and success factors for social innovation (SI) in the forest sector at hand of two community centres located in Welsh Woodlands: The Woodlands Skills Centre and Coppice Wood College. These are both cases for social innovations as many of their activities and services have the explicit goal to meet social needs; their organisation is inclusive and participatory towards civil society actors. Both are community forestry enterprises with many similarities. Both projects have reached successful levels of rural empowerment and are bringing livelihood and income to their areas. Notwithstanding their similarities, our in-depth research detects specific differences in the organisations, namely their legal status and their different business models at the organisational level. Both initiatives are relatively long term projects with complex governance structures, but very different ownership structures, different financial maintenance and a different conceptualisation of the services and goods they provide. Our insights contribute with examples of two in-depth empirical case studies to general research on community forestry and to research on social innovation, namely to the procedural determinants of origin and support factors of innovation. For policy and practice the support of SI in forestry is relevant especially for regional development in rural areas.","[Ludvig, Alice; Weiss, Gerhard] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Forest Environm & Nat Resource Policy, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Vienna BOKU, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria; [Ludvig, Alice; Weiss, Gerhard] European Forest Inst Cent Eastern European Reg Of, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria; [Wilding, Maria; Thorogood, Adam] Llais & Goedwig, Unit Dyfi Eco Parc 6, Machynlleth SY20 8AX, Powys, Wales","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Ludvig, A (通讯作者)，Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Forest Environm & Nat Resource Policy, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Vienna BOKU, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria.;Ludvig, A (通讯作者)，European Forest Inst Cent Eastern European Reg Of, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria.",alice.ludvig@boku.ac.at,"Ludvig, Alice/ABF-3048-2020","Ludvig, Alice/0000-0003-1323-2276",SIMRA [677622]; [FP7-KBBE-2012-6- STARTREE],SIMRA;,"This research has been partly funded by Grant Agreement No. 677622 (H2020, EU Commission) SIMRA, and by grant agreement No. FP7-KBBE-2012-6- STARTREE single stage for the European Commission.

The distance between each property and the nearest CE, and between each pair of properties, are calculated and used to find spatial dependence. Results show that the total number of CEs in properties' surrounding areas enhances property values. In addition, the proximity to CE-protected open space after the CEs are established have positive price effects on the surrounding properties, and this effect diminishes with distance.","[Zhang, Weiyi; Mei, Bin; Izlar, Robert L.] Univ Georgia, Harley Langdale Jr Ctr Forest Business, Warne Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Mei, B (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Harley Langdale Jr Ctr Forest Business, Warne Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",bmei@uga.edu,"Zhang, Weiyi/U-5270-2019","Zhang, Weiyi/0000-0002-0104-9768",Appraisers Research Foundation [R15-058],Appraisers Research Foundation,The Appraisers Research Foundation (Grant R15-058) funded this research project.,,30,8,14,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,AUG,2018,93.0,,,,,,30,35,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.05.008,0.0,,,6,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GM5LY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000438180100004,0

Two differences-in-differences (DiD) models are used to examine the causal effects of management on price and revenue. A hedonic price model finds that the IFQ program had minimal direct effects on prices. A landings composition model finds that the IFQ program increased landings of the largest scallops. The Limited Access fleet, which lands most of the scallops in the region and is managed primarily with input controls, serves as a control for both models.

Local and foreign business entities, while in agreement that Halal assurance through certification and labelling is important for Muslim consumers, have expressed their anxiety over whether such requirements will mean extra costs, particularly for small and medium enterprises. At the same time, the mandatory labelling regime involves several WTO issues under the TBT Agreement, which raise questions regarding Indonesia's compliance with its obligations. As a defence, Indonesia could argue that its mandatory halal labelling measure falls under the exception for protecting 'public morals'. The WTO panel in the US-Gambling dispute noted that the meaning of 'public morals' and 'public order' varied depending on a range of factors, including prevailing social, cultural, ethical, and religious values. Should the WTO allow all types of moral and religious belief, even if they restrict trade? How can public moral policy objectives be applied in ways that do not violate WTO law? This paper seeks to examine the WTO consistency of the new Indonesian Halal Act, and whether the public moral objective underlying mandatory halal certification/labelling can be defended as an exception in the context of the TBT Agreement.","[Limenta, Michelle; Edis, Bayan M.; Fernando, Oscar] Univ Pelita Harapan, Ctr Int Trade & Investment, Tangerang, Indonesia",Universitas Pelita Harapan,"Limenta, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pelita Harapan, Ctr Int Trade & Investment, Tangerang, Indonesia.",michelle.limenta@uph.edu; bayanedis@gmail.com; oscar.fernando@uph.edu,,,Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO)/World Trade Institute (WTI) Academic Cooperation Project,Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO)/World Trade Institute (WTI) Academic Cooperation Project,"Thanks for valuable comments from Christian Haberli, anonymous referees and seminar participants at the SIEL Biennial Conference 2016 at University of Witwatersrand Johannesburg, South Africa.

A key issue is the role of deterrence measures that penalise violations. Employment standards enforcement in Ontario, like in most jurisdictions, is based mainly on a compliance framework promoting voluntary resolution of complaints and, if that fails, ordering restitution. Deterrence measures that penalise violations are rarely invoked. However, the Ontario government has recently increased the role of proactive inspections and tickets, a low-level deterrence measure which imposes fines of CAD295 plus victim surcharges. In examining the effectiveness of the use of tickets in inspections, we begin by looking at this development in the broader context of employment standards enforcement and its historical trajectory. Then, using administrative data from the Ministry of Labour, we examine when and why tickets are issued in the course of workplace inspections. After demonstrating that even when ticketable violations are detected, tickets are issued only rarely, we explore factors associated with an increased likelihood of an inspector issuing a ticket. Finally, we consider how the overall deterrent effect of workplace inspections is influenced by the use or non-use of deterrence tools.","[Casey, Rebecca] York Univ, Closing Employment Stand Enforcement Gap Res Part, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Vosko, Leah F.] York Univ, Polit Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Vosko, Leah F.] York Univ, Polit Econ Gender & Work, 618 Kaneff Tower,4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada; [Tucker, Eric] Osgoode Hall Law Sch, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Noack, Andrea M.] Ryerson Univ, Sociol, Toronto, ON, Canada",York University - Canada; York University - Canada; York University - Canada; York University - Canada; Toronto Metropolitan University,"Vosko, LF (通讯作者)，York Univ, Polit Econ Gender & Work, 618 Kaneff Tower,4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.",lvosko@yorku.ca,"Tucker, Eric/R-3759-2019","Tucker, Eric/0000-0002-9958-4311; Casey, Rebecca/0009-0007-5100-3956; Noack, Andrea/0000-0003-2087-5093",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC),Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"The research for this article was funded by a partnership grant, titled 'Closing the Employment Standards Enforcement Gap: Improving Protections for People in Precarious Jobs', funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC).",,28,6,6,1,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

'Pipeline' theories attribute these patterns to a male advantage in mathematics, but our longitudinal analysis, using administrative data on a full cohort of students in Victoria, Australia, shows that these patterns remain intact after conditioning on prior achievement. Female students require stronger prior signals of mathematical ability to choose male-dominated subjects, and when choosing these subjects earn higher average scores than males, suggesting a possible loss of efficiency. Previous research has shown that socio-economic disadvantage adversely affects boys more than girls, and indeed we find less of a male advantage in physics and advanced mathematics among socially disadvantaged students. We find that students with a language background other than English choose STEM fields with greater frequency than other students, reflecting their comparative advantage, while exhibiting more markedly gendered subject choices, indicating a role for cultural factors. Finally, we find significantly less gender streaming in STEM subjects among female students in all-girl schools than in co-educational schools, but no such difference for male students.","[Justman, Moshe] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Ruppin Acad Ctr, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Justman, Moshe] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Econ, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Mendez, Susan J.] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, 111 Barry St, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",Ruppin Academic Center; Ben Gurion University; Ben Gurion University; University of Melbourne,"Méndez, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, 111 Barry St, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",susan.mendez@unimelb.edu.au,"; Mendez, Susan/I-7222-2015","Justman, Moshe/0000-0002-5455-0943; Mendez, Susan/0000-0002-1233-3158",,,,,50,19,29,0,42,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0272-7757,1873-7382,,ECON EDUC REV,Econ.

Females' relative lack of academic self-confidence explains 8%, while other-regarding preferences and professional goals capture a further 14%.

However, through government intervention in the form of an integrated reforestation policy and programs, both countries have restored their degraded forestlands and increased their forest cover. We analyzed the reforestation policy and programs implemented in Ghana using the theory of policy integration and compared it to the successful case of the ROK. We observed that Ghana used the vertical policy integration approach to drive forest transition, unlike the ROK, which used the horizontal policy integration approach. Both countries used similar strategies to implement the integrated reforestation policy and programs, including coordinated national forestation plans, collaboration among ministries and departments, and organizational reform. This integrated approach facilitated the successful implementation of the reforestation programs in Ghana and the ROK. Government intervention through an integrated reforestation policy and programs is an innovative way to slow the rate of deforestation and enhance economic development. This paper may contribute to the literature on how reforestation policy integration can reduce deforestation and achieve forest transition, especially in developing countries.","[Andoh, Jewel; Lee, Yohan] Yeungnam Univ, Pk Chung Hee Sch Policy & Saemaul, Dept Sustainable Dev, 280 Daehak Ro, Gyongsan 38541, Gyeongsanbuk Do, South Korea",Yeungnam University,"Lee, Y (通讯作者)，Yeungnam Univ, Pk Chung Hee Sch Policy & Saemaul, Dept Sustainable Dev, 280 Daehak Ro, Gyongsan 38541, Gyeongsanbuk Do, South Korea.",johnlee@yu.ac.kr,,"Andoh, Jewel/0000-0002-7824-6428",Yeungnam University; R&D Program for Forest Science Technology by Korea Forest Service (Korea Forestry Promotion Institute) [2013069E10-1719-AA03],Yeungnam University; R&D Program for Forest Science Technology by Korea Forest Service (Korea Forestry Promotion Institute),"We wish to express our appreciation to all the anonymous referees who took time to review this article and provide thoughtful comments.

Using longitudinal administrative data from the Opportunity New York City-Family Rewards study (n = 2182) and child fixed-effects models, we examine the role of stability of household income on student level attendance of 4th, 7th and 9th graders as they transition through elementary, middle, and high school, respectively. Family income volatility varies across and within these developmental stages of children, even among this low-income sample. Consistent with prior research, higher income was associated with better school attendance in all grades. But, interestingly, high income volatility is associated with worse school attendance among 4th and 7th graders, relative to stable income or moderate levels of income volatility. This finding contributes to emerging studies seeking to identify whether income volatility has distinct influences on children's school-related outcomes.","[Gennetian, Lisa A.; Rodrigues, Christopher; Morris, Pamela A.] NYU, Inst Human Dev & Social Change, Kimball Hall,246 Greene St,Floor 5E, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Hill, Heather D.] Univ Washington, Daniel J Evans Sch Publ Policy & Governance, Parrington Hall,4100 15th Ave NE, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",New York University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Gennetian, LA (通讯作者)，NYU, Inst Human Dev & Social Change, Kimball Hall,246 Greene St,Floor 5E, New York, NY 10003 USA.",lg1864@nyu.edu; cr1390@nyu.edu; hdhill@uw.edu; pamela.morris@nyu.edu,"Hill, Heather/HKW-4759-2023","Hill, Heather D./0000-0002-8750-2649",William T.

The paper describes five eras of participation; (1) the participatory-turn, when post-Rio programme model was initiated; (2) the creation and (3) establishment of RFP as a policy instrument that applies forest councils as deliberative forum, and Is conducted synchronously with National Programmes. Many scientific studies focused on the RFP process in earlier phases raised scepticism on the capability of the institution to fully serve its purposes. Reconsideration of programme practices started by (4) a search of an ideal model for participation procedures, but ended up to the ongoing era that can be labelled either as a (5) participatory downturn or as a strategic-turn, depending on the political position regarding to forest programme, i.e. if the programme is viewed from the implementation or social choice approach. A praxis story of the paper demonstrates sceptical findings on potentials of nonnative planning studies to contribute sustainable changes in participatory forest policy processes. The central role of power is to be more properly understood in the forthcoming studies and institutional developments.","[Tikkanen, Jukka] Univ Eastern Finland, Sch Forest Sci, Yliopistokatu 7, Joensuu 80100, Finland",University of Eastern Finland,"Tikkanen, J (通讯作者)，Univ Eastern Finland, Sch Forest Sci, Yliopistokatu 7, Joensuu 80100, Finland.",jukka.tikkanen@uef.fi,,,,,,,124,7,7,2,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,APR,2018,89.0,,,,SI,,87,97,,10.1016/j.forpol.2017.04.009,0.0,,,11,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GD8IN,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430756200011,0

We estimate the labour supply curve for long-haul truck drivers in the United States, applying two-stage least squares regression to a national survey of truck drivers. We start with the standard model of the labour supply curve and then develop two novel extensions of it, incorporating pay level and pay method, and testing the target earnings hypothesis. We distinguish between long-haul and short-haul jobs driving commercial motor vehicles. Truck and bus drivers choose between long-distance jobs requiring very long hours of work away from home and short-distance jobs generally requiring fewer hours. The labour supply curve exhibits a classic backward bending shape, reflecting drivers' preference to work until they reach target earnings. Above target earnings, at a safe rate' for truck drivers, they trade labour for leisure, working fewer hours, leading to greater highway safety. Drivers work fewer hours at a higher pay rate and likely have less fatigue. Pay rates also have implications for driver health because worker health deteriorates as working time exceeds 40hours.","[Belzer, Michael H.] Wayne State Univ, Wayne, NJ USA; [Sedo, Stanley A.] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Wayne State University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Belzer, MH (通讯作者)，Wayne State Univ, Dept Econ, 2074 Fac Adm Bldg,656 W Kirby St, Detroit, MI 48202 USA.",Michael.H.Belzer@wayne.edu,"Belzer, Michael/N-5789-2019","Belzer, Michael/0000-0001-7069-5838",Sloan Foundation; FMCSA,Sloan Foundation(Alfred P.

We find that an increase in dry-season rainfall leads to an increase in agricultural production and dampens conflict intensity. By contrast, an increase in wet-season rainfall is harmful to crops and produces more conflict. Consistent with the hypothesis that rebel groups gain strength after a bad harvest, we find that negative rainfall shocks lead to an increase in conflict incidents initiated by insurgents but not by government forces. These results suggest that the predicted shift towards wetter wet seasons and drier dry seasons will lead to more civil conflict even if annual rainfall totals remain stable. We conclude that policies aimed at mitigating the effect of climate change on agriculture could have the added benefit of reducing civil conflict. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This tests the conditions under which school choice induces healthy competition between public and private schools through the threat of student exit. Using unique data from parent applications to as many as eight different schools (including traditional public, charter, and private schools), we find that many parents include a mix of public and private schools among their preferences, often ranking public schools alongside or even above private schools on a unified application. Parents who list both public and private schools show a preference for the private sector, all else equal, and are willing to accept lower school performance scores for private schools than otherwise equivalent public options. These parents reveal a stronger preference for academic outcomes than other parents and place less value on other school characteristics such as sports, arts, or extended hours.

When students are drawn from a population distribution into a class, their realized distribution of abilities is predictably linked to the size of the class. Increasing the class size draws students' percentile ranks closer to their population percentiles. Since grades are awarded based on percentile ranks in the class, this reallocates incentives for effort between students with different abilities. The predicted aggregate effort and the predicted effort from high-ability students increases while the predicted effort from low-ability students decreases. Andreoni and Brownback (2017) find that the size of a contest has a causal impact on the aggregate effort from participants and the distribution of effort among heterogeneous agents. In this paper, I randomly assign class sizes to quizzes in an economics course to test these predictions in a real-stakes environment.

Understanding the images of the future of young people provides a beneficial source of information not only about their probable future actions but also about their current motivations, decisions and choices. This article describes the procedure of exploring the images of the future of a group of young adults from different cultural backgrounds who are Bachelor and Master's degree students in Finland. Due to the intricate nature of the images of the future and also the existent complexity within the current societal context, this study proposes that investigation of the images of the future demands a refined, subtle selection of methods. During this study, a combination of several interview techniques is employed to collect the qualitative research material. Then Causal Layered Analysis (CLA) is utilized as a multi-layered theoretical framework for qualitative content analysis of the material. The results include four images of the future which reflect on different levels of the young adults' understandings and feelings. The first image, Living With the Chill, displays the most pessimistic view of the future and the fourth, Imagine ... !, is the most optimistic one. Two other images, Fear and Hope, and Life as a Chance for Dedication, are moderate, not very optimistic, nor very pessimistic. The images of the future of the participants of this study suggest that young adults tend to define the future in terms of presence or absence of the current societal concerns and do not seem to exceed this framework. They also indicate that the studied young adults' radically negative or positive approach toward the future have reduced their perceived locus of control. We conclude that using CLA in the analysis of interview material produces a fruitful, rich, in-depth understanding of the images of the future.","[Kaboli, Seyedeh Akhgar; Tapio, Petri] Univ Turku, Finland Futures Res Ctr, FI-20014 Turku, Finland",University of Turku,"Kaboli, SA (通讯作者)，Univ Turku, Finland Futures Res Ctr, FI-20014 Turku, Finland.",seakka@utu.fi,,,FutWend project [297742]; Academy of Finland; Turku University Foundation,FutWend project; Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); Turku University Foundation,"This article is dedicated to the memory of Dr. Anita Rubin who gave help in the beginning of the research process before passing away.

The less well-known fact is that the restored economic growth doesn't generate the new work force with the longer delay and almost in the smaller, i.e. insufficient, extent. The main focus of this article is just on the youthful. In the Czech Republic and in the European Union as well we can see that there is a direct proportion between the education and ability to find employment. The worst situation can be monitored in the south of Europe where the unemployment of the youthful (i.e. Spain) is above 50% and makes more than 30% of the total unemployment. The tertiary education increases employment rate of youthful but not in the same range. The difference is among the economical, technical, medical and art specialization.","[Adamek, Petr] Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, W Churchill Sq 1938-4, Prague, Czech Republic; [Dobrylovsky, Jiri] Univ Econ & Management, Narozni 2600-9A, Prague 5, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Adámek, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, W Churchill Sq 1938-4, Prague, Czech Republic.",adamek@vse.cz; jiri.dobrylovsky@vsem.cz,,,,,,,13,1,1,0,3,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,20,29,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400003,0

After accounting for the effects global shocks, we find that several factors facilitate adjustment to shocks in middle-income countries.

However, modern databases, online information and knowledge sharing, and increased access points for e-banking transactions opened opportunities for sophisticated fraudsters to perpetrate and abuse customers in their social, cyber and physical worlds. The intensification in cases of fraud presents tremendous challenges for the banking sector to caution, educate and inform customers on cybercrime because it reflects the synthetic and integrative use of the interaction between resources which include the fraudster's intelligence abuse in the social world, the abuse of knowledge resources and technology in the cyber world and the abuse of resources and trading tools in the physical world. Most studies focus on the detection of fraud patterns through tapping in data warehouses of third-party or by using data mining programs to identify fraud patterns, specifically credit cards, computer intrusion and mobile communication or first-party fraud when a legitimate customer knowingly betrays the bank. This study focuses on the prevention of fraud that falls into two main categories, namely: phishing/vishing/SMishing and malware practices (any activity of payment fraud where fraudsters gain access and uses customer' accounts for their own unlawful financial benefit); and identity theft (gaining access to or opening new accounts in the customer's name). The main premises of the research problem are built on the fact that a lack of studies exists to investigate the use of proactive communication through the three typologies of knowledge management to create awareness and educate customers on e-security measures and prevention of e-banking fraud where the move towards (co)liability should not impede but enhance customer relationship building. The research is conducted through a qualitative research methodology and the subject under study was the website of the South African Banking Risk Information Centre (SABRIC) purposefully sampled. The three concurrent cyclical flow of activity of the data analysis interactive model was used in the research. An abductive approach was used to report on the findings based on descriptions and interpretive comments relating it to and drawing on the theoretical thrusts identified. Main findings suggest, inter alia, the importance to proactively educate customers on how to protect themselves before they fall, victim, the importance of visibility on security measures, methods and standards for e-banking, and the move towards a (co)liability policy and shared responsibility process.","[Barker, Rachel] Univ South Africa, POB 395, ZA-0003 Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa,"Barker, R (通讯作者)，Univ South Africa, POB 395, ZA-0003 Pretoria, South Africa.",barker@unisa.ac.za,"Barker, Rachel/B-1003-2019",,,,,,21,0,0,0,8,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,656,672,,,,,,17,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200058,0

Firms located in country 1 can decide to offshore their manufacturing activities to country 2. The profitability of production in a country depends on several factors: unitary costs of production, the number of firms that are located in each country, within-country spillovers, and cross-border spillovers. Furthermore, profits in country 2 are influenced by congestion costs. Country 1 is assumed to be technologically advanced and has an advantage in terms of internal spillovers. In contrast, country 2 offers lower production unit cost which, however, may be offset by congestion costs. The firms' (re)location choices are based on a simple comparison of current production costs obtained in the two countries and the dynamics of switching is modeled by a simple replicator dynamics. The global analysis of the resulting one-dimensional dynamical system reveals that a large advantage in terms of unitary production costs encourages the firms to off-shore manufacturing activities to country 2. This off-shoring process stops when congestion costs offset this advantage of country 2, even though congestion costs do not cause all manufacturing activities to be re-shored to country 1. The re-shoring process can be accelerated by an increase of within-country spillovers in country 1, while cross-border spillovers tend to favor a geographic dispersion of manufacturing activities and make location patterns that lead to suboptimal long run outcomes less likely.","[Bischi, Gian Italo] Univ Urbino Carlo Bo, DESP, 42 Via Saffi, I-61029 Urbino, PU, Italy; [Kopel, Michael] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Inst Org & Econ Inst, Graz, Austria; [Lamantia, Fabio] Univ Calabria, Dept Econ Stat & Finance, 3C Via P Bucci, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy; [Lamantia, Fabio] Univ Manchester, Econ Sch Social Sci, Arthur Lewis Bldg, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Radi, Davide] LIUC Univ Cattaneo, Sch Econ & Management, 22 Cso Matteotti, I-21053 Castellanza, VA, Italy",University of Urbino; University of Graz; University of Calabria; University of Manchester; Universita Carlo Cattaneo - Liuc,"Radi, D (通讯作者)，LIUC Univ Cattaneo, Sch Econ & Management, 22 Cso Matteotti, I-21053 Castellanza, VA, Italy.",gian.bischi@uniurb.it; michael.kopel@uni-graz.at; fabio.lamantia@unical.it; dradi@liuc.it,"Radi, Davide/M-6403-2013; Radi, Davide/HHR-9023-2022; Kopel, Michael/AAF-1301-2020","Radi, Davide/0000-0001-7809-1166; Lamantia, Fabio/0000-0003-2147-0979","COST Action The EU in the new complex geography of economic systems: models, tools and policy evaluation; DESP-University of Urbino","COST Action The EU in the new complex geography of economic systems: models, tools and policy evaluation; DESP-University of Urbino","The authors thank the participants at the GeComplexity Conference in Crete 2016 for valuable comments and suggestions on an earlier draft of this paper.

By drawing on ethnographic material from the Icelandic fishing industry, this article demonstrates how fishers maneuver the boundaries of market-based resource management that tend to ignore the ever-changing environment of the sea. The empirical material shows how fishers skillfully manipulate their socio-technical environment in order to adjust the market for so-called Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQs) with the movement of fish stocks. Accordingly, three coping practices are deployed: (i) tinkering with accounts, (ii) socio-technical conversion, and (iii) redefining boundaries. While these practices allow fishers to stay afloat, they are likewise undermined by the ever-changing environment of the sea, consequently fueling a money-induced cycle of socio-technical problem-solving and breakdowns.","[Dobeson, Alexander] Uppsala Univ, Dept Sociol, Box 624, S-75126 Uppsala, Sweden",Uppsala University,"Dobeson, A (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, Dept Sociol, Box 624, S-75126 Uppsala, Sweden.",alexander.dobeson@soc.uu.se,,,European Research Council Starting Grant [ERC 263699-CEV],European Research Council Starting Grant(European Research Council (ERC)),This article was supported by a European Research Council Starting Grant [ERC 263699-CEV].,,63,3,3,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

The study reveals that three countries: Germany, Spain and Ireland are efficient when the relation between the investments in solar power and the volume of energy generated by solar farms is considered. However, when additional aspects of solar power efficiency are included different countries benefit. Inclusion of the environmental output reveals that efficiency increases the most in Poland, Malta, Bulgaria, Cyprus and the Czech Republic, where coal is the main energy source. Taking into account the economic aspect, i.e. the costs of generating energy from non-renewable energy sources, an increase in the efficiency scores is noted in countries in which oil (Malta and Cyprus), or natural gas (Lithuania, Belgium, Luxembourg) are used as the main energy source.","[Frodyma, Katarzyna; Papiez, Monika; Smiech, Slawomir] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Stat, Rakowicka 27 St, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Frodyma, K (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Stat, Rakowicka 27 St, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",frodymak@uek.krakow.pl; papiezm@uek.krakow.pl; smiechs@uek.krakow.pl,"Papież, Monika/I-3257-2018; Śmiech, Sławomir/I-3253-2018; Frodyma, Katarzyna/I-4596-2018","Papież, Monika/0000-0003-3597-2080;",Faculty of Management at Cracow University of Economics,Faculty of Management at Cracow University of Economics,"Publication was financed from the funds granted to the Faculty of Management at Cracow University of Economics, within the framework of the subsidy for the maintenance of research potential.",,14,1,1,0,3,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",2545-1227,,978-83-65907-20-2,SOC ECON MODEL FOREC,,,2018,1.0,,,,,,140,149,,10.14659/SEMF.2018.01.14,0.0,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BQ1LQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000576774700014,0

We show that in the most important export manufacturing industries of the NMS, the growth in exported value added was substantial, while the growth of the domestic component of GDP was mostly due to the growth in services. We associate growth of sectoral productivity with the foreign direct investment and exporting but, more importantly, with the position of a sector/country in the global value chains. We show that sectors that have imported intermediate goods have experienced higher productivity growth. Moreover, faster productivity growth was found in sectors further away from the final demand and in sectors exporting intermediate goods.","[Hagemejer, Jan] Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Ul Dluga 44-50, PL-02953 Warsaw, Poland; [Hagemejer, Jan] Narodowy Bank Polski, Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw; Narodowy Bank Polski,"Hagemejer, J (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Ul Dluga 44-50, PL-02953 Warsaw, Poland.",j.hagemejer@uw.edu.pl,"Hagemejer, Jan/G-6339-2013","Hagemejer, Jan/0000-0003-0775-3411",Narodowe Centrum Nauki [UMO-2013/09/D/HS4/01519],"Narodowe Centrum Nauki(National Science Centre, Poland)",This work was supported by the Narodowe Centrum Nauki: [Grant Number UMO-2013/09/D/HS4/01519].,,39,16,16,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The analysis applies a policy-based identification strategy to control for the endogenous relationship between paid leave entitlements and breastfeeding decisions. Estimates show that paid maternity leave has a strong positive effect on breastfeeding duration. Specifically, if the length of paid leave increases by thirty days, then the probability of breastfeeding for at least six months increases by 12 percentage points. Between 1988 and 2008, the average length of paid leave for mothers without a college education decreased by twenty-three days, which reduced these mothers' probability of breastfeeding for at least six months by 9 percentage points. These results support the view that paid maternity leave enhances the ability of employed women to sustain breastfeeding and call for universal paid leave entitlements.","[Jia, Nan] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Econ, 555 Liutai Ave, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Dong, Xiao-yuan] Univ Winnipeg, Econ, 515 Portage Ave, Winnipeg, MB R3B 2E9, Canada; [Song, Yue-ping] Renmin Univ China, Sociol & Populat Studies, 59 Zhongguancun Ave, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; University of Winnipeg; Renmin University of China,"Jia, N (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Econ, 555 Liutai Ave, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",jianancandy@swufe.edu.cn; x.dong@uwinnipeg.ca; songyueping@ruc.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71303189]; International Development Research Center of Canada [107579],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); International Development Research Center of Canada,The work was carried out with the aid of a grant from the International Development Research Center of Canada (Project no. 107579) and a grant from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 71303189).,,28,26,28,2,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

In this study, we focus on legitimacy seeking behaviour of companies from the controversial tobacco producer Philip Morris, Czech Republic. We perform content analysis of published annual reports to find features of pragmatic legitimacy, which attempts to convince the corporate stakeholders that behaviour of the said company is in line with current level of common social norms and usual behavioural patterns.

Introducing the concept of vice-related deficit, which aggregates the positive effects on public finance on the revenue side (cash inflows) and the negative effects on the expenditures side (cash outflows), the article looks upon cigarette, alcohol, and gasoline consumption as determinants of vice-related deficit for a number of 68 countries for year 2012. We found that smoking had a negative effect on vice-related budget balance, while alcohol and gasoline consumption had a positive effect. As control variables, we used life expectancy and size of the economy, both having been found with negative effects. The results prove robust to different sample adjustments. We also found that the negative effect of private vices on public finance is stronger for Christian countries than for non-Christian countries.

We first study firms' incentives for resistance management through pricing and we distinguish two cases of demand for pesticides; one where users are able to coordinate their pesticide use and one where they are not. We show that users benefit from coordination, but that this gain is at the expense of firms facing a lower demand. When firms are allowed to obtain scientific information on the likelihood of pest resistance and, possibly, to share this information among themselves, we find that they have an incentive to acquire information and to share it with competitors. They also benefit from transmitting this information to users if the latter are coordinated. In the case of uncoordinated users, transmission of information to users is not necessarily profitable for firms if it favors their coordination. Finally, we discuss the policy implications for existing information sharing committees in the pesticide industry. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Due to high latency and heavy burden on the backhaul links, traditional centralized network architecture cannot accommodate such challenges. Therefore, new architectures bring network functions to the edge of network, such as small-cell base stations and access point. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has been recognized as a promising technique to provide caching, computation and communication functionalities at the edge of cellular networks. In this paper, we first give an overview of mobile edge networks, including architecture and features. Next, a distributed and local-first computing (DLFC) model based on MEC is proposed, including distributed computing model and transmission model. Subsequently, the comparison between DLFC and centralized cloud computing (CCC) model is given and analyzed service delay and performance.

This conflict is evident in recent WTO disputes where renewable energy support mechanisms allegedly infringed WTO trade rules including the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement). Most of the literature looks at this conflict as a conflict between societal values, such as environment protection, and WTO-trade rules. This article takes a different look at this problem. Specifically, this article contends that both WTO-trade rules and international environmental law embrace environment protection as a 'common value'. Nevertheless, the fragmented nature of international law in the modern times gave rise to the phenomenon of 'self-contained regimes'. Both the WTO trade regime and international environmental rules are considered 'self-contained regimes' with unclear boundaries between each other as well as between each of them and the general body of international law. In short, the real conflict between WTO - trade rules and international environmental rules is a 'conflict of norms' rather than a 'conflict of values'.","[Raslan, Reem Anwar Ahmed] Cairo Univ, Fac Law, Business Law, Giza, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Cairo University,"Raslan, RAA (通讯作者)，Cairo Univ, Fac Law, Business Law, Giza, Egypt.",rraslan@post.harvard.edu,"Raslan, Reem/AAN-8909-2020",,,,,,55,2,2,1,6,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

The government and public expenditures for R&D are concentrated in a small number of the leading regions and also in those which are located closer to the industrial border. The regions beyond the borders of these technology intensive centers depend as a rule on less technological forms of innovation and on the technology transfer. We determined the following factors which are important for the regional growth: human capital, infrastructure, labour market, innovation, agglomerations interactions and productivity. As the factors characterizing the innovations we use the number of the issued patents, internal expenditures for the R&D, expenditures for technological innovations, number of employees involved in the R&D, volume of innovative goods, works and services and innovative activity of organizations. The innovations can have a positive impact on the long term growth. The data were collected in 83 regions of Russia in 2005-2015. The model of a regression with a constant elasticity was used. In the case when the impact of the competitive environment factors on the regional economic growth is significant it is difficult to assess the importance of the innovations. The division of the regions into groups according to the GDP per capita allows us showing the significant factors of their innovative growth. From the point of view of a practical application it is obvious that the regions with the development of the regions lower than average GDP per capita are expected to develop due to the innovations. Such institutional factors like management, leadership, efficient use of the potential available in the region are expected to take into account the active role of the innovations for the working force. Using as an example the Russian regions we showed that the provision of an innovative economic growth has a considerable impact for the regions with the level of the development lower than average and is less important for the explanation of the growth in other regions.","[Rastvortseva, Svetlana N.] Higher Sch Econ, Dept World Econ, Moscow, Russia; [Zemlyanskaya, Stella V.] Volgograd State Univ, Inst Econ & Finance, Dept Econ Theory World & Reg Econ, Volgograd, Russia; [Akimova, Olga E.] Volgograd State Tech Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Chair World Econ & Econ Theory, Volgograd, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); Volgograd State University (VOLSU); Volgograd State Technical University,"Rastvortseva, SN (通讯作者)，Higher Sch Econ, Dept World Econ, Moscow, Russia.",srastvortseva@gmail.com; zemlyanskayasv@volsu.ru; olafishka@mail.ru,"Rastvortseva, Svetlana/AAS-8915-2020","Rastvortseva, Svetlana/0000-0002-1599-359X",Russian Federation [NSh-3175.2018.6],Russian Federation(Russian Federation),"This paper was supported by the grant of the President of the Russian Federation, project No. NSh-3175.2018.6",,12,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-514-6,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,39.0,,,,,,623,629,,,,,,7,Business; Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BO4YG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000515721900127,0

In this context the choice of variables describing entrepreneurship conditions at the NUTS 3 level was the biggest limitation of the research. Due to availability of data it was possible to conduct dynamic research for the years 2010-2015. In the research taxonomic measure of development was assessed with application of TOPSIS method based on median vector Weber. The obtained values of taxonomic measure of development enabled to rank the NUTS 3 regions starting with the once characterised with the best conditions for entrepreneurs to the once with the worst conditions and to analyse the stability of the obtained results in time. The analysis indicates that relatively stable disparities at regional level in regard to entrepreneurial conditions can be considered as a significant problem for regional policy in Poland.","[Rogalska, Elzbieta] Univ Wamia & Mazury, Dept Microecon, Ul Plac Cieszynski 1, PL-10719 Olsztyn, Poland",,"Rogalska, E (通讯作者)，Univ Wamia & Mazury, Dept Microecon, Ul Plac Cieszynski 1, PL-10719 Olsztyn, Poland.",ela.n.rogalska@gmail.com,,"Rogalska, Elzbieta/0000-0003-4995-5791",,,,,19,0,0,0,1,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",2545-1227,,978-83-65907-20-2,SOC ECON MODEL FOREC,,,2018,1.0,,,,,,395,404,,10.14659/SEMF.2018.01.40,0.0,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BQ1LQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000576774700040,0

In practice, the Laspeyres price index is used to measure the CPI despite the fact that many economists consider the superlative indices to be the best approximation of COLI. The Fisher index is one of the superlative indices and, additionally, it satisfies most of tests from the axiomatic price index theory. Nevertheless, the Fisher price index makes use of current-period expenditure data and its usefulness in CPI measurement is limited. Lent and Dorfman (2009) show that a weighted average of the arithmetic and geometric Laspeyres indices (the so-called AG mean index) used as a proxy for the Fisher formula can provide a simple alternative to the Lloyd-Moulton index. To use the AG mean index in practice we have to approximate the right parameter being in the index's body. Theoretically, the parameter should not change rapidly over time since it denotes the elasticity of substitution. In the paper we apply the AG mean index for the Fisher index approximation using CPI data from the United Kingdom and Bulgaria. The main aim of the paper is to examine fluctuations in the estimated parameter and its dependence on the level of data aggregation.","[Roszko-Wojtowicz, Elzbieta] Univ Lodz, Dept Econ & Social Stat, Ul Rewolucji 1905 R 41, PL-90214 Lodz, Poland; [Bialek, Jacek] Univ Lodz, Dept Stat Methods, Ul Rewolucji 1905 R 41, PL-90214 Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz; University of Lodz,"Roszko-Wójtowicz, E (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Dept Econ & Social Stat, Ul Rewolucji 1905 R 41, PL-90214 Lodz, Poland.",eroszko33@gmail.com; jbialek@uni.lodz.pl,"Białek, Jacek/S-6879-2018; Białek, Jacek/AAX-5756-2020; Roszko-Wójtowicz, Elżbieta/AAD-4218-2019","Białek, Jacek/0000-0002-0952-5327; Białek, Jacek/0000-0002-0952-5327; Roszko-Wójtowicz, Elżbieta/0000-0001-9337-7218",National Science Centre in Poland [2017/25/B/HS4/00387],"National Science Centre in Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)",Authors of the paper would like to thank the National Science Centre in Poland for financing this publication (grant no. 2017/25/B/HS4/00387).,,15,0,0,0,0,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",2545-1227,,978-83-65907-20-2,SOC ECON MODEL FOREC,,,2018,1.0,,,,,,405,412,,10.14659/SEMF.2018.01.41,0.0,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BQ1LQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000576774700041,0

Nevertheless, managing a startup is often harsh, and the great majority fail soon after being founded. It is very hard for entrepreneurs to achieve success, and the star status achieved by a few of them reveals to be a mirage to barely every startup. It is therefore natural to recognise the importance of the incubators for these new, fresh, but fragile forms of businesses. Accordingly, this paper has the purpose to try to understand and evaluate the startups' expectations and what the incubator truthfully offers for their development, as well as to verify whether such expectations match with the reality offered. Furthermore, it is expected that this paper may have practical and social implications, as it attempts to contribute to the incubators' strategies and actions, allowing them to analyze externally and internally the needs and motivations of their incubates. Concurrently, this research presents also a valuable contribution for the startups and for the regions where they are headquartered. This work is actually based on the startups perspective, which will contribute to a more efficient and adapted relationship between startups and incubators, since it emphasizes on what they actually expect and perceive from the incubation process.","[Sousa, Joao; Meneses, Raquel] Univ Porto, FEP, Porto, Portugal; [Ribeiro, Humberto] Univ Aveiro, ESTGA, GOVCOPP, Aveiro, Portugal; [Alves, Sandra Raquel] Polytech Inst Leiria, ESTG, CIC, DIGITAL, Leiria, Portugal",Universidade do Porto; Universidade de Aveiro,"Sousa, J (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, FEP, Porto, Portugal.",joaopedropina15@gmail.com; raquelm@fep.up.pt; hnr@ua.pt; raquel.alves@ipleiria.pt,"Meneses, Raquel/K-1975-2012; Ribeiro, Humberto/AAJ-9053-2020","Ribeiro, Humberto/0000-0003-4747-1048",,,,,56,0,0,3,8,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,823,834,,,,,,12,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO8KK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000527683300092,0

However, without regularization, this mimicking behavior of the index-tracking model is susceptible to the volatility in the market index and has negative effects on the tracking portfolio. We recast the index-tracking optimization problem by applying a form of regularization using the convex combination of 11 and squared 12 norm constraints on the portfolio weights. The proposed optimization model enables us to control the tracking performance and the sparsity structure of the portfolio simultaneously. A sample of assets from Borsa Istanbul (BIST) is used to demonstrate the performance of the regularized portfolios with various levels of regularization. Results indicated that the regularized portfolios obtained using this approach had better tracking performances with a desired sparsity structure compared to the standard index-tracking portfolio where no regularization is applied.","[Tas, Engin; Turkan, Ayca Hatice] Afyon Kocatepe Univ, Fac Sci & Literature, Dept Stat, Afyon, Turkey",Afyon Kocatepe University,"Tas, E (通讯作者)，Afyon Kocatepe Univ, Fac Sci & Literature, Dept Stat, Afyon, Turkey.",engintas@aku.edu.tr; aturkan@aku.edu.tr,"Tas, Engin/HZJ-9079-2023; Atli, Ayca Hatice/GXZ-8041-2022","Tas, Engin/0000-0003-3644-0131; Atli, Ayca Hatice/0000-0002-4375-9733",,,,,18,3,3,1,7,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

As the competition in the cross-border E-commerce industry is increasingly fierce, the cross-border E-commerce industry has been subdivided into multiple operation modes gradually. In order to help the participants of cross-border E-commerce industry clarify the development status of Chinese cross-border E-commerce, and learn to deal with various specific issues in practice, this thesis will divide the cross-border E-commerce platform into two parts, the B2B Model and Retail Mode, compare and study the development, operation, logistics and storage, and payment of different platforms in different modes, then summarize and compare the features, advantages and disadvantages of the two different modes, and finally provide improvement suggestion combining the pain points of each mode. At last, this thesis summarizes the status quo of overall cross-border E-commerce platform at present and expects to make some contribution to development of future cross-border E-commerce platform. After comparative analysis on Chinese typical cross-border E-commerce platforms in the entire thesis, it is concluded that Chinese cross-border E-commerce platform shall still improve in aspects of logistics, storage, payment, policy and talent. Only in this way can Chinese cross-border E-commerce enterprises seize opportunity to develop rapidly and make the cross-border E-commerce become the driver of cross-border trade growth.","[Yao, Lei; Li, Yi-Yi; Yang, Zhuo-Chao] Beijing Inst Fash Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Institute of Fashion Technology,"Yao, L (通讯作者)，Beijing Inst Fash Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China.",sxyyl@bift.edu.cn; 315562391@qq.com; liyiyi611@163.com,"LI, yi/HKO-0480-2023; yijie, li/JRY-8316-2023",,Beijing Excellent Talents Cultivating Funding ProjectsResearch on the optimization path of Beijing garment industry structure under the coordinated development of Beijing Tianjin Hebei [TJSH201510012002]; Beijing Excellent Talents Cultivating Funding Projects [2014000026833ZS06]; key project of social science program for Beijing Municipal Education Commission [SZ201610011208],Beijing Excellent Talents Cultivating Funding ProjectsResearch on the optimization path of Beijing garment industry structure under the coordinated development of Beijing Tianjin Hebei; Beijing Excellent Talents Cultivating Funding Projects; key project of social science program for Beijing Municipal Education Commission,Beijing Excellent Talents Cultivating Funding ProjectsResearch on the optimization path of Beijing garment industry structure under the coordinated development of Beijing Tianjin Hebei (Fund code: TJSH201510012002).

Before 1937, Japan had been strengthening control over telecom in the northeast through force and relevant agreements with the Puppet Manchukuo. Then Japan's control on telecom was reinforced by adjusting management of the Puppet Manchuria Telegraph and Telephone Co. while Japan strengthened telecom management with governmental agencies and law by the puppet government. China telecom sovereignty was violated badly. Though Japan increased and improved the telecommunication equipments, its behaviors were to invade China to snatch more interests. Telecom control of Japan seriously hindered the development of China's telecom.

Relative wages and peer pressure also exercise a significant role in the out-migration decisions of young medical doctors.

This benefit is not captured in conventional cost-effectiveness evaluations of treatment and is particularly relevant in patient groups with a high risk of transmission, such as those people who inject drugs (PWID), where the treatment rates have been historically low. This study aimed to quantify how reduced HCV transmission changes the cost-effectiveness of new direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens as a function of treatment uptake rates. An established model of HCV disease transmission and progression was used to quantify the impact of treatment uptake (10-100%), within the PWID population, on the cost-effectiveness of a DAA regimen versus pre-DAA standard of care, conducted using daclatasvir plus sofosbuvir in the UK setting as an illustrative example. The consequences of reduced disease transmission due to treatment were associated with additional net monetary benefit of A 24,304-A pound 90,559 pound per patient treated at A 20,000 pound/QALY, when 10-100% of eligible patients receive treatment with 100% efficacy. Dependent on patient genotype, the cost-effectiveness of HCV treatment using daclatasvir plus sofosbuvir improved by 36-79% versus conventional analysis, at 10-100% treatment uptake in the PWID population. The estimated cost-effectiveness of HCV treatment was shown to improve as more patients are treated, suggesting that the value of DAA regimens to the NHS could be enhanced by improved treatment uptake rates among PWID. However, the challenge for the future will lie in achieving increased rates of treatment uptake, particularly in the PWID population.","[Bennett, Hayley; Gordon, Jason; Jones, Beverley; Ward, Thomas; Webster, Samantha; McEwan, Phil] Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res Ltd, HEOR, 9 Oak Tree Court,Mulberry Dr, Cardiff CF23 8RS, S Glam, Wales; [Gordon, Jason] Univ Adelaide, Dept Publ Hlth, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Kalsekar, Anupama; Yuan, Yong] Bristol Myers Squibb Pharmaceut Ltd, World Wide Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Princeton, NJ USA; [Brenner, Michael] Bristol Myers Squibb Pharmaceut Ltd, UK HEOR, Uxbridge, Middx, England; [McEwan, Phil] Swansea Univ, Sch Human & Hlth Sci, Swansea, W Glam, Wales",Health Economics & Outcomes Research Ltd; University of Adelaide; Bristol-Myers Squibb; Bristol-Myers Squibb; Swansea University,"Bennett, H (通讯作者)，Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res Ltd, HEOR, 9 Oak Tree Court,Mulberry Dr, Cardiff CF23 8RS, S Glam, Wales.",hayley.bennettwilton@heor.co.uk,"Ward, Tom/GZH-1553-2022",,Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd.,Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd.,This study was funded by an unrestricted grant from Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd.,,75,14,15,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Specifically, I test for health effects as a result of within-country variations in the generosity of minimum wages, which are measured by the Kaitz index. The paper finds that higher levels of minimum wages are associated with significant reductions of overall mortality rates as well as in the number of deaths due to outcomes that have been shown to be more prevalent among individuals with low socioeconomic status (e.g., diabetes, disease of the circulatory system, stroke). A 10% point increase of the Kaitz index is associated with significant declines in death rates and an increase in life expectancy of 0.44 years. Furthermore, I provide evidence for potential channels through which minimum wages impact population health by showing that more generous minimum wages impact outcomes such as poverty, the share of the population with unmet medical needs, the number of doctor consultations, tobacco consumption, calorie intake, and the likelihood of people being overweight.","[Lenhart, Otto] Univ West Florida, Dept Mkt & Econ, 11000 Univ Pkwy,Bldg 53 Room 120, Pensacola, FL 32514 USA",State University System of Florida; University of West Florida,"Lenhart, O (通讯作者)，Univ West Florida, Dept Mkt & Econ, 11000 Univ Pkwy,Bldg 53 Room 120, Pensacola, FL 32514 USA.",olenhart@uwf.edu,,,,,,,55,38,40,1,45,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

To explore this idea, a research has been conducted to identify future-oriented methodologies that can sustain activities in such fields as the culture of peace and global citizenship education. Such methodologies as Causal Layered Analysis, the Sarkar game, Transformative Scenario Planning and the framework of Futures Literacy are examined in relation to their added value for intercultural competences. The paper finishes on the presentation and analysis of a case study on a foresight participative workshop held with young people in Africa. The four methodologies and the case study presented in this paper provide, in our view, a strong impetus to further explore spaces where intercultural competences and the discipline of anticipation can be hybridized. Such hybridity seems to correspond to what is required of citizens in a globalizing world where solutions must not only be based on long term perspectives but also be shared across national, cultural, ethnic or religious boundaries.

Validation of the map with certified areas in Russia showed reasonable results, but the lack of openly accessible data requires broadening the strategy for improving the global certification map in the future. Thus, the second aim of the paper is to present an online tool for visualization and interactive improvement of the global forest certification product through collaborative mapping, aiming at a range of stakeholders including third-party certifiers, green NGOs, forestry organizations, decision-makers, scientists and local experts. Such an approach can help to make more accurate information on forest certification available, promote the sharing of data and encourage more transparent and sustainable forest management, i.e. both producers and users can benefit from this online tool.","[Kraxner, Florian; Schepaschenko, Dmitry; Fuss, Sabine; Lunnan, Anders; Kindermann, Georg; Aoki, Kentaro; Durauer, Martina; Shvidenko, Anatoly; See, Linda] IIASA, Ecosyst Serv & Management Program, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Fuss, Sabine] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Torgauer Str 12-15, D-10829 Berlin, Germany; [Lunnan, Anders] Norwegian Univ Life Sci NMBU, Sch Econ & Business, Box 5003, N-1432 As, Norway; [Kindermann, Georg] Austrian Res & Training Ctr Forests Nat Hazards &, Seckendoff Gudent Weg 8, A-1131 Vienna, Austria; [Aoki, Kentaro] Shinshu Univ, Cooperat Res Ctr, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano 3808553, Japan; [Shvidenko, Anatoly] Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Branch, Sukachev Inst Forest, Akademgorodok 50-28, Krasnoyarsk 660036, Russia; [Schepaschenko, Dmitry] Moscow State Tech Univ, Mytischi Filial Bauman, Inst Skaya 1, Mytishchi 141005 5, Russia","International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Norwegian University of Life Sciences; Shinshu University; Russian Academy of Sciences; Krasnoyarsk Science Center of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences; Sukachev Institute of Forest, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences","Kraxner, F (通讯作者)，IIASA, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria.",kraxner@iiasa.ac.at; schepd@iiasa.ac.at; Fuss@mcc-berlin.net; anders.lunnan@nmbu.no; kinder@iiasa.ac.at; kentarou.aoki@gmail.com; duerauer@iiasa.ac.at; shvidenk@iiasa.ac.at; see@iiasa.ac.at,"Schepaschenko, Dmitry G./E-9603-2012","Schepaschenko, Dmitry G./0000-0002-7814-4990; Kraxner, Florian/0000-0003-3832-6236; Kindermann, Georg Erich/0000-0003-4297-1318","ERC project CrowdLand [617754]; MISTRA, Sweden","ERC project CrowdLand; MISTRA, Sweden","This work has been carried out as part of IIASA's Tropical Futures Initiative (TFI, www.iiasa.ac.at/tropics), the ERC project CrowdLand (No. 617754), and the IIASA-led RESTORE +: Addressing Landscape Restoration on Degraded Land in Indonesia and Brazil project (www.restoreplus.org), carried out under the International Climate Initiative (IKI) of the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB).

The fate of over half of the 330 million hectares of forestland in the United States (U.S.) rests in the hands of private ownerships, and over 35% of U.S. forestland is owned by families. Landowner estate planning offers a means for families to make critical decisions about the future stewardship of their land, including whether and how to split up lands or to take steps to ensure lands remain forested. Yet, decision making regarding ownership transition and formal estate planning remains poorly understood. Our research provides foundational knowledge of the current status of family landowners' formal estate planning in four northeastern U.S. states. Using a mail survey in Massachusetts, Maine, New York and Vermont, we compiled information on owners' current management, future intentions, estate planning, and demographics. Approximately 66% of respondents have made use of a will for estate planning; 25% have combined the use of a will with a tool that may control use; and 34% have not employed any formal planning tools. Findings from a multinomial logit model of estate planning actions suggest that landowner and land characteristics, barriers to the planning process, and intentions to pass to heirs, recreational and financial investment objectives, and landscape area differences explain variation in the extent and type of planning by owners. Our results underscore the importance of additional research on estate planning, including the conservation intent of these plans, and offer guidance to practitioners interested in bolstering engagement with these planning tools.","[Markowski-Lindsay, Marla; Catanzaro, Paul; Kittredge, David; Markowitz, Ezra; Milman, Anita; Zimmerer, Rebekah] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, 160 Holdsworth Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Bell, Kathleen] Univ Maine, Sch Econ, 5782 Winslow Hall, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Leahy, Jessica] Univ Maine, Sch Forest Resources, 241 Nutting Hall, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Butler, Brett] US Forest Serv, USDA, Northeastern Res Stn, 160 Holdsworth Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Allred, Shorna] Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Coll Agr & Life Sci, 102 Fernow Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Sisock, Mary] Univ Vermont, Rubenstein Sch Environm & Nat Resources, 313 Aiken Ctr, Burlington, VT 05405 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; Cornell University; University of Vermont,"Markowski-Lindsay, M (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, 160 Holdsworth Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",marla@eco.umass.edu; paulcat@umass.edu; kpbell@maine.edu; jessica.leahy@maine.edu; bbutler01@fs.fed.us; emarkowitz@eco.umass.edu; amilman@eco.umass.edu; srb237@cornell.edu; mary.sisock@uvm.edu,"Catanzaro, Paul/AAR-9297-2021","Bell, Kathleen/0000-0001-6224-181X; Catanzaro, Paul/0000-0002-6620-7149; Milman, Anita/0000-0002-5712-9388; Allred, Shorna/0000-0001-6237-0638; Markowski-Lindsay, Marla/0000-0001-7778-2416","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2015-68006-23110]; Center for Agriculture, Food and the Environment and Environmental Conservation Department at University of Massachusetts Amherst [MAS00032]; Maine Agricultural & Forest Experiment state project [ME041707]; USDA NIFA [ME0-L-7-00524-13, ME0-M-7-00500-12]","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA); Center for Agriculture, Food and the Environment and Environmental Conservation Department at University of Massachusetts Amherst; Maine Agricultural & Forest Experiment state project; USDA NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA))","This material is based upon work supported by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) under award number 2015-68006-23110; the Center for Agriculture, Food and the Environment and Environmental Conservation Department at University of Massachusetts Amherst, under McIntire-Stennis project number MAS00032; Maine Agricultural & Forest Experiment state project ME041707; and USDA NIFA Maine award ME0-L-7-00524-13 and ME0-M-7-00500-12.",,51,15,16,0,15,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,OCT,2017,83.0,,,,,,36,44,,10.1016/j.forpol.2017.06.004,0.0,,,9,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,FK6JW,,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413611000005,0

The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a T2D prevention initiative targeting weight reduction, increased physical activity and healthier diet in persons in pre-diabetic states by comparing a hypothetical intervention versus no intervention in a Swedish setting. A Markov model was used to study the cost-effectiveness of a T2D prevention program based on lifestyle change versus a control group where no prevention was applied. Analyses were done deterministically and probabilistically based on Monte Carlo simulation for six different scenarios defined by sex and age groups (30, 50, 70 years). Cost and quality adjusted life year (QALY) differences between no intervention and intervention and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated and visualized in cost-effectiveness planes (CE planes) and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEA curves). All ICERs were cost-effective and ranged from 3833 a,notsign/QALY gained (women, 30 years) to 9215 a,notsign/QALY gained (men, 70 years). The CEA curves showed that the probability of the intervention being cost-effective at the threshold value of 50,000 a,notsign per QALY gained was very high for all scenarios ranging from 85.0 to 91.1%. The prevention or the delay of the onset of T2D is feasible and cost-effective. A small investment in healthy lifestyle with change in physical activity and diet together with weight loss are very likely to be cost-effective.","[Neumann, Anne; Lindholm, Lars; Norberg, Margareta; Norstrom, Fredrik] Umea Univ, Dept Publ Hlth & Clin Med, Epidemiol & Global Hlth, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Neumann, Anne] Tech Univ Dresden, Univ Hosp, Ctr Evidence Based Healthcare, Fetscherstr 74, D-01307 Dresden, Germany; [Schoffer, Olaf; Klug, Stefanie J.] Tech Univ Dresden, Univ Canc Ctr, Univ Hosp, Canc Epidemiol, Fetscherstr 74, D-01307 Dresden, Germany",Umea University; Technische Universitat Dresden; Carl Gustav Carus University Hospital; Technische Universitat Dresden; Carl Gustav Carus University Hospital; University of Hamburg; University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf,"Neumann, A (通讯作者)，Umea Univ, Dept Publ Hlth & Clin Med, Epidemiol & Global Hlth, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.;Neumann, A (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Dresden, Univ Hosp, Ctr Evidence Based Healthcare, Fetscherstr 74, D-01307 Dresden, Germany.",Anne.Neumann@uniklinikum-dresden.de,"Norström, Fredrik/C-6193-2013; Schoffer, Olaf/R-1841-2016","Norström, Fredrik/0000-0002-0457-2175; Schoffer, Olaf/0000-0001-6922-7148; Klug, Stefanie J./0000-0003-3523-1362",,,,,50,27,28,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

In this study, we integrate various foresight methods in analysing the future of the sawmilling industry in Finland. According to the results, climate change mitigation policies impact firstly through increasing energy costs and secondly through emerging energy products. The greatest uncertainties are related to the price of energy and the competitive situation of wood as a potential source of energy, both regulated heavily by EU- and national level policies. In addition, the future development of biorefineries was regarded as a potential driver of change: the increasing demand for pulpwood would increase competition for the raw materials. From a managerial perspective, the Finnish sawmilling industry should thus consider adoption of new business models for joint production of wood, chips, and energy for heat and power. For the policymakers our study illustrates how important it is to take into account the causal effects on profitability determinants when designing policy measures. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This paper attempts to fill the gap by investigating the impact of air pollution on several key dimensions, including mental health status, depressive symptoms, moment-to-moment happiness, and evaluative happiness. We match a nationwide longitudinal survey in China with local air quality and rich weather conditions according to the exact time and place of survey. By making use of variations in exposure to air pollution for the same individuals over time, we show that air pollution reduces hedonic happiness and increases the rate of depressive symptoms, while life satisfaction has little to do with the immediate air quality. Our results shed light on air pollution as an important contributor to the Easterlin paradox that economic growth may not bring more happiness. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Current evidence based policy exercises entail forms of quantification-often in the form of risk analysis or cost benefit analyses-which aim to optimize one among a set of policy options corresponding to a generally single framing of the issueunder consideration. More cogently the deepening of the analysis corresponding to a single view of what the problem is has the effect of distracting from what could be alternative readings. When using evidence based policy those alternative frames become a kind of 'uncomfortable knowledge' which is de facto removed from the policy discourse. All the more so when the analysis is supported by extensive mathematical modelling. Thus evidence based policy may result in a dramatic simplification of the available perceptions, in flawed policy prescriptions and in the neglect of other relevant world views of legitimate stakeholders. This use of scientific method ultimately generates-rather than resolving-controversies and erodes the institutional trust of the involved actors. We suggest an alternative approach-which we term quantitative story-telling-which encourages a major effort in the pre-analytic, pre-quantitative phase of the analysis as to map a socially robust universe of possible frames, which represent different lenses through which to perceive what the problem is. This is followed by an analysis where the emphasis in not on,confirmatory checks or system optimization but-the opposite-on an attempt to refute the frames if these violate constraints of feasibility (compatibility with processes outside human control); viability (compatibility with processes under human control), and desirability (compatibility with a plurality of normative considerations relevant to the system's actors).

We resort to Hopner's (2007) concepts of organization and coordination in order to analyze how firms progressively engaged in Business Interest Associations (BIAs) and interlocking directorates during the first part of the 20th century. Our inquiry is based on a network analysis on large firms of the Swiss machine, electrotechnical and metallurgy (MEM) sector. Our results show that before the First World War, only major firms were promoting coordination and organization through, respectively, interlocking directorates and BIAs. Although many firms were reluctant to cooperate in the first place, interests beyond the firm level (organization) and the economic needs of firms (coordination) had cumulative effects, and most firms progressively engaged in both mechanisms of cooperation from the interwar period. We argue that differentiating between organization and coordination contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the emergence of non-liberal capitalism.","[Eichenberger, Pierre] Univ Zurich, Forsch Stelle Sozial & Wirtschaftsgeschichte, Hist Seminar, Ramistr 64, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland; [Ginalski, Stephanie] Univ Lausanne, UNIL Mouline, Inst Polit Hist & Int Studies, Geopolis, Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Zurich; University of Lausanne,"Ginalski, S (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, UNIL Mouline, Inst Polit Hist & Int Studies, Geopolis, Lausanne, Switzerland.",stephanie.ginalski@unil.ch,,,,,,,64,9,9,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

President Obama's decision to extend AGOA, which was set to expire at the end of September 2015, for another ten years (2015 to 2025), was highly controversial. The Extension and Enhancement of AGOA Act, signed into law by President Obama, on the 29 June 2015, had thus included many new provisions to incorporate the views of the US Congress on the implementation of the ten-year extension and the future trajectory of AGOA. In this paper, the new Extension and Enhancement of AGOA Act is analysed to elucidate the new and additional powers that the new AGOA Act provides the US Congress, the US Administration, and US business lobbies, and the implications of these changes for sub-Saharan African countries. At least three new trends in the 2015 AGOA Act can be identified: payment for preferences, institutional attrition, and a shift to reciprocity. These trends, it is argued in this paper, are potentially contrary to a more mutually beneficial relationship between the US and Africa. The paper offers some reflections on the future of AGOA.","[Ismail, Faizel] Univ Cape Town, Rondebosch, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Ismail, F (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Rondebosch, South Africa.",faizel.ismail51@gmail.com,,,,,,,24,0,2,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JUL,2017,16.0,3,,,,,527,544,,10.1017/S147474561600063X,0.0,,,18,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,EY2GJ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000403786300005,0

To that end, three provisions form the centerpiece of liberalization: market access (Article XVI GATS), national treatment (Article XVII GATS), and domestic regulation (Article VI GATS). Although these provisions contain different obligations, in certain conditions they can overlap. How this issue is resolved could undermine the delicate balance between liberalization and the right to regulate. As the GATS provides no guidance, the task of determining the applicable rules has been delegated to the World Trade Organization (WTO) adjudicating bodies.

Unlike previous studies, this study adopts a mixed methods research design to investigate, in a systematic manner, these differences. HTA recommendations for ten orphan drugs appraised in England (NICE), Scotland (SMC), Sweden (TLV) and France (HAS) (N = 35) were compared using a validated methodological framework that breaks down these complex decision processes into stages facilitating their understanding, analysis and comparison, namely: (1) the clinical/cost-effectiveness evidence, (2) its interpretation (e.g. part of the deliberative process) and (3) influence on the final decision. This allowed qualitative and quantitative identification of the criteria driving recommendations and highlighted cross-country differences. Six out of ten drugs received diverging HTA recommendations. Reasons for cross-country differences included heterogeneity in the evidence appraised, in the interpretation of the same evidence, and in the different ways of dealing with the same uncertainty. These may have been influenced by agency-specific evidentiary, risk and value preferences, or stakeholder input. Other considerations (e.g. severity, orphan status) and other decision modulators (e.g. patient access schemes, lower discount rates, restrictions, re-assessments) also rendered uncertainty and cost-effectiveness estimates more acceptable. The different HTA approaches (clinical versus cost-effectiveness) and ways identified of dealing with orphan drug particularities also had implications on the final decisions. This research contributes to better understanding the drivers of these complex decisions and why countries make different decisions. It also contributed to identifying those factors beyond the standard clinical and cost-effectiveness tools used in HTA, and their role in shaping these decisions.","[Nicod, Elena] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Social Policy, LSE Hlth & Social Care, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Nicod, E (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Social Policy, LSE Hlth & Social Care, London WC2A 2AE, England.",elena@nicod.com,,"Nicod, Elena/0000-0001-6798-9923",European Commission [305983],European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"This research was funded by the European Commission's 7th Framework Programme and is undertaken under the auspices of Advance-HTA (Grant # 305983).

This article explores the factors affecting collective action related to the removal of the mile-a-minute weed (Mikania micrantha, referred to as Mikania), an invasive plant, in community forests in the buffer zone region around Chitwan National Park in Chitwan, Nepal. Few studies have combined larger sample size quantitative data with greater generalizability and nuanced, qualitative data to explore what factors influence collective action or focused on how perception of the issue at multiple levels affects outcomes. This research employs household and community forest management survey data from 21 community forests in and near the buffer zone of Chitwan National Park in Nepal. Our multilevel econometric analyses, including an analysis examining geographic space using eigenvectors, investigate what influences local people's participation in Mikania removal and we contextualize the findings with case-study interview data. Our results indicate that reliance on community forest resources, perception of the issue, and neighborhood sizes influence are influential factors in their participation in Mikania removal. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of increasing the effectiveness of Mikania removal efforts and influencing collective action in relation to other global human-environment issues.

The focus lies on the impact of forest harvesting machinery on soil and the resulting risks to the forest ecosystem in general and to soil fertility in particular. The economic dimension of the issue becomes increasingly apparent when wet weather hampers the planning and execution of forestry operations. Public interest has also increased: damage to the forest floor is negatively perceived by the population as well as nature conservationists, and attracts media attention. With the overall sustainability of forest management at stake, the issue entails major ecological as well as economic and political challenges. The article examines physical soil protection from various economic perspectives, focusing on (i) production economics, (ii) industrial economics and (iii) institutional economics. The findings of this comprehensive approach contribute to a better understanding of the complexity of this private and public good. Possible challenges in the future are posed by climate change and increasing demand for forest resources. These could massively exacerbate the problem of forest soil protection and drive up its costs. Further economic analysis is needed to improve decision making in soil protection to ensure sustainable forest management.

Data was taken from fourteen rounds of the Health Survey for England (between 2000-2014; N = 31,043) for children aged 2-16. We regressed obesity in childhood against birth weight, accounting for interactions between birth weight and household income, using sibling-fixed effects models. High birth weight was associated with increased risk of subsequent obesity. This association was significantly more pronounced in children from low-income families, compared with children from high-income families. A 1 kg increase in birth weight increased the probability of obesity by 7% in the lowest income tertile and 4% in the highest income tertile. This suggests that early socioeconomic deprivation compound the effect of high birth weight on obesity.","[Kinge, Jonas Minet] Norwegian Inst Publ Hlth, Pb 4404 Nydalen, N-0403 Oslo, Norway; [Kinge, Jonas Minet] Univ Oslo, Dept Hlth Management & Hlth Econ, Oslo, Norway",Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH); University of Oslo,"Kinge, JM (通讯作者)，Norwegian Inst Publ Hlth, Pb 4404 Nydalen, N-0403 Oslo, Norway.;Kinge, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Dept Hlth Management & Hlth Econ, Oslo, Norway.",Jonas.Minet.Kinge@fhi.no,,,Norwegian Research Council [250335/F20],Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),"I would like acknowledge the project The burden of obesity in Norway: morbidity, mortality, health service use and productivity loss funded by the Norwegian Research Council through grant 250335/F20.

However, inducing participation in Payment for Ecosystem Services schemes for coordinating land management choices is challenging from a policy design perspective owing to transaction costs associated with participation. This paper employs a laboratory experiment to investigate the impact of such costs on participation and land use in the context of an Agglomeration Bonus (AB) scheme. The AB creates a coordination game with multiple Nash equilibria related to alternative spatially-coordinated land use patterns. The experiment varies transaction costs between two levels (high and low), which affects the risks and payoffs of coordinating on the different equilibria. Additionally, an option to communicate is implemented between neighbors arranged on a local network to facilitate spatial coordination. Results indicate a significant difference in participation and performance under high and low transaction costs, with lower uptake and performance when transaction costs are high. These effects are, however, impacted by transaction costs faced in the past Communication improves both AB participation rates and performance with the effect being greater for participants facing high transaction costs.

In order to estimate the direct costs of all adult ESRD patients, according to (RRT) modality, patient condition, and clinical events, data from the French national health insurance funds were used. The mean monthly costs for the 47,862 stable prevalent patients (73 % of the population) varied substantially according to treatment modality (from 7300a,notsign for in-center hemodialysis to 1100a,notsign for a functioning renal graft) and to clinical event (8300a,notsign for the first month of dialysis, 11,000a,notsign for the last month before death, 22,800a,notsign for the first month after renal transplantation).

Since China struggles to enforce environmental regulation, trade policy can be used as a second-best environmental policy. In a general equilibrium model it is possible to show that the second-best export tax increases in a product's pollution intensity. The empirical analysis investigates whether the export tax equivalent of partial VAT rebates and export taxes are higher for products which are more pollution intensive along several dimensions. The results indicate that the VAT rebate rates are set in a way that discourages exports of water pollution intensive, 502 intensive and energy intensive products from 2007 on. Moreover, the conservation of natural resources such as minerals, metals, wood products and precious stones seems to be a key determinant of China's export VAT rebate rates. There is little evidence that export taxes are motivated by environmental concerns. (C) 2016 The Author. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Because of career histories in lower paid and more insecure employment, a higher percentage of women than men are dependent on the age pension rather than on superannuation or savings and investments, and so will be disproportionately affected by deferred access. Yet, fewer women than men hold the types of good jobs' that will sustain them into an older age. Women are more likely to be sequestered in precarious employment, with reduced job quality and a greater potential for premature workforce exit. This article counterposes macro-level data drawn from national cross-sectional labour force statistics and the longitudinal Household Income and Labour Dynamics Australia survey, with case study analysis, based on interviews with 38 women in midlife insecure jobs, in order to identify the types of life course and labour market barriers that contribute to women's reliance on the pension and the systemic disadvantage that will render them particularly vulnerable to any further erosion of this safety net. The analysis moves between this empirical evidence and a discussion, drawing on the theoretical literature, of the failure in equal opportunity endeavours over recent decades and what this means for later life workforce participation for women.

At the same time, cities struggle to find tools to help manage their long-term transition towards a low-carbon, resource-smart economy. In 2006-2007, the municipalities in the Helsinki metropolitan region organised an international competition for ideas titled Greater Helsinki Vision 2050. It drew a good number of entries in the competition stage and later helped bring together the awarded participants with local planning professionals and citizens. This paper explores the process behind the vision-making exercise and evaluates its success in providing new tools for the long-term transition to a low-carbon, resource-smart Helsinki metropolitan region. The theoretical framework used in this paper is 'incrementalism with perspective' (Ganser, Siebel & Sieverts, 1993) and its ideas on using long-term visions in the integration and coordination of incremental activities in various institutions. We perceive the backcasting scenario method (Dreborg, 1996) as a tool for implementing this approach and hence interpret the case example's results through the framework of this method. The Greater Helsinki Vision 2050 competition was an example of a vision-oriented planning process that provided new tools for bringing the 'unmanageable' metropolitan region within the scope of the manageable. The backcasting approach was deployed as a tool'for emancipating stakeholders to imagine alternative futures for metropolitan spaces. The backcasting scenario method should be considered a viable tool when managing vision-oriented planning processes: longer than usual time horizons help initiate strategic learning among stakeholders. However, in addition to civil servants, citizens and other stakeholders should be widely engaged in order to secure sustainable results. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, the impact of different carbon policies on a landowner's management decisions is analyzed at the stand level. Wildfires as a random natural phenomenon and forestry prescribed burning as a fuel treatment tool are all considered within the framework of a generalized Faustmann model. The results reveal that harvesting rotations and land values can be affected by the level and pattern of wildfire risk, and additionally, the consideration of carbon in variots policies. In response to different carbon policies, the optimal time of prescribed burning Only varies slightly, but its intensity can experience much larger variations. If the landowner needs to pay for carbon emission from prescribed burning but not from a wildfire, the optimal strategy is to conduct the prescribed burning more lightly and later than in the base scenario. Overall, participation in a carbon program results in a higher land expectation value, which is beneficial to the landowner. These research findings are helpful for understanding the relation between carbon policies and the behavior of landowners, and furthermore, for improving carbon policy designs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We document significant variation in the hours worked per worker for many emerging-market economies using manufacturing data. Both employment and hours worked per worker are positively correlated with each other and with output. We show that a search-theoretic context in a small open-economy model requires a small wealth effect to explain these regularities at the expense of a smaller wage response. On the other hand, introducing a financial friction in the form of a working capital requirement can explain the observed movements of labor market variables such as employment and hours worked per worker, as well as other distinguishable business cycle characteristics of emerging economies. These include highly volatile and cyclical real wages, labor share, and consumption.","[Altug, Sumru] Koc Univ, Istanbul, Turkey; [Altug, Sumru] CEPR, Istanbul, Turkey; [Kabaca, Serdar] Bank Canada, 234 Wellington St, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G9, Canada",Koc University; Bank of Canada,"Kabaca, S (通讯作者)，Bank Canada, 234 Wellington St, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G9, Canada.",kaba@bankofcanada.ca,"Altug, Sumru/K-2197-2019; Kabaca, Serdar/AAA-8969-2020","Kabaca, Serdar/0000-0002-7124-0891; Altug, Sumru/0000-0003-2788-5235",,,,,37,8,8,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Although contexts play a significant role, this may be true to a certain extent. It is also true, however, that the value of foresight has been under-explored. The purpose of the paper is to show the value of foresight in contributing to the development of more participatory societies irrespective of the specific 'official' objectives it is designed to serve. The methodology included the creation of a specific impact assessment framework and the assessment of certain foresight exercises (FNR Foresight and eFORESEE Malta) in terms of contribution to more participatory societies through case studies. The assessment showed that although contributing to more participatory societies was not among the main aims of the particular exercises, they managed to achieve certain impacts facilitating increased public participation or directly improving democratic processes in policy-making. Foresight is 'by default' devised to promote democratic processes through inclusiveness, openness, transparency, public engagement, and multi-stakeholder approaches. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The most effective way to increase Romania's entrepreneurship level will be to improve the weaknesses we identified at the institutional level, as institutional variables are the most significant drivers for entrepreneurship based on our results, and at the same time, their week values seems to be the main explanation why Romania has a low entrepreneurial level.","[Dumitru, Ionela] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Business Adm, Bucharest, Romania; [Dumitru, Ionut] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Finance Insurance Banking & Stock Exchange, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Dumitru, I (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Business Adm, Bucharest, Romania.",ionela_jianu@yahoo.com; ionut.dumitru@fin.ase.ro,"Dumitru, Ionela/AAP-1969-2021","Dumitru, Ionut/0000-0002-1930-4405",,,,,20,2,2,1,19,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Our results also support the Environmental Kuznets Curve by showing that when per capita income grows larger, pollution intensity first rises and then falls. We also find that ceteris paribus, a higher level of city human capital intensity is associated with a lower level of city pollution intensity. In addition, our results show that there exists inter-city strategic interaction among the governments of the YRD cities in determining their effort levels with respect to environmental protection.","[Jiang, Yanqing] Shanghai Int Studies Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, 1550 Wenxiang Rd, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Jinghai] Northumbria Univ, Newcastle Business Sch, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England",Shanghai International Studies University; Northumbria University; Newcastle University - UK,"Jiang, YQ (通讯作者)，Shanghai Int Studies Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, 1550 Wenxiang Rd, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China.",yjiang@shisu.edu.cn,,,Shanghai International Studies University [KX161067],Shanghai International Studies University,The research contained in this paper has been carried out partly under a key research project of Shanghai International Studies University that started in November 2015 (Project No. KX161067).

Institutional investors play important roles in firms because of their substantial shareholdings and their capability to monitor managers. However, the question is whether they are capable of monitoring the managers. The literature has provided different evidence for the monitoring role of institutional investors. This study attempts to provide insights into the monitoring roles of institutional investors by examining the relationship between institutional ownership and earnings quality on the Tehran Stock Exchange. Institutional investors are classified into two groups, namely active institutional investors and passive institutional investors, based on their monitoring power in Iran. A multidimensional method is used to measure the various aspects of earnings quality, such as earnings response coefficient, predictive value of earnings, discretionary accruals, conservatism, and real earnings management. The results show that institutional ownership has a positive effect on earnings quality. Similar to total institutional ownership, active institutional ownership has positive effects on proxies of earnings quality. Nonetheless, passive institutional ownership does not have any power to affect earnings quality. Moreover, lead-lag tests of the direction of causality suggest that institutional ownership leads to more earnings quality and not the reverse.","[Mehrani, Sasan; Moradi, Mohammad] Univ Tehran, Fac Management, Tehran, Iran; [Eskandar, Hoda] Islamic Azad Univ, Cent Tehran Branch, Fac Econ & Accounting, Dept Accounting, Tehran, Iran",University of Tehran; Islamic Azad University,"Eskandar, H (通讯作者)，Univ Tehran, Fac Management, Tehran, Iran.",heskandar@ut.ac.ir,,", hoda/0000-0002-4461-8860; moradi, mohammad/0000-0001-9519-3367",,,,,74,19,19,10,79,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The study shows that women migrants are less likely to remit than men and, when they do, they transfer smaller amounts. The remittance gender gap is not universal among subgroups, since it is only observable among Hispanics who came to the US to improve their economic situation, plan to return to their home country, and have low income and low schooling. An index on migrants' perceptions of gender roles as a proxy for cultural gendered norms is constructed and shows that more traditional gender views are associated with a significant gender gap in favor of men in remittances.","[Park, Yongjin; Cruz-Saco, Maria Amparo; Anuarbe, Monika Lopez] Connecticut Coll, Econ, 270 Mohegan Ave, New London, CT 06320 USA",Connecticut College,"Park, Y (通讯作者)，Connecticut Coll, Econ, 270 Mohegan Ave, New London, CT 06320 USA.",ypark@conncoll.edu; macru@conncoll.edu; manuarbe@conncoll.edu,"López-Anuarbe, Mónika/Y-3046-2019","López-Anuarbe, Mónika/0000-0002-1731-6138; Cruz-Saco, Maria Amparo/0000-0003-1601-8507",,,,,44,4,5,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

First, we employ Moran's I statistic to describe the empirical evidence for the presence of spatial dependencies in provincial nonperforming loans ratio (NPLR) after checking the stationarity of the data by the second-generation panel unit root tests. Then we construct the spatial panel data model through a set of model specification tests, and calculate the direct and indirect effects of the explanatory variables. The empirical results show that the spatial spillover effect plays a significant role in regional nonperforming loans. Furthermore, the growth rate of the gross domestic product and the unemployment rate are two important factors in the transmission of nonperforming loans among the regions.","[Zhang, Xi] Hunan First Normal Univ, Business Sch, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Policy & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Guo, Dongmei] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Yi] Cent China Normal Univ, Sch Informat Management, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Wang, Mingxi] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Hunan First Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; CAS Institutes of Science & Development; Central University of Finance & Economics; Central China Normal University; University of International Business & Economics,"Guo, DM (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",guodongmeicufe@163.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71540007, 71471039, 71301173]; National Social Science Foundation of China [14BGL175]; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province [2016JJ4026]; Beijing Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science [13JGB018]; Central University of Finance and Economics",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province); Beijing Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science; Central University of Finance and Economics,"The authors gratefully acknowledge support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant nos. 71540007, 71471039, and 71301173), National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 14BGL175), Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province (Grant no. 2016JJ4026), Beijing Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science (13JGB018), and Program for Innovation Research in Central University of Finance and Economics.",,43,8,8,3,42,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

We found that an increase in the ratio of workers aged over 50 years to total workers had a negative effect on value added per worker, which was consistent with the findings of most previous studies based on European data. However, the results of the analysis, including various classifications such as size, industry and several financial conditions, revealed that an increase in the ratio of older workers had positive effects on value added per worker in large manufacturing firms under risky or growing conditions. As the productivity of older workers may vary, future research may determine under what conditions - size, industry, region and financial conditions - older workers contribute positively to productivity. Firms with financial troubles or those planning to downsize should be cautious about laying off older workers as an approach to improving organisational performance because these workers contribute positively to productivity under certain conditions.","[Lee, Bokwon; Park, Joowoong] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Daejeon, South Korea; [Lee, Bokwon] Minist Econ & Finance, Human Resources Off, Sejong, South Korea; [Yang, Jae-Suk] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Future Strategy, Daejeon, South Korea",Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST); Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST),"Yang, JS (通讯作者)，Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Moon Soul Grad Sch Future Strategy, Daejeon, South Korea.",yang@kaist.ac.kr,"LEE, BOKWON/AAM-5136-2021; Yang, Jae-Suk/F-2332-2015","Yang, Jae-Suk/0000-0001-9595-5229",Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2016S1A5A8019490],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)",This work was in part supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2016S1A5A8019490).,,51,6,8,1,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

It offers an analytical framework for the anticipation of the futures of journalism by mapping out how experts see the current state and the future of journalism. The data is gathered from the 2017 journalism predictions by NiemanLab of the Harvard University, and from a 2014 futures workshop and interview (FWI) process for Finnish journalists and media experts. The NiemanLab predictions are categorised, and these categories are compared with the FWI results to find common themes and trends. The results from both data analyses are reflected upon a typology of digital journalism by Mark Deuze (2003). In terms of identified trends, a diversification of journalism, contests over what is true and what is not, collaboration, and an increasingly close relationship between media outlets and the audiences stand out. In regards to changes in journalistic values and types, especially the rise of dialogical journalism is predicated by the analysis, as well as instrumental journalism that serves specific audience needs. Together these developments imply a discontinuation in the shape of journalism, moving away from an insulated field toward in many ways more open culture and practice of journalism.","[Ruotsalainen, Juho] Univ Turku, Finland Futures Res Ctr, Korkeavuorenkatu 25 A2, FI-00130 Helsinki, Finland",University of Turku,"Ruotsalainen, J (通讯作者)，Univ Turku, Finland Futures Res Ctr, Korkeavuorenkatu 25 A2, FI-00130 Helsinki, Finland.",juho.ruotsalainen@utu.fi,,,Media Industry Research Foundation of Finland; Finnish Foundation for Economic Education,Media Industry Research Foundation of Finland; Finnish Foundation for Economic Education,This research was supported by the Media Industry Research Foundation of Finland and the Finnish Foundation for Economic Education.,,122,6,7,0,17,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,DEC,2018,104.0,,,,,,14,24,,10.1016/j.futures.2018.06.011,0.0,,,11,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,HD5RG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000452587000002,0

This paper quantifies the energy savings of the Energize Phoenix program in Phoenix, Arizona. Impacts of retrofits are analyzed using pre-post treatment billing data from January 2008 to April 2013, covering 201 residential buildings and 636 commercial buildings. There are five types of retrofits for residential buildings and six types for commercial buildings. Empirical results from fixed effects panel regression models indicate monthly energy savings of 12% for commercial buildings and 8% for residential buildings. The realized energy savings are 30-50% lower than those predicted by engineering models. We have also separated the energy savings provided by individual retrofits and retrofit bundles, and estimate how the effectiveness of retrofits varies based on building attributes, all of which should be considered when making energy efficiency decisions. Learning effects are also observed in this program, which means as the post-retrofit time increases, there is a possibility for improved learning and control of energy use. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

J,"Hakobyan, S",,,,"Hakobyan, Shushanik",,,Do Anti-dumping Duties Still Matter? The Curious Case of Aluminum Foil,WORLD TRADE REVIEW,,,English,Review,,,,,,,TRADE DIVERSION,"In 2009, the EU imposed anti-dumping duties on aluminum foil imported from Armenia, Brazil, and China for five years. The final determination resulted in the imposition of definitive anti-dumping duties of 13.4% (Armenia), 17.6% (Brazil), and 6.4-30% (China). This paper quantifies the direct and indirect effects of the EU anti-dumping duty on EU and US imports from targeted and unaffected countries using detailed data for the years 2006 through 2012, and controlling for exports of all products within the aluminum sheet, plate, and foil manufacturing industry from all countries. The findings point to the trade destruction, trade depression, trade diversion, and trade deflection effects typically found in the existing literature. However, the uniqueness of this case lies in the fact that the Armenian exporter is a subsidiary of a Russian firm. And as Armenia's exports to the EU declined, they expanded rapidly to the US. At the same time, the US imports from Russia, a country not directly touched by the anti-dumping ruling, declined dramatically, and were diverted to the EU. This points to the potential ineffectiveness of anti-dumping duties in the presence of multinational corporations with production facilities located across countries differentially impacted by anti-dumping duties.","[Hakobyan, Shushanik] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Hakobyan, S (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",shakobyan@imf.org,,,,,,,7,1,1,1,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,OCT,2018,17.0,4,,,,,557,574,,10.1017/S1474745617000465,0.0,,,18,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,GX1QX,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447494100001,0

Despite the establishment of legal and institutional frameworks for devolving a meaningful authority to local people, participatory forestry in Bangladesh has been facing many governance challenges. Therefore local people involvement in forest governance needs to be evaluated. A quantitative and qualitative research method has been applied to investigate a forest governance framework for evaluating the efficacy of participatory forestry in Bangladesh. Field data were collected by semi-structured interview of 120 local forest participants using scoring of qualitative data on a point scale (1-5). The study was based on the proposed modified framework for evaluation of good governance in terms of participation, transparency and efficiency. Analysis of data revealed that participation in benefit sharing received the highest score (3.90), while the lowest in the management committee meeting (2.12). Transparency in decision-making process received the lowest score (2.42). Similarly efficiency in handling tree farming fund (TFF) has the lowest score (2.35). In overall governance level, participation received the highest score (3.12), while transparency received the lowest (2.72). Findings indicate that poor governance still exists in participatory forestry program because of low level of participation and lack of transparency in handling tree farming fund (TFF). Therefore pragmatic approaches like strengthening monitoring mechanism, providing incentives for rule compliances need to be adopted to harness the benefit of good governance of a participatory forestry program. The findings of this study would be useful to forest policy-makers, development official and local forest practitioners in formulating effective policies for participatory forest management programs in Bangladesh and other developing countries. Our finding has also an implication on forest governance discourse in participatory forest management regimes.","[Mollick, Abdus Subhan; Rahman, Md Khalilur; Khan, Md Nabiul Islam; Sadath, Md Nazmus] Khulna Univ, Forestry & Wood Technol Discipline, Khulna 9208, Bangladesh; [Sadath, Md Nazmus] Georg August Univ, Forest & Nat Conservat Policy, Gottingen, Germany",Khulna University; University of Gottingen,"Sadath, MN (通讯作者)，Khulna Univ, Forestry & Wood Technol Discipline, Khulna 9208, Bangladesh.;Sadath, MN (通讯作者)，Georg August Univ Gottingen, Forst & Nat Schutzpolit, Fak Forstwissensch & Waldokol, Busgenweg 3, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",nsadath@gwdg.de,"Khan, Nabiul Islam/K-3799-2015; Mollick, Abdus Subhan/ABF-9014-2021; Khan, Md Nabiul Islam Islam/AAW-7861-2021; Londe, Pedro/AAG-2267-2019","Mollick, Abdus Subhan/0000-0001-6690-0747; Khan, Md Nabiul Islam Islam/0000-0002-1536-8954; Sadath, Md.

This paper investigates if the quantitative effects of flipping on student outcomes differ by scheduling. It further evaluates if student perceptions about flipping vary depending on the spacing of class meetings. This paper shows that students in flipped classes scored significantly higher on final exams compared to those in a traditional setting, and the effect of flipping did not vary with class spacing. Students in the flipped class setting reported significantly more active learning and were significantly more likely to recommend the professor to other students than those in a traditional setting; however, those in the flipped class that met twice a week for 80 min reported significantly less active learning and were significantly less likely to recommend the professor than those in the traditional setting. The results documented in this study suggest that while the effects of flipping on student learning do not vary with class spacing, student satisfaction does differ with spacing. Therefore, when considering the scheduling of a flipped course, instructors need not worry about the impact of flipping on learning outcomes, but they should consider the importance of student satisfaction.","[Calimeris, Lauren] St John Fisher Coll, Dept Econ, 3690 East Ave,Kearney 416, Rochester, NY 14618 USA",Saint John Fisher University,"Calimeris, L (通讯作者)，St John Fisher Coll, Dept Econ, 3690 East Ave,Kearney 416, Rochester, NY 14618 USA.",lcalimeris@sjfc.edu,,,,,,,24,8,9,0,15,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1477-3880,2352-4421,,INT REV ECON EDUC,Int.

However, pure cost sharing effects are typically hard to measure due to the presence of adverse selection effects. In this paper, we examine the impact of cost sharing on mental healthcare utilization in the context of mandatory health insurance where adverse selection is absent. Using a large proprietary dataset of a Dutch private health insurer, we examine to what extent a new copayment scheme for adult mental healthcare changed healthcare utilization. We exploit the fact that non-adults are exempted from copayments. First, we compare changes in utilization among adults and non-adults using t tests and a difference-in-difference analysis. Second, we highlight differential changes in mental healthcare utilization by treatment (duration and type of mental illness) and individual characteristics (gender and socioeconomic status). Third, we evaluate to what extent anticipatory behavior occurred pending the introduction and subsequent repeal of the new copayment scheme. Our results show a strong and significant (p < 0.01) decrease in outpatient secondary mental healthcare utilization among adults following the introduction of copayments, which is absent among non-adults. This decrease is concentrated among treatments for less severe mental illnesses. Furthermore, the utilization patterns suggest the presence of anticipatory behavior.","[Lambregts, Timo R.; van Vliet, Rene C. J.

We find that drought and heat exert a strong impact on virtually all types of crimes, that the impact on property crimes is larger than for violent crimes, and that this relationship has been relatively stable over three decades of economic development. We then use seasonal and geographical disaggregations of weather and agricultural cultivation to examine the prevailing hypothesis that agricultural income shocks drive the weather-crime relationship in developing countries. The patterns we find are consistent with this hypothesis in the case of rainfall shocks, but suggest additional mechanisms may play an important role in driving the heat-crime relationship, consistent with evidence from industrialized countries.","[Blakeslee, David S.] New York Univ Abu Dhabi, Econ, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Fishman, Ram] Tel Aviv Univ, Publ Policy, Tel Aviv, Israel",New York University Abu Dhabi; Tel Aviv University,"Blakeslee, DS (通讯作者)，New York Univ Abu Dhabi, Econ, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.",davidsblakeslee@nyu.edu; ramf@post.tau.ac.il,,,,,,,56,46,48,2,33,UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS,MADISON,"JOURNAL DIVISION, 1930 MONROE ST, 3RD FL, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0022-166X,1548-8004,,J HUM RESOUR,J.

In a current programme on the East Coast of New Zealand, we are undertaking action research to develop culturally appropriate adaptive governance capacity in forest-dependent and rural communities. These communities do not necessarily want more intense or increased forest or agricultural production. They must manage the tensions inherent in an increase in forest and agricultural production, while dealing with severe erosion and a range of social, environmental, economic and cultural aspirations. The processes we are experimenting with are designed to understand land-use actors, their interests, networks and perceived challenges. Using this information, we apply adaptive governance and Kaupapa Maori principles to encourage collaboration and innovative thinking and decision-making. This work is innovative in that it has not been done before in New Zealand, can be scaled up and across contexts, and shift thinking away from traditional forest approaches (i.e. exotic monocultures) that have not worked.

We used baseline data from a large-cluster randomized school trial to study the relationship between HRQoL, bullying experience, and other demographic factors. Cross-sectional self-reported questionnaires collected pre-randomization from the on-going INCLUSIVE trial. The questionnaires were completed in the classroom. The Gatehouse Bullying Scale measured bullying victimization and the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime school misbehavior subscale (ESYTC) measured aggressive behaviors. HRQoL was assessed using the Child Health Utility 9 Dimensions (CHU-9D) and general quality of life using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL). Participants were a cohort of year 7 students (age 11-12 years) from 40 state secondary schools in England. Descriptive statistics for the CHU-9D and PedsQL were calculated using standard methods with tests for differences in median scores by sex assessed using quantile regression. Correlation between HRQoL measures was conducted using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. Predictors of HRQoL were identified using univariate and multiple regressions. A total of 6667 students filled out the questionnaire. The CHU-9D was correlated with the PedsQL (0.63, p < 0.001). The multivariable regression results suggest that if students were bullied frequently and upset it resulted in a decrement in CHU-9D scores of (-0.108) and fall in PedsQL score of (-16.2).

This paper marshals data from a variety of sources to rigorously assess the issue. It begins by using a large survey dataset to trace the evolution in families' child care expenditures. I find that the typical family currently spends 14 percent more on child care than it did in 1990. This is less than half the increase documented in previous work. In addition, most families allocate approximately the same share of income to child care as they did several decades ago. The next section of the paper examines the trend in the market price of child care. The evidence suggests that after persistent, albeit modest, growth throughout the 1990s, market prices have been essentially flat for at least a decade. In the paper's final section, I analyze several features of the child care market that may have implications for prices, including the demand for child care, the skill-level of the child care workforce, and state regulations. A few findings are noteworthy. First, I show that child care demand stagnated around the same time that market prices leveled-off. Second, although the skill-level of the child care workforce increased in absolute terms, highly-educated women increasingly find child care employment less attractive than other occupations. Finally, child care regulations have not systematically increased in stringency, and they appear to have small and inconsistent effects on market prices. Together, these results indicate that the production of child care has not become more costly, which may explain the recent stagnation in market prices.","[Herbst, Chris M.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, 411 N Cent Ave,Suite 420, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA; [Herbst, Chris M.] Arizona State Univ, IZA, 411 N Cent Ave,Suite 420, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Downtown Phoenix; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Downtown Phoenix,"Herbst, CM (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, 411 N Cent Ave,Suite 420, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA.;Herbst, CM (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, IZA, 411 N Cent Ave,Suite 420, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA.",chris.herbst@asu.edu,,,,,,,38,20,25,2,15,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0272-7757,1873-7382,,ECON EDUC REV,Econ.

In this study, the participatory process adopted in the formulation of the second NFP in Czech Republic (NFPII) was analysed considering four aspects: (1) structure of the participatory process; (2) level of participation and social actors involved; (3) role of facilitator; (4) skills and knowledge of participants. The data were collected through in-depth interviews to a sample of stakeholders (44% of total stakeholders involved in the decision-making process). The results of this study show that the participatory process for Czech NFPII was designed considering representativeness, early involvement, independency, influence, transparency, and resource accessibility criterion. The participatory process was structured in two stages: in the first stage the Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of the Environment identified 17 experts to involve in the definition of a first draft of NFPII; in the second stage the two Ministries Identified and involved 18 organized groups of stakeholders in order to discuss the key issues previously identified by experts. The main weakness of participatory process in the formulation of NFPII in Czech Republic is the low level of participation of citizens and the different level of skills and knowledge among participants.

This study aimed to assess disability due to IBD in the Brazilian population and demographic factors potentially associated with absence from work. Analysis was performed using the computerized Single System of Social Security Benefits Information, with a cross-check for aid pension and disability retirement, for Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Additional data were obtained from the platform, including the average values, benefit duration, age, gender and region of the country. Temporary disability occurred more frequently with UC, whereas permanent disability was more frequent with CD. Temporary disability affected more younger patients with CD than patients with UC. Temporary work absences due to UC and CD were greater in the South, and the lowest absence rates due to CD were noted in the North and Northeast. Absence from work was longer (extending for nearly a year) in patients with CD compared to those with UC. The rates of temporary and permanent disability were greater among women. Permanent disability rates were higher in the South (UC) and Southeast (CD). The value of benefits paid for IBD represented approximately 1% of all social security benefits. The benefits paid for CD were higher than for UC, whereas both tended to decrease from 2010 to 2014. In Brazil, IBD frequently causes disability for prolonged periods and contributes to early retirement. Reduction trends may reflect improvements in access to health care and medication. Vocational rehabilitation programs may positively impact social security and the patients' quality of life.","[Froes, Renata de S.

The effect depends on the precision of performance information and may be reversed when cooperation is important. We then investigate panel data spanning different banks and find that stronger differentiation indeed increases subsequent bonus payments.

To understand why, I turn to Weber's theory of patrimonialism, which primarily has been applied to historical or non-Western societies. I argue that patrimonialism-activated through trust, loyalty and tradition-restricts access to financial rewards and facilitates the reproduction of the white male domination of this industry. Using data from 45 in-depth interviews combined with field observations at industry events over a 4-year period, I investigate how hiring, grooming and seeding practices within and among firms enable certain elites to maintain monopolies over financial resources. Applying the theory of patrimonialism to a context with few women and minority men in power-holding positions demonstrates how practices that reproduce elite structures are directly connected to inequality in the workplace.","[Neely, Megan Tobias] Stanford Univ, Michelle R Clayman Inst Gender Res, 450 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94025 USA",Stanford University,"Neely, MT (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Michelle R Clayman Inst Gender Res, 450 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94025 USA.",mtneely@stanford.edu,"Neely, Megan Tobias/ACF-6833-2022","Tobias Neely, Megan/0000-0002-7012-889X",,,,,90,41,46,2,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

The aim of this study was to develop a framework to quantify the potential economic impact of climate change on an industry and analyze the impact of market dynamics on its economic viability under changing climate. To achieve this, a model was developed that incorporates economic, spatial, and biophysical variables. By way of empirical illustration, the focus was on Australia's Sydney rock oyster (SRO) industry. The findings from scenario analyses suggest that the negative effect of projected climate change on the industry's revenue may be moderate overall. However, some production areas may be more affected than others. Furthermore, results suggest that market dynamics could have a larger impact on the future economic sustainability of the industry than direct effects from climate change.","[Schrobback, Peggy] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Pascoe, Sean] EcoSci Precinct, CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, POB 2583, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Coglan, Louisa] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, GPO Box 2434, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia",University of Queensland; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Schrobback, P (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",p.schrobback@gmail.com; sean.pascoe@csiro.au; l.coglan@qut.edu.au,"Coglan, Louisa/AAF-2356-2019; Schrobback, Peggy/X-4697-2019; Pascoe, Sean/D-9710-2011","Coglan, Louisa/0000-0001-5730-7845; Schrobback, Peggy/0000-0003-0526-1659; Pascoe, Sean/0000-0001-6581-2649",Fisheries Research Development Cooperation (FRDC) [2008/306]; Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),Fisheries Research Development Cooperation (FRDC)(Fisheries R&D Corp); Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)),"The authors acknowledge financial support of the Fisheries Research Development Cooperation (FRDC) under FRDC-funded project 2008/306.

The model derives an analytical marginal abatement cost function, dividing the cost according to these direct and indirect effects, and explores the implications for optimal environmental policy. The model is numerically simulated using parameters for the U.S. manufacturing sector for criteria air pollutants, demonstrating that the direct cost of regulations understates the true cost. Moreover, because marginal abatement costs vary across industries, reallocating pollution across industries to achieve cost-effectiveness can generate modest cost savings. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

These findings suggest that changes in organizational structure, such as a merger of physician groups, influence not only the negotiated prices of services, but also service provision.","[Dunn, Abe; Shapiro, Adam Hale] Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - San Francisco,"Shapiro, AH (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA.",adam.shapiro@sf.frb.org,,,,,,,60,12,12,1,4,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",2332-3493,2332-3507,,AM J HEALTH ECON,AM.

Based on an extensive dataset with personality traits, combined with socio-economic data, our findings suggest that the regional clustering of these personality traits contribute to an understanding of the regional dispersion of the Brexit vote. We find evidence that psychological 'Openness' is the personality trait that matters most and that modest changes in this trait could actually have swung the vote across UK districts. Moreover, the relevance of psychological Openness solves the puzzle that UK districts that are relatively dependent on trade with the EU predominantly voted for Leave. By including psychological factors, our results show how we can arrive at a better understanding of the geography of the discontent with globalisation.","[Garretsen, Harry; Stoker, Janka I.; Soudis, Dimitrios] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Groningen, Netherlands; [Martin, Ron L.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge, England; [Rentfrow, Peter Jason] Univ Cambridge, Dept Psychol, Cambridge, England",University of Groningen; University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge,"Garretsen, H (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Groningen, Netherlands.",j.h.garretsen@rug.nl; j.i.stoker@rug.nl; d.soudis@rug.nl; rlm1@cam.ac.uk; pjr39@cam.ac.uk,"Rentfrow, Peter Jason/ABB-9257-2021; Martin, Ronald/JPW-9668-2023","Rentfrow, Peter Jason/0000-0002-9068-2118; Stoker, Janka/0000-0001-5339-1891",,,,,37,34,35,1,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-1378,1752-1386,,CAMB J REG ECON SOC,Camb.

Consumer preferences for credence characteristics are heterogeneous, and stakeholders in the farmed seafood industry can look to both agriculture and marine labels when they seek ways of positioning their products. In this article, we conduct a review of consumer studies related to mandatory and voluntary labels used for farmed seafood. In most developed countries, mandatory seafood labels include information about species, farmed or wild, and area of origin. Voluntary labels include information regarding sustainability, organic production, animal welfare, traceability, and safety. We point to emerging research topics and possibilities. Challenges related to the labeling of farmed seafood are also discussed.","[Alfnes, Frode; Chen, Xianwen; Rickertsen, Kyrre] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Sch Econ & Business, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway; [Chen, Xianwen] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, Oslo, Norway",Norwegian University of Life Sciences; Norwegian Institute Nature Research,"Alfnes, F (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Sch Econ & Business, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway.",frode.alfnes@nmbu.no,"Rickertsen, Kyrre/AAG-6921-2020; Alfnes, Frode/I-8970-2016","Alfnes, Frode/0000-0002-3072-9308; Rickertsen, Kyrre/0000-0002-5068-0847; Chen, Xianwen/0000-0001-9262-2568",Research Council of Norway [238200],Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),This work was supported by The Research Council of Norway [Grant Number 238200].,,126,54,59,5,93,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

Organizations must find ways to handle global, national, market, technological and consumer demands whilst crafting relevant strategies to their internal workings and cultures. When the strategies of organizations are misaligned with market realities, the survival rate rapidly decreases. We suggest that the culture of organizations offer an anchor dictating how organizations perceive themselves, their surroundings, their customers and relevant stakeholders. The assumptions, beliefs and values determine how companies comprehend what is happening inside and outside the organization while dominating the strategy formulation and execution process. In a culture where change is avoided, prompt adaptation to market changes could be painful if not impossible. Thus, we propose that organizational culture can be utilized as a bridge for aligning inner realities of organizations with demands of the outer domain. Essentially, we suggest that organizations' internal values and culture are generally not aligned with their strategic positions and that the focus of organizations need to be on a fit which will create a competitive cultural persona supporting the strategic posture in the marketplace. Such a fit will enable organizations to deploy resources effectively and manage information flow smoothly.","[Alpay, Guven] Bogazici Univ, Dept Management, Istanbul, Turkey; [Buyukbalci, Pinar] Yildiz Tech Univ, Dept Business Adm, Istanbul, Turkey; [Dulger, Meral] Marmara Univ, Dept Business Adm, English, Istanbul, Turkey",Bogazici University; Yildiz Technical University; Marmara University,"Dülger, M (通讯作者)，Marmara Univ, Dept Business Adm, English, Istanbul, Turkey.",alpay@boun.edu.tr,"Buyukbalci, Pinar/ABA-6363-2020; Dülger, Meral/HKN-2924-2023","Dülger, Meral/0000-0002-8491-3522",,,,,36,0,0,3,5,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-76288-3; 978-3-319-76287-6,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2018,9.0,,,,,,85,95,,10.1007/978-3-319-76288-3_7,0.0,,,11,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO7XE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000525862100007,0

This paper applies the propensity score matching technique to household survey data to examine the impact of improved feed technology on fish income and poverty in Kenya. After controlling for observable household characteristics, the results indicate that improved feed technology increases aquaculture income and reduces poverty among fish farming households. Specifically, the income effect of the technology is 23-37%, with resultant poverty reduction effect of 19-23% points. Evidence from the study indicates that the likelihood of adopting improved feed in Kenya will surge with improved extension service delivery, access to government subsidized feed, and easy market access for purchasing improved feed and sale of mature fish.","[Amankwah, Akuffo; Quagrainie, Kwamena K.; Preckel, Paul V.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 403 W State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Amankwah, A (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 403 W State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",amankwah_akuffo@yahoo.com,,"Quagrainie, Kwamena/0000-0001-9272-1419",Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Collaborative Research on Aquaculture & Fisheries through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) [EPP-A-00-06-00012-00]; Norman E.

To characterize sustainable development, indicators systems are developed that enable to adequately assess the means used and the level of goals achievability as well as effective monitoring and management of regional environmental and economic policies. To assess the impact of economic processes on the environment in global practices decoupling analysis which is based on calculating the decoupling index is applied. The traditional calculation of the decoupling index can hardly give a deep evaluation of the decoupling effect (i.e. reveal whether the effect is absolute or relative). The paper proposes a model for analyzing the ecological and economic state of a region on the basis of calculating the adjusted decoupling index, which helps to assess the absolute and relative decoupling effect. Using the proposed model the decoupling effect is analyzed in the Volgograd region in terms of pollutant emissions from stationary sources and discharges of contaminated wastewater. The results suggest the robustness of the proposed model and its advantages over the currently applied decoupling analysis algorithms, which will enable to more efficiently substantiate the measures to support projects in the field of green economy and achieve the goals of sustainable development at the regional level.","[Anikina, Irina; Gukova, Albina; Anikin, Andrey] Volgograd State Univ, Inst Econ & Finance, Corp Finance & Banking Dept, Volgograd, Russia",Volgograd State University (VOLSU),"Anikina, I (通讯作者)，Volgograd State Univ, Inst Econ & Finance, Corp Finance & Banking Dept, Volgograd, Russia.",anikina@volsu.ru; gukova@volsu.ru; kfbd@volsu.ru,"Anikin, Andrey/AAU-1023-2020",,,,,,8,0,0,1,4,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-514-6,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,39.0,,,,,,589,594,,,,,,6,Business; Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BO4YG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000515721900121,0

The theory and practice of leadership have a long history and yet it has much to evolve also. The discrepancies might reside in the fact that the theory builders can't be ahead of the market developments and thus is difficult to create futurist theories. Nowadays, all over the world there is much talking about leadership and the need for leaders. There is a growing interest on the impact of management, leadership and entrepreneurship practices on achieved performance. In recent years, organizations have undergone significant changes, becoming powerful and effective, with a strong desire to have intelligent leaders of emotion with vision and character. Throughout the sections of the paper we present several aspects which help the projection of a comparison between the classic paradigm of leadership and the new philosophy of leadership. Within the introduction section we refer to some of the issues which changed the perception of leadership, like emotional intelligence or leading teams. In order to emphasize what are the coordinates of leadership in today's organizations we decided to present a series of best-practices of well-known global companies which we consider as modern organizations because they are always updated and implementing the latest methods and techniques. The section about leadership of work-teams contains brief argumentation about the most well-known five stages of training, agitation, normalization, running and discontinuing operations. At this point we discussed the effectiveness of a specific type of teams, actually the virtual teams. Following we focused the debate upon the future of organizations and which might be the upcoming challenges to be faced mainly by business companies.","[Baesu, Camelia] Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, 13 Univ, Suceava 720229, Romania",Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava,"Baesu, C (通讯作者)，Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, 13 Univ, Suceava 720229, Romania.",cameliabaesu@gmail.com,,,,,,,34,0,0,0,1,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,633,642,,,,,,10,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200056,0

It is argued that increasing legislative action on the domestic level will require detailed knowledge not only of the substantive obligations of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) but also its various exception clauses. GATS Article XXII:3 is reviewed that shields violations of the national treatment (NT) requirement from challenge in WTO dispute settlement proceedings where the measure falls within the scope of a double taxation agreement (DTA). The ambiguous wording and the lack of jurisprudence on the provision leave states with little guidance on its application. This article explores issues that arise under the provision ratione materiae, temporis, and personae. The quantitative reach of the provision is equally examined. Subsequently, the once-of opportunity to immunize violations of the most-favoured-natiou (MFN) clause by means of inclusion in the List of Article II Exemptions is reviewed. Few states have submitted tax exemptions all of which are, with the exception of the US', narrowly framed. Lastly, the scope of the subparagraphs of the general exception clause, Article XIV, is analysed. In addition to subparagraph c) which may serve to justify a wide range of violations, subparagraphs d) and e), relating to national and MFN treatment respectively, are scrutinized.","[Beyer, Vincent] Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Geneva, Switzerland",,"Beyer, V (通讯作者)，Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Geneva, Switzerland.",vincent.beyer@graduateinstitute.ch,,,,,,,45,4,4,0,1,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

We also demonstrate that beyond the level of globalization, corruption, money laundering, and the status of a country as a tax haven, cross-country similarity also plays an important role.

Analyzing data from 2002 to 2013 of Korean listed companies, we find that auditors spend fewer audit hours and charge lower audit fees for clients with multiple CEOs. Additional tests reveal that the lower audit fees for co-CEO clients are likely attributable to reduced audit effort rather than to reduced hourly rates. We also document that firms with co-CEOs exhibit better-reporting quality than do firms with a solitary CEO. In sum, this article presents evidence that mutual monitoring via co-CEO appointments assures high-quality financial reporting of audit clients, and thus leads to reduced audit fees.","[Choi, Youn-Sik] Kyung Hee Univ, Sch Management, Seoul, South Korea; [Hyeon, Jiwon; Jung, Taejin; Lee, Woo-Jong] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Business Adm, Seoul, South Korea",Kyung Hee University; Seoul National University (SNU),"Lee, WJ (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Business Sch, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea.",woojong@snu.ac.kr,"CHOI, YOUN SIK/AAH-9223-2020","Jung, Taejin/0000-0001-7413-806X; Choi, Youn-Sik/0000-0002-3864-6291",Institute of Management Research at Seoul National University,Institute of Management Research at Seoul National University,"We are grateful for helpful comments and constructive suggestions from Ali Kutan (editor), two anonymous referees, Jong-Hag Choi, Samuel Cheung (discussant), Lee-Seok Hwang, Eunchul Lee (discussant), seminar participants at Seoul National University, conference participants at Korean Accounting Association International Winter Conference, Korea Accounting Information Association Autumn Conference, and 2017 JCAE Annual Symposium.

The changes that have been occurring in the labor market over the past dozen or so years make finding and maintaining a valuable employee an extremely difficult task for the employer. Therefore, companies intensify their efforts to attract potential employees with their offer. Building an image of an attractive employer is now an extremely desirable competence in the labor market. One of the support tools in this field is employer branding (EB). Especially over the last dozen or so years, we have been observing an increase in the importance of this concept, both on the level of theory and practice. It is worth emphasizing that making efforts to build a brand is not a manifestation of current fashion, but has a much deeper cause. Some of them are in the organization itself the others are penetrating from the changes taking place in the near or distant surroundings of the organization. The strongest impact on the increase in the interest of the employer branding organization are the changes taking place in the demographic sphere, i.e. the low birth rate, which results in the contraction of employees' potential on the labor market. This is both a quantitative and a qualitative aspect, for example, specialists are more and more desirable, being able to participate and implement several different projects in parallel. The need to implement tools in the field of employer brand building is confirmed by numerous studies. D. Brain, President & CEO of Edelman Europe, in the Edelman Trust Barometer report(8) emphasizes that the importance of reputation is systematically growing as a decisive factor in the interest of potential employees (especially desirable specialists), attracting them to the organization and building trust that strengthens loyalty and allows the retention of employees. Bearing in mind that this is a relatively new concept and is still under development, the authors, based on the available literature, case study analysis and research carried out by research institutions, aim to systematize the knowledge in this area, identify the the tools used in employer branding along with the characteristics of different generational groups of employees to whom these tools are addressed. This paper is an attempt to answer the following questions: 1. What are the conditions for the growth of interest in employer branding in today's organizations? 2. What characterizes and what are the differences in the system of values, attitudes, behaviors, and needs of employees in the generation cross-section - internal recipients of employer branding activities? 3. How to consistently and long-term to build the image of the enterprise as an attractive employer and what benefits can entrepreneurs bring to the implementation of the discussed concept? 4. What tools are the most effective for implementing this concept?","[Cielemecki, Mariusz] Sledlce Univ Nat Sci & Humanities, Zytnia 17-19 St, PL-08110 Siedlce, Poland; [Wereda, Wioletta] Mil Univ Technol Warsaw, Gen Witolda Urbanowicza 2 St, PL-00908 Warsaw 46, Poland",Military University of Technology in Warsaw,"Cielemecki, M (通讯作者)，Sledlce Univ Nat Sci & Humanities, Zytnia 17-19 St, PL-08110 Siedlce, Poland.",mariusz.cielemecki@uph.edu.pl; weredawioletta@tlen.pl,"Wereda, Wioletta/ABC-1459-2020","Wereda, Wioletta/0000-0002-6948-0239",,,,,39,1,1,0,11,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,416,430,,,,,,15,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200037,0

The Netherlands provides an interesting case in this debate. The Dutch system could be characterized as a system involving managed competition and mandatory healthcare insurance. Information about the quality of care provided by hospitals has been publicly available since 2008. In this paper, we evaluate the relationship between quality scores for three diagnosis groups and the market power indicators of hospitals. We estimate the impact of competition on quality in an environment of liberalized pricing. For this research, we used unique price and production data relating to three diagnosis groups (cataract, adenoid and tonsils, bladder tumor) produced by Dutch hospitals in the period 2008-2011. We also used the quality indicators relating to these diagnosis groups. We reveal a negative relationship between market share and quality score for two of the three diagnosis groups studied, meaning that hospitals in competitive markets have better quality scores than those in concentrated markets. We therefore conclude that more competition is associated with higher quality scores.","[Croes, R. R.] NZa Dutch Healthcare Author, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Croes, R.

Both bankers' greed, with their toxic products, and consumers' greed who, most of them, had borrowed money to buy a second home, were the most important causes of the recent financial crisis. The recent financial crisis has shown us that the Economics itself is in crisis because it is grounded on hypotheses unproven by reality. It refers both to the assumption of spontaneous market regulation and to that of the capitalization of interest. The work demotes these assumptions and proposes as the solution a sustainable development in which the individual returns to the fundamental values: family, environment, community, partnerships, resource saving, communion with others. The main conclusion is that the economy should be understood from the following holistic approaches: economic, social, cultural, philosophical, political and spiritual. With regard to money (as the subjects and the main objects of Economics), the rich is the one who gives, the one who helps his fellows and not the wealthy people of these days who have perverted the economy so that to justify the usury, the speculation and the financial engineering.","[Gazzola, Patrizia] Insubria Univ, Via Ravasi 2, I-21100 Varese, Italy; [Suciu, Titus] Transylvania Univ, 29 Eroilor Blvd, Brasov 500036, Romania",University of Insubria; Transylvania University of Brasov,"Gazzola, P (通讯作者)，Insubria Univ, Via Ravasi 2, I-21100 Varese, Italy.",gazzola@uninsubria.it; titus.suciu@unitbv.ro,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,3,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,202,210,,,,,,9,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200018,0

They did so not as naive globalists, but as desperate realists - realists who had survived the Great Depression and the second great war of the century. In designing the framework that would govern post-war international economic policy, American leaders and technocrats adhered to a set of essential principles. These principles had emerged from their hard-earned experience during the breakdown of global cooperation in the interwar years and the staggering bloodshed of the war itself. A careful review of the substance of negotiations over the formation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and political communications by US officials in support of those institutions - including essays, speeches, and testimony before Congress - suggests a set of vital and, perhaps, enduring principles that won the day: multilateral coordination, liberalization, mutual benefit-mutual responsibility, and economy = security. To American leaders these principles were abundantly evident. Their task was to persuade their domestic and international peers of the necessity of these principles and to put them into action. Ultimately they created a set of interlocking multilateral institutions to facilitate global commerce and global peace.","[Hoffman, Michael E.

Meanwhile, interaction between the two policies plays an extremely important role in explaining the development of stock markets.","[Hu, Lei; Zhang, Qiang] Hunan Univ, Coll Finance & Stat, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Han, Junying] Fortune Secur Co Ltd, Equ Prod Investment Div, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China",Hunan University,"Han, JY (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ, Coll Finance & Stat, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China.",hanjy@cfzq.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71661137006, 71221001]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [71661137006 and 71221001].,,50,7,7,1,46,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The most typical characteristics of the institutional provision of the innovative activity of Europe are studied. They are presented by the necessity of the construction of a multi-level system of the forecasting support for the participants of the innovative process. It was shown that the regional and the sectoral aspects of the institutional provision of the innovative policy and the regional scientific and technological cooperation are closely connected with the encouragement of various forms of the net cooperation among which a specific role in the countries of the European Union is given to the creation of the regional clusters and the nets of the scientific and research cooperation. In the paper the main risks dealing with a fast growth of the number of the enterprises which use cyber physical systems which in their turn have a significant impact on the character of the management of the innovative sphere, on the arising relations and structures are discovered. The authors particularly emphasize the threats of the cyber criminality, prevailing of clearly entrepreneurial tasks over the spirit of research. On the basis of the carried out research the authors make the conclusion about the necessity of taking into account both positive effects (ecological friendliness growth, productivity growth) and the negative ones (sharpening of the cultural conflicts) resulting from an uncontrolled introduction of social innovations. The authors in the end draw the conclusions about a sufficiently systematic character of the European innovative policy which is based on a serious institutional foundation.","[Ivanov, Aleksei S.] Volgograd State Univ, Inst Management & Reg Econ, Chair Management, Volgograd, Russia; [Babich, Tatiana V.; Koneva, Daria A.] Volgograd State Univ, Inst Management & Reg Econ, Chair State & Municipal Adm, Volgograd, Russia",Volgograd State University (VOLSU); Volgograd State University (VOLSU),"Ivanov, AS (通讯作者)，Volgograd State Univ, Inst Management & Reg Econ, Chair Management, Volgograd, Russia.",invanov-volsur@yandex.ru; tat.babich2017@yandex.ru; lady.dugina@yandex.ru,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-514-6,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,39.0,,,,,,90,93,,,,,,4,Business; Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BO4YG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000515721900020,0

The problem of measuring the impact of ICT on the economy is an extremely complicated issue, due to the multitude of variables and the problem with the selection of those most appropriate for that task. ICT development and its use have been regarded in the European Union for a long time as an important factor for maintaining the competitiveness of the European Union's economy, and in the longer term, the standard of living of its citizens. Despite actions taken, the use of ICT is notoriously different across the Member States. The aim of this paper is to analyse the position of V4 countries concerning the use of ICT and compare it with selected European Union Member States and other developed countries.

This article addresses, first, the EU's reformed approach of investment dispute resolution and the repercussions from Asian countries; secondly, concerns which may persist in weighing the new court model and the existing investor-state arbitration system. Some Asian countries have been following very closely the new trend and raise a number of specific questions. It would be very interesting to understand the concerns of the Asian countries and analyse their current positions as well. It seems that Asian countries need to consider key elements concerning its establishment, including the need to build consensus among states, institutional aspect of the new permanent structure, issues relating to the decision-makers, and financial resources at stake.

Hence, China is facing the huge pressure of environmental protection and CO2 emission reduction. The feed-in tariff (FIT) policy that promotes more wind power to substitute for thermal power and a well-functioning carbon price mechanism can significantly affect CO2 abatement, and both can work in coordination to achieve emission reduction. Using panel model, we prove that FIT policy is more effective than other policies in promoting more wind power. Also the slowdown of economic growth, energy substitution, technological progress, and CO2 mitigation requirement can stimulate the expansion of wind power. Additionally, based on the calculation of real abatement cost of wind power, we obtain the provincial and national average of carbon prices (239 CNY/ton and 242 CNY/ton). Specifically, 233-251 CNY/ton will be the range for reasonable carbon price in the future. We find that the carbon prices in this article are higher than those of the emissions trading scheme pilots in 2014 and 2015, due to the relatively high proportion of free allowance. Based on the above conclusions, we proposed some policy suggestions.","[Lin, Boqiang; Chen, Yufang] Xiamen Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Sch Management, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China",Xiamen University,"Lin, BQ (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Sch Management, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.",bqlin@xmu.edu.cn,"Lin, Boqiang/G-3960-2010","Lin, Boqiang/0000-0002-1308-400X",Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy [1260-Z0210011]; Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding [1260-Y07200]; China National Social Science Fund [17AZD013],Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy; Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding; China National Social Science Fund,"The paper is supported by the Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy (No: 1260-Z0210011), Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding (No: 1260-Y07200) and China National Social Science Fund (No. 17AZD013).",,58,18,18,3,54,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The whole market of a given product can be conceptualized as being segmented into several, small local markets. VC has a comprehensive knowledge of local markets in general but is prone to noisy aggregate demand information as a result. While crowdfunding investors have intimate knowledge regarding local demand information in their respective locales, they lack knowledge in other local markets. We show that under certain conditions, crowdfunding can provide more accurate demand information and therefore can generate better incentives to entrepreneurs while improving product quality and helping entrepreneurs make correct decisions on whether or not to launch a new product.

Mobility is one of the most difficult topics to face in the urban areas. Good mobility for citizens and businesses greatly increases the attractiveness and competitiveness of cities. Meeting Europe's 2020 targets, tackling congestion, improving air quality, accessibility and sustainability in cities requires substantial changes in the transport system and its operations, and in the mobility behaviour of people and businesses. Promoting the use of electric vehicles and clean fuels and raising the attractiveness of public transport, collective transport, and cycling comes hand-in-hand with improving infrastructures and increasing intermodality between different transport types. This paper explores smart mobility issues in the selected EU medium-sized cities. The aim of the paper is to present one of the methods used to compare the smart urban development, taking as a case study mobility dimension in three European cities: Valladolid, Bremen and Szczecin. The study is based on the literature sources analysis and data regarding six key fields of smart urban development with a special regard to smart mobility indicators.

First, the results suggest that only some types of social capital are relevant for labor force participation: namely, networks with weaker yet far-reaching connections, including higher-status individuals. There are neither empirical nor theoretical reasons to believe that women have better access to such networks than men. Second, this type of social capital is only relevant for the economic integration of the richest women, failing to increase labor force participation among women of the other 80 percent of households. Thus, this study concludes that policies targeted at women's economic integration based on the presumption that women have more social capital than men are deeply flawed.","[Puga, Ismael] Univ Cent Chile, Fac Ciencias Sociales, Lord Cochrane 417, Santiago, Chile; [Soto, Daniela] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Intercultural & Indigenous Res, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7810436, Region Metropol, Chile",Universidad Central de Chile; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Puga, I (通讯作者)，Univ Cent Chile, Fac Ciencias Sociales, Lord Cochrane 417, Santiago, Chile.",ismael.puga@ucentral.cl; dsotoh@uc.cl,"Puga Rayo, Ismael/A-4175-2017","Puga Rayo, Ismael/0000-0002-6385-9678; Soto, Daniela/0000-0001-8555-0244",Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies [CONICYT/FONDAP/15130009],Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies,The authors thank Prof. Dante Contreras for the excellent feedback provided during the development of this research.

The selection of suppliers in this paper is based on the application of the interval fuzzy logic and the group decision making model. Interval fuzzy logic was applied to the AHP and TOPSIS methods. The AHP method has determined the weights of the criteria, while TOPSIS method ranks the supplier based on the distance from an ideally positive and negative solution. Linguistic values were used to meet the criteria of supplier. Based on a practical example conducted on real suppliers, it has been established that supplier A(6) shows the best results in relation to other suppliers.

Furthermore, the gender wealth gap is much larger in Switzerland than in Australia. The study links this finding to the type of wealth held by individuals in these two countries.

The present article uses a qualitative and quantitative approach for the optimal selection of project portfolios and applies a set of techniques, including data envelopment analysis (DEA) and fuzzy analytic network process (FANP) for project portfolio management space for the first time. This algorithm can also be used to optimize project portfolios based on a multi-objective non-linear programming (MONLP) model. The MONLP model will be solved by efficient branch and bound algorithm. A more accurate estimation can be accomplished for the selection of a low risk portfolio by adding these two new criteria for computing risk numbers in terms of their proximity to the event and the ability to control and modify them in the future. This algorithm will ultimately be applied for a real case study in Mobarakeh Steel Co., a leading Iranian company producing steel sheets.","[Sharifighazvini, M. R.; Ghezavati, V.

We clustered Russian regions into four clusters which represent the scientific and technical potential, the level of innovation activity and the state of innovations' activity sphere. The results of the clustering have enabled us to define three leading regions which stand out due to their high-quality innovation activity. What is common for many other regions is that the ineffective unleashing interferes with their high innovation potential.

In an IPO setting, we find that earnings management (long-term performance) significantly decreases (increases) with the ownership of corporate venture capital firms. However, we do not find a significant relation between the ownership of independent venture capital firms and earnings management or long-term performance.

To study the implication relationship, on the one hand, we present an investor's expectation-forming and decision-making model to summarize the key features of individual behavior. We think the individual expectation is determined mainly by the number of differences between positive signals and negative signals in the information flow. The behavior is determined by both the expectations of investors around him (her) and the expected returns from a potential action. On the other hand, we simulate an investor community to verify if the model is able to replicate the related stylized facts. Mainly, three conclusions are drawn from the simulation: (1) A relationship of asymmetrical conditional dependence exists between expectation consistency and behavior consistency. (2) Market volatility is caused mainly by the difference between expectation consistency and behavior consistency. As the density of connections in the investor community network increases, the difference between them grows. (3) Influential investors have profound impacts on the formation of normal investors' expectations and behavior. Thus influential investors play an important role in determining the degree of market volatility.","[Wang, Yong] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Social Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Deng, Hanzhong] Tsinghua Univ, Inst Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University; Tsinghua University,"Deng, HZ (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Inst Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",deng9596@gmail.com,"Wang, Yong/HTQ-0502-2023","Wang, Yong/0009-0003-4045-1519",,,,,57,3,4,4,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

(2) Promoting food security in poverty-stricken areas through territorial development and poverty alleviation. (3) Increasing the development resources of poor peasant households through land development and poverty alleviation. In view of the problems of poverty alleviation in Wumeng Mountain Area, three policies have been put forward: transforming the government's investment in territorial development into the policies of village-level organizations and peasant assets, guiding some land to poor peasant households, and guiding some land to poor peasant households.","[Zhao Mei; Zhao Yaqiao; Li Xuekun; Zhou Lv; Wang Qi] Yunnan Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Kunming 650201, Yunnan, Peoples R China",Yunnan Agricultural University,"Wang, Q (通讯作者)，Yunnan Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Kunming 650201, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",,"Zhang, Can/JUU-9511-2023",,Public Welfare Industry Research Project of Ministry of Natural Resources [201511003],Public Welfare Industry Research Project of Ministry of Natural Resources,Foundation Project: Public Welfare Industry Research Project of Ministry of Natural Resources (201511003),,7,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-642-6,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2018,290.0,,,,,,199,202,,,,,,4,Economics; Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BM5QX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000465421000051,0

Although most Eurosceptics and pro-Europeans agree that, in its current form, it much resembles a half-built house, the former would rather dismantle it, while the latter will prescribe the creation of a fiscal union.

But the challenge to recover economic and ecological functionality could be far beyond their financial capacity. Here, we explore the potential of markets and their interaction with policies to leverage investment for FLR in the tropics. We first review the challenges and opportunities of exploiting market forces for FLR, which can be essential for kick-starting the implementation of programs globally. We identify four key opportunities for regulating markets to promote FLR: economic mechanisms; technological, educational or infrastructural investment; legal and enforcement mechanisms; and market-led standards and certification schemes. Finally, we present five pitfalls that may arise when relying on markets to promote FLR. Governments will need to play a critical role in establishing appropriate policy frameworks and institutional arrangements to leverage investments when market signals are not strong enough to initiate changes in traditional land use or farming practices, or to regulate reforestation activities when market signals become so strong that they overwhelm all other land-use activities, leading to a transformed and homogenized landscape.","[Brancalion, Pedro H.

J,"Robertson, SL",,,,"Robertson, Susan L.",,,"Colonising the future: Mega-trade deals, education services and global higher education markets",FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Time-future; Higher education; Power; Trade agreements; Education services; Beckert,TIME,"This paper explores a less well-examined aspect of time in relation to higher education and the academy; that of 'time-future'. The paper takes the case of education trade strategies being pursued by governments and allied agencies, and explores the multiple ways in which time-future is mobilised. Drawing on trade documents, government statistics, and related reports, the paper points to two time-future dynamics at work. The first dynamic focuses on the ways in which the future is imagined by strategic actors, and legitimated through creating equivalences between education trade, economic growth and prosperity. The second dynamic explores the ways in which the current round of global and regional trade negotiations colonise the future as a political resource. I reflect on how time-future is a key resource and modality of power to be claimed and cognitively shaped so as to reorient actor's expectations towards the rhythms and demands of capitalism, and away from the temporal orders of the academy. However, efforts to commodify higher education, on the one hand, and colonise higher education futures exclusively to serve the interests of economic investors, on the other, continues to be contested. As a result, a new temporal order is yet to become common-sense, and an existing order is yet to die. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: An economic evaluation was conducted within a multi-centre trial. 94 patients were randomised to either eight sessions of nurse-led CBT or supportive listening (SL). Costs were calculated from the health, social and indirect care perspectives, and combined with additional quality-adjusted life years (QALY) or improvement on the GHQ-12 score, to explore cost-effectiveness at 12 months. Results: CBT had higher mean health costs ( pound 1610, 95% CI, - pound 187 to 3771) and slightly better QALYs (0.0053, 95% CI, -0.059 to 0.103) compared to SL but these differences were not statistically significant. This yielded pound 301,509 per QALY improvement, indicating that CBT is not cost-effective according to established UK NHS thresholds. The extra cost per patient improvement on the GHQ-12 scale was pound 821 from the same perspective. Using a pound 20,000, threshold, CBT in this format has a 9% probability of being cost effective. Although subgroup analysis of patients with clinical levels of distress at baseline showed an improvement in the position of CBT compared to SL, CBT was still not cost-effective. Conclusion: Nurse delivered CBT is more effective in reducing distress among MS patients compared to SL, but is highly unlikely to be cost-effective using a preference-based measure of health (EQ-5D). Results from a diseasespecific measure (GHQ-12) produced comparatively lower Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios, but there is currently no acceptable willingness-to-pay threshold for this measure to guide decision-making.","[Mosweu, I.; McCrone, P.] Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, Kings Hlth Econ, David Goldberg Ctr, Box 024,De Crespigny Pk,Denmark Hill, London SE5 8AF, England; [Moss-Morris, R.] Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, Dept Psychol, London, England; [Dennison, L.] Univ Southampton, Sch Psychol, Southampton, Hants, England; [Chalder, T.] Kings Coll London, Dept Psychol Med, Cutcombe Rd, London SE5 9RJ, England",University of London; King's College London; University of London; King's College London; University of Southampton; University of London; King's College London,"Mosweu, I (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, Kings Hlth Econ, David Goldberg Ctr, Box 024,De Crespigny Pk,Denmark Hill, London SE5 8AF, England.",iris.mosweu@kcl.ac.uk,"Chalder, Trudie/A-5717-2011; Mosweu, Iris/P-4391-2016","Chalder, Trudie/0000-0003-0775-1045; Mosweu, Iris/0000-0001-6797-2478; Dennison, Laura/0000-0003-0122-6610; McCrone, Paul/0000-0001-7001-4502; Moss-Morris, Rona/0000-0002-2927-3446",MS Society in the UK [872/07],MS Society in the UK,"This paper summarises independent research funded by the MS Society in the UK (award number 872/07).

This network perspective provides a rather comprehensive overview of the basic architecture of China's state-owned sector. It illustrates important governance institutions that are unobservable from the laws on the book and distinctive from international standards. It clarifies some SOE behaviors that appear puzzling when taking the individual firm as the unit of analysis.

The news media are important sources for framing the meanings of emerging technologies such as 3D food printing and introducing them to publics. In this article, I discuss the findings of an analysis of online news reporting of 3D printed food technology. A sociocultural perspective was adopted, in which the promissory themes contributing to broader sociotechnical imaginaries related to food and novel technologies were identified in the corpus of news stories examined. These imaginaries can be pivotal in framing collective ideas of where the futures of technologies lie. The analysis found that, unlike coverage of many other novel food technologies, the corpus of online news reports examined overwhelmingly framed food printing technologies in positive ways. Five major promissory themes were identified, portraying 3D printed food technologies as: futuristic; creative; healthy; efficient; and sustainable. These themes contributed to sociotechnical imaginaries that drew on a number of contemporary preoccupations related to food cultures: novelty, entertainment and leisure pursuits; convenience and time-saving; effective production and distribution; health and nutritional aspects; and environmental impacts and global food security.","[Lupton, Deborah] Univ Canberra, Fac Arts & Design, News & Media Res Ctr, Canberra, ACT, Australia",University of Canberra,"Lupton, D (通讯作者)，Univ Canberra, Fac Arts & Design, News & Media Res Ctr, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",deborah.lupton@canberra.edu.au,"Lupton, Deborah A/F-5638-2011","Lupton, Deborah A/0000-0003-2658-4430",,,,,39,30,31,4,70,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,OCT,2017,93.0,,,,,,44,53,,10.1016/j.futures.2017.08.001,0.0,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,FK3MX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413390300004,0

But in the forestry sector, even limited devolution of powers often constrains local user groups with excessive bureaucratic burdens. In addition, entrenched political economy interests tend to inhibit effective governance. To investigate the apparent institutional malaise that seems to characterise community forestry sites in Cambodia, this study employed a mixed methods approach to evaluate capacities to engage in collective action on forest governance. In our two case studies, community forestry is characterised by the exclusion of younger and poorer households from formal meetings, high costs and limited benefits for members, informal information channels where women and poorer households are excluded, low levels of formalisation, high enforcement costs and massive external pressures. The article calls for community forest entities to develop locally-adapted graduated sanction mechanisms through the receipt of greater support for internal monitoring and enforcement.","[Persson, Joel; Prowse, Martin] Lund Univ, Dept Human Geog, Solvegatan 10, S-22362 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Prowse, M (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Human Geog, Solvegatan 10, S-22362 Lund, Sweden.",martin.prowse@keg.lu.se,"; Prowse, Martin/C-1669-2015","Persson, Joel/0000-0001-7536-793X; Prowse, Martin/0000-0002-1271-468X",,,,,69,27,29,3,39,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,OCT,2017,83.0,,,,,,70,79,,10.1016/j.forpol.2017.06.008,0.0,,,10,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,FK6JW,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413611000008,0

Using an instrumental variables estimation, we find the percentage of students meeting test score proficiency thresholds decrease in math and reading in the first couple years after the capital expenditures and then increase in subsequent years. These results are consistent with short-term disruptions in student learning followed by long-term benefits from the capital expenditures. We also consider mechanisms by which capital expenditures affect achievement and find some evidence that changes in capital expenditures are correlated with changes in operating expenditures, suggesting that some of these effects may be attributable to operating expenditures. We find similar effects of these capital investments on the housing market. While in the short-term these construction projects decrease home prices, the housing market does benefit in the long-term from improvements to the capital stock. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Often access is regulated inter alia by multiple-choice entrance exams. The application of this testing format is problematic if it favors the answering strategies of certain groups. We present the results of a field experiment in answering multiple-choice questions. Our sample consists of 2113 pupils from different school types. We find that girls skip more answers than boys only if the questions are difficult. This gender gap vanishes when extrinsic rewards are provided. This suggests that our findings are compatible with a stereotype threat explanation. Moreover, the gender gap is found only for pupils of school types preparing for the academic track. It is therefore important to consider all social strata in the design of testing formats. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper lies at the intersection of the above two topics: by focusing on a typical behavior of acculturation, namely English-name usage, I examine the extent of acculturational homophily among Chinese students. Specifically, I investigate the relationship between self English-name usage and English-name usage of close friends using online social networking data on students who receive undergraduate education in China and graduate education in the U.S. The empirical analysis relies on an instrumental variable strategy: I use the indicator of the difficulty of pronouncing the Chinese name in English to instrument for English-name usage. Results suggest the presence of acculturational homophily: students with English-name usage have more close friends who are also English-name users, and the relationship is not based on the number of close friends overall.

Its approach combines two literatures: An experimental one that varies the price of consequential contribution decisions indirectly, and the stated preferences literature that elicits responses from subjects to direct, but hypothetical price variations. We apply this approach to the price elasticity of participating in climate change mitigation. In an online field experiment, we observe the decision of a representative sample of 2,440 subjects whether to reduce the emissions of CO2 into the atmosphere by one metric ton or receive a monetary reward between 2 and (sic)100. In contrast to previous findings from indirect price variation, but in line with stated preference approaches, voluntary PEB is found to have non-zero elasticity of probability (about -0.3 across the treatment range). The inelastic response of the probability of PEB to direct price variation is robust with respect to a range of controls and with respect to the potential problem of field price censoring.

The Austrian Federal Forests (Osterreichische Bundesforste -OBf) recently commissioned a research project on the valuation of this ecosystem service by means of the replacement cost method and the hedonic pricing approach. Based on the international literature, this paper focuses on a careful and realistic design of the baseline scenario with which the marginal change in ecosystem services can be assessed and valued. While the (current) management scenario is rather clear and reflects the approach pursued by the OBf (reasonably labeled as multifunctional forestry), the design of the baseline scenario (intensified commercial forestry) assumes a reduced protective function of the forests which, however, would still have to be in line with strict legal frameworks such as the Austrian Forest Act or European nature conservation directives. Given these strict frameworks, the potential leeway for commercial forestry is rather limited; still, the current multifunctional forest management secures ecosystem services worth up to EUR 14.7 m per year (valued at replacement costs of technical measures to substitute the protective function of forests), which corresponds to EUR 268 per hectare and year. The result of the hedonic pricing approach for property in hazard zones protected by forests is substantially lower: The ecosystem service is valued at EUR 2.9 m per year (which corresponds to an annual per-hectare value of EUR 53). The results in general underline the importance of multifunctional forestry and of the ecosystem services function sustained especially in state-owned forests. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The politicization and demystification of the global trade agenda by civil society also opens up space for a more diverse set of actors to influence trade negotiations. This article examines the evolution of the WTO secretariat's engagement with civil society within this context and argues that the dominant mode of engagement, as manifest in WTO Public Forums and civil society participation in ministerial conferences, is no longer fit for purpose. Rather it reflects an outmoded strategy that once served to underscore the existence and value of the WTO as an international organization and works to neutralize political contestation and publicly promote the benefits of free trade. It is now in need of reform.","[Hannah, Erin] Univ Western Ontario, Kings Univ Coll, London, ON, Canada; [Scott, James] Kings Coll London, London, England; [Wilkinson, Rorden] Univ Sussex, Brighton, E Sussex, England",Western University (University of Western Ontario); University of London; King's College London; University of Sussex,"Wilkinson, R (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",rorden.wilkinson@sussex.ac.uk,,"Wilkinson, Rorden/0000-0002-0883-8081; Scott, James/0000-0003-3296-0375",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),We gratefully acknowledge the support of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada for funding part of the research out of which this paper emerges.

This observation naturally leads to the question whose utility values should be used as the basis in cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA). Intuitively, one would presume that patients are better informed about the consequences of their illness, and public authorities should, therefore, use the patients' utility values in CEA. Contrary to this presumption, it has been argued that society at large should determine which values are to be used and not the patients because, in the end, it is societal resources that are to be allocated. Against this background, we use data from a discrete choice experiment (DCE) that was completed by patients of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and non-patients to explore the discrepancies between the two groups' utility estimates for typical consequences of RA. Our results indicate that both groups attach remarkably similar part-worth utilities to the symptoms pain, fatigue, and functional limitations.

The ARDL model is employed in order to investigate the long-term and short-term static relationship between health expenditure and economic growth. The results show that a 1 % increase in per-capita health expenditure will lead to a 0.434 % increase in per-capita gross domestic product.

Our objective was to evaluate the impact of the French P4P program (CAPI) on the early detection of breast cancer among women between 50 and 74 years old. Based on an administrative database of 50,752 women aged 50-74 years followed between 2007 and 2011, we estimated a difference-in-difference model of breast cancer screening uptake as a function of visit to a CAPI signatory referral GP, while controlling for both supply-side and demand-side determinants (e.g., sociodemographics, health and healthcare use). Breast cancer screening rates have not changed significantly since the P4P program implementation. Overall, visiting a CAPI signatory referral GP at least once in the pre-CAPI period increased the probability of undergoing breast cancer screening by 1.38 % [95 % CI (0.41-2.35 %)], but the effect was not significantly different following the implementation of the contract. The French P4P program had a nonsignificant impact on breast cancer screening uptake. This result may reflect the fact that the low-powered incentives implemented in France through the CAPI might not provide sufficient leverage to generate better practices, thus inviting regulators to seek additional tools beyond P4P in the field of prevention and screening.","[Sicsic, Jonathan; Franc, Carine] Univ Paris Saclay, Univ Paris Sud, CESP, UVSQ,INSERM,Hop Paul Brousse Couturier, 16 Ave Paul Vaillant Couturier, F-94807 Villejuif, France",Universite Paris Saclay; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Paul-Brousse - APHP,"Sicsic, J (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Saclay, Univ Paris Sud, CESP, UVSQ,INSERM,Hop Paul Brousse Couturier, 16 Ave Paul Vaillant Couturier, F-94807 Villejuif, France.",jonathan.sicsic@inserm.fr,"SICSIC, Jonathan/M-1549-2018; Franc, Carine/R-4207-2018","SICSIC, Jonathan/0000-0002-5509-4791; Franc, Carine/0000-0001-7166-6895",Canceropole; National Institute for Cancer (INCa),Canceropole(Region Ile-de-France); National Institute for Cancer (INCa),We are indebted to the Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Maladie des Travaileurs Salaries (CNAMTS) for giving access to the data.

Differences-in-differences analysis using a propensity score control group shows that all-cause mortality declined by 6 percent, with the most robust reductions for health-care amenable causes. HIV-related mortality (affected by the recent introduction of antiretrovirals) accounted for 20 percent of the effect. Mortality changes were closely linked to county-level coverage gains, with one life saved annually for every 239 to 316 adults gaining insurance.

Very often, the leasing arrangement takes the form of a club, wherein a specified number of members pay an annual fee to either a landowner or the club's manager to have a certain bundle of access rights in accordance with other club regulations or attributes. Currently, little is formally known about hunter preferences for club characteristics. The objective of this study was to identify hunter preferences for attributes related to big game hunting clubs and to derive measures of economic value for these attributes. This was accomplished by conducting a choice experiment (CE) via a mail survey in 2012 of licensed big game hunters in Georgia. The CE presented respondents with alternative hunting clubs representing different combinations of attributes including acreage, membership number, harvest regulations, recent forest management activity, and annual club dues. Responses were analyzed with conditional logit and multinomial probit regression models. Consistent with economic theory, hunters preferred more acreage and fewer members. The least preferred harvest regulation was a one buck limit without size restriction while recent clearcutting was the least preferred forest management activity. Results should provide a better understanding of big game hunters' preferences and trade-offs for club attributes and should help landowners and club managers make management decisions that enhance the value of their resources.

At prior phases of the legal process, a WTO Panel and the Appellate Body had sided with Canada and Mexico by finding that the US regulation had negatively affected their exports of livestock - cattle and hogs - to the US market. The arbitrators authorized Canada and Mexico to retaliate by over $1 billion against US exports - the second largest authorized retaliation on record and only the twelfth WTO dispute to reach the stage of an arbitration report. Our legal-economic analysis focuses on several issues in the arbitration report. First, the complainants requested that, to compute the permissible retaliation limit, the arbitrators consider a new formula that would include the effects of domestic price suppression. We present a simple, economics-based model to explain the arbitrators' rejection of this proposal. Second, we provide market context for the $1 billion finding. The arbitrators relied on the trade effects' formula, which sets the retaliation limit as equivalent to the perceived loss of export revenue from the WTO violation. We argue that this amount was implausibly large, given the conditions in the US market for cattle and hogs during this period. We then describe the challenges facing arbitrators as they construct such estimates, including those likely to have arisen in this dispute.","[Bown, Chad P.] Peterson Inst Int Econ, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Bown, Chad P.] CEPR, London, England; [Brewster, Rachel] Duke Law Sch, Durham, NC USA",Peterson Institute for International Economics; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Duke University,"Bown, CP (通讯作者)，Peterson Inst Int Econ, Washington, DC 20036 USA.;Bown, CP (通讯作者)，CEPR, London, England.",cbown@piie.com; Brewster@law.duke.edu,,"Bown, Chad/0000-0002-6963-7857",,,,,26,7,8,0,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,APR,2017,16.0,2,,,,,371,394,,10.1017/S1474745616000586,0.0,,,24,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,EQ6NA,,"Bronze, Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000398197500011,0

The cross-country comparison of five corporate governance indicators shows how the implementation of a similar set of liberalizing reforms had a puzzlingly divergent impact in France, Italy and Spain. An actor-centred coalitional approach is applied to demonstrate how such divergence was created by the same dynamic: the exploitation of liberalization by domestic corporate insiders. Leveraging their unparalleled power resources, corporate insiders mediate the effects of liberalizing legal reforms on corporate outcomes. Hence, liberalization, rather than favouring outsiders' contention, further strengthened the insider nature of French, Italian and Spanish corporate governance. The validity of these claims is tested by looking at the impact of the Eurozone crisis on the power of corporate insiders.","[Bulfone, Fabio] European Univ Inst, Fiesole, Italy",European University Institute,"Bulfone, F (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Fiesole, Italy.",Fabio.bulfone@eui.eu,,,,,,,72,7,7,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

However, this changed when analyses were made of cases of land use change or old growth forest logging for bioenergy purposes. These analyses showed a significant carbon debt that could take hundreds of years to be compensated by the substitution factor of the bioenergy. Currently, carbon debt analyses are often carried out: 1) at one hectare scale, or 2) against the hypothetical case of allowing the managed forest to grow to an old-growth state, or 3) in a comparison against short term policy goals. All three are not realistic for European forests. Here we analysed carbon debt and parity of realistically increased harvesting over large forest areas in Europe. We found that under such realistic cases, a carbon debt does not occur. i.e. the large scale average stocks in the forest are not reduced. What does occur is a parity compared to the baseline harvesting levels. The parity effect was eventually also compensated for. However it took long, espedaily if final fellings were increased for bioenergy; which is a rather hypothetical case. In case of increased thinnings, the parity equality was often reached within 80 years compared to burning coal. Removal of harvesting residues was often compensated within 1 decade. However, parity is a theoretical comparison against a higher baseline C stock in the forest. It is not certain that this higher stocking under the baseline will be sustained, because there is an increasing chance of natural disturbances. Thus the parity may be much shorter than analysed here. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Nabuurs, Gert-Jan; Arets, Eric J. M.

By increasing the informational content of grades, central exams may improve the sorting of students by productivity. To test this, we exploit the unique German setting where students from states with and without central exams work on the same labor market. Our difference-in-difference model estimates whether the earnings difference between individuals with high and low grades differs between central and local exams. We find that the earnings premium for a one standard-deviation increase in high-school grades is indeed 6% when obtained on central exams but less than 2% when obtained on local exams.

The analysis reveals an economy with women engaging increasingly in business in an expanding range of sectors. By the 1890s, women managed nearly a quarter of Santiago's firms and 5 percent of elite firms nationally. Widows appeared overrepresented among elite businesses and underrepresented among those of the non-elite. These results suggest that institutions constraining entrepreneurship among married women were more strongly enforced among the elite than among other social classes. The evidence thus suggests that during late nineteenth century there was an increase in the economic autonomy exercised by unmarried women and widows of all socioeconomic strata, but also by married women among the non-elite.","[Andrae, Bernardita Escobar] Univ Talca, Fac Econ & Business, CIEPLAN UTalca Program, Talca, Chile",Universidad de Talca,"Andrae, BE (通讯作者)，Univ Talca, Fac Econ & Business, CIEPLAN UTalca Program, Talca, Chile.",bernardita.escobar@cieplan.org,"Escobar, Bernardita/JVO-2641-2024","Escobar, Bernardita/0000-0003-0244-816X",Faculty of Business and Economics at Universidad Diego Portales,Faculty of Business and Economics at Universidad Diego Portales,"I gratefully acknowledge the support from the research fund of Faculty of Business and Economics at Universidad Diego Portales that partly funded stages of the process of collection and digitalization of official records; and the assistance of Elena Gordeeva in the taking of pictures of the trademarks books.

In the first step, we use the structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) approach to identify the global shocks. Second, we regress the disaggregated price indices for selected European economies on the global shocks controlling for the domestic variables. We find that the fluctuations of inflation in the analyzed countries are to large extent determined by the cyclical movements of the domestic output gap however the commodity shock also contributes strongly to inflation variability. The role of the non-commodity global supply shock is less prominent, however, interpreted to some extent as a globalization shock, for most of the analyzed period lowers the inflation. Nonetheless, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, this shock reversed what may be interpreted as the weakening of the globalization process.","[Halka, Aleksandra; Kotlowski, Jacek] Natl Bank Poland, Ul Swietokrzyska 11-21, PL-00919 Warsaw, Poland; [Kotlowski, Jacek] Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland",Narodowy Bank Polski; Warsaw School of Economics,"Halka, A (通讯作者)，Natl Bank Poland, Ul Swietokrzyska 11-21, PL-00919 Warsaw, Poland.",aleksandra.halka@nbp.pl,,,,,,,49,14,14,2,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Taking our cue from John Dewey, the new is here interpreted as a consequence of indeterminacy. We study practices that induce indeterminacy in order to 'source' the new. Based on findings from a collective research programme, we distinguish three ways of inducing indeterminacy: configuring situations, creating things and risking valuations. For each of these ways of inducing indeterminacy basic variations are described and discussed in greater detail. The three ways of inducing indeterminacy are shown to correspond to a present-centred concept of time that distinguishes the now from a past and a future horizon. The cases presented affirm the claim that the new is not an inevitable consequence of the increasing entanglement of technoscience and the economy but something that needs to be sought for, cared for and actively produced.","[Hutter, Michael] Berlin Social Sci Ctr WZB, Berlin, Germany; [Farias, Ignacio] Tech Univ Munich, Munich Ctr Technol Soc, Munich, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Farías, I (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, Munich Ctr Technol Soc, Munich, Germany.",ignacio.farias@tum.de,,"Farias, Ignacio/0000-0002-6611-2975",,,,,77,17,18,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

However, governments may overshoot the requirements of health and consumer safety and use SPS and TBT to shield domestic producers from fair competition. Potential abuses of both measures as protectionist tools not only constrain international trade but also consumers' welfare by restricting the choices of goods available to them. Our analysis shows that in general the measures seem to be positive for trade after controlling for other factors. However, the impacts are mainly driven by exports from advanced economies. Less developed countries do not gain as much when implementing the measures or are disadvantaged in exporting goods, particularly when importers are advanced economies. Within South countries, developing Asia are more adversely affected by SPS while non-Asian developing country exports are afflicted more by TBT. SPS in particular is damaging intraregional agricultural trade among Asian countries, which calls for policy makers to act more proactively in resolving nontariff hurdles in the region.","[Kang, Jong Woo; Ramizo, Dorothea M.] Asian Dev Bank, Econ Res & Cooperat Dept, Manila, Philippines",Asian Development Bank,"Kang, JW (通讯作者)，Asian Dev Bank, Econ Res & Cooperat Dept, Manila, Philippines.",jkang@adb.org; dramizo.consultant@adb.org,,,,,,,17,5,5,1,17,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Permanent developmental disproportions reinforce divisions in the country's spatial structure. Persistent differences in the economic potential of individual regions constitute one of the basic problems of the modern economy. The concept of sustainable development calls for equalization of the differences between developed and peripheral regions.

Against this development, this study empirically examines, for a sample of 55 European listed companies, whether there is a change in such voluntary disclosures from period previous to the directive (2012) in comparison to period after the issuing of the directive and before its transposition in national legislation (2015). Following a legitimacy theory perspective, we expected companies to improve the amount and quality of disclosures. Further, we expected disclosures to be associated with legitimacy variables i.e.: negative disclosures, exposure to corruption and firm size. We assessed and compared the quantity, breadth and informational quality of the disclosures and conducted the analysis on the whole sample and on two sub-samples including respectively firms exposed and not exposed to corruption. Results show a growth of the quantity, scope and informational quality of the disclosures on anti-corruption and a positive association of quantity, scope and informational quality of anti-corruption disclosure with time effect, propensity of a firm towards voluntary negative disclosure on corruption information, corruption-risk exposure and firm size.","[Landis, Cristina] Univ Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany; [Paglietti, Paola] Univ Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy",University of Regensburg; University of Cagliari,"Landis, C (通讯作者)，Univ Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.",Cristina.Landis@wiwi.uni-regensburg.de; ppagliet@unica.it,,,Bavarian program zur Realisierung der Chancengleichheit fur Frauen in Forschung und Lehre through the University of Regensburg,Bavarian program zur Realisierung der Chancengleichheit fur Frauen in Forschung und Lehre through the University of Regensburg,"The authors wish to thank Christoph Deiminger, Christoph Durchschein and Michael Link for their helpful suggestions, and the two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments.

Concerns about food security only intensified at the WTO following the 2008 Global Food Crisis, with the Bali and Nairobi Ministerials revealing polarized views between the US and India on the financing of public food stockholding. These `food fights' at the WTO have attracted significant international media, civil society, and scholarly attention. In this article, I argue that inter-state disagreement on food security is not new or specific to the Doha Round but instead has been a recurrent phenomenon in the multilateral trade system for decades. Employing an historical approach, I show that food security has repeatedly been an item of negotiation in successive GATT negotiating rounds and has been steadily codified in international trade law over time. Today, food security is deeply integrated into the rules of the trade regime, making the WTO an important yet largely unacknowledged institution in global food security governance.","[Margulis, Matias E.] Univ Stirling, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland",University of Stirling,"Margulis, ME (通讯作者)，Univ Stirling, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",m.e.margulis@stir.ac.uk,,"Margulis, Matias/0000-0003-0931-6581",,,,,121,20,21,1,26,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JAN,2017,16.0,1,,,,,25,57,,10.1017/S1474745616000410,0.0,,,33,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,EN9YV,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000396356400002,0

We performed an analysis of all direct costs associated with CF relative to key disease features and laboratory examinations. A retrospective prevalence-based cost-of-illness (COI) study was performed in a representative cohort of 242 CF patients in the Czech Republic, which represents about 65 % of all Czech CF patients. Medical records and invoices to health insurance companies for reference year 2010 were analyzed. The mean total health care costs were a,notsign14,486 per patient, with the majority of the costs going towards medicinal products and devices (a,notsign10,321). Medical procedures (a,notsign2676) and inpatient care (a,notsign1829) represented a much smaller percentage of costs. A generalized linear model showed that the strongest cost drivers, for all cost categories, were associated with patient age and lung disease severity (assessed using the FEV1 spirometric parameter), when compounded by chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa airway infections. Specifically, maximum total costs are around the age 16 years; a FEV1 increase of 1 % point represented a cost decrease of: 0.9 % (medicinal products), 1.7 % (total costs), 2.8 % (procedures) and 7.0 % (inpatient care). COI analysis and regression modeling using the most recent data available can provide a better understanding of the overall economic CF burden. A comparison of our results with other methodologically similar studies demonstrates that although overall costs may differ, FEV1 can nonetheless be utilized as a generally transferrable indicator of the relative economic impact of CF.","[Mlcoch, Tomas; Jircikova, Jitka; Dolezal, Tomas] Inst Hlth Econ & Technol Assessment, Prague, Czech Republic; [Klimes, Jiri] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Pharm, Dept Social & Clin Pharm, Prague, Czech Republic; [Vavrova, Vera; Skalicka, Veronika; Zemkova, Dana; Bilkova, Alena] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Pediat, Fac Med 2, Prague, Czech Republic; [Fila, Libor; Vavrova, Vera; Skalicka, Veronika; Turnovec, Marek; Krulisova, Veronika; Zemkova, Dana; Dedeckova, Klara Vilimovska; Bilkova, Alena; Drevinek, Pavel; Macek, Milan, Jr.] Univ Hosp Motol, V Uvalu 84, Prague 15006 5, Czech Republic; [Turnovec, Marek; Krulisova, Veronika; Macek, Milan, Jr.] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Biol & Med Genet, Fac Med 2, V Uvalu 84, Prague 15006 5, Czech Republic; [Fila, Libor] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Pneumol, Fac Med 2, Prague, Czech Republic; [Dedeckova, Klara Vilimovska; Drevinek, Pavel] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Med Microbiol, Fac Med 2, Prague, Czech Republic; [Fruhaufova, Vladimira; Friedmannova, Zuzana; Drnek, Radovan] Univ Hosp Motol, Div Hlth Insurance, Prague, Czech Republic; [Homola, Lukas] Masaryk Univ, Univ Hosp, Fac Med, Dept Childrens Infect Dis, Brno, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; Charles University Prague; Motol University Hospital; Charles University Prague; Charles University Prague; Charles University Prague; Motol University Hospital; Masaryk University Brno; University Hospital Brno,"Macek, M (通讯作者)，Univ Hosp Motol, V Uvalu 84, Prague 15006 5, Czech Republic.;Macek, M (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Dept Biol & Med Genet, Fac Med 2, V Uvalu 84, Prague 15006 5, Czech Republic.",Milan.Macek.Jr@LFmotol.cuni.cz,"Homola, Lukáš/AAZ-2891-2021; Doležal, Tomáš/H-8967-2017","Turnovec, Marek/0000-0001-9497-3919","Czech Ministry of Health [00064203, NT/13770-4, NF-CZ11-PDP-3-003-2014, COST - LD14073, CZ.2.16/3.1.00/24022OPPK]; Czech CF Association","Czech Ministry of Health(Ministry of Health, Czech Republic); Czech CF Association","Supported by the Czech Ministry of Health 00064203 to MM and PD; NT/13770-4; NF-CZ11-PDP-3-003-2014, COST - LD14073 and CZ.2.16/3.1.00/24022OPPK to MM.

Although much of the writings on CFM acknowledge its potential to deliver sustainable SESs, knowledge about what specific role of government can strengthen local forest management and utilization is still poor at best. This study aims to fill the gap by analyzing meta-data from International Forestry Resources and Institutions (IFRI) database for 77 SESs (IFRI sites) in seven countries. We used Ordinal logistic regression to model association between government's Forester Department involvement in important forest management activities and sustainability of forest SES. Our result shows that Forester Department involvement in planting, forest maintenance activities and forest benefit sharing among forest users are associated with sustainable SESs while their involvement in monitoring, sanctioning and transfer of local people harvest right are associated with unsustainable SESs. Our finding has important implications for the ongoing local to global level discourse on how to structure appropriate government interventions to achieve positive social and environmental outcomes from local forest management. However, we suggest precaution not to overstretch the implication of our findings as a panacea for CFM. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This calls for explicit modeling of constraints and motivations that, respectively, obstruct and stimulate visits to selected outdoor destinations. Choice set formation is the result of screening and/or inclusion of specific sites (alternatives) to form the set of sites considered in real choices. Evidence shows that the omission of a structural representation of choice set formation is harmful to econometric inference. Yet, the literature has largely ignored the underlying behavioral phenomenon. We show, using a discrete choice experiment involving selection among seven recreational sites in an Italian national park, that choice set formation is behaviorally relevant, even after controlling for preference discrimination. Motivations (why visit?) are important determinants of preliminary site screening for choice set inclusion, as well as site selection, justifying the additional value of such modeling extension.

The costs as the accounting category can impact both on business and on European Union projects. There has been a slight change in business practice, especially thanks to possibility of business financing through the European Union funds, with the focus on more correct and transparent managing costs. Documentation of costs can provide properly synchronized documents with domestic legislation and international standards and European Union directives. Despite of numerous studies of types of cost and their documentation application, the same has still not been done in Croatia in the context of European Union projects. This paper explain how cost are planned and prepared for European Union projects, the importance of auditors trail in European Union projects implementation as well as documentation of costs by categories and most common mistakes in the process of documentation. Those mistakes arise mostly because of certain differences in legislation of European Union members and special rules of financial management and European Union directives. The difference between acceptable and unacceptable costs will be distinguished. Also, the role and importance of European Court of Auditors in the process of documentation and control of costs in European Union projects will be explained. For the purpose of writing this paper, the data were collected by secondary and primary research. Analyzed data has confirmed expectations that the role and importance of the European Court of Auditors is of great importance for documenting and controlling cost in European Union projects.","[Tominac, Sanja Broz] Fac Econ & Business Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Tominac, SB (通讯作者)，Fac Econ & Business Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia.",sbroz@efzg.hr; hrv.mamic@gmail.com,"BROZ TOMINAC, SANJA/H-8481-2018","BROZ TOMINAC, SANJA/0000-0002-7670-4341",,,,,7,0,0,0,7,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,261,269,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6MR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426857700027,0

Explaining this behaviour requires revising theories of autonomous agenda-setting and 'ceremonial conformity' in international organizations (IOs). I argue that IOs often adopt a posture of strategic ambiguity when confronted with a combination of divisions among major member states and a lack of consensus in the profession that provides the organization's source of expert legitimacy. However, while the ambiguity helps avoid conflict in the short run, it undermines organizational governance capacity in the medium run, resulting in coordination failures. The empirical analysis relies on internal records of Fund meetings on the exchange rate issue, interviews with former IMF officials and analysis of the organization's governance role during currency crises in Mexico, Russia, Brazil and Argentina.","[Van Gunten, Tod S.] Max Planck Inst Study Soc, Cologne, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Van Gunten, TS (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Study Soc, Cologne, Germany.",tvg@mpifg.de,"Van Gunten, Tod/P-8369-2019","Van Gunten, Tod/0000-0003-4454-7713",Social Science Research Council; National Science Foundation [SES-0957298]; Robert F. and Jean E.

We explore the application of such instruments in low carbon heat markets. Using a conceptual framework derived from actor network theory and economic sociology, we examine the role of technical-economic models as market devices in two heat network proposals in British cities. Government intermediaries relied on the models to enact the mutual financial and carbon benefits of an area-wide heat market, and to enrol multiple public sector organisations in innovation. In practice, the models produced the opposite response: parties synthesised the modelled cost-benefit calculations into the existing public services market agencement and translated the model numbers ino opportunities to secure competitive advantage for their own organisation. These activities undermined the projected cost and carbon saving logic of the collective actor solution. The findings demonstrate the potent economic agency of marketemulating public finance and competitive procurement instruments in governing such organisational decisions, and indicate the limited traction of a low carbon calculus, which lacked significant political or senior management sponsorship. Questions are posed about the formatting of economic agency suited to securing the common goods of a sustainable society.","[Webb, Janette; Hawkey, David] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Webb, J (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",jan.webb@ed.ac.uk,,"Webb, Janette/0000-0001-8295-346X",Economic and Social Research Council [RES-628-25-0052]; EPSRC [EP/M008215/1] Funding Source: UKRI; ESRC [ES/I007423/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/M008215/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council [grant number RES-628-25-0052].,,26,14,14,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

Despite the importance of the concept of Futures Consciousness, and the proliferation of related concepts, there is no commonly used definition or operationalization that would permit empirical research. This article presents a conceptual model of Futures Consciousness that is based on an integrated review and analysis of the descriptions of future consciousness and its related concepts in literature as well as in the theoretical underpinnings of futures research. The model contains five dimensions: 1) Time perspective, 2) Agency beliefs, 3) Openness to alternatives, 4) Systems perception and 5) Concern for others.

Empirical evidence of such supply abnormalities has been found for some open-access fish species but not yet for non-timber forest products (NTFPs). We describe the theory of the backward-bending long-run supply and how such a supply relationship could produce multiple market equilibria, affecting regulatory outcomes. An empirical example is provided to test the theory in the case of wild American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius), which has been subjected to habitat loss and harvest pressure since the 18th Century and now has its exports regulated. We find evidence that quantities supplied are negatively related to price in the long run, indicating that harvest pressure is restricting wild ginseng harvestable stocks. Also, we find that a federal regulation banning exports of roots from plants under five years old, in effect since 1999, coincided with a reduction of supply. This result could be due to the slow natural rate of population recovery.","[Frey, Gregory E.; Prestemon, Jeffrey P.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Southern Res Stn, POB 12254, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Chamberlain, James L.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Southern Res Stn, 1710 Res Ctr Dr, Blacksburg, VA 24060 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service,"Frey, GE (通讯作者)，US Forest Serv, USDA, Southern Res Stn, POB 12254, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",gregoryefrey@fs.fed.us; jchamberlain@fs.fed.us; jprestemon@fs.fed.us,"Chamberlain, James/KBB-2077-2024","Prestemon, Jeffrey/0000-0001-8850-5668; Chamberlain III, James L./0000-0002-7974-4648; Frey, Gregory/0000-0003-0538-0199",,,,,61,14,15,0,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,DEC,2018,97.0,,,,,,97,109,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.09.011,0.0,,,13,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,HE0KP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000452955800011,0

The Canadian literature on the costs of forest carbon sequestration is dominated by what is known as the bottom-up engineering method. Generally speaking, this approach relies on values observed in markets to estimate land opportunity costs. An alternative is the econometric method, which can capture other potential influences on the behavior of landowners, as revealed by historical data. To our knowledge, there are currently no studies that apply the econometric method to Canada; this may be because detailed land-use data over time is not available. We identified a database compiled by the Canadian Forest Service and used it to estimate an econometric model of afforestation in Ontario. Simulations were conducted from the estimated equation under a range of conditions. The results suggest that carbon sequestration at a given cost could be much lower than indicated by Canadian bottom-up studies. The simulations also demonstrate that, if afforestation is encouraged by awarding offset credits, low carbon prices could result in an unacceptably high share of those credits going to non-additional projects - ones that would have been carried out anyway.","[Murphy, Rose; Jaccard, Mark] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Management, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Gross, Dominique M.] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Publ Policy, 515 West Hastings St, Vancouver, BC V6B 5K3, Canada",Simon Fraser University; Simon Fraser University,"Murphy, R (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Management, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",remurphy@sfu.ca; dgross@sfu.ca; jaccard@sfu.ca,,"Murphy, Rose/0000-0001-6643-853X",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions (PICS); Canadian Association for Energy Economics (CAEE); Simon Fraser University,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions (PICS); Canadian Association for Energy Economics (CAEE); Simon Fraser University,"Funding for this research was provided by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), the Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions (PICS), the Canadian Association for Energy Economics (CAEE), and Simon Fraser University.

We have classified the articles in the journal along five dimensions: content, methods, environmental media, the regional dimension of studies, and cross-cutting issues. While up to about 10 years ago, non-market valuation and cost-benefit analysis, natural resource economics, and environmental policy instruments represented the lion's share of articles published in the journal, more recently we observe a significant shift towards a more diversified array of research areas, with climate change and energy issues finding their way into the journal. In addition, increasing methodological plurality becomes apparent, reflected in a significant shift away from economic theory and towards empirical approaches. We also analyze key distinctions between the major environmental economics journals. Finally, we analyze JEEM's external influence on leading general economics (A+) journals. We find that A+ citations are positively correlated with a focus on climate change economics, market-based environmental policies and policy comparisons, the use of econometric and statistical methods or experimental approaches, and negatively correlated with a focus on water pollution and other pollutants such as pesticides.

To explore this subnational variation, we examine the multifaceted Neoliberal attack on public sector unions in the 50 US states during the Tea Party era. We undertake a qualitative case study of four states as well as a quantitative historical study of all 50 states and find substantial regional variation between Southern and non-Southern states. In the non-South where public sector unionism is strong, we find that states that experience a transition from either Republican-to-Democratic or Democratic-to-Republican party control of state government experience declines in public sector union membership, but no such effect is found among Southern states where public sector unionism is already weak. Thus, despite variable events, circumstances and policy agendas in different states, Tea Party forces constrain state budgetary options and undermine public sector union membership.","[Vachon, Todd E.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Labor Studies & Employment Relat, Sch Management & Labor Relat, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Wallace, Michael] Univ Connecticut, Dept Sociol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",United States Department of Labor; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; University of Connecticut,"Vachon, TE (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Dept Labor Studies & Employment Relat, Sch Management & Labor Relat, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",todd.vachon@rutgers.edu; michael.wallace@uconn.edu,,,,,,,49,4,4,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-1378,1752-1386,,CAMB J REG ECON SOC,Camb.

First, if an incumbent faces a threat of being removed once and for all by a rival faction, extraction becomes more voracious if the factions do not share rents equally. Second, perennial political conflict cycles are more inefficient if constitutional cohesiveness or the partisan in-office bias is large and political instability is high. Third, resource wars are more intense if constitutional cohesiveness is weak, the incumbent has a partisan in-office bias, reserves of resources are high, the wage is low, governments can be less frequently removed from office, and fighting technology has less decreasing returns to scale. Resource depletion in such wars is more rapacious if there is more government instability, the political system is less cohesive, and the partisan in-office bias is smaller. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Nowadays, the different forms of urban green areas represent one of the most important elements of the built environment, which directly affect physical activity, health, and mortality. This paper analyses the perceived health benefits of the students-volunteers who agreed to spend five consecutive weeks of their recess time in an existing Arboretum in the city of Belgrade. The aim of this study is to gain some basic knowledge of the restorative potential of the urban forest environment and to identify perceived physical, mental and social benefits of the younger population using a survey. The survey was analysed by an interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). Additionally, DASS21 was used for psychometric evaluation of the mental well-being of respondents so the control group was included. The two-factor analysis of data on the total score recorded marginally significant interaction testing between the groups (F-1.45 = 3.781; p < .058), indicating a higher tendency to the stress reduction at the arboretum group. Further, the findings from the IPA indicate that the spatial qualities such as such greenery, lawn, and benches are important for the restorative experience in an Arboretum. The research outputs indicate that the urban forest environment in the city of Belgrade has a potential to support restorative experience and daily habits of a younger population.","[Vujcic, Maja; Tomicevic-Dubljevic, Jelena] Univ Belgrade, Dept Landscape Architecture & Hort, Belgrade, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Vujcic, M; Tomicevic-Dubljevic, J (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Dept Landscape Architecture & Hort, Belgrade, Serbia.",maja.vujcic@yahoo.com; jelena.tomicevic@sfb.bg.ac.rs,,"Vujcic Trkulja, Maja/0000-0001-8069-1734; Tomicevic-Dubljevic, Jelena/0000-0001-7905-5722",,,,,107,35,37,1,80,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,NOV,2018,96.0,,,,,,54,62,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.08.006,0.0,,,9,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GV3HM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445985000006,0

In this paper, we estimate the effects of MMLs on secondary and post-secondary students' time use using data from the American Time Use Survey. We apply a difference-in-differences research design and estimate flexible fixed effects models that condition on state fixed effects and state-specific time trends. We find no effect of MMLs on secondary students' time use. However, we find that college students in MML states spend approximately 20% less time on education-related activities and 20% more time on leisure activities than their counterparts in non-MML states. These behavioral responses largely occur during weekends and summer when students have more spare time. Finally, the impacts of MMLs are heterogeneous and stronger among part-time college students, who are more likely to be first-generation college goers and to come from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups.","[Chu, Yu-Wei Luke] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Econ & Finance, Wellington, New Zealand; [Gershenson, Seth] Amer Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Washington, DC 20016 USA",Victoria University Wellington; American University,"Chu, YWL (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Econ & Finance, Wellington, New Zealand.",Luke.chu@vuw.ac.nz; gershens@american.edu,,"Chu, Yu-Wei Luke/0000-0002-8537-3468",,,,,82,7,11,0,13,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0272-7757,1873-7382,,ECON EDUC REV,Econ.

Few safety studies associate crashes with economic pressure, a pervasive latent influence. This study uses data from the US Large Truck Crash Causation Study to predict truck crashes based on work pressure factors that have their origins in market pressures on motor carriers and truck drivers. Logistic regression shows that factors associated with the work process, including an index of work-pressure attributes, predict the likelihood that crash analysts consider the truck driver to be the person whose last action could have prevented the crash. While not proving causation, the data suggest that economic factors affecting drivers contribute significantly to truck crashes.","[Belzer, Michael H.] Wayne State Univ, Econ Dept, 2127 Fac Adm Bldg,656 W Kirby, Detroit, MI 48202 USA",Wayne State University,"Belzer, MH (通讯作者)，Wayne State Univ, Econ Dept, 2127 Fac Adm Bldg,656 W Kirby, Detroit, MI 48202 USA.",Michael.H.Belzer@Wayne.edu,"Belzer, Michael/N-5789-2019","Belzer, Michael/0000-0001-7069-5838",Alfred P.

In math, the effect is larger for older children and co-varies with entry into an important pubertal stage.

First, energy taxes indirectly tax the informal sector because even informal firms must buy formal sector sources of energy such as electricity. Second, a revenue-neutral shift in the tax base toward energy can decrease the tax burden on goods which are substituted for by the informal sector. These mechanisms can lead to welfare-enhancing substitution from informal labor into the formal sector. We consider the magnitude of these effects in a stylized model of the U.S. tax system. Even though the U.S. informal sector is relatively small, we find that distortionary costs of energy taxes are reduced by more than half. In developing countries, where the informal sector is typically much larger, the effect we identify here become even more relevant: we find negative gross costs in many cases. Finally, we address two potentially important countervailing effects: the use of informal fuels in developing countries and the potential for informal production to substitute for energy-intensive goods. We show how these different types of informality compete, and find that welfare enhancing effects typically dominate. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This may affect the future development potential in the wood using sectors in Europe and their contribution in the new circular bio-economy. We explore the potential consequences mainly on the forest sector in the region consisting of EU and Norway (EU + N), but also globally, that would arise if the countries in the EU + N constrained economic utilization of their forest resources. For the analysis, we use the global forest sector model EFI-GTM, which also incorporates the trade in wood and wood products. Due to the globally growing demand for forest products and available forest resources in the rest of the world (RoW) outside of the EU + N, the leakages of harvests, forest industry production and employment opportunities from EU + N to RoW would be considerable. Decreased wood harvests and forest industry production in the EU + N would raise the wood and forest industry product prices globally, and increase production and employment in the forest sector in RoW. Due to the harvest leakage, climate mitigation benefits of the policy in the form of forest carbon sinks in the EU + N would be considerably reduced. Also, there would be inter-sectoral carbon leakage, as part of the wood consumption would shift to more energy-demanding competing materials.","[Kallio, A.

The present paper reports the results of a population survey designed to test whether PS helped to explain people's preferences for health services and whether it did this better than the absolute shortfall or the equity related variables that PS seeks to replace. Survey respondents were asked to allocate 100 votes between 13 scenarios and a standard scenario. Variation in the allocation of votes was explained by health gain and different combinations of the equity variables.

The theoretical framework is a variant of the Heckscher-Ohlin model, which we estimate using cross-country data for 1995 and 2010 to examine soybeans, maize, and cotton trade. The data include measures of country land endowments, which we disaggregate into GMO and non-GMO components, as well as recently released measures of GMO regulations. Findings show land endowments are a primary source of comparative advantage in GMO intensive industries before and after the advent of GMOs. Further, an increase in a country's allocation of land to GMO crops has a positive effect on her net exports in GMO intensive industries. This positive effect occurs both across countries and time. Finally, a country's GMO regulations have a negligible effect as a supply-side determinant of comparative advantage. However, a country's decision about whether to adopt GMO technologies does matter to trade. These findings are robust with respect to a variety of considerations.","[Smith, Pamela J.; Jamiyansuren, Bolormaa; Lee, Jaeseok] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Kitsuki, Akinori] Kyushu Univ, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan; [Yang, Jooyoung] Korea Inst Ind Econ & Trade, Seoul, South Korea",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Kyushu University; Korea Institute for Industrial Economics & Trade (KIET),"Smith, PJ (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",psmith@umn.edu,,,,,,,38,8,8,4,27,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JUL,2018,17.0,3,,,,,427,449,,10.1017/S1474745617000180,0.0,,,23,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,GO8GA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440323800003,0

We propose and use a new decomposition strategy to measure the contribution of early childhood and school influences to the cognitive gap between urban and rural eight-year-old children in Peru. This strategy accounts for the relation between family choices and skill inputs and is less prone to biases than those employed before. We find that school influences occurring between ages 6 and 8, account for a significant share of urban/rural cognitive gap (around 35%). The share attributable to early childhood influences is important but no larger than 50%. Because skill depreciates, only a fraction of the gap (70-80%) is carried forward to the next period. Therefore, inequalities in school environments are sustaining a cognitive gap that would otherwise be smaller and this explains why differences that emerge during early childhood can remain unchanged after children start school.","[Castro, Juan F.] Univ Pacifico, Av Salaverry 2020, Lima 11, Peru; [Rolleston, Caine] UCL, 20 Bedford Way, London, England",Universidad del Pacifico Peru; University of London; University College London,"Castro, JF (通讯作者)，Univ Pacifico, Av Salaverry 2020, Lima 11, Peru.",castro_jf@up.edu-pe,,"Castro, Juan/0000-0003-2032-0565; Rolleston, Caine/0000-0002-4564-4331",,,,,39,9,10,1,6,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0272-7757,1873-7382,,ECON EDUC REV,Econ.

We find that all four methods are effective relative to the control group (a mass e-mail solicitation) at increasing applications but only suggestive evidence for increasing matriculation. We observe a few differences in the relative effectiveness of the methods. We complete a simple cost-effectiveness analysis that suggests the admissions call is the preferred method.

A Markov model was constructed to compare the cost-effectiveness of two strategies for gastric cancer-risk screening over a 30-year period: the ABC method, which uses a combination of assessing the presence of HPA and measuring serum PG concentrations and scheduling endoscopies accordingly, and annual endoscopic screening. Clinical and epidemiological data on variables in the model were obtained from published reports. Analyses were made from the perspective of the Japanese health care payer. According to base-case analysis, the ABC method cost less than annual endoscopic screening (64,489 vs. 64,074 USD) and saved more lives (18.16 vs. 18.30 quality-adjusted life years). One-way analyses confirmed the robustness of the cost-effectiveness results. The probability that the ABC method is cost-effective in Japanese individuals aged 50 years was 0.997.

J,"Yamada, Y",,,,"Yamada, Yusuke",,,Can a regional-level forest management policy achieve sustainable forest management?,FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Forest zoning; Bayesian network model; Adaptive management; Decision making; Forest multiple functions,BEHAVIOR,"While deliberating a regional level forest management policy, one should note the probable existence of plural and independent decision-makers in the target region and the possibility that they may not fully understand or obey the intent of the regional policy. To achieve sustainable forest management, the relationships between the policy and the decisions of individual decision-makers with respect to forestry activities (for example, thinning or dear-cutting) need to be considered. The objective of this study is to determine the extent to which zoning, as a regional forest management method that affects individual management activities, influences future forest resources. A Bayesian belief network (BBN) model was used to model relationships between zoning and individual forestry activities. Through the construction of the BBN model with factors (nodes) such as zoning types, forestry activities, and forest stand conditions, a conditional probability table (CPT) was obtained. This CPT shows the degree of possibility of harvest for each forest stand. Individual forestry activities were simulated on the basis of the CPT. As a case study, this model was applied to the regional municipality of Ugo which is situated in the Tohoku district of Japan. Three types of zoning were examined: (1) no zoning covering for wood production, (2) the current zoning that is actually used, and (3) zoning planned to emphasize wood production. The volume of harvested wood and the statistics for the slope distribution where harvesting occurred were observed under each zoning type. Results showed that future forest resources varied under each zoning type. However, influencing the timing and location of individual forestry activities may enable appropriate regional scale management to achieve sustainable forest management.","[Yamada, Yusuke] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Yamada, Yusuke] 1 Matsunosato 1, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan",Forestry & Forest Products Research Institute - Japan,"Yamada, Y (通讯作者)，Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.;Yamada, Y (通讯作者)，1 Matsunosato 1, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.",yamayu@ffpri.affrc.go.jp,"Yamada, Yusuke/J-3622-2019","Yamada, Yusuke/0000-0003-0088-0549",,,,,24,11,11,2,18,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,MAY,2018,90.0,,,,,,82,89,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.01.013,0.0,,,8,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GD8MK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430766300010,0

Heterogeneity in student preferences creates variation in demand pressure across institutions, which we estimate can account for 11% of the total variation in the ratio of amenity to academic spending across 4-year colleges in the United States.","[Jacob, Brian; McCall, Brian; Stange, Kevin] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Jacob, Brian; Stange, Kevin] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Stange, K (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;Stange, K (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",bajacob@umich.edu; bpmccall@umich.edu; kstange@umich.edu,,,,,,,46,61,69,2,26,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0734-306X,1537-5307,,J LABOR ECON,J.

Years of life lost (YLL) were calculated by multiplying the number of deaths by the remaining life expectancy. Local expected YLL (LEYLL) and standard expected YLL (SEYLL) were computed using Polish life expectancy tables and WHO standards, respectively. In the base case analysis LEYLL and SEYLL were computed with 3.5 and 0% discount rates, respectively, and no age-weighting. Premature mortality costs were calculated using a human capital approach, with discounting at 5%, and are reported in Polish zloty (PLN) (1 euro = 4.3 PLN). The impact of applying different assumptions on base-case estimates was tested in sensitivity analyses. The total LEYLLs and SEYLLs due to suicide were 109,338 and 279,425, respectively, with 88% attributable to male deaths. The cost of male premature mortality (2,808,854,532 PLN) was substantially higher than for females (177,852,804 PLN). Discounting and age-weighting have a large effect on the base case estimates of LEYLLs. The greatest impact on the estimates of suicide-related premature mortality costs was due to the value of the discount rate. Our findings provide quantitative evidence on the burden of suicide. In our opinion each of the demonstrated methods brings something valuable to the evaluation of the impact of suicide on a given population, but LEYLLs and premature mortality costs estimated according to national guidelines have the potential to be useful for local public health policymakers.","[Orlewska, Katarzyna] Med Univ Warsaw, Ul Zwirki & Wigury 61, PL-02091 Warsaw, Poland; [Orlewska, Ewa] Jan Kochanowski Univ Kielce, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, AL 9 Wiekow Kielc 19, PL-25317 Kielce, Poland",Medical University of Warsaw; Jan Kochanowski University,"Orlewska, E (通讯作者)，Jan Kochanowski Univ Kielce, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, AL 9 Wiekow Kielc 19, PL-25317 Kielce, Poland.",eorl@ujk.edu.pl,"Orlewska, Ewa/HMW-0385-2023",,,,,,30,9,9,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Research has therefore not investigated the meanings and morality of elites' lifestyle choices, particularly from the perspective of the wealthy themselves. Yet understanding this lived experience is critical to understanding the cultural dimensions of inequality. This article draws primarily on in-depth interviews with 50 affluent New Yorkers to analyze their spending practices, discourses and conflicts. My respondents worked hard to frame their consumer choices as meeting reasonable, 'normal' needs, representing their consumption as basic, family-oriented and prudent, and drawing explicit symbolic boundaries against ostentation, materialism and excess. I argue that these discourses illuminate their struggles to feel morally worthy of privilege, and expand our understanding of a cultural vocabulary of legitimate entitlement in the USA, to include consumption as well as hard work. Furthermore, these discourses illuminate symbolic boundaries that are incongruous with social boundaries, as they appeal to middle-class symbolism. By theorizing consumption discourse as a site of legitimation as well as exclusion for elites, the article highlights another mechanism by which extreme inequality is made acceptable.","[Sherman, Rachel] New Sch Social Res, New York, NY 10011 USA",The New School,"Sherman, R (通讯作者)，New Sch Social Res, New York, NY 10011 USA.",shermanr@newschool.edu,,,,,,,81,39,44,3,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

We use a recently proposed alternative approach to value willingness to pay (WTP) for health, making use of trade-offs between income and life years or quality of life, which we extend to allow for a more realistic multiplicative utility function over health and money. Moreover, we show how reference-dependency can be incorporated into this model and derive its predictions for WTP elicitation. We propose three experimental elicitation procedures and test these in a feasibility study, analysing the responses under different assumptions about the discount rate. Several interesting results are reported: first, the data are highly skewed, but if we trim the 5% lowest and highest values, we obtain plausible WTP estimates. Second, the results differ considerably between procedures, indicating that WTP estimates are sensitive to the assumed utility function. Third, respondents appear to be loss averse for both health and money, which is consistent with assumptions from prospect theory. Finally, our results also indicate that respondents are more willing to trade quality of life than life years.","[Attema, Arthur E.; Krol, Marieke; van Exel, Job; Brouwer, Werner B.

Apart from analyzing whether drug budgets fulfill their overall goal of reducing spending, changes in the cost and quality of prescribing and the enforcement mechanisms put in place need evaluation to assess the effectiveness of drug budgets at the physician level. In this study, we aim to analyze the cost and quality of prescribing conditional on the level of utilization of the drug budget and in view of varying levels of enforcement in cases of overspending. We observed drug budget utilization in a panel of 440 physicians in three federal states of Germany from 2005 to 2011. At the physician level, we retrospectively calculated drug budgets, the level of drug budget utilization, and differentiated by varying levels of enforcement where physicians overspent their budgets (i.e., more than 115/125% of the drug budget). Using lagged dependent-variable regression models, we analyzed whether the level of drug budget utilization in the previous year affected current prescribing in terms of various indicators to describe the cost and quality of prescribing. We controlled for patient and physician characteristics. The mean drug budget utilization is 92.3%. The level of drug budget utilization influences selected dimensions of cost and quality of prescribing (i.e., generic share (estimate 0.000215; p = 0.0246), concentration of generic brands (estimate 0.000585; p = 0.0056) and therapeutic substances (estimate -0.000060; p < 0.0001) and the share of potentially inappropriate medicines in the elderly (estimate 0.001; p < 0.0001)), whereas the level of enforcement does not. Physicians seem to gradually adjust their prescription patterns, especially in terms of generic substitution.","[Fischer, Katharina Elisabeth] Univ Duisburg Essen, CINCH Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Campus Essen,Thea Leymann Str 9, D-45127 Essen, Germany; [Fischer, Katharina Elisabeth; Koch, Taika; Stargardt, Tom] Univ Hamburg, Hamburg Ctr Hlth Econ, Hamburg, Germany; [Kostev, Karel] IMS Hlth, Epidemiol, Frankfurt, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen; University of Hamburg,"Fischer, KE (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, CINCH Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Campus Essen,Thea Leymann Str 9, D-45127 Essen, Germany.;Fischer, KE (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Hamburg Ctr Hlth Econ, Hamburg, Germany.",katharina.fischer@uni-due.de,"Blankart, Katharina/ADV-4204-2022; Kostev, Karel/S-4755-2019","Kostev, Karel/0000-0002-2124-7227; Blankart, Katharina Elisabeth/0000-0001-9831-1787; Bernhardt, Taika/0000-0002-9832-0613",Federal Ministry of Education and Research in Germany [BMBF 01EH1101A],Federal Ministry of Education and Research in Germany,Funding: This study was supported by a research grant from the Federal Ministry of Education and Research in Germany (grant number BMBF 01EH1101A).,,37,9,10,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Majoritarianism's distinct internal dynamics and imperfect representation mechanisms yield insufficient state responses to rising inter-regional inequality, stoking populist discontent. Global integration may thus be less stable today under majoritarian than proportional electoral rules.

In the given context, the aim of this paper is to analyze the impact of Social Media on consumer's behavior related to their travel choices, to investigate whether Social Media influence people's decision to visit specific tourist destination. The primary method used is an online questionnaire, along with documentary analysis, statistical analysis, and personal observation. The paper will start with a brief literature review to explore themes such as tourists decision-making behavior or motivation of travel. Then, the relationship between Social Media and the desire to travel, as well as the use of Social Media throughout the whole holiday decision-making process, including before, after and during the trip will be examined.

In doing so, it problematizes current social science scholarship, which emphasizes the analysis of digital data and analytics, and reinforces the magnitude of its consequences and 'data power'. The paper proposes making three corrective 'movements' that might enrich our approaches to how databases and analytics are assembled in business settings. The first movement involves the problem of ethnographic access to data-making practices. We propose taking seriously the issue of fabricating an ethnographic encounter where the process of making digital objects is exposed. The second movement concerns the visibility and the type of politics taking place in data practices. We argue for the need to displace attention from data impacts and results to the myriad of mundane practices and devices through which these objects are assembled. The third movement we suggest requires a focus on examining error and failure as key aspects of the manufacturing of consumer databases.

Approximately 40% of all EU funds received by Poland was directed to rural areas (including agriculture). Such a significant financial input in the period 2002-2015 led to transformations in many aspects of the economy as well as changes in the indicators of the level of economic development. The results showed that the economic effectiveness of individual measures depend on a number of factors, including: the amount of funds, the purposes to which they were used, the type of instruments used, and the number of beneficiaries. Pro-investment funds (the investments in farms, adaptation of farms to EU standards) proved to have the largest positive impact on the economic development. Economically weak regions and regions with strong agricultural sector draw most benefits from CAP funds, whereas lowest impact of CAP funds is observed in highly developed voivodships with diversified structure of the regional economy.","[Biczkowski, Miroslaw; Jezierska-Thole, Aleksandra; Adamiak, Czeslaw] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Fac Earth Sci, Ul Lwowska 1, PL-87100 Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Biczkowski, M (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Fac Earth Sci, Ul Lwowska 1, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.",mirbicz@umk.pl; alekjez@umk.pl; czeslaw.adamiak@umk.pl,"Biczkowski, Mirosław/AAF-9798-2021; Adamiak, Czesław/AAA-9419-2020; Jezierska-Thöle, Aleksandra/AAM-1967-2021","Biczkowski, Mirosław/0000-0001-8936-457X; Adamiak, Czesław/0000-0003-3307-5079; Jezierska-Thöle, Aleksandra/0000-0002-7607-9531",National Science Centre [DEC-2012/07/B/HS4/00364],"National Science Centre(National Science Centre, Poland)",This paper was written in the framework of the research project of the National Science Centre (no.

The state-owned companies' organization structure has had various forms and levels of management and at the same time the specific administrative knowledge. For various reasons, objective or subjective, some managers being nominated in positions of management or execution caused a multitude of financial risks. From simple opportunity or threats to financial risk, there are many theoretical arguments through which the management in the public organization in our country can be explained, by always discovering specters of approach, complacent to one study or another. The article's goal is to underline the role of making a study of impact based on solutions given by theoretic concepts and terms from financial risk management field. We conceive this case study by using a comparison between an existing company and a former company, bankrupted, sale and ultimately closed, by applying to each of them the contemporary financial and business realities of Romania. In order to draw valuable conclusions in the field of financial risk management, the researchers underline some differences between our two examples chosen from the car industry. Likewise, we would like to present the manner in which a good style of managing of financial risk in an organization has transformed Dacia-Renault cars factory into one of the best-performing companies in Romania. The study aims to analyze the risks of the two major Romanian plants, what measures could be taken in the short, medium and long -term to minimize and/or limit their effects and to prevent bankruptcy, as unfortunately, did not happen with ARO. The applied methodology is that of analysis based on case studies, being a quantitative analysis. The research paper presents the results of this comparative case studies analysis, which attempts to highlight the main aspects of the ways in which the threats and risks were mitigated and depending on their relevance, the findings were transformed into graphs which will make it easier for readers to understand the research results.

We investigate the changes in market efficiency for the RMB against 12 major currencies in the past decade. Our findings reveal that even with a small floating band in China's foreign exchange markets, if the market allows the exchange rate to adjust according to the price mechanism, then market efficiency does improve significantly. When the RMB was pegged to the USD at 6.83 during the global financial crisis, there was a severe market failure.

Moreover, the volatility of revenues of income taxes over time is generally low. Interestingly, in general changes in size of revenues from corporate income tax do not follow trends for payroll taxes. This suggests that receipts from those two kinds of taxes are determined (i) either by separate factors or (ii) the causes are the same but they act in opposite direction. As a result the importance of widely discussed matter of tax competition is questionable or understanding of its influence should be redefined.

This study examines whether investments behave asymmetrically responding to changes in cash flows and, if so, how managerial overconfidence affects asymmetric ICS. Using a sample of KOSPI and KOSDAQ firms in Korea, we find the incidence of downwardly sticky ICS in unconstrained firms. We then find that overconfident managers encourage ICS to be stickier than their rational peers do in unconstrained firms. Finally, we find that managerial overconfidence intensified by self-attribution bias induces ICS to get even stickier, suggesting more explicit evidence of corporate investment distortions. The results of alternative tests using the asymmetric models of Homburg and Nasev (2008) are qualitatively consistent with prior results. Overall, our findings imply a higher incidence of excessive investment commitments driven by overconfident managers.","[Koo, Jeong-Ho] Kumoh Natl Inst Technol, Dept Business Adm, Gumi, South Korea; [Yang, Daecheon] Chung Ang Univ, Sch Business Adm, 84 Heukseok Ro, Seoul 06974, South Korea",Kumoh National University Technology; Chung Ang University,"Yang, D (通讯作者)，Chung Ang Univ, Sch Business Adm, 84 Heukseok Ro, Seoul 06974, South Korea.",dcyang@cau.ac.kr,,,,,,,74,15,16,3,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Although widely advertised allegations by the US carriers and counter-accusations by the Gulf carriers focus on questions of fact (i.e., whether the airlines in question received subsidies from their governments or not), there are more fundamental questions about whether airline subsidies can ground a legal action for unfair competition and whether the law can play a role in regulating airline subsidies. There are three obstacles to answering these questions. Firstly, there is no widely accepted legal definition of 'subsidy' in the context of airlines. Secondly, it is not clear which law applies to the subject matter because the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures does not apply to air services and most bilateral air services agreements do not explicitly regulate subsidies. Thirdly, there is a question as to which international organization should be responsible for regulating airline subsidies. This article suggests that a transparency mechanism, based on subsidy provisions in newly developed air services agreements and the Chicago Convention of 1944, could play a significant role in disciplining unfair subsidies and thus contributing to fairer competition in the international aviation market.","[Lee, Jae Woon] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Fac Law, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Lee, JW (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Fac Law, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",Jaewoon.lee@cuhk.edu.hk,"Lee, Jae Woon/AHH-2399-2022",,,,,,55,2,2,1,5,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

The assumption concerning constant amplitude in such model seems to be too strong to describe the changing nature of the business cycle. Hence, in this paper we assume that the mean function depends on unknown frequencies (related to the length of the cyclical fluctuations) in a similar way as for the almost periodic mean function proposed in Lenart and Mazur (2016), while the assumption concerning constant amplitude was relaxed. More specifically, we assume that the amplitude associated with a given frequency is time-varying and is a linear spline. We obtain the explicit marginal posterior distribution for vector of frequency parameters in the approximate model. We consider real data example concerning monthly production in industry in Poland. The main conclusion is that the posterior for frequency is still likely to be multimodal, but it seems that this multimodality is not as strong as in the deterministic cycle model with constant frequency proposed in Lenart and Mazur (2016).","[Lenart, Lukasz] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Math, Ul Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Lenart, L (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Math, Ul Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",lukasz.lenart@uek.krakow.pl,"Lenart, Lukasz/F-1509-2013","Lenart, Lukasz/0000-0003-4111-0866",,,,,17,1,1,0,0,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",2545-1227,,978-83-65907-20-2,SOC ECON MODEL FOREC,,,2018,1.0,,,,,,239,247,,10.14659/SEMF.2018.01.24,0.0,,,9,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BQ1LQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000576774700024,0

Finally we follow the theory of job search presented with the Christopher A. Pissarides. In this modern theory of labor market Pissarides do not assume the labor market equilibrium.

Besides, the impulsion instead of compulsion is used as a method of control. The problem is solved by the simulation modeling, and for the investigation of the respective non-antagonistic differential two-players game a method of qualitatively representative scenarios is used. Its principal idea is that from a very big and even infinite set of the potentially existing control scenarios it is possible to choose a very small number of scenarios that reflect qualitatively different development paths of the controlled system. These scenarios are distinguished principally, while the others do not give anything essential new.

Increase in the use of clothes hangers of wood at EU-28 market is a clear indicator of changes in customer awareness, so instead of cheap plastic hangers, they decide to buy more expensive ones of wood. Continuous emphasis in the environmental properties of wood, as natural material, has contributed to this, which resulted in the increase of its use.

It has been established that funds coming from the Community budget allowed Polish agriculture to adjust to the requirement of new environment. Integration into the European Union has created good conditions to dynamic development of the agri-food sector as a whole. Acceleration of the modernization and restructuring processes of Polish farms has taken place. These developments have resulted in a reduction in the total number of farms (by 52%) at the simultaneous rise in their average area (by 78%). Union financial measures have also influenced on generational renewal amongst farms managers. The funds considerably enhanced farmers' incomes, which increased by 156%, thus promoting expenditure on investments. As a result the improvement of technical utilities of farms has been achieved. Consequently, labour productivity growth in Polish agriculture has also been recorded. A wide range of measures within the framework of the Common Agricultural Policy enables to overcome many obstacles of the rural areas in Poland.

High levels of household spending on having and raising children is traditionally thought to be one of the reasons for low fertility. Some of these expenditures are compensated by the state, other parts are borne by parents. The paper presents the results of a time series study of indicators that describe spending on population reproduction compensated by the state. Thus overall, during the analysed period the Urals federal district showed a positive dynamic in government spending on population reproduction. However, over the same period, people's living standards deteriorated considerably. This shows the inadequacy of state measures of material support for the reproduction of the population. Moreover, parents bear costs related to raising and educating children at all stages of parenting, whereas current state policy is largely geared towards paying maternity and child benefits at the initial stages of parenthood. We believe that increasing the share of state compensation of costs related to the reproduction of human capital at all stages of parenting will have a positive impact upon demographic dynamics and reduce adverse consequences if pessimistic demographic scenarios transpire in Russia.","[Shmarova, Irina; Bagirova, Anna] Ural Fed Univ, 19 Mira St, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia",Ural Federal University,"Shmarova, I (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, 19 Mira St, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia.",i.v.shmarova@urfu.ru; a.p.bagirova@urfu.ru,"Bagirova, Anna/M-7440-2013","Bagirova, Anna/0000-0001-5653-4093",Russian Federation [NSh-3429.2018.6],Russian Federation(Russian Federation),"The article is processed as one of the outputs of the research project Fertility and parenting in Russian regions: models, invigoration strategies, forecasts, supported by the President of Russian Federation, project no.

Social housing in the European Union is characterized by the wide diversity of national housing concepts and policies across the member states. Therefore, at first a short description of a variety of implemented approaches across the EU, in terms of tenures, providers, beneficiaries and funding arrangements is offered. In most publications, the individual EU countries difference in the proportions by tenure status is only mentioned as a fact. Thus we quantified these differences between selected EU countries using measures of similarity of structures.

It is observed that informed traders at an aggregate level adopt stealth trading strategy, wherein they prefer medium sized trades over large sized trades in order to camouflage their private information. However, the stealth trading behavior varies across stocks, wherein informed traders prefer more large sized trades on firms that are part of an index compared to non-index firms. Trading behavior also varies across other market conditions. It has been noted that informed traders prefer large sized trades during periods of high market thickness, negative returns, and low volatility. This study also provides a rationale for such varied behavior of informed traders.","[Sriram, Kidambi Sridharan; Gopalaswamy, Arun Kumar] Indian Inst Technol Madras, Dept Management Studies, Madras 600036, Tamil Nadu, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Madras,"Sriram, KS (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol Madras, Dept Management Studies, Madras 600036, Tamil Nadu, India.",sriramkjs@gmail.com,"Villen Retamero, Andrea Maria/IAR-1667-2023",,,,,,27,2,2,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Game-based assessment has received a lot of media attention and managed to capture the interests of many organizations (e.g. Unilever, AXA Group, Deloitte, etc.). What are actually game-based assessments? These are games that allow you to measure the knowledge, abilities, values, personality, motivation, or skills of the rated person. They fall into the broader category of serious games, i.e. games designed for purposes beyond entertainment. The introduction of GBA into selection programs contributed, among other factors, to increasing the volume of applications and decreased dropout rates compared to other tests, such as traditional numerical and verbal. Game-based assessments can also help maintain a high commitment during the evaluation and also increases the amount of time that data can be collected. Previous studies highlight that those applying for a job are eager to use game-based assessment for self-evaluation, especially when these games are available for free. Also, in game-based assessment, it is likely to be less obvious to a candidate what behavioral/response elements are measured. Game-based assessment is more likely to generate genuine responses from candidates because they are immersed in gaming experience, thereby reducing the likelihood of falsification and distortion responses. Previous studies have shown that gamified evaluation reduces testing anxiety and that this type of games has been well received by candidates in real selection settings. The assessment is also reinforced by the fact that not only the final data (final result) is recorded, but also process data such as reaction time, time spent on each item, or intermediate steps taken to reach the final result. This new information can add value to the conclusions drawn on the knowledge, skills or traits of the candidates. The potential of games as evaluation tools can only be achieved if data evaluation methods can be developed in psychometrically feasible ways. Many of the traditional methods developed to evaluate the fidelity and validity of (classic) tests do not match game-based assessment. Currently, the game-based assessment marketplace is dominated by alternatives that are not very clear in comparison to traditional psychometry.","[Stanescu, Dan] Natl Univ Polit Sci & Publ Adm, 30A Expozitiei Blvd, Bucharest 012104, Romania; [Tosca, Adrian; Ionita, Catalin Gabriel] Struct Management Solut, 1 Nicolae Titulescu Blvd,Bl A7,Sc 4,Ap 115, Bucharest 011131, Romania",,"Stanescu, D (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Polit Sci & Publ Adm, 30A Expozitiei Blvd, Bucharest 012104, Romania.",dan.stanescu@comunicare.ro; adi.tosca@structuralmanagement.ro; catalin.ionita@structuralmanagement.ro,"Stanescu, Dan Florin/P-6421-2019","Stanescu, Dan Florin/0000-0001-8188-903X",S.I.R.O. project [36/02.08.2017]; MySMIS [115926],S.I.R.O. project; MySMIS,"This research was supported by the S.I.R.O. project Innovative solution for online recruitment, contract no. 36/02.08.2017, MySMIS 2014 code 115926.",,37,0,0,4,29,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,480,489,,,,,,10,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200042,0

It highlights the importance of CRM projects aligned with the organization strategy, and introduces, what are the most important success criteria of these projects and what factors have an influence on the successful realization of CRM projects. The paper first gives an overview of the strategic importance of projects and project management. Than project success criteria and factors are discussed. Customer Relationship Management is introduced in order to analyze its role in strategic decision making. In the empirical part of the paper CRM projects at Hungarian telecommunication companies and their information technology suppliers are analyzed. Telecommunication companies are leaders in introducing and applying CRM systems in Hungary. In order to identify project project success criteria, and the key success factors of CRM projects, as well as the relationship between them, a questionnaire was developed. Project managers and team members, as well as representatives of stakeholders - suppliers, consultants - of CRM projects at these companies, were asked to fill out the questionnaire by evaluating the CRM project they have worked for or they have been involved in. Experience in agile project management, in innovation, and in CRM system introduction is the characteristic feature of the selected respondents. 90 experts were selected and asked to fill out the questionnaire. Quantitative analysis has been made by using a database of 62 respondents. The importance of the research is that no empirical survey has been made by focusing on success criteria and factors of CRM projects neither in global nor in Hungarian perspective. The Standish Group has been investigating software development projects by applying the project triangle as success criterion and reveals the most important success factors of these projects, however, it provides general information of software development projects but no special attention has been made to CRM projects (Standish Group, 1995-2015). The PMI's Pulse of the Profession survey series also provides useful knowledge of success factors and criteria of projects, but its investigation doesn't give IT- and CRM-related information (PMI, 2012-2018). Furthermore, Hungarian projects don't take part in these surveys' samples. This indicates how our research fills in the gap of investigating the success criteria and the critical success factors of CRM projects completed in Hungarian telecommunication sector","[Szabo, Lajos] Corvinus Univ Budapest, 8 Fovam St,8, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary; [Bajza, Eszter] Stratis Ltd, 13 Majus 1 St, H-2890 Tatabanya, Hungary",Corvinus University Budapest,"Szabó, L (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, 8 Fovam St,8, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary.",lajos.gy.szabo@uni-corvinus.hu; bajzaeszter91@gmail.com,,,,,,,35,0,0,2,5,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,1104,1118,,,,,,15,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200094,0

In the face of this degradation, several restoration and conservation interventions have been implemented by both government and civil society organizations in collaboration with the communities. However, these efforts directed at mangrove conservation and restoration in the Songor and Keta Lagoon Complex Ramsar sites have largely failed to improve the conservation and sustainable use of mangroves, because key issues relating to access, ownership regimes and land tenure are often overlooked. The study therefore focused exclusively on exploring these governance issues and how they influence the sustainable conservation and utilization of mangroves in the two Ramsar sites. Eleven communities from the Sangor Ramsar site and the Keta Lagoon Complex Ramsar site were involved in the study. Participatory rural appraisal (PRA) tools such as key informant interviews, focus group discussions and direct observations, as well as questionnaires were employed in generating data on ownership regimes and how they influence the management and conservation of mangroves. The results showed that the existing ownership regime of mangrove resources has a direct bearing on the effectiveness of mangrove conservation and utilization. While mangroves under individual ownership dominated at Keta Lagoon Complex Ramsar site, family owned mangroves dominated the Songor Ramsar site. Most of the existing mangrove ownership regimes (community, clan or family lands) in the area allow access to the people to exploit mangrove resources indiscriminately without restrictions/regulations which results in over exploitation and degradation. Given the weakness of effective governance regimes and inadequacy of a formal legal framework governing mangroves in the Ramsar sites, a collaborative effort between the Forestry Commission and the communities or individually owned mangrove areas that formalizes mangrove management present the best opportunity to regulate access and exploitation of the mangroves at the Songor and Keta Lagoon Complex Ramsar sites, by providing legal backing to the community governance arrangements for sustainable conservation and restoration efforts.","[Asante, Winston A.; Acheampong, Emmanuel; Boateng, Kyereh; Adda, Jacob] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Renewable Nat Resources, Dept Silviculture & Forest Management, Kumasi, Ghana",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology,"Asante, WA (通讯作者)，Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Renewable Nat Resources, Dept Silviculture & Forest Management, Kumasi, Ghana.",winstonasante@gmail.com,,"Acheampong, Emmanuel/0000-0001-7419-1821","SNV Netherlands Development Organization, Ghana","SNV Netherlands Development Organization, Ghana","The research was graciously funded by the SNV Netherlands Development Organization, Ghana.

Accordingly, SFM related ideas and norms are translated across different environmental domains, levels of governance, and social-ecological systems. This article discusses how SFM related rules, norms, and discourses are translated from the global to the domestic level of Brazil. Results show how international forest governance is translated to multiple forest policy contexts of Brazil. First, international conventions related to forest lead to specific translations of SFM into national policies. Second, international discourses on SFM have failed to have much influence on the main piece of domestic forest legislation, the Brazilian Forest Code. Third, the confluence of international ideas and norms of SFM with the social-ecological systems of different Brazilian forest biomes produces a set of very different SFM translations on the domestic level. We conclude that translations of SFM, from the global to the domestic level, are shaped by domestic policy and social-ecological systems. Thus, the role of domestic policies and the specificity of forest ecosystems deserve more attention in global forest governance than is currently the case.","[Faggin, Joana Mattei; Behagel, Jelle Hendrik] Wageningen Univ, Forest & Nat Conservat Policy Grp FNP, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Faggin, Joana Mattei] Brazilian Minist Educ, CAPES Fdn, Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Wageningen University & Research; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES),"Faggin, JM (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Forest & Nat Conservat Policy Grp FNP, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.;Faggin, JM (通讯作者)，Brazilian Minist Educ, CAPES Fdn, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",joana.matteifaggin@wur.nl; jelle.behagel@wur.nl,"Behagel, Jelle H/M-1785-2013","Behagel, Jelle H/0000-0002-3997-3446",CAPES Foundation from the Brazilian Ministry of Education through the 'Science without Borders' Scholarship Program [9106-13-08],CAPES Foundation from the Brazilian Ministry of Education through the 'Science without Borders' Scholarship Program,The first author's work was generously supported by the CAPES Foundation from the Brazilian Ministry of Education through the 'Science without Borders' Scholarship Program [grant number: 9106-13-08].,,60,14,20,1,20,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,DEC,2017,85.0,,1.0,,,,22,31,,10.1016/j.forpol.2017.08.012,0.0,,,10,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,FR3SG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418986200003,0

The main objectives of this study are to investigate the factors that affect neonatal deaths as well as examine the effect of the Ghana Health Insurance on neonatal deaths in Ghana. Using the most recent round of the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey, the study estimates the probit model with interaction effects to account for the heterogeneity in outcomes. Additionally, the study employs the propensity score matching approach to account for the possible endogeneity in the insurance enrolment decision. Results from the estimations, after controlling for relevant individual and household characteristics suggest that the national health insurance significantly reduces the likelihood of neonatal deaths. Estimates remain consistent even after more robust estimators are employed. Estimates from the interaction between place of residence and health insurance indicate that health insurance beneficiaries who reside in urban areas are at a higher risk of neonatal deaths compared to other women. Access to medical facilities proxied by distance to the nearest health post emerged as an important predictor of neonatal death. The study also suggests significant regional differences in neonatal deaths. We, therefore, conclude that the national health insurance may have the potential to substantially improve the health outcomes of neonates and have policy implications for increasing coverage to more mothers and their neonates, as well as coverage in critical neonatal services and drugs.","[Lambon-Quayefio, Monica; Owoo, Nkechi S.] Univ Ghana, Econ Dept, POB LG 57, Accra, Ghana",University of Ghana,"Lambon-Quayefio, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ghana, Econ Dept, POB LG 57, Accra, Ghana.",mplambon@gmail.com,,"Lambon-Quayefio, Monica/0000-0003-4126-6430; Owoo, Nkechi/0000-0002-5220-9733",,,,,46,16,17,0,5,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

We address this policy disconnect by considering a new possible explanation; PWOs perceive forest management as an abstract and distant concept. Psychological distance (PD) is built on the premise that an individual's mental representations of objects and activities depend on four dimensions of distance between the individual and the object: spatial, temporal, social, and hypothetical. There are few applications of PD in natural resource and environmental research. Our objectives were to: 1) Understand the PD of private woodland owners; and 2) Evaluate how the four dimensions of PD are specifically related to the timber harvesting decision. We interviewed 32 PWOs in Maine, U.S.A. to understand their timber harvesting decision. Results suggest that PD can be described using frequency of harvesting, absentee ownership, co-ownership structure, and harvesting knowledge. PWOs with distant representations of harvesting require different policy mechanisms than those who are psychologically closer. PD is a useful theory in understanding forest management behavior by describing the extent to which timber harvesting is relevant to a private woodland owner. Social, temporal, and hypothetical distance can be shortened by offering frequent opportunities for woodland owner engagement like peer-to-peer networking and learning events and a deeper understanding of how timber harvesting promotes sustainable forest management.","[Huff, Emily S.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Forestry, 480 Wilson Rd,Rm 126, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Leahy, Jessica E.] Univ Maine, Sch Forest Resources, 241 Nutting Hall, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Kittredge, David B.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, 160 Holdsworth Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Noblet, Caroline L.] Univ Maine, Sch Econ, 207 Winslow Hall, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Weiskittel, Aaron R.] Univ Maine, Sch Forest Resources, 229 Nutting Hall, Orono, ME 04469 USA",Michigan State University; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono,"Huff, ES (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Forestry, 480 Wilson Rd,Rm 126, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",ehuff@msu.edu; Jessica.leahy@maine.edu; dbk@eco.umass.edu; caroline.noblet@maine.edu; aaron.weiskittel@maine.edu,"Weiskittel, Aaron/H-3688-2019","Weiskittel, Aaron/0000-0003-2534-4478; Noblet, Caroline L./0000-0002-3122-9268","National Science Foundation (NSF) Sustainable Energy Pathways (SEP) award [1230908]; NSF award [EPS-0904155]; Maine Agricultural and Forest Experiment Station; Northeastern States Research Cooperative through USDA Forest Service; Div Of Chem, Bioeng, Env, & Transp Sys; Directorate For Engineering [1230908] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation (NSF) Sustainable Energy Pathways (SEP) award; NSF award(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Maine Agricultural and Forest Experiment Station; Northeastern States Research Cooperative through USDA Forest Service; Div Of Chem, Bioeng, Env, & Transp Sys; Directorate For Engineering(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG))","The authors would also like to thank S.

Since households receive the cash and parents are responsible for making spending decisions, we also examine the intervening pathways between cash transfers and child schooling. Data comes from a cluster-randomized study of Malawi's Social Cash Transfer Program (SCTP). After a baseline survey, households in village clusters were randomly assigned to treatment and control arms with treatment villages receiving transfers immediately and control villages assigned a later entry. We test for treatment impacts on a panel of school-aged children (6-17) using a differences-in-differences model. After a years' worth of transfers, we find the Malawi SCTP both improves enrollment rates and decreases dropouts. The main intervening pathway between the program and schooling is education expenditures, suggesting that the cash improves the demand for education by reducing financial constraints.

Researchers applying different modeling strategies to the same data (the ECLS-K:99) have reached contrasting conclusions on this question. We outline the similarities and differences across three common approaches to estimating gains and heterogeneity in gains: 1) a gain score model (with intercept), 2) a first-difference (FD) model (in some cases equivalent to regression-through-the-origin [RTO] and student fixed effects models), and 3) a student random effects (RE) model. We show via simulation that FD/RTO and RE models produce estimates of learning rates - and group differences in learning rates - with more favorable RMSD compared to the gain score model with intercept. Using data from the ECLS-K:99, we demonstrate that these precision differences lead to contrasting inferences regarding learning rate heterogeneity, and likely explain the inconsistencies across previous studies.

In this study, a Collaborative Forest Management (CFM) site was studied using a questionnaire survey administered to a CFM user group in order to understand CFM users' perceptions and knowledge of their forest and REDD + and evaluate their expectations for potential REDD+ benefits. Specifically, the study investigated the following questions: Do CFM users know about REDD +? Are there any differences in the perceptions and expectations among nearby and distant users? The data obtained from the semi-structured questionnaire, interviews and household survey indicate that people are sensitive to changes in climate and the forest around them but are unaware of climate change mechanisms and the links between climate change and deforestation. Compared to distant users, nearby users felt more strongly that the forest is essential to their lives and were more interested in participation in REDD+ practices. As the distant users are also significant actors in management practices, there is a need to raise distant users' interests in REDD +. Both nearby and distant users had high expectations of the potential benefits of REDD +. These findings are significant for policymakers as they provide insights into the feasibility of REDD + within the context of the present form of CFM in Nepal. The Government and related stakeholders should communicate with the local communities regarding the opportunities and risks of REDD + projects, and meaningfully involve the local communities in the design and implementation process if they are to receive local support. It is important to develop a system of equitable decision-making and benefit-sharing that reflects local needs, and is incorporated into any REDD + action plans applied to the Terai forests.

The goal of the agency is to implement the socially efficient emissions level. The audit mechanism is the agency's sole choice variable, while other variables such as the tax rate on emissions and the fine for non-compliance are determined by other governmental actors. The fines and budget of the agency are constrained in such a way that the common random audit mechanism fails to implement socially efficient emissions. Assuming perfect information among the firms, we derive an optimal audit mechanism capable of implementing the socially efficient emissions level. The optimal audit mechanism creates a contest exploiting the strategic interdependencies between the firms, where the probability of winning (not being audited) for each firm depends on costly efforts (their taxable emissions reports).

Understanding the effect of English skills on health insurance is difficult because English skills are correlated with many unobservable characteristics that are also related to health insurance. In this paper, I exploit the fact that young children can learn a new language much more easily than older children to examine how English skills affect health insurance coverage for immigrants and their children. I find that English skills greatly improve immigrants' access to employer-sponsored health insurance. While Medicaid covers a majority of children who do not have employer-sponsored health insurance because of their immigrant parents' poor English skills, immigrants with poor English skills are much more likely to be uninsured. I test for heterogeneous responses to Medicaid expansions based on English ability and find evidence that the effect of satisfying Medicaid's income requirements on Medicaid coverage is smallest for immigrants with the worst English skills, which suggests that the different effects for parents and their children may not be entirely because of different Medicaid income thresholds for adults and children.","[Dillender, Marcus] WE Upjohn Inst Employment Res, Kalamazoo, MI 49007 USA",W.E.

The level of demand for child labour is shown to be linked mainly to adult wage levels, the adult unemployment rate in an area, and the size of the informal and agriculture sectors. The supply of child labour is seen to be positively linked to the proportion of adult unemployment in the household. Unlike previous studies, the article analyses both demand and supply side factors in a context of poverty and takes account of the co-existence of formal and informal labour markets. Furthermore, to generalise the issue for a longer span of time (which previous studies fail to do), it adopts the methodology of a pseudo-panel approach based on that proposed by Deaton. This approach makes it possible to pinpoint more accurately the factors, and their interaction, that need to be considered in any effective policy approach to the issue of child labour. To prevent unintended consequences, a multi-faceted development approach is required.","[Fatima, Ambreen] Univ Karachi, Appl Econ Res Ctr, Karachi 75270, Sindh, Pakistan",University of Karachi,"Fatima, A (通讯作者)，Univ Karachi, Appl Econ Res Ctr, Karachi 75270, Sindh, Pakistan.",amber@aerc.edu.pk,"Fatima, Ambreen/P-5503-2019","Fatima, Ambreen/0000-0002-6164-2184","Higher Education Commission, Pakistan","Higher Education Commission, Pakistan(Higher Education Commission of Pakistan)","The research formed part of a PhD thesis funded by the Higher Education Commission, Pakistan.",,33,9,9,0,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

We offer new evidence on principals' subjective evaluations of their teachers' effectiveness using two sources of data from a large, urban district: principals' high-stakes personnel evaluations of teachers, and their low-stakes assessments of a subsample of those teachers provided to the researchers. We find that principals' evaluations of teachers are quite positive whether the stakes are high or low, but the low-stakes evaluations show substantially more use of lower rating categories, and many teachers rated ineffective on the low-stakes assessment receive effective or highly effective high-stakes ratings. Teacher characteristics, such as experience, partially explain the discrepancy between the two scores. Also, despite the fact that principals overwhelmingly assign teachers to the two highest rating categories on the high-stakes evaluation, their high- and low-stakes ratings show similar correlations with teacher value-added measures.","[Grissom, Jason A.] Vanderbilt Univ, Peabody Coll, Nashville, TN 37203 USA; [Loeb, Susanna] Stanford Univ, Ctr Educ Policy Anal, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University Peabody College; Stanford University,"Grissom, JA (通讯作者)，Vanderbilt Univ, Peabody Coll, Nashville, TN 37203 USA.",jason.grissom@vanderbilt.edu; sloeb@stanford.edu,,"Loeb, Susanna/0000-0003-1854-8843",Institute of Education Sciences at the U.S. Department of Education [R305A100286],Institute of Education Sciences at the U.S. Department of Education,"The authors thank Julie Cohen, Mimi Engel, the anonymous referees, and attendees of the 2013 Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management and 2014 Association for Education Finance and Policy annual meetings for helpful comments on earlier drafts.

J,"Stanford, J",,,,"Stanford, Jim",,,Automotive surrender: The demise of industrial policy in the Australian vehicle industry,ECONOMIC AND LABOUR RELATIONS REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Australia; auto industry; car manufacturing; deindustrialisation; financialisation; industrial policy; trade liberalisation,DEINDUSTRIALIZATION; GEOGRAPHY; GROWTH; TRADE,"Australia developed a strong and successful automotive manufacturing industry after the Second World War, based on active industrial policy. But in 2017, mass vehicle assembly in the country will cease altogether, as the last global automakers operating in the country close their final plants, with negative spillover effects along the automotive manufacturing supply chain. After 2017, Australia will be the only major industrial country with no vehicle assembly whatsoever. This article analyses the shifts in industrial policy that explain both the initial postwar expansion, and the subsequent decline and closures. Policy-makers incorrectly assumed that the critical goal of stimulating automotive exports could be achieved through trade liberalisation, but dismantling tariffs only stimulated vehicle imports without increasing overseas demand for Australian cars. Production declined in tandem with tariffs, and there was no clear industry policy strategy for facilitating the redirection of released resources to more productive manufacturing activity, when that outcome, predicted in neoliberal comparative advantage theory, failed to materialise. Financial market deregulation, resulting in financialisation of the economy, coupled with high commodity prices, resulted in an overvalued and volatile currency, attracting foreign investors to resources and asset speculation while appearing to increase manufacturing production costs. A clear contrast is drawn between Australia's policy passivity in recent decades, and the continued policy activism visible in other jurisdictions of all political orientations - including countries which, particularly after the global financial crisis, faced economic and industrial challenges at least as daunting as Australia's. In the 1970s, Australia had been among the world's top 10 auto manufacturers; after 2017, it will be one of only two G20 countries completely lacking mass automotive manufacturing capacity. The industry's disappearance from Australia is shown to have resulted from some unique policy choices: understanding them may help avert future similar policy errors.","[Stanford, Jim] Australia Inst, Ctr Future Work, Level 1 Endeavour House,1 Franklin St, Manuka, ACT 2603, Australia; [Stanford, Jim] McMaster Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, ON, Canada",McMaster University,"Stanford, J (通讯作者)，Australia Inst, Ctr Future Work, Level 1 Endeavour House,1 Franklin St, Manuka, ACT 2603, Australia.",jim@tai.org.au,,,,,,,58,5,5,0,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of universal infant (< 2 years old) vaccination with a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in comparison with a 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) for the prevention of pneumococcal disease in Germany. A population-based Markov model was developed to estimate the impact of PCV13 and PCV10 on invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), non-invasive pneumonia (PNE), and acute otitis media (AOM) over a time horizon of 50 years. The model included the effects of the historical vaccination scheme in infants as well as indirect herd effects and replacement disease. We used German epidemiological data to calculate episodes of IPD, PNE, and AOM, as well as direct and indirect effects of the vaccination. Parameter uncertainty was tested in univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. In the base-case analysis, the ICER of PCV13 versus PCV10 infant vaccination was EUR 9826 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained or EUR 5490 per life-year (LY) gained from the societal perspective and EUR 3368 per QALY gained or EUR 1882 per LY gained from the perspective of the German statutory health insurance. The results were particularly sensitive to the magnitude of indirect effects of both vaccines. Universal infant vaccination with PCV13 is likely to be a cost-effective intervention compared with PCV10 within the German health care system, if additional net indirect effects of PCV13 vaccination are significant.","[Kuhlmann, Alexander; von der Schulenburg, J. -Matthias Graf] Leibniz Univ Hannover, CHERH, Otto Brenner Str 1, D-30159 Hannover, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover,"Kuhlmann, A (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, CHERH, Otto Brenner Str 1, D-30159 Hannover, Germany.",ak@ivbl.uni-hannover.de,"Kuhlmann, Alexander/JFA-2021-2023",,,,,,102,14,14,2,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Data Sources/Study Setting. Using secondary data from 100% FFS Medicare enrollees, we analyzed endoscopy utilization during two intervals, 2001-2005 and 2006-2009. Study design: We examined change in predictors of county-level endoscopy utilization rates based on a conceptual model of market supply and demand with spillovers from managed care practices. The equations for each period were estimated jointly in a spatial lag regression model that properly accounts for both place and time effects, allowing robust assessment of changes over time. Data collection/Extraction methods: All Medicare FFS enrollees with both Parts A and B coverage who were age 65+, remained alive and living in the same state over the interval were included in the analyses. The later interval used a new cohort defined the same as the earlier interval. 100% Medicare denominator files were also used, providing county of address to use for county-level aggregation. The outcome variable was defined as county-level proportion of enrollees who ever used endoscopy over the interval. Principal findings: Endoscopy utilization by FFS Medicare increased, and became more accessible across the US. Medicare managed care plan spillovers onto FFS Medicare endoscopy utilization changed over time from a significant negative (restraining) effect in the early period to no significant effect by the later period. Conclusions: The MMA eased budget constraints for seniors, making endoscopic CRC screening more affordable. The MMA policies also strengthened managed care business prospects, and enrollments in Medicare managed care escalated. The change in managed care spillover effects reflects the gradual acceptance of endoscopic CRC screening procedures, as they emerged as the gold standard during the period.","[Mobley, Lee R.; Zhou, Mei; Bose, Srimoyee] Georgia State Univ, 1 Pk Pl,Suite 700, Atlanta, GA 30304 USA; [Amaral, Pedro] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Cedeplar, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Kuo, Tzy-Mey] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Mobley, LR (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, 1 Pk Pl,Suite 700, Atlanta, GA 30304 USA.",lmobley@gsu.edu,"Amaral, Pedro/AAQ-1486-2021",,Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [1R01HS021752],Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesAgency for Healthcare Research & Quality),"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, R01 grant (1R01HS021752).",,35,5,5,0,19,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

Numerous studies have demonstrated a worrisome decline in low- and medium-income employment resulting from the replacement of human workforce with machines. A seminal study by Frey and Osborne in 2013 predicted that 47% of the 702 examined occupations in the United States faced a high risk of decreased employment rate within the next 10-25 years as a result of computerization. Despite the seemingly dystopian future foreshadowed by these numbers, the wholesale replacement of labor by machines will most likely not become a reality in the foreseeable future for an array of reasons, including the creativity required by many occupations and interventions by governments. However, despite the barriers, computerization is likely to have a significant effect on the current market. In this paper, we aim to track the relative quantities of jobs that are either susceptible or non-susceptible to computerization in the future, by developing and utilizing an analytical model using Markov chains. Various simulations performed using this model demonstrate the importance of intervention policies, such as improved technical education of the public, in controlling the rate of computerization. Moreover, the simulations identify the probable creation of new jobs that would facilitate new human employment. Although radical changes in technology and economy await humanity, adequate preparation will help to facilitate a smoother transition into the age of computers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The European Commission selectively relied on econometric analyses, predicting a positive impact of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. Its proposed legal text on Trade and sustainable development' fell short of the European Parliament's negotiating guidelines, which themselves failed to ensure protection of labour standards. The activities of corporate lobbies threatened the effective protection of workers' rights. Major risks to workers' rights are posed by discrepancies between US and European Union labour and social law and labour standards. The most recent legal text lacks compliance monitoring provisions and sanction mechanisms against member states failing to ratify core labour conventions. The investment court system does not resolve the problems of the discredited investor-state dispute settlement mechanism for which it is the proposed replacement. The year 2016 has provided a foretaste of the dislocation likely from trade and investment regulation that sees social and environmental standards and labour rights simply as barriers to corporate profits.

Although international payments will be granted to participating countries strictly based on their carbon performance, this will not necessarily be the case for benefit-sharing at local levels. In this paper we analyse the technical and legal constraints to the development of 'pro-poor' benefit distribution systems, using the prototype scheme of Mexico as an example. There are two distinct types of carbon impacts in REDD+: avoided/reduced emissions and carbon sequestration/removals. From a legal perspective it is possible to link the ownership of carbon stocks and enhancements in forests to the legaLowners of trees and land, thus enabling them to participate in carbon markets to trade carbon credits for sequestration/removals. However, we argue that it is not possible to create exclusive property rights over avoided/reduced emissions since they are counterfactual; they have no legal existence; moreover deforestation is illegal in Mexico without a land use change permit, and to pay for not deforesting would be tantamount to paying people not to commit a crime. In order to share the financial benefits derived from avoided/reduced emissions, the principle of fair compensation to those producing environmental benefits can however be used. The funds resulting from avoided/reduced emissions, assessed at national level, will be used by the government for investments at the local level in activities which directly or indirectly lead to more sustainable territorial development within communities, via up-front payments for efforts rather than ex-post rewards for carbon results. Although results-based benefit distribution systems in REDD+ can be defended on grounds of environmental effectiveness and cost-efficiency, they have a much higher probability of systematically excluding vulnerable groups, in comparison with effort-based strategies. Mexico's effort-based approach to the finance of initial REDD+ activities has the potential in principle to be a pro-poor instrument, but up to now, specific interventions to target vulnerable groups have not been implemented, nor have adequate guidelines been developed to promote an inclusive local distribution of benefits.

The average daily yield of crayfish was 2.13lb/acre (95% CI=1.19-3.00) and yield did not differ between wetlands dominated with Red Swamp Crayfish or White River Crayfish. Four hypothetical scenarios of harvest operations revealed annual costs associated with harvesting crayfish to be $163.89-370.75/acre. Although these costs were lower than estimated costs currently associated with harvesting crayfish from fields with planted forage in Louisiana ($749.96/acre), a three-fold reduction in crayfish yield (lb/trap/day) from moist-soil wetlands resulted in an increase in the break-even selling price from $1.25/lb in Louisiana to $1.70-$3.86/lb in the MAV.

Managers currently have little information to understand the effect of these closures on harvesting effort or economic values. In order to address this important need, we recently conducted a contingent behavior survey of recreational shellfish harvesters that use Puget Sound beaches. The survey elicited the number of annual trips respondents would expect to take under alternative closure scenarios, including a baseline of no closure.

This will happen on 1 January, 2018. The work is divided into four parts. The first part depicts the credit as a financial instrument. It also indicates such negative phenomena as asymmetry of information, distortion of information and adverse selection, which may all affect the credit risk. Also, high risk credits, i.e. subprime credits have been described. The second part presents the expected credit loss model in accordance with IFRS 9 and depicts its scope as well as the division of the entities' credit exposures into three stages. The third part of this article contains the evaluation of potential effects of implementation of expected credit loss model for banks. In the last part, the possible effects of the new impairment model on the credit policy are discussed, as well as the limits of the paper and future research regarding the studied subject.","[Bista, Anna; Pawlowska-Szawara, Ewelina] Univ Econ Cracow, Krakow, Poland",,"Bista, A (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Cracow, Krakow, Poland.",bistaa@uek.krakow.pl; pawlowse@uek.krakow.pl,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,20,ANGLO-AMER UNIV,PRAHA 1,"LETENSKA 5, PRAHA 1, 118 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-906585-4-7,,,,2017,,,,,,,315,327,,,,,,13,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393100025,0

However, little research presents empirical evidences for Chinese stock market due to the absence of option market. Under general equilibrium asset pricing framework, this article estimates time-varying VRP using the Chinese stock market data. We find that the estimated VRP predicts the excess Chinese stock market return, and this forecasting power is stronger at 4- and 5-month horizons, which is consistent with the findings of existing literature.","[Chen, Jian; He, Chen] Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, Dept Finance, Xiamen, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jing] Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China",Xiamen University; Xiamen University,"Zhang, J (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.",jzhang1@xmu.edu.cn,"Chen, Jian/HKM-6136-2023",,"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [20720151027, 20720151036]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71303200]",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Jian Chen acknowledges the financial support by Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 20720151027), and Jing Zhang thanks the financial support by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71303200) and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 20720151036).",,25,1,1,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

In industrial society, it is determined by the level of technological development. In modern world, the specificity of social time and space is determined primarily by the variety of person's identities of political and cultural self-identification and by the scale and level of involvement of the virtual in society's social and political objective reality.

An ARMAX model is specified to provide a parsimonious characterization of producer prices and used to simulate price effects from exchange rate shocks. Results show the importance of exogenous shocks, outside the control of fisheries management on welfare/income of Canadian fishermen. An error-correction model is specified to link the price in the first-hand market to the price in the processing market. This model measures both the short- and long-run parameters in defining price, provides estimates on the length of time to regain the equilibrium from price shocks and to forecast producer price response. Interestingly, results show that process price can be considered weakly exogenous with respect to both the short and long run and is the price leader in determining producer price.","[Gordon, Daniel V.] Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Gordon, Daniel V.] Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ, Stavanger, Norway",University of Calgary; Universitetet i Stavanger,"Gordon, DV (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",dgordon@ucalgary.ca,,,,,,,50,7,8,1,17,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

(2) If yes, do market participants apply the sovereign ceiling rule adopted by rating agencies in the pricing of our bond market data? And (3) how do market views compare with the rating agencies ceiling policy for each corporate bond? We find strong evidence of an economically and statistically significant effect of sovereign risk on corporate spreads across different panel econometric specifications and bonds. Moreover, markets do not apply the ceiling rule in 77-90% of the bonds we sample and these findings are consistent with rating agencies' policies toward the latter for about 50% of the firms. These results are robust to the inclusion of firm- and bond-specific variables derived from the structural approach to credit risk and to the business cycle in each country.","[Grandes, Martin] Univ Buenos Aires, Sarmiento 2058, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Grandes, Martin; Tupac Panigo, Demian] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CITRA, Sarmiento 2058, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Tupac Panigo, Demian] Univ Nacl La Plata, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Anibal Pasquini, Ricardo] Univ Austral, IAE Business Sch, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",University of Buenos Aires; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); National University of La Plata; Austral University,"Grandes, M (通讯作者)，Univ Buenos Aires, Sarmiento 2058, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.;Grandes, M (通讯作者)，Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CITRA, Sarmiento 2058, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",grandes.m@umet.edu.ar,,,,,,,46,1,1,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

After its 1959 revolution, it sought to achieve economic independence from the US, and traded mainly outside GATT rules, in barter arrangements with the Soviet Union and later with Venezuela. This article investigates why Cuba chose to remain in the GATT and WTO as a centrally planned economy. GATT and WTO documents reveal that Cuba sought to gain influence among developing countries as a critic of existing trade rules and negotiations, while attempting to retain or seek new rules-based multilateral channels of market access. Yet Cuba has not been able to avoid dependence on major trading partners and a limited range of exports, as the collapse of the Soviet system, and the political deterioration in Venezuela led to major declines in Cuban exports and economic crisis. However, Cuba has begun to diversify its exports and expand its trade partnerships, and its trade interests now align more closely with WTO rules and negotiating agendas. Cuba will, however, need to implement domestic reforms and increased openness to global markets in order to realize the economic benefits of WTO membership.","[Jones, Kent] Babson Coll, Econ, Wellesley, MA 02457 USA",Babson College,"Jones, K (通讯作者)，Babson Coll, Econ, Wellesley, MA 02457 USA.",kjones@babson.edu,,,,,,,34,1,1,0,2,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Latvia, along with other East European countries, over the past two decades has witnessed the demographic and socioeconomic decline of many rural areas. Human mobility or relative immobility is inherently geographical in nature, not only in the sense of population movements across the space but also raises important questions about the socioeconomic development of particular place. Much of the recent geographical research on human mobilities has focused on urban areas. Less attention has been given to mobilities in the context of rural places. In this paper, we argue that mobility and immobility represents important component of rural lifestyles and places. The aim of the current study is to analyse mobility behaviour of rural residents with regard to population composition in the Latvian countryside. We draw on empirical materials from a survey of a survey of 802 rural households in Vidzeme and Latgale regions to reveal the nature of mobilities and related residential composition. Research results confirm the importance of human mobility as essential force contributing to rural decline. It was found that migration selectivity is stable but the composition and behaviour of migrants vary between highly mobile working age individuals mostly in Vidzeme and overrepresentation of elderly, economically non-active immobile population in Latgale.","[Krisjane, Zaiga; Apsite-Berina, Elina; Berzins, Maris; Grine, Ineta] Univ Latvia, Fac Geog & Earth Sci, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Apsite-Berina, E (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Fac Geog & Earth Sci, Riga, Latvia.",elina.apsite-berina@lu.lv,"Berzins, Maris/JRY-1356-2023; Berina, Elina Apsite/AAM-8973-2020",,National Research Program EKOSOC-LV [5.2.4]; Latvian Council of Sciences [514/2012]; University of Latvia,National Research Program EKOSOC-LV; Latvian Council of Sciences(Latvian Ministry of Education and Science); University of Latvia,"The research was funded by the National Research Program EKOSOC-LV [grant number 5.2.4], the Latvian Council of Sciences [grant number 514/2012], and University of Latvia, to whom we are very grateful.",,20,1,1,0,2,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-261-3,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2017,,45,,,,,127,133,,,,,,7,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BI1NY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406530100015,0

In Procurement process, the author identifies three main stages, which are essential for a successful and efficient procurement - procurement planning, selection of evaluation criteria and performance of the contract. Latvian largest food purchasers through public procurements are local governments or their authorities and procuring goods is not their primary function. So the biggest challenge for local governments at all stages of the procurement is insufficient level of knowledge. On the other hand there are challenges regarding to suppliers, for example, small producers are not competitive to participate in the public procurement of food, they can't provide high-quality products in relevant quantity all the year, and also lack of knowledge on how to sell their products to schools and other local authorities. The following research methods were employed to carry out the present research: analysis and synthesis, induction and deduction, the monographic method and the graphic method.","[Krivasonoka, Inita; Zvirbule, Andra] Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,"Krivasonoka, I (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia.",inita.krivasonoka@gmail.com; andra.zvirbule@llu.lv,"Zvirbule, Andra/AAF-5649-2019; Zvirbule, Andra/AAN-8223-2020","Zvirbule, Andra/0000-0001-7206-7608;",,,,,16,2,2,0,6,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,343,352,,,,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6MR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426857700036,0

After the reform and opening up to the outside world, China's colleges and universities have been developing rapidly. As an important information resource, the colleges and universities archives play an increasingly important role in the construction and development of colleges and universities. The compilation and research of colleges and universities archives takes the top priority in the whole development of archives in colleges and universities, which is directly related to the quality of archives work. At present, the development of archives work in colleges and universities is developing rapidly, but there are still many shortcomings. For instance insufficient recognition of colleges and universities, professional talent shortage, studying form is single, studying results are not good and so on. The author worked in the archives in colleges and universities for a long time, so the author has put forward some suggestions. Firstly, the author put forward the significance of studying on the archives work. Such as the important role of cultural inheritance, the function of becoming an important part of the memory of colleges and universities, and the function of providing relevant materials and technical assistance to other departments in universities and so on. Therefore, some innovative suggestions are proposed for the above problems. For instance, provide professional guidance for the research of archives work, and provide a new channel for the research work by means of the big data information, and provide special fund support for the archives work in colleges and universities. The innovation of this paper is not only to start from the theoretical level, but also to put forward the relevant methods for the university archives research work from the practice level. With the continuous rise of China's economic level and comprehensive strength, the people's pursuit of spiritual culture is getting higher and higher. Strengthening the construction of archives culture in colleges and universities can promote the healthy development of colleges and universities, cultivate better talents for the society, and provide the universities' own power for the strategy of powerful cultural country.","[Liu Xiqiao] Archives Northeast Normal Univ, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China",,"Liu, XQ (通讯作者)，Archives Northeast Normal Univ, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China.",84009476@qq.com,,,,,,,4,1,1,0,2,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-442-2,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2017,156.0,,,,,,101,104,,,,,,4,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BJ6GD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426646800024,0

During the period 2000-2002 the Norwegian salmon industry witnessed a period of low prices leading to a wave of defaults and bankruptcies. The consequences were large monetary losses for both investors and banks, highlighting the importance of early detection of failing firms. Using financial ratios measuring the firms' financial status prior to this event, two credit risk models are developed; one using logit regression and the other Classification and Regression trees. The performance of the two models developed is compared to a cross-industry benchmark model developed by the Norwegian Central Bank. The model estimated on industry data is better at separating between companies with high and low credit risk in the salmon industry compared to the benchmark model.","[Misund, Bard] Univ Stavanger, Sch Business, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway",Universitetet i Stavanger,"Misund, B (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, Sch Business, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway.",bard.misund@uis.no,"Misund, Bård/J-8720-2016","Misund, Bård/0000-0001-7069-5707",,,,,63,6,10,1,22,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

The economic literature attests a tight interdependence between job quality, mainly reflected through the working environment, work intensity, working program, skills, earnings or job difficulty and the labour productivity, job satisfaction, respectively performance and economic growth. Therefore, we have developed a complex cluster analysis based on the Ward method and Euclidian distance that allowed for a proper grouping of EU-28 countries according to the outcomes resulted on three job quality indices. Furthermore, we configured six macroeconometric models processed through the correlated panels corrected standard error method of estimation (PCSE) and OLS in order to assess the impact of various measures of the working conditions upon the GDP per person employed. The results of the cluster analysis point out that Central and Eastern European countries tend to have a less flexible working program but with more hours worked and increased job difficulty compared to the other Member States, while the estimation results for the job quality impact models upon GDP per person employed highlight important positive effects of all four job quality dimensions considered as explanatory variables (fixed program, tight deadlines, paid training, job prospects), reflected in terms of significant improvements in the level of GDP per person employed for the 28 panel considered economies.","[Noja, Gratiela Georgiana] West Univ Timisoara, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Timisoara, Romania; [Cristea, Mirela] Univ Craiova, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Craiova, Romania",West University of Timisoara; University of Craiova,"Noja, GG (通讯作者)，West Univ Timisoara, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Timisoara, Romania.",gratiela.noja@e-uvt.ro; mirelas.cristea@gmail.com,"Cristea, Mirela/AAP-8154-2020; Noja, Gratiela/X-2471-2019","Cristea, Mirela/0000-0002-6670-9798; Noja, Gratiela/0000-0002-9201-3057",,,,,19,3,3,0,6,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,59,71,,,,,,13,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ2BZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418819000007,0

Additionally, two structural complexity measures, entropy and the number of attribute level changes, are used to capture status quo effects from the similarity between alternatives and the number of trade-offs. A crucial finding is that the frequency of status quo choices is negatively associated with the number of alternatives indicating preference matching effects. By contrast, the probability of choosing the status quo increases with a higher number of choice tasks, a wider level range, and the similarity between alternatives. Status quo choices are further affected by the current environmental situation perceived by respondents. We also find that Marginal and non-marginal welfare estimates are significantly affected by the choice design. One key finding is that the most used choice task format in environmental economics, i.e., two hypothetical and a status quo alternative, is likely to increase the propensity to choose the status quo option.

From the perspective of fish farmers as well as regulators managing aquaculture can be regarded as what political scientists refer to as a wicked problem. This is because there is a great extent of uncertainty and lack of firm knowledge with respect to the externalities of aquaculture production; e.g., diseases, environmental impacts, and conflicts with other user interests. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of the aquaculture sector contributes to the uncertainty as new solutions emerge, rendering established knowledge obsolete or irrelevant. Designing appropriate public regulations and policy measures is thus important, but difficult. Based on empirical data from Norway, we investigate what respondents from public agencies and the industry perceive to be challenges in governing aquaculture and what we may infer on the characteristics of a good governance approach. We propose that such an approach needs to focus on building competence, collaboration, and be adaptable. Furthermore, it needs to be flexible and cost efficient.","[Osmundsen, Tonje C.; Almklov, Petter] NTNU Social Res, Dept Studio Apertura, Trondheim, Norway; [Tveteras, Ragnar] Univ Stavanger, Ctr Innovat Res, Stavanger, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Universitetet i Stavanger,"Osmundsen, TC (通讯作者)，NTNU Social Res, Dragvoll Alle 38b, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",tonje.osmundsen@samfunn.ntnu.no,,"Osmundsen, Tonje/0000-0002-5776-6694; Almklov, Petter/0000-0002-2836-440X; Tveteras, Ragnar/0000-0002-8553-556X","Research Council of Norway (NFR) [900590, 234139]; Regional Research Fund Mid-Norway [220835]; Norwegian Seafood Research Fund - FHF [900902]",Research Council of Norway (NFR)(Research Council of Norway); Regional Research Fund Mid-Norway; Norwegian Seafood Research Fund - FHF,"The authors would like to acknowledge funding from the Research Council of Norway (NFR no. 900590 and no. 234139) and the Regional Research Fund Mid-Norway (no. 220835), as well as from the Norwegian Seafood Research Fund - FHF, Project no. 900902.",,53,85,86,2,32,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

The assessment isolates the insurance effect (moral hazard) from individual and environmental factors relating to sick leave (including health and working conditions). Results suggest that employees who are compensated during the 3-day waiting period are not more likely to have an absence. On the contrary, their sickness leaves are significantly shorter by 3 days on average. These results could be explained by consequences of presenteeism and ex post moral hazard when employees are exposed to a waiting period.","[Pollak, Catherine] DREES French Directorate Res Studies Evaluat & St, Paris, France",,,catherine.pollak@sante.gouv.fr,,,,,,,34,6,8,2,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

However, the current estimates of costs in the literature provide the aggregate loss of income, but not the macroeconomic loss in terms of output and demand insofar as they fail to consider the structural interlinkages of the economy. Focusing on Vietnam, this study proposes an approach based on the social accounting matrix (SAM) to estimate the macroeconomic loss due to violence. Using Vietnam's 2011 SAM, the study estimates the income and multiplier loss due to VAW. From a policy point of view, the study argues that the macroeconomic loss due to VAW renders a permanent invisible leakage to the circular flow that can potentially destabilize, weaken, or neutralize the positive gains from government expenditure on welfare programs.","[Raghavendra, Srinivas] JE Cairnes Sch Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Galway, Ireland; [Duvvury, Nata] Natl Univ Ireland Galway, Sch Polit Sci & Sociol, Global Womens Studies Programme, Galway, Ireland; [Ashe, Sinead] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Econ, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; University of Edinburgh,"Raghavendra, S (通讯作者)，JE Cairnes Sch Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Galway, Ireland.",s.raghav@nuigalway.ie; nata.duvvury@nuigalway.ie; sinead.ashe@ed.ac.uk,"Duvvury, Nata/C-3995-2011","Duvvury, Nata/0000-0002-6616-808X; Raghavendra, Srinivas/0000-0003-2058-822X; Ashe, Sinead/0000-0003-4408-064X",UK Department for International Development (DFID),UK Department for International Development (DFID),The authors thank the UK Department for International Development (DFID) for their support during the preparation of this article.

But due to cultural differences it is questionable if usage and adaption of IFRS prescriptions is the same everywhere. And consequently the comparability of the accounting information provided by the companies is affected by these cultural differences. Data and methods: From the global ORBIS-database, we selected all listed non-financial and non-insurance companies which left us with more than 22 thousand companies from 95 different countries. Based on available information from PWC and supplementary sources on the worldwide present status (December 2016) on the use and implementation of IFRS, we established a categorisation of each country's accounting regime reflecting if IFRS is mandatory, allowed, or disallowed for listed companies in the country. For our categorisation of cultural differences we used Hofstede's cultural indexes adapted to accounting setting in accordance with Gray and Radebaugh(2,3). For our comparisons and analyses we chose five performance measures ROA, Earnings Margin, Tobin's Q, and two Enterprise Value multiples since these financial ratios serve as well-defined and commonly used operational profitability accounting measures. Results: The set of uniform standards impacts differently in different countries due to differences in tradition and culture, and as a consequence, the prescribed uniform accounting standards seems to be a short-cut into producing comparable annual reports across culturally different countries in the European Union, and globally.","[Schoeler, Finn] Aarhus Univ, Sch Business & Social Sci, Aarhus, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Schoeler, F (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Sch Business & Social Sci, Aarhus, Denmark.",fsc@econ.au.dk,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,2,ANGLO-AMER UNIV,PRAHA 1,"LETENSKA 5, PRAHA 1, 118 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-906585-4-7,,,,2017,,,,,,,245,258,,,,,,14,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393100019,0

The information collected through the survey conducted in March-May 2015 within 94 organizations in southeastern Romania, allowed us to analyze the particularities of management systems. In this paper, we will focus on other management tools (management methods and techniques). To achieve the aim of the research, five hypotheses were formulated and tested through statistical means. The main results were found to be in line with the theoretical approach and previous research and validated most of the formulated hypotheses. In particular, it was found that to achieve managerial performance, is not enough to implement any of the management tools, but their methodology of design and implementation should be known and properly applied. Managers wanting to enhance their organizations' managerial performance should be aware of the importance of acquire and put into practice managerial knowledge. Thus, it will be created the premises for shaping the directions and means of action able to increase the organizations' competitiveness and performance, through modernization of management tools.","[Stefan, Simona Catalina; Popa, Ion; Dobrin, Octavian Cosmin; Popescu, Doina I.] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Stefan, SC (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",simonacatalina_2006@yahoo.com; iipopa@yahoo.com; cdobrin@yahoo.com; doinaipopescu@yahoo.com,"Ștefan, Simona Cătălina/A-5823-2016; Ștefan, Simona Cătălina/Q-4646-2019; Popa, Ion/H-5068-2016; Dobrin, Cosmin/AFW-2382-2022","Ștefan, Simona Cătălina/0000-0003-4731-6785; Ștefan, Simona Cătălina/0000-0003-4731-6785; Popa, Ion/0000-0003-0703-3828; Dobrin, Cosmin/0000-0002-8866-9643",,,,,28,1,1,0,10,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Much of the value-added of China's exports of smartphones, tablet computers, and consumer electronics goods comes from processors, sensors, and other parts and components (p&c) produced in Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and ASEAN. This article finds that the exchange rates in countries supplying p&c are crucial for understanding China's electronics exports. A concerted appreciation of East Asian currencies is needed to rebalance the region's exports. However, because of underdeveloped financial markets, the U.S. dollar remains the most important currency in the currency baskets of many East Asian economies.

The theme of shared finance is to promote sharing of reform achievements through financial development. Therefore, the next level of sharing is to solve long-term financial repression of China. In the new era, reducing income distribution GDP is required by finance sharing. Therefore, the third level of sharing is to solve the unbalanced financial development in China.

Based on the theory of job embeddedness, this paper uses the job embeddedness-voluntary turnover method to analyze the Internet R&D personnel, and then analyzes the data of empirical study with the help of the spss22.0. The results show that there is no significant influence between off-the-job embeddedness and the turnover tendency of Internet R&D personnel. On-the-job embeddedness is negatively correlated with voluntary turnover of Internet R&D personnel. Besides, the degree of correlation between off-the-job embeddedness and employee voluntary turnover is lower than on-the-job embeddedness.

It is typically assumed that certified forestland is the hallmark of sustainable forestry. This reasoning has led to a general perception that uncertified forestlands are not sustainably managed. In this regard, the role of the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) Fiber Sourcing Standard is instrumental in promoting sustainable forest management on uncertified forestlands. We used an advanced spatial approach to determine the influence of the SFI Fiber Sourcing Standard over space and time on Georgia's forestlands. We also assessed differences in the implementation rate of forestry Best Management Practices (BMPs) in Georgia on harvested sites located within the sourcing radius of mills certified to SFI Fiber Sourcing Standard relative to those harvest sites located outside the sourcing radius of certified mills. Our results suggest that the SFI Fiber Sourcing Standard affects 80% or more of total forestland in Georgia. We also found that the average BMP implementation rate on harvested sites located within the sourcing radius (about 65 km) of certified mills is about 2% higher relative to harvested sites located outside the sourcing radius of such mills over time. Our results indicate that the SFI Fiber Sourcing Standard is helping in ensuring sustainability of forestlands in Georgia, as forestry BMPs are an important indicator of sustainable forest management. We hope our results will bring clarity to the overall sustainability of uncertified forestlands in Georgia and other forested regions in North America in the context of global private forest governance systems like the SFI Fiber Sourcing Standard.","[Dwivedi, Puneet; Tumpach, Chantal; Cook, Chase; Izlar, Bob] Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, 180 E Green St, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Dwivedi, P (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, 180 E Green St, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",puneetd@uga.edu,"Tumpach, Chantal/AAN-7451-2021","Tumpach, Chantal/0000-0003-4876-8089",Sustainable Forestry Initiative Conservation & Community Partnerships Grant Program,Sustainable Forestry Initiative Conservation & Community Partnerships Grant Program,This work was supported by the Sustainable Forestry Initiative Conservation & Community Partnerships Grant Program.,,35,12,14,0,13,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,DEC,2018,97.0,,,,,,51,58,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.08.016,0.0,,,8,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,HE0KP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000452955800006,0

We analyzed 933 CARs from 22 FSC-certified FMUs reported by six CABs in 99 public summaries. The average number of CARs issued did not vary with type of audit or CAB, most focused on social and environmental issues, and most represented minor infractions that were rectified with procedural changes (i.e., improvements in planning, record keeping, and reporting). None of the measured characteristics of Indonesian FMUs helped explain the foci of assigned CARs. The elapsed time before CAR closure differed among CABs and type of audit, but decreased over time. Large FMUs established before 1998 that employed many workers and subcontracted logging took longer to close CARs than FMUs with the opposite characteristics. Finally, conclusions based on this analysis should be made in light of the limitations of analyses based on reports from auditors rather than on direct observations.","[Hermudananto] Univ Gadjah Made, Fac Forestry, Yogyakarta, Indonesia; [Romero, Claudia; Putz, Francis E.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Ruslandi] Nature Conservancy, Sorong, Indonesia",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; The Nature Conservancy Indonesia,"Romero, C (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",hermudananto@ugm.ac.id; romero@ufl.edu; Ruslandi@tnc.org; fep@ufl.edu,,", Hermudananto/0000-0002-3482-728X; Ruslandi, Ruslandi/0000-0002-8918-1893",USAID PRESTASI II; Tropical Conservation and Development (TCD) program at the University of Florida,USAID PRESTASI II(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Tropical Conservation and Development (TCD) program at the University of Florida,"This research was part of the first author's master thesis for which Appendix A.

Empirical research has shown that in these countries, households are unable to access formal insurance markets in order to insure their consumption against health shocks. Thus, in this study, are the poor and uninsured households more vulnerable from health shocks? We investigate the factors that lead to welfare loss from health shocks, and how to break the vulnerability from health shocks in three Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries, namely, Burkina Faso, Niger and Togo. Methods: This study focusses on 1597 households in Burkina Faso, 1342 households in Niger and 930 households in Togo. A three-step Feasible Generalized Least Squares (FGLS) method was used to estimate vulnerability to poverty and to model the effects of health shocks on vulnerability to poverty. Results: The estimates of vulnerability show that about 39.04%, 33.69%, and 69.03% of households are vulnerable to poverty, in Burkina Faso, Niger, and Togo respectively. Both interaction variables, health shocks and wealth' and health shocks and access to health insurance' had a significant negative effect on reducing household's vulnerability to poverty. Poverty is the leading cause of economic loss from health shocks as the poorer cannot afford the purchase of sufficient quantities of quality food, preventive and curative health care, and education. We found that lack of health insurance coverage had a significant effect by increasing the incidence of welfare loss from health shocks. Moreover, household size, type of health care used, gender, education and age of the head of the household as well as the characteristics of housing affect vulnerability to poverty. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that for the poor households, reduction of user fees of health care at the point of service or expansion of health insurance could mitigate vulnerability to poverty. Other challenges-birth control policy, adequate sanitation facilities and a universal basic education program-need to be addressed in order to reduce significantly the effects of health shocks on vulnerability to poverty in SSA.","[Atake, Esso-Hanam] Univ Lome, Dept Econ, Lome, Togo",University of Lome,"Atake, EH (通讯作者)，Univ Lome, Dept Econ, Lome, Togo.",atakesyl@gmail.com,,"ATAKE, Esso - Hanam/0000-0003-4633-4615",,,,,40,29,32,2,26,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

J,"Auld, K",,,,"Auld, Kathleen",,,Trade Measures to Prevent Illegal Fishing and the WTO: An Analysis of the Settled Faroe Islands Dispute,WORLD TRADE REVIEW,,,English,Review,,,,,,,,"There has been increasing litigation in the WTO on environmental issues in recent years, much of it about fishing. Two cases, Chile-Swordfish and Faroes-Herring, brought to light the potential for conflict between trade and fisheries law through the imposition of port state measures by WTO members to prevent illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, although both cases were settled before reaching Panel stage. Port state measures aim to combat IUU fishing by allowing countries to close their ports to IUU fish. This includes using trade measures and trade-related measures, such as import bans and transshipment bans, which may violate WTO law. The potential for conflict is even more acute now that the Port State Measures Agreement (PSMA) has come into force. This paper takes as its study Faroes-Herring, where the Faroes challenged certain EU regulations aimed at preventing IUU fishing through the use of port state measures.

Food insecure countries that are specialized in agriculture and have weak political institutions, are likely to face difficulties to enforce forest conservation. This article explores in how far export tariffs on agricultural goods combined with public investments, could be used as a forest conservation policy mix in such contexts. We first show empirically that structural constraints to forest conservation policies are particularly pronounced in one third of countries where REDD+ programs are planned to be rolled out. We then develop a two sector competing land use model with a domestic food producing and an exporting agricultural sector. We show that it is possible to combine export tariffs with public investments such that deforestation decreases, while agricultural production levels and food prices remain constant.","[Schwerhoff, Gregor] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Torgauer Str 12-15, D-10829 Berlin, Germany; [Wehkamp, Johanna] Tech Univ Berlin, Str 17 Juni 135, D-10623 Berlin, Germany",Technical University of Berlin,"Wehkamp, J (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Berlin, Str 17 Juni 135, D-10623 Berlin, Germany.",schwerhoff@mcc_berlin.net; wehkamp@mcc-berlin.net,"Schwerhoff, Gregor/L-2365-2019","Schwerhoff, Gregor/0000-0003-3644-3447",international REDD + funding,international REDD + funding,"The proposed policy mix entails costs (for the public investments), but would also generate public revenues (from the export tariffs) and is thus partially self-financing.

The viability of REDD + programs depends in a large part on their opportunity costs (OCs); however, large variation exists in the estimated OC. This study aims to quantify the variation in OC reported in the literature and identify its causes. In addition to a careful description, a meta analysis was conducted to examine the heterogeneities across the different estimating methods, data sources, deforestation drivers, and geographic regions found in previous studies. Our results show a large variation in the estimated OC because of differences in data sources, assumptions about future markets, and factors, such as carbon density, crop price and yield, and time horizon. Furthermore, variation exists even among studies of the same driver(s) of deforestation and forest degradation, within the same continent, and from the same data source. Time horizon is the largest contributor to cost variation, followed by carbon density and crop price. Geographically, the OCs are $19.49/tCO(2)e in Africa, $9.19/tCO(2)e in Asia Pacific, and $4.33/tCO(2)e in Latin America, respectively.

Examples include persistent over exploitation of oil fields and ocean fisheries, despite general agreement that production constraints are needed. Contracting costs encountered in assigning property rights are an explanation, but analysis of their role is limited by a lack of systematic data. We examine governance institutions in California's 445 groundwater basins using a new dataset to identify factors that influence the adoption of extraction controls. In 309 basins, institutions allow unconstrained pumping, while an additional 105 basins have weak management plans. Twenty of these basins are severely overdrafted. Meanwhile, users in 31 basins have defined groundwater property rights, the most complete solution. We document the critical role of the transaction costs associated with contracting in explaining this variation in responses.

This mechanism of our model is supported by Swedish firm-level data. Our mechanism runs through firms' endogenous investments in abatement. Firms' abatement investments depend on their production volumes, since a larger scale allows them to spread the fixed costs of abatement investment across more units. Production volumes increase in firm productivity and, as a consequence, firms' emission intensity is negatively related to firm productivity. Exporting also leads to higher production volumes and thereby to a lower emission intensity. Thus, trade has an effect on emissions independently of firm productivity. Trade therefore leads to higher but cleaner production. The overall effect of trade on emissions is neutral in our model. Trade liberalization does not affect aggregate emissions in our benchmark case of symmetric countries. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

For example, these events can reduce instructional time by causing teacher and student absences, school closures, and disturbances to classroom and home routines. This paper uses a quasi-experimental research design to identify the effects of the 2002 Beltway Sniper attacks on student achievement in Virginia's public elementary schools. To identify the causal impact of these events, the empirical analysis uses a difference-indifferences strategy that exploits geographic variation in schools' proximity to the attacks. The main results indicate that the attacks significantly reduced school-level proficiency rates in schools within five miles of an attack. Evidence of a causal effect is most robust for math proficiency rates in the third and fifth grades, and third-grade reading proficiency, suggesting that the shootings caused a decline in school proficiency rates of about 2 to 5 percent. Particularly concerning from an equity standpoint, these effects appear to be entirely driven by achievement dedines in schools that serve higher proportions of racial minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged students. Finally, results from supplementary analyses suggest these deleterious effects faded out in subsequent years.","[Gershenson, Seth; Tekin, Erdal] Amer Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Washington, DC 20016 USA",American University,"Gershenson, S (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",gershens@american.edu; tekin@american.edu,,,,,,,63,28,43,0,13,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

An activity-based costing method was used, in which the cost of staff time spent in preparedness and response activities was calculated based on a time-recording system and interviews with key professionals at the healthcare organizations involved. In addition, the organizations provided cost information on patient days of hospitalization, laboratory tests, personal protective equipment (PPE), as well as the additional cleaning and disinfection required. The estimated total costs averaged (sic)12.6 million, ranging from (sic)6.7 to (sic)22.5 million. The main cost drivers were PPE expenditures and preparedness activities of personnel, especially those associated with ambulance services and hospitals. There were 13 possible cases clinically evaluated and one confirmed case admitted to hospital. The estimated total cost of EVD preparedness and response in the Netherlands was substantial. Future costs might be reduced and efficiency increased by designating one ambulance service for transportation and fewer hospitals for the assessment of possible patients with a highly infectious disease of high consequences.","[Suijkerbuijk, Anita W.

Results from a discrete choice experiment demonstrate that presentation format influences the valuation of mortality risk reductions, which to varying degrees depends on the respondent's level of concern and numeracy. Marginal willingness to pay for a risk reduction increases significantly when framed in terms of avoided fatalities compared to corresponding frequencies. Furthermore, we find that less numerate respondents are more influenced by the inclusion of the number of fatalities in the presentation format The same pattern is observed for respondents who express a higher degree of concern for a traffic accident.

Fifty percent of students signed up to this software, so when combined with a further first-year mathematics and statistical methods unit, without message board software, this enabled the opportunity to use a difference in difference methodology to find the causal impact of message board software on student examination performance. The results suggest that students who actively engage with message boards perform significantly better than students who sign up for the message boards, but neither ask, nor answer, questions. However, the results for the impact compared to non-participants is mixed, and may be related to behavioural change in students.","[Proud, Steven] Univ Bristol, Dept Econ, Bristol, Avon, England",University of Bristol,"Proud, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Dept Econ, Bristol, Avon, England.",Steven.proud@bristol.ac.uk,"Proud, Steven/ABB-7387-2020","Proud, Steven/0000-0002-0289-1842",,,,,11,0,0,0,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1477-3880,2352-4421,,INT REV ECON EDUC,Int.

Requiring compliance with this policy could lead to unintended consequences as schools shift resources or students are re-sorted. Using a difference-in-differences estimation strategy, I investigate a 2004 state-wide mandate to offer AP programs in Arkansas and its impact on students' schooling outcomes. Results suggest schools decrease the share of courses dedicated to career and technical education in favor of AP courses. Additionally, enrollment decreases by about 60 students on average, the 4-year graduation rate increases by 2.5 percentage points, and there are generally fewer students scoring in the highest category on two end-of-course exams at schools required to comply with the mandate. Taken together, these results suggest the policy may have at least partially affected the sorting of students across schools.","[Arce-Trigatti, Paula] Univ Houston, Dept Econ, 3623 Cullen Blvd,Room 204, Houston, TX 77204 USA",University of Houston System; University of Houston,"Arce-Trigatti, P (通讯作者)，Rice Univ, Kinder Inst Urban Res, 6500 Main St,MS-208, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",parcetrig@rice.edu,"Rodrìguez, Antonio/C-5413-2018",,,,,,15,2,11,1,10,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0272-7757,1873-7382,,ECON EDUC REV,Econ.

We examine the change of a number of outcome variables, including effort, species diversity, and location diversity. We then examine whether participation in sectors led to shifts in the production frontier and/or changes in technical efficiency using stochastic frontier models. Our results suggest that participation in sectors appears to have impacted trawl vessels more than gillnet vessels, likely due to the different ways in which the effort regulations in place under the common-pool regime impacted these vessel types. In addition, sector participation appears to have an impact on behavioral responses (i.e., changes in effort and diversity of species and locations) rather than technical efficiency, despite some evidence that sector participation led to shifts in the production frontiers of both vessel types.","[Huang, Ling; Ray, Subhash; Segerson, Kathleen] Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, Storrs, CT 06268 USA; [Walden, John] Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 166 Water St, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA",University of Connecticut; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Huang, L (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, Storrs, CT 06268 USA.",ling.huang@uconn.edu; subhash.ray@uconn.edu; kathleen.segerson@uconn.edu; john.walden@noaa.gov,,,University of Connecticut,University of Connecticut,"Financial support for this project was provided, in part, by the research funding program at the University of Connecticut.

Using a new measure of social circles memberships based on proximity in social networks, we identify a cohesive core group of 171 individuals within a corporate elite of 6154 board members of the top 1037 Danish corporations. A high degree of social homogeneity in gender, social background, education and career position underlines the cohesion of the inner circle. By mapping business association committees, political commissions, university governing boards, cultural institutions, social clubs, foundations and royal events, the inner-circle members are shown to be representatives of the entire capitalist class in key sectors. This suggests that ongoing opposition to the capitalist class enhances the need for collective action, and thus paradoxically strengthens the unity of the corporate elite.","[Larsen, Anton Grau; Ellersgaard, Christoph Houman] Copenhagen Business Sch, Frederiksberg, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Ellersgaard, CH (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Frederiksberg, Denmark.",che.dbp@cbs.dk,,"Larsen, Anton Grau/0000-0003-4903-6437",,,,,79,10,11,0,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

As part of bioeconomy policies governments have initiated reviews of the contemporary laws in order to identify and remove potential barriers and address the shortcomings as well as develop new tools to facilitate transition to bioeconomy. This paper discusses the role of natural resources law in bioeconomy and considers the needs for developing legislation to better meet the future challenges. As a concrete case study the article evaluates regulations governing the use of forests in Finland from the perspective of bioeconomy. The paper shows that major deficiencies in regulations governing the use of forests in Finland in developing bioeconomy relate to ecological and social sustainability, resource efficiency, and conflict management. The article concludes that there is a need to increase integration, adaptability, transparency and public participation in Finnish forest regulation to facilitate the transition to and maintain sustainable bioeconomy.","[Borgstrom, Suvi] Univ Eastern Finland, Law Sch, Kuopio, Finland",University of Eastern Finland,"Borgström, S (通讯作者)，Minist Environm Finland, Aleksanterinkatu 7, Helsinki 00023, Finland.",suvi.borgstrom@ym.fi,,,project 'Law for Green economy - the future of nature conservation and natural resources management law' (Academy of Finland) [275930]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [275930] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA),project 'Law for Green economy - the future of nature conservation and natural resources management law' (Academy of Finland); Academy of Finland (AKA)(Research Council of Finland),The preparation of this paper was funded from the project 'Law for Green economy - the future of nature conservation and natural resources management law' (Academy of Finland 2014-2017) (275930).,,67,15,15,0,37,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,MAR,2018,88.0,,,,,,11,23,,10.1016/j.forpol.2017.10.012,0.0,,,13,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,FW0DO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000424961800002,0

Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that the turnaround program did not improve, and may have reduced, average school-level passing rates in math and reading. One potential contributor to that finding appears to be that the program increased the concentration of low-income students in treated schools. Based on teacher survey data, we find that, as was intended, treated schools brought in new principals and increased the time teachers devoted to professional development. At the same time, the program increased administrative burdens and distracted teachers, potentially reducing time available for instruction, and increased teacher turnover after the first full year of implementation.

Our analysis was done for ten developing European economies, using a stepwise panel regression approach and a one-lag panel VAR.

Methodology: document analysis, analysis of statistical data and expert survey. The system approach, cluster theory, M.Porter's competitiveness theory and the concept of the triple spiral were used as the main approach. Findings: for the university the possibility of participating in economic clusters is determined by those research areas in which they have accumulated considerable experience. At the same time, the general increase in the competitiveness of the cluster and the region directly increases the competitiveness of the university, influencing its main indicators in national and international rankings.

The literature provides contradictory predictions about the effects of a relationship with an affluent employer on a vulnerable employed woman and her household. Using data from the 2002-8 General Household Survey, this study uses propensity score matching (PSM) to compare paid domestic workers versus employed women with similar labor market characteristics. It finds that the household members of paid domestic workers tend to have a lower likelihood of unemployment, lower unemployment duration, higher likelihood of owning assets, and lower prevalence of hunger. It is, however, important to see evidence of such benefits in the context of a complicated employment relationship and to highlight that such benefits can reflect both altruistic and self-serving employer motivations.","[Burger, Ronelle; Von Fintel, Marisa; Van der Watt, Carina] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Econ, 5th Floor,CGW Schumann Bldg,Bosman St, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"Burger, R (通讯作者)，Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Econ, 5th Floor,CGW Schumann Bldg,Bosman St, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa.",rburger@sun.ac.za; marisa.vonfintel@gmail.com; cvdwatt@gmail.com,"; Burger, Ronelle/N-5203-2017","von Fintel, Marisa/0000-0002-2390-8586; Burger, Ronelle/0000-0003-2463-5265",,,,,49,3,4,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

We find that the relationship between promoter ownership and leverage is inversely U-shaped in group-affiliated firms, whereas in stand-alone firms there is a U-shaped relationship. We argue that a substantial presence of family owners and the selection of managers from within the family play some role for such relationship in group-affiliated firms. On the other hand, the argument for observed relationship in stand-alone firms follows from alignment hypothesis, entrenchment hypothesis, managerial risk aversion hypothesis, and active monitoring hypothesis.","[Chakraborty, Indrani] Inst Dev Studies Kolkata, DD-27-D,Sect 1, Kolkata 700064, India",University of Calcutta,"Chakraborty, I (通讯作者)，Inst Dev Studies Kolkata, DD-27-D,Sect 1, Kolkata 700064, India.",indrani.c61@gmail.com,,,,,,,85,7,8,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

In order to enable them to find a way to rejuvenate they need to find new innovative offers and explore new target markets. Recent changes in the population, in particular the aging factor, enable to identify new promising markets, such seniors. Seniors are considered as an important new target market to invest in since they have spending power to travel and they travel for longer time and off-season. Although seniors are an interesting market, they bring with them the effects of ageing, i.e., disability. Among different disability, dementia plays an important role. This made policy makers and businesses starting to be interested in dementia tourism. Some supply led initiatives have already been created, but further insights are needed to understand whether people with dementia and their caregivers are interested in such offers. This paper aims to explore this further. The qualitative findings of this research shows that people with dementia and their caregivers will benefit of such tourism offers, and they are willing to participate in them if extra-care is offered. This shades positive lights on the fact that such an offer could be successful. However, it is important to notice that not every caregiver is positive in making their beloved one participating in such activities, and they won't be willing to participate as well. As a matter of fact, factors such as the level of cognitive impairments, and the level of behavioral impairments influence the possibility to join such activities. The willingness of joining such activities is also influence by the family bond: husbands and wives are more prone to participate than children. This depends as well on the perception of tourism as a beneficial activity by caregivers, and the need of diversion, respite, and enjoyment of time together. If caregivers do not see tourism as something positive for their wellbeing and the one of the beloved one they will not be interested. Last but not least the lifestyle before dementia and past experience of tourism in early stage of dementia influence strongly the willingness to participate. With this in mind the markers should spend time in making sure that this offer will be appealing to their target market before starting an initiative, which although being extremely good in theory, might not be actually needed in the reality.","[Gazzola, Patrizia; Pavione, Enrica; Grechi, Daniele] Insubria Univ, Via Montegeneroso 71, I-21100 Varese, Italy; [Ossola, Paola] Cesar Ritz Coll Switzerland, Enghisch Gruss Str 43, CH-3902 Brig, Switzerland",University of Insubria,"Gazzola, P (通讯作者)，Insubria Univ, Via Montegeneroso 71, I-21100 Varese, Italy.",patrizia.gazzola@uninsubria.it; enrica.pavione@uninsubria.it; grechi.daniele@uninsubria.it; grechi.daniele@uninsubria.it,"Grechi, Daniele/GYD-5197-2022",,,,,,34,0,0,1,3,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,1031,1039,,,,,,9,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200088,0

In essence, a circular economy represents an alternative to the currently predominant linear take-make-consume-dispose economic model, which is not sustainable and in many cases is causing the wasting of natural resources. The circular economy according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation aims to maintain the utility of products, components and materials and retain their value. It thus minimizes the need for new inputs of materials and energy, while reducing environmental pressures linked to resource extraction, emissions and waste. In the article there are presented main schools of thought in which circular economy has its origins. Among analyzed concepts are: cradle to cradle, industrial ecology, biomimicry, dematerialization and performance economy. The concept of circular economy is essential for whole Europe, however Central and South-Eastern Europe is in a specific situation because on one hand, some indicators, for example recycling rate and the amount of waste going into landfills without treatment are much higher than in Western European countries, but on the other hand, in the countries of Central and South-Eastern Europe, the amount of waste generated per capita is many times lower than in Western Europe. Wise implementation of circular economy programs can cause that in these countries waste management systems will be significantly improved in a relatively short time. In the article the comprehensive assessment of the European waste management systems and circular economy programs - which aim to manage all natural resources more efficiently and sustainably - are analyzed. European Commission Circular Economy Package which is going to stimulate Europe's transition towards a circular economy has been also analyzed. In the paper benefits related to the implementation of circular economy programs have been analyzed: environmental benefits which bring less environmental impact; economic benefits which bring opportunities for economic growth and innovation and social benefits which bring sustainable consumer behavior and job opportunities. Moreover, new business models which play an important role in the circular economy and have significant potential for increased economic, social and environmental benefits are presented. Among analyzed models are: remanufacturing and reuse; selling services rather than goods and sharing economy business model.","[Gheorghiu, Anda] Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, 30A Expozitiei Blvd,Sect 1, Bucharest 010324, Romania; [Szajczyk, Marek] Siedlce Univ Nat Sci & Humanities, 2 Stanislawa Konarskiego St, PL-08110 Siedlce, Poland",National University of Political Studies & Public Administration (SNSPA) - Romania,"Gheorghiu, A (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, 30A Expozitiei Blvd,Sect 1, Bucharest 010324, Romania.",anda.gheorghiu@facultateademanagement.ro; marek.szajczyk@uph.edu.pl,"Gheorghiu, Anda E/D-2238-2015",,,,,,18,0,0,0,14,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,155,167,,,,,,13,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200014,0

We build on recent evidence of a cyclical job ladder that reallocates workers from low-productivity to high-productivity firms through job-to-job moves. In this paper, we turn to the question of who moves up this job ladder and the implications for worker sorting across firms. Not surprisingly, we find that job-to-job moves reallocate younger workers disproportionately from less productive to more productive firms. More surprisingly, especially in the context of the recent literature on assortative matching with on-the-job search, we find that job-to-job moves disproportionately reallocate less educated workers up the job ladder. This finding holds even though we find that more educated workers are more likely to work with more productive firms. We find that while highly educated workers are less likely to match to low-productivity firms, they are also less likely to separate from them, with less educated workers more likely to separate to a better employer in expansions and to be shaken off the ladder (separate to nonemployment) in contractions. Our findings underscore the cyclical role job-to-job moves play in matching workers to better-paying employers.","[Haltiwanger, John] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Hyatt, Henry; McEntarfer, Erika] US Census Bur, Ctr Econ Studies, Suitland, MD USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Haltiwanger, J (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",haltiwan@econ.umd.edu,,,,,,,41,18,28,4,11,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0734-306X,1537-5307,,J LABOR ECON,J.

At the same time crowdfunding can also be viewed as marketing instrument. In order for crowdfunding to be successful, it is crucial that idea or project are presented in away that attracts, interests and motivates people on engagement. Successful crowdfunding campaign generates financial result and at the same time creates strong awareness, personal engagement and buying willingness of potential target audience. Current world wide practice of crowdfunding is relied on spread and reach of the Internet and on the impact of social networks. First crowdfunding campaign in Croatia appeared in 2011 and its use grows ever since. But the term crowdfunding means different things to different people and still this mechanism is not very well known in general public in Croatia. The paper presents research results about understanding, knowledge, experience and future intentions about usage of crowdfunding instrument in Croatia.

Clusters are a chance for dynamic development in the group of cooperating enterprises. Localization in a cluster is for many companies the implementation of internationalization strategy and the possibility of going beyond the borders of the home country to the global market. Through functioning in the cluster, micro, small and medium-sized enterprises are increasingly transforming into international actors, which is particularly visible in export-oriented clusters. MSMEs benefit from the flow of knowledge between cluster actors, which translates into an increase in their level of innovation. The aim of the paper is to evaluate how SME can benefit from cluster activities.

Firms may adopt forced turnover policies to keep lines of advancement open, and they may alter their organizational structures to relax these constraints. This gives rise to a trade-off between incentive provision at the worker level and productive efficiency at the firm level.

However, this requirement has not been seriously enforced during GATT and WTO years because WTO members have not agreed to an exact definition of SAT. Nevertheless, some WTO members examining RTAs in the WTO Committee on Regional Trade Agreements (CRTA) expressed the view that elimination of tariffs in 90% of tariff lines satisfies the SAT requirement on the ground that the average of tariff elimination coverage of RTAs is 90%. RTA parties with tariff-elimination coverage below the average level have adapted to this perceived norm by prolonging tariff elimination schedules or by using subjective measures of internal trade liberalization. Paradoxically, the adaptations support the argument that the GATT Article XXIV:8 requirement is an operationally binding constraint on the RTA parties, although there is no agreement on any fixed percentage of internal-trade-liberalization coverage that meets the Article XXIV:8 requirement.","[Kim, Jong Bum] Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Seoul, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Kim, JB (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Seoul, South Korea.",jongbumkim@yonsei.ac.kr,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,2,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Dealing with emergency situations usually involve quick reaction which would influence a lot of people being faced with such matters, as floods, earthquakes, hurricanes or terrorist attacks. Typically, both evacuation and response to the problem involve massive movements and a wide range of issues that need to be addressed. One of the notions of great concern is how to use available tools and how to make evacuation as flawless as possible. The tools involve available means of transport, such as planes, drones and airships, trains, road vehicles such as cars, coaches, buses, but also trams and trolleybuses, and boats of various kind. Those may prove both extremely comfortable and useful means of evacuation and unfortunately, equally effective and threatening means of terrorists' massive attack tool. When considering the former case, one needs to address such issues, as managing the fleet in use, problems with infrastructure or with people skilled to operate them, as well as panic issues. When considering the latter one, one needs to consider distraction impact, the panic that would rise, the need to block the attack and to need to evacuate people. In order to be able to face the challenges, one ought to be able to use the tools to manage all the fleet that is used in emergency situations. The tools that may help deal with such situations are the ones that would cover gathering the information about each of the vehicle. They should also offer the possibility to update such knowledge, as well as pass selected information to other bodies and receive feedback from them. Moreover, there is the approach towards managing the vehicles and towards to priorities set in an emergency situation. The hereby article presents the overview of the available tools and approaches towards dealing with the emergency.

Evidence shows that governments can expedite forest transition, although economic and institutional failures can distort policy incentives. This study addresses the paucity of spatially explicit empirical research on the robustness of the forest transition hypothesis in a developed country context and identifies factors that may hasten, delay, or even reverse forest transition. We applied spatial-econometric analysis to high-resolution forest cover, climatic, socioeconomic, physiographic, and State-jurisdiction data for the Australian intensive agricultural zone from 1988 to 2014. While environmental and physiographic factors explained the spatial distribution of forests, net forest cover change was significantly associated with trends in farm-output prices inducing deforestation in Queensland, the State with less effective land clearance regulations. Changes in land clearing regulations in Queensland were significantly associated with the national forest cover trends that resulted in forest transition in Australia around 2008. Yet when land clearing regulations and their enforcement were subsequently relaxed in 2012, significant forest cover loss was once again observed in that State, particularly in remnant forests. We conclude that if forest regulatory protection is not effective, net forest loss could resume or increase, even in developed countries, in response to growing incentives for forest conversion to agriculture.","[Marcos-Martinez, Raymundo; Bryan, Brett A.] CSIRO, Waite Ctunpus, Glen Osmond, SA 5064, Australia; [Marcos-Martinez, Raymundo; Connor, Jeffery D.] Univ South Australia, Sch Commerce, Adelaide, SA 5002, Australia; [Bryan, Brett A.] Deakin Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia; [Schwabe, Kurt A.] Univ Calif Riverside, Sch Publ Policy, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Schwabe, Kurt A.; Connor, Jeffery D.] Univ Adelaide, Ctr Food & Resources, Adelaide, SA 5064, Australia; [Law, Elizabeth A.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Law, Elizabeth A.] Univ Queensland, ARC Ctr Excellence Environm Decis, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of South Australia; Deakin University; University of California System; University of California Riverside; University of Adelaide; University of Queensland; University of Queensland,"Marcos-Martinez, R (通讯作者)，CSIRO, Waite Ctunpus, Glen Osmond, SA 5064, Australia.",mar77v@csiro.au,"Marcos-Martinez, Raymundo/Q-7051-2019; Connor, Jeff/T-7345-2019; connor, jeffery/G-5466-2010; Bryan, Brett Anthony/F-8949-2010","Marcos-Martinez, Raymundo/0000-0002-7925-7081; connor, jeffery/0000-0002-2313-8630; Bryan, Brett Anthony/0000-0003-4834-5641; Schwabe, Kurt/0000-0002-3402-1411","CSIRO's Office of the Chief Executive; CSIRO Agriculture and Food; University of California, Riverside","CSIRO's Office of the Chief Executive; CSIRO Agriculture and Food; University of California, Riverside(University of California System)","We thank Shanti Reddy (Australian Department of the Environment), Jeremy Wallace, Peter Caccetta, and Suzamie Furby (CSIRO) for sharing the forest cover data; and Sophie-Min Thomson and Darran King for help with GIS tasks.

To the best of our knowledge, existing literature on online counterfeiting lacks a theoretical framework. To fill this gap, this article proposes a two-period model with sellers, buyers, and a platform. We focus on the relationship among platform structure (characterized by the ratio of buyers to sellers), asymmetric information, deterrence strength, and the ratio of counterfeits. Cross-network externalities of platform make platform managers worry about potential exodus of buyers and sellers due to counterfeits. This externality provides platform with strong incentives to fight counterfeits by itself, even without external regulatory requirement. We further show that the higher the ratio of buyers to sellers, the lower the ratio of counterfeits. Moreover, a lower degree of information asymmetry or a higher degree of punishment can reduce the ratio of counterfeits. We suggest that governments and e-commerce platforms work together in the fight against counterfeiting.","[Miao, Qi; Zhong, Weiqiang] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Social Sci, Inst Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xie, Danxia] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, 1400 E 55th PL,427S, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Tsinghua University; University of Chicago,"Xie, DX (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, 1400 E 55th PL,427S, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",xiedanxia@post.harvard.edu,,,,,,,13,4,6,17,57,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Analysis of healthcare costs from a payer's perspective was based on a sample of 425 PWD, analysis of healthcare costs from societal perspective on a subsample of 254 PWD and their informal caregivers. Frequency of healthcare resource utilization was assessed by means of questionnaires. Informal care and productivity losses were assessed by using the Resource Utilization in Dementia questionnaire (RUD). Costs were monetarized using standardized unit costs. To analyze the associations, multiple linear regression models were used. Total annual costs per PWD valued 7016a,notsign from a payer's and 25,877a,notsign from a societal perspective, meaning that societal cost is approximately three and a half times as much as payer's expenditures. Costs valuated 5456 a,notsign for medical treatments, 1559 a,notsign for formal care, 18,327a,notsign for informal care. Productivity losses valued 1297a,notsign for PWD caregivers. Informal care could vary substantially (-21%; +33%) concerning different valuation methods. Medical care costs decreased significantly with progression of dementia and with age. Costs of care double over the stages of dementia. Formal care costs were significantly higher for PWD living alone and informal care costs significantly lower for PWD with an employed caregiver. For all cost categories, deficits in daily living activities were major cost drivers.","[Michalowsky, Bernhard; Eichler, Tilly; Hertel, Johannes; Wucherer, Diana; Rau, Henriette; Hoffmann, Wolfgang] German Ctr Neurodegenerat Dis DZNE, Dept Translat Hlth Care Res, Ellernholzstr 1-2, D-17487 Greifswald, Germany; [Flessa, Steffen] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Dept Gen Business Adm & Hlth Care Management, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany; [Dreier, Adina; Hoffmann, Wolfgang] Univ Med Greifswald, Inst Community Med, Sect Epidemiol Hlth Care & Community Hlth, Ellernholzstr 1-2, D-17487 Greifswald, Germany; [Zwingmann, Ina; Thyrian, Jochen Rene] German Ctr Neurodegenerat Dis DZNE, Dept Intervent Hlth Care Res, Ellernholzstr 1-2, D-17487 Greifswald, Germany",Helmholtz Association; German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE); Universitat Greifswald; Greifswald Medical School; Helmholtz Association; German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE),"Michalowsky, B (通讯作者)，German Ctr Neurodegenerat Dis DZNE, Dept Translat Hlth Care Res, Ellernholzstr 1-2, D-17487 Greifswald, Germany.",bernhard.michalowsky@dzne.de; steffen.flessa@uni-greifswald.de; tilly.eichler@dzne.de; hertelj@uni-greifswald.de; adina.dreier@uni-greifswald.de; ina.zwingmann@dzne.de; diana.wucherer@dzne.de; henriette.rau@dzne.de; rene.thyrian@dzne.de; wolfgang.hoffmann@uni-greifswald.de,"Zwingmann, Ina/IZQ-1593-2023; Flessa, Steffen/AEO-9609-2022; Thyrian, Jochen René/AAP-8228-2020; Hertel, Johannes/HZJ-3685-2023","Thyrian, Jochen René/0000-0001-6889-693X; Hertel, Johannes/0000-0002-7641-0132; Zwingmann, Ina/0000-0002-2650-4659; Dreier-Wolfgramm, Adina/0000-0002-6248-0631; Rau, Henriette/0000-0003-0816-0693; Michalowsky, Bernhard/0000-0002-3425-0089",,,,,55,31,31,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

We discuss a variety of contemporary pricing practices, and three types of personhood they produce: generic, protected, and transcontextual. While some contemporary developments in pricing draw on understandings of the person that are quite familiar, others are novel and likely to be contested. We argue that many newer pricing techniques make it harder for consumers to identify themselves as part of a recognized group. We conclude that contemporary price personalization should be understood in terms of the intensification of individualization in combination with dividualization, and as such, contributes to novel and consequential forms of classification.","[Moor, Liz] Goldsmiths Univ London, London SE14 6NW, England; [Lury, Celia] Univ Warwick, Ctr Interdisciplinary Methodol, Coventry, W Midlands, England",University of London; Goldsmiths University London; University of Warwick,"Moor, L (通讯作者)，Goldsmiths Univ London, London SE14 6NW, England.",l.moor@gold.ac.uk,"Lury, Celia/C-2719-2019","Lury, Celia/0000-0001-7630-5597",ESRC [ES/K010689/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,61,28,28,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

However, because of the feature of mandatory pre-disclosure policy in China, this article further finds that the relation between unusually low trading volume and unfavorable earnings surprises only exists in the stocks without earnings preannouncements, because fundamental information is incorporated in the stock prices timely around preannouncements date.

The authors therefore examine the relationships between employer-provided training programmes, wages and retirement among older workers. They find that when establishments offer special training programmes targeted at these workers, women - especially low-paid women - are less likely to retire, possibly because of consequent wage growth. Their results suggest that such targeted training can indeed play an important role in retaining low-wage older women and advancing their careers.","[Berg, Peter B.] Michigan State Univ, Sch Human Resources & Labor Relat, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Hamman, Mary K.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, La Crosse, WI 54601 USA; [Piszczek, Matthew M.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Management & Human Resources, Oshkosh, WI 54901 USA; [Ruhm, Christopher J.] Univ Virginia, Frank Batten Sch Leadership & Publ Policy, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",Michigan State University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin System; University of Virginia,"Berg, PB (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Sch Human Resources & Labor Relat, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",bergp@msu.edu; mhamman@uwlax.edu; piszczem@uwosh.edu; ruhm@virginia.edu,"Piszczek, Matt/A-5658-2013; Piszczek, Marek/R-8952-2018","Piszczek, Matt/0000-0001-6089-1843;",Research Data Centre (FDZ) of the German Federal Employment Agency (BA) at the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) [fdz426],Research Data Centre (FDZ) of the German Federal Employment Agency (BA) at the Institute for Employment Research (IAB),"This study uses the IAB Establishment Panel (Waves 2002, 2006 and 2008).

In this paper, we propose an alternative stated preference elicitation technique, which we refer to as 'trio-wise'. We explain this new technique, its relative advantages, modeling framework, and how it compares to the best-worst scaling method. To better illustrate the differences and similarities, we utilize best-worst scaling Case 2, where individuals make best and worst (most and least) choices for the attribute levels that describe a single profile. We demonstrate this new preference elicitation technique using an empirical case study that explores preferences among the general public for ways to involve them in decisions concerning the health care system. Our findings show that the best-worst scaling and trio-wise preference elicitation techniques both retrieve similar preferences. However, the capability of our trio-wise method to provide additional information on the strength of rank preferences and its ability to accommodate indifferent preferences lead us to prefer it over the standard best-worst scaling technique.","[Erdem, Seda; Campbell, Danny] Univ Stirling, Stirling Management Sch, Econ Div, Stirling, Scotland",University of Stirling,"Erdem, S (通讯作者)，Univ Stirling, Stirling Management Sch, Econ Div, Stirling, Scotland.",seda.erdem@stir.ac.uk; danny.campbell@stir.ac.uk,"Erdem, Seda/B-7225-2014; Campbell, Danny/E-1873-2011","Erdem, Seda/0000-0002-4296-5834; Campbell, Danny/0000-0001-7467-2318",National Institute for Health Research,National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),Funding was provided by National Institute for Health Research.,,41,2,3,1,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Such heterogeneity is, however, rarely taken into account in forest scenario modelling. This study, in contrast, conducts a detailed forest owner mapping that feeds into simulations of ecosystem services (ES) under alternative future scenarios. First, we identify four private forest owner types (FOT) - Forest Businessmen, Household Foresters, Passive Forest Lovers, and Ad Hoc Owners through in-depth interviews and qualitative analyses on a case study area in western Lithuania. Next, each forest estate and forest compartment is assigned a FOT by combining the property registry and forest characteristics with opinions of two types of local experts: state forest managers and inspectors from the State Forest Service. Third, a set of forest management (FM) programmes is specified using field interviews and desktop research, FM records, and expert judgement for each forest compartment. Finally, ES provision is projected using a behavioural matrix combining management styles of FOT5 with details of FM programmes. We simulate the dynamics of profits from forestry activities, accumulated carbon in live biomass and tree species diversity under a reference scenario without substantial changes; and a policy intervention scenario. The study demonstrates that treating forest owners as a homogenous group overestimates profits from timber and underestimates the provision of the other analysed ES, potentially misinforming policy decisions.

A natural approach to reducing the under- or overcompensation for a particular group is enriching the risk equalization model with risk adjustor variables that indicate membership in that group. For some groups, however, appropriate risk adjustor variables may not (yet) be available. For these situations, this paper proposes an alternative approach to reducing under- or overcompensation: constraining the estimated coefficients of the risk equalization model such that the under- or overcompensation for a group of interest equals a fixed amount. We show that, compared to ordinary least-squares, constrained regressions can reduce under/overcompensation for some groups but increase under/overcompensation for others. In order to quantify this trade-off two fundamental questions need to be answered: Which groups are relevant in terms of risk selection actions? and What is the relative importance of under- and overcompensation for these groups? By making assumptions on these aspects we empirically evaluate a particular set of constraints using individual-level data from the Netherlands (N = 16.5 million). We find that the benefits of introducing constraints in terms of reduced under/overcompensations for some groups can be worth the costs in terms of increased under/overcompensations for others. Constrained regressions add a tool for developing risk equalization models that can improve the overall economic performance of health plan payment schemes.","[van Kleef, Richard C.; van Vliet, Rene C.

Yet, till now there is little evidence that this policy helps raise students' persistence and performance in college. To better understand how to design cost-effective remedial education, this paper studies the impact of an intervention implemented in an undergraduate economics program in Italy. This remedial policy aims at raising students' effort and performance by combining a short remedial course with the threat of re-enrolling them in the first year in case of a failure in the remedial exam. To estimate causal effects, I implement a sharp regression discontinuity design that exploits the cutoff rule used to assign students to remediation. Results indicate that this nudge-type policy fails to obtain any positive and significant effect on either persistence or performance in college. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

On yielding climate representation to experts,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Post-normal science; Bangladesh; Adaptation; Uncertainty; Place,SCIENCE,"Our representations of climate are changing, and with them the ways we claim to know our local climates, and live according to them. Amidst this destabilising change in natural and social orders, scientific representations of climate are emerging as dominant. In this perspective piece I start from post-normal science and offer two arguments against completely. yielding climate representation to experts, illustrated by my experiences in northeast Bangladesh. Descriptively, abandoning non-scientific representations and knowledge of climate results in a smaller and more fragile knowledge base for adaptation. Normatively, it is our common enterprise to rediscover the places we inhabit; it is not the responsibility of the expert community alone to reinterpret our places under a changing climate. Looking at the co-existence of modern and pre-modern representations of climate in Bangladesh, I suggest that post-normal science approaches may help bridge these different representations, with equal attention to their quality for adaptation, and the values and meanings underpinning them.

Human-caused wildfires often pose considerable safety and environmental hazards, and can result in sizeable economic losses. This study analyzed the relative importance of temporal, spatial, and socioeconomic factors on occurrence of 52,532 human-caused wildfires in Mississippi that burned during 1991-2005. The probability of human-caused wildfires was modeled using a multinomial logit regression for unordered nominal outcomes. Results indicated that in comparison to incendiary wildfires, other types of human-caused wildfires were most likely to occur in summer. Wildfires caused by equipment use, children, and debris burning were more likely than incendiary wildfires to occur in close proximity to primary roads and railroad tracks, whereas close proximity to population centers increased the relative likelihood of wildfires caused by debris burning. Socioeconomic characteristics also influenced occurrence of many human-caused wildfires. Wildfires caused by children and debris burning were more likely than incendiary wildfires to occur in densely populated areas, whereas wildfires caused by debris burning, equipment use, and related to smoking were more likely in areas with high unemployment rates and large proportions of people below the poverty level. Wildfires related to smoking were also more likely than incendiary wildfires to occur in areas with higher median income. These findings will be helpful in predicting wildfire occurrence as well as developing new wildfire awareness and prevention strategies, allocating resources, and reducing wildfire damage costs in Mississippi and other fire-prone regions.","[Grala, Katarzyna; Cooke, William H., III] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Geosci, Box 5448, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA; [Grala, Robert K.; Varner, J.

This forest biomass resource can be converted into bioenergy through various technologies and it becomes one of sources in Indonesia's energy mix. This paper focuses on forest residues generated primarily from the harvesting of natural production forests and industrial forest plantations; and wood processing mill residues. The estimated total potential forest biomass in Indonesia for bioenergy in the year 2013 was 132 PJ. About 50.4% resulted from harvesting residues and 49.6% from wood processing residues. Riau province has the largest potential bioenergy followed by Central Kalimantan, East Kalimantan, East Java, South Sumatera, Central Java and Jambi, which all together accounted for 87% of total potential bioenergy. Moreover, three major islands accounted for 95% of total potential bioenergy. Using a conversion return approach, the economic value of forest biomass when it was pelletized was estimated to be about US$ 5.6 per ton wood residues. The economic value of forest biomass is more sensitive to changes in the price of wood pellet than to changes in the collection and hauling cost of wood residues.","[Simangunsong, B. C.

This paper studies corporate environmental reports within the Finnish forest industry to determine the environmental performance of the industry at large. Fifteen years of environmental reports from the three biggest Finnish forest industry companies are analysed. The majority of these reports focus on inputs needed for production (especially energy) and unwanted outputs (especially air and water emissions) in the industry. The environmental impacts in areas of the industry taking place outside of mills, however, are less often reported and appear to be less important to the companies. This paper makes five contributions to the literature: First, the forest industry's reporting, as a less researched field, is studied in detail. Second, the forest industry's environmental reporting is diverse, comprised of multiple indicators and units of measurement. Third, the energy indicator reporting is both established and diversified. The diversity makes the reports as a weak source of comparison of environmental performance. Fourth, the case companies seldom report the environmental performance of their supply chains. Fifth, while the prior literature has analysed multiple environmental impacts of the forest industry, the case companies report on very few of them. The paper concludes by stating that future environmental reporting should especially address supply chains and multiple environmental impacts caused by the industry. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Supporting studies have employed a limited range of analytical techniques and the objective of the present paper is to test the hypothesis using a new methodology, the Relative Social Willingness to Pay. Three subsidiary hypotheses are: (1) that the importance of the 'severity effect' varies with the type of medical problem; (2) that the relationship between value and utility varies with the severity of the initial health state; and (3) that there is a threshold beyond which severity effects are insignificant. For each of seven different health problems respondents to a web-based survey were asked to allocate a budget to five services which would, cumulatively, move a person from near death to full health. The time trade-off utilities of health states before and after the service were estimated. The social valuation of the service measured by the budget allocation was regressed upon the corresponding increase in utility and severity as measured by the pre-service health state utility. Results confirm the severity hypothesis and support the subsidiary hypotheses. However, the effects identified are quantitatively significant only for the most severe health states. This implies a relatively limited redistribution of resources from those with less severe to those with more severe health problems.","[Richardson, Jeff; Iezzi, Angelo; Maxwell, Aimee] Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, Ctr Hlth Econ, Level 2,15 Innovat Walk, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",Monash University,"Richardson, J (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, Ctr Hlth Econ, Level 2,15 Innovat Walk, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",Jeffrey.richardson@monash.edu,"Maxwell, Aimee/JAC-6426-2023","Maxwell, Aimee/0000-0003-4328-144X; Richardson, Jeff/0000-0002-4248-4280",National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) [1069241]; National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [1069241] Funding Source: NHMRC,National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia); National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia),Financial support for this study was provided entirely by a grant from the National Health and Medical Research Council (NH&MRC) project Grant ID 1069241.

In this study, we propose a method to estimate 'quality adjusted' output based on indicators of the Adult Social Care Outcomes Toolkit (ASCOT), using data collected in the annual adult social care survey (ASCS). When combined with expenditure and activity data for 2010 to 2012, we found that this approach was feasible to implement with current data and that it altered the productivity results compared with non-adjusted productivity metrics.

Understanding the public's attitudes toward these projects could provide critical information for forest management; furthermore, their underlying values and the acquired knowledge might help collect more detailed information for these projects. Out of a total of 800 questionnaires, 724 valid questionnaires were obtained from July 2012 to March 2013; the study site was in central Taiwan. A paired t-test was used to compare the perceived forest benefits between mountain and lowland areas, and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was adopted to rank the different forest values in each area. However, the relationship between forest values, forest knowledge components and attitudes toward the two projects was constructed based on cognitive hierarchical theory. Logistic regressions were employed to analyze this relationship. The result indicated that the respondents held positive attitudes toward these two projects, particularly the RMA project. Comparing the same forest values held by public in mountain and lowland areas, the scores were higher in mountain areas, and all items showed the same pattern. Meanwhile, among the forest values, the external benefits were shown to have higher priority, regardless of the area. After the logistic regression analysis, we confirmed that people's forest values and forest knowledge were possible components for forming their attitudes toward the two projects for example, the RMA project was influenced by forest values and forest knowledge, whereas the ALA project was only influenced by forest values. Nevertheless, the logistic models were shown to perform well in the cognitive hierarchical theory framework in our study. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Only limited empirical knowledge is available on the determinants of these expenditures. In this article we analyze which characteristics of private households influence out-of-pocket pharmaceutical expenditure (OOPPE) in Austria. We use cross-sectional information on OOPPE and household characteristics provided by the Austrian household budget survey 2009/10. We split pharmaceutical expenditures into the two components prescription fees and over-the-counter (OTC) expenditures. To adjust for the specific characteristics of the data, we compare different econometric approaches: a two-part model, hurdle model, generalized linear model and zero-inflated negative binomial regression model. The finally selected econometric approaches give a quite consistent picture. The probability of expenditures of both types is strongly influenced by the household structure. It increases with age, doctoral visits and the presence of a female householder. The education level and income only increase the probability of OTC pharmaceuticals. The level of OTC expenditures remains widely unexplained while the household structure and age influence the expenditures for prescription fees. Insurance characteristics of private households, either private or public, play a minor role in explaining the expenditure levels in all specifications. This refers to a homogeneous and comprehensive provision of pharmaceuticals in the public part of the Austrian health care system. The article gives useful insights into the determinants of pharmaceutical expenditures of private households and supplements the previous research that focuses on the individual level.","[Sanwald, Alice; Theurl, Engelbert] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Econ & Stat, Univ Str 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria",University of Innsbruck,"Sanwald, A (通讯作者)，Univ Innsbruck, Dept Econ & Stat, Univ Str 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",Alice.Sanwald@web.de; Engelbert.Theurl@uibk.ac.at,,,University of Innsbruck; Medical University of Innsbruck; Austrian Science Fund [FWF: S10306-G16],University of Innsbruck; Medical University of Innsbruck; Austrian Science Fund(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),Open access funding provided by University of Innsbruck and Medical University of Innsbruck.

The United States banned imports of beef from Argentina following a 2000 Argentine outbreak of highly contagious foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), a disease not found in the United States since 1929. The United States refused to relax its import ban, and Argentina filed a WTO dispute in 2012, more than six years after its last FMD outbreak. Our analysis starts with Argentina's claim that the gap between its first requests, in 2002, to restore its trading rights and no action by the United States as of 2012 constituted undue delay'. We rely on simple insights from economic research on asymmetric information problems - moral hazard and adverse selection - to describe the difficulties facing the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and the WTO's Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Agreement in dealing with problems like FMD. Such an environment creates disincentives for socially efficient behavior that were clearly realized in this episode. The exporting country has an incentive to hide information on outbreaks and report being disease-free too quickly, and the importing country has no incentive to quickly undertake the costly effort of conducting the necessary inspections to restore the exporter's market access. Finally, we address the Panel Report's treatment of alleged discrimination both across different FMD-impacted countries and across FMD-impacted and non-impacted geographic zones within Argentina, and we touch on the Report's shift in approach regarding the obligation of the United States to take into account the special needs of developing countries such as Argentina.","[Bown, Chad P.] Peterson Inst Int Econ, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Bown, Chad P.] CEPR, London, England; [Hillman, Jennifer A.] Georgetown Univ, Ctr Law, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Peterson Institute for International Economics; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Georgetown University,"Bown, CP (通讯作者)，Peterson Inst Int Econ, Washington, DC 20036 USA.;Bown, CP (通讯作者)，CEPR, London, England.",cbown@piie.com; jah95@law.georgetown.edu,,"Bown, Chad/0000-0002-6963-7857",,,,,16,7,8,1,17,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,APR,2017,16.0,2,,,,,253,277,,10.1017/S1474745616000537,0.0,,,25,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,EQ6NA,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000398197500006,0

Modernizations of training curricula provide us with a quasi-experimental setting as these modernizations can be seen as a relatively exogenous shock. We argue that firms will train more apprentices when they have more choice options in the training curriculum because of (1) the higher productivity of graduates who have acquired more skills that are relevant for the firm, and (2) firms' higher market power in the wage bargaining process with graduates. We test this hypothesis on data on the demand for apprentices in Germany in all occupations from 2004 to 2014. We find that a more heterogeneous curriculum increases both firms' demand for and the supply of apprentices. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We argue that Vietnam's shrimp exporters may have been subject to anti-dumping duties because Vietnam has non-market economy' (NME) status in the United States. This makes it possible to levy higher duties against Vietnamese firms. We make the point that it was particularly inappropriate to impose anti-dumping duties against the Vietnamese shrimp industry because this industry shows clear indications of being perfectly competitive, whereby firms cannot dump. This in turn raises the question of how the USDOC was able to construct a dumping case where apparently none could have existed. Use of the zeroing' methodology, in conjunction with Vietnam's NME status, turns out to be central to the answer. The broader issue is that anti-dumping duties are overused where safeguards would be more efficient. The analysis is relevant for the current controversy over China's NME status with a number of its trading partners.","[Zissimos, Ben] Univ Exeter, Sch Business, Exeter EX4 4QJ, Devon, England; [Wouters, Jan] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven Ctr Global Governance Studies, Leuven, Belgium",University of Exeter; KU Leuven,"Zissimos, B (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Sch Business, Exeter EX4 4QJ, Devon, England.",B.Zissimos@exeter.ac.uk; jan.wouters@ggs.kuleuven.be,"Wouters, Jan/D-1800-2015; Wouters, Jan M.F./HPC-2729-2023","Wouters, Jan/0000-0002-0093-698X; Wouters, Jan M.F./0000-0001-8328-6005",,,,,31,2,2,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,APR,2017,16.0,2,,,,,183,201,,10.1017/S1474745616000501,0.0,,,19,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,EQ6NA,,"Green Submitted, Bronze, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000398197500003,0

The former puts more emphasis on local initiatives and the latter emphasizes the role of the government in forest transition. The purpose of this study is to clarify the relationship between the two pathways. Based on a particular case study from Vietnam, we analyze historical forest transition data generated from remote sensing imageries and field research during the period from the 1950s until 2008. As a result, we found that after 1989 the forest area in the study area recovered and smallholder played an important role in forest transition. However, they did not engage in reforestation activities on their own. Rather, government support, technical expertise, a tree processing facility, traders and a research institute all supported reforestation. This broader institutional support from government and the private sector was important next to farmer driven reforestation to explain forest transition. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Yet the root causes of the disease remain unknown. A recent hypothesis posits that maternal vitamin D levels during pregnancy affect the probability the fetus later develops asthma. Employing two large-scale studies, we test this hypothesis using a natural experiment afforded by historical variation in sunlight, a major source of vitamin D. Specifically, holding the birth location and month fixed, we see how exogenous within-location variation in sunlight across birth years affects the probability of asthma onset. We show that this measurement of sunlight correlates with actual exposure, and consistent with preexisting results from the fetal development literature, we find substantial and highly significant evidence in both data sets that increased sunlight during the second trimester lowers the subsequent probability of asthma. Our results suggest policies designed to augment vitamin D levels in pregnant women, the large majority of whom are vitamin D insufficient, could be very cost effective and yield a substantial surplus.","[Wernerfelt, Nils] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Slusky, David J.

How should responsibility be understood and used in a time characterized by complexity and uncertainty? This paper develops a typology that distinguishes six notions of responsibility and then employs it in analyzing interpretations of responsibility in Swedish forestry practice. The Swedish forest management system is a deregulated system structured by the governing principle of freedom with responsibility. By investigating how responsibility is understood and enacted by forest consultants and forest owners, we demonstrate the practical fluidity of the responsibility concept.

Managing the Friction Between Trade Rules and Climate Policy,JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,The December 2015 Paris agreement on climate change did not include an enforcement mechanism. Long-recognized potential frictions between climate goals and trade rules therefore remain. This article will present a concrete policy solution that both ensures continued adherence to core multilateral trade commitments while allowing nations to pursue independent greenhouse gas mitigation policies. A 'carbon safeguard' would allow for border adjustments on select imports from countries with less onerous carbon pricing policies but only after demonstration of injury to a domestic industry as a result of differential carbon policies. This process would concentrate complicated carbon border adjustments on a small subset of carbon-intensive and trade-sensitive sectors but continue broad adherence to the long-standing WTO 'national treatment' principle. The structure also would incorporate hard-earned lessons from trade remedy procedures under current WTO rules.,"[Moore, Michael O.] George Washington Univ, Dept Econ & Elliott Sch, Inst Int Econ Policy, Washington, DC 20052 USA",George Washington University,"Moore, MO (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Dept Econ & Elliott Sch, Inst Int Econ Policy, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",mom@gwu.edu,,,,,,,23,3,3,1,11,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

By the 1960s ecological consciousness has been completely suppressed by the dominant anthropocentrism, which places the focus of its essence on human. The visible and tangible consequences of anthropogenic pressure on the environment resulted with the introduction of a modern approach to environmental protection. The culmination of the ecological crisis, at the end of the 20th century, has encouraged the development of ecological consciousness. The importance of sustainable development in the correlation with environmental protection, in terms of criminal justice repercussion, is increasingly reflected on the awareness of the necessity of emphasizing the ecocentric concept of environmental protection that focuses on a natural environment rather than maintaining human living conditions. Insufficiently developed ecological awareness, in terms of unrecognition and unresponsiveness to the realization of the criminal offense in fild of environmental pollution, is still present in the 21st century, and was reflected in the Pliva case situation where the welfare of the chemical industry expansion gained primacy over environmental protection from pollution. The aim of this paper is to point out the importance of ecological consciousness as a part of social consciousness, in the absence of which the criminal law regulation remains only a black letter on paper, as seen in the Pliva case. Also, it leads us to the conclusion that unreported environmental crimes contribute its relatively small and negligible share in the overall criminal structure.","[Aljinovic, Nevena] Univ Split, Univ Dept Forens Sci, Split, Croatia",University of Split,"Aljinovic, N (通讯作者)，Univ Split, Univ Dept Forens Sci, Split, Croatia.",nevena.aljinovic@gmail.com,,,,,,,11,0,0,2,6,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,24,33,,,,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6MR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426857700002,0

This paper presents maps of natural resources, transportation, protected areas, and geography in the Arctic. The overlay method is used to study where resources and limiting factors overlap to identify development areas that might open up with a warming climate. The novelty of this study lies in the new overlay maps and their interpretation in combination with megapatterns in spatial trends to reveal areas that are likely to develop in the Arctic in the future (around the year 2100) given a warming climate. The analysis is intended to help strategic long-range planning and policy making on large geographic scales in order to prepare for growing development pressures. The results show the Barents Sea region has the most growth potential, followed by the Beaufort Sea and Kara Sea. The Barents Sea draws activities due to abundant natural resources, location in relation to the Northern Sea Route, geographical conditions, and existing infrastructure. The other areas have more limiting factors. Within the North Atlantic, the east and west Coasts of Greenland have the most opportunities, especially in terms of oil/gas extraction and future fishing grounds, but they are vulnerable to ecological change and pollution.

The findings are compatible with the fact that a nontrivial portion of the internal migration in China tends to be involuntary.","[Hua, Yue] Hunan Univ, Coll Econ & Trade, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Yin, Zhujia] Changsha Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Room 108,7th Teaching Bldg,Jinpenling Campus, Changsha 410076, Hunan, Peoples R China",Hunan University; Changsha University of Science & Technology,"Yin, ZJ (通讯作者)，Changsha Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Room 108,7th Teaching Bldg,Jinpenling Campus, Changsha 410076, Hunan, Peoples R China.",zhujiayin@126.com,"Hua, Yue/ABE-4066-2020; Hua, Yue/K-7659-2019","Hua, Yue/0000-0002-7627-6631",Natural Science Foundation of China [41571524]; National Social Science Foundation of China [15BGL041],Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),We thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41571524) and the National Social Science Foundation of China (15BGL041) for funding this research.,,17,4,4,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Drawing on a questionnaire-based field survey of brothel-based sex workers from Delhi and Kolkata carried out between June and December 2013, it uses the capabilities approach to understand individual, occupational, and institutional determinants of bargaining power and well-being. The study considers bargaining power to be a latent, unobservable variable and estimates it using structural equation modeling. Findings indicate that both institutional and occupational factors play significant roles. The study differentiates between objective and subjective bargaining power. Some factors that play a significant role in determining objective bargaining power, such as years spent in sex work and residence in a brothel, may not play a role in determining subjective bargaining power. Conversely, factors such as marital status and caste play a significant role in determining subjective but not objective bargaining power.","[Hui, Neha] Univ Reading, Econ, Whiteknights Campus,POB 217, Reading RG6 6AH, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Hui, NH (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Econ, Whiteknights Campus,POB 217, Reading RG6 6AH, Berks, England.",n.hui@pgr.reading.ac.uk,,,Commonwealth Scholarship Commission,Commonwealth Scholarship Commission,"The author thanks three anonymous reviewers for detailed reviews that have greatly improved the quality of this work.

ICA is used to select the important indicators. After determining the inputs, kernel methods are employed to predict the direction of the stock market. We have used the Dow-Jones, Nasdaq and S&P500 indices for experiments. Technical indicators of the indices are used as input variables for the proposed model. According to the analysis of the experimental results, kernel methods are capable of producing satisfactory forecasting accuracies and gain rates for Dow-Jones, Nasdaq and S&P 500 indices. The trading experiment shows that the kernel methods obtain higher rate of returns than the other investment strategies.","[Ince, Huseyin; Trafalis, Theodore B.] Gebze Tech Univ, Fac Business Adm, Gebze, Turkey",Gebze Technical University,"Ince, H (通讯作者)，Gebze Tech Univ, Fac Business Adm, Gebze, Turkey.",h.ince@gtu.edu.tr,"Ince, Huseyin/A-9132-2009","Ince, Huseyin/0000-0002-5953-6497",,,,,21,7,7,0,10,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Social commerce continues to evolve rapidly in response to business practice, IT advances, changing consumer demand, and the insights gained from user-generated content. Also, social media has drawn a wide attention in the industry. Much remains to be done to achieve best practices in social commerce and to improve returns on social commerce technology investments by converting site visits to purchases on social platforms. It was not long when web became the ultimate business necessity. If one doesn't have an online presence, it is not worthy to stay in this hardcore competitive market. Therefore, there is always the need of social media optimization company to create a huge impact on the e-commerce ground. There's no better way to increase awareness of a product or service than social media, allowing businesses to not only advertise products but participate in one-on-one customer service by interacting with customers. Surprisingly enough, however, sales often show little impact from social media. Although sites like Facebook and Pinterest have little direct impact on sales, they are used to build brand awareness. That awareness can indirectly affect sales, keeping their products top of mind for customers. Social media impacts almost every aspect of e-commerce, including warehousing and order fulfillment. If you have launched a social media campaign that involves a contest prize or samples, then you need a warehouse and fulfillment service that is prepared to handle the results rapidly and accurately. Campaigns that go viral on social media-especially on fast-paced, news-breaking Twitter-may require a much quicker and higher volume of product shipping than had been initially expected or planned. With the changing Google algorithms and norms, there are some changes in the way social media impacts e-commerce and e-market. This paper presents the impact of social media on e-commerce.","[Lekaj, Erion; Kercini, Donika] European Univ Tirana, Tirana, Albania",European University of Tirana,"Lekaj, E (通讯作者)，European Univ Tirana, Tirana, Albania.",,,,,,,,16,1,1,2,13,"MASTERS INT CONSULTANCY RES PUBL, MIRDEC",KUCUKCEKMECE,"CINARLICESME SK, NO 21-13, KUCUKCEKMECE, ISTANBUL PK-34303, TURKEY",,,978-605-82290-3-7,,,,2017,,,,,,,53,58,,,,,,6,Area Studies; Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BJ5TI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426276100005,0

We estimate a conventional production model for a fishery undergoing a transition to rights-based management and show that ex ante production data alone arrives at misleading conclusions regarding post-rationalization production possibilities even though the technologies available to fishermen before and after rationalization were effectively unchanged. Our results emphasize the difficulty of assessing the potential impacts of a policy change on the basis of ex ante data alone. Since such data are generated under a different incentive structure than the prospective system, a purely empirical approach imposed upon a flexible functional form is likely to reflect far more about the incentives under status-quo management than the actual technological possibilities under a new policy regime.","[Reimer, Matthew N.] Univ Alaska Anchorage, Dept Econ & Publ Policy, Inst Social & Econ Res, 3211 Providence Dr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA; [Abbott, Joshua K.] Arizona State Univ, Global Inst Sustainabil, Sch Sustainabil, POB 875502, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Abbott, Joshua K.] Arizona State Univ, Ctr Environm Econ & Sustainabil, POB 875502, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Haynie, Alan C.] NOAA, Resource Ecol & Fisheries Management Div, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 7600 Sand Point Way NE,Bldg 4, Seattle, WA 98115 USA",University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Anchorage; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Reimer, MN (通讯作者)，Univ Alaska Anchorage, Dept Econ & Publ Policy, Inst Social & Econ Res, 3211 Providence Dr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA.",mreimer2@alaska.edu; joshua.k.abbott@asu.edu; alan.haynie@noaa.gov,,"Reimer, Matthew/0000-0001-6087-9115",NOAA Fisheries Science and Technology's Spatial Economics for Fisheries (FishSET) Program,NOAA Fisheries Science and Technology's Spatial Economics for Fisheries (FishSET) Program,"We thank a number of individuals for helpful comments, including Jim Wilen, Ron Felthoven, Ben Fissel, Martin Smith, and two anonymous referees, as well as seminar participants at UC Davis, University of Washington, University of Alaska Fairbanks, and University of Alaska Anchorage, and IIFET 2012 and NAAFE 2013 meetings.

In 1966, the government of Japan enacted the Iriai Modernization Act, which aimed to assign legal ownership to forest iriais. It gave forest users the option to choose between individual or collective ownership. The paper explores the implementation of the act and whether if the choices for iriai modernization and group or individual ownership can be linked causally to characteristics of the forest user group. By the year 2010, 36.5% of the area of forest iriais had been modernized. The size of forest iriai user group and the ratio of plantation forest appeared negatively correlated with the conversion to modern property ownership, but the unity among user group members appeared positively correlated with iriai modernization. The persistence of following customs and traditions of the user group correlated with modernization towards group ownership under the act, while past labor contribution by group members appeared positively correlated with modernization towards individual ownership. The case of forest iriai modernization in Japan is relevant for the expanding debate on the interrelations between a state's natural resource use reforms and how forest commons are incorporated in this process.

It uses a subjective well-being approach, based on self-reported happiness, to capture income and non-income aspects of employment. The study uses original survey data from 2013 for the Saint-Louis region in Senegal and an instrumental variable approach, supported by information from focus group discussions. It finds that women's employment improves subjective well-being for the poorest women, but not for women whose household income is above the poverty threshold. Women's employment improves women's happiness through an income effect, as it leads to higher income levels and improved living standards, but the non-income effects reduce women's happiness. This negative effect is related to a higher workload and low job satisfaction due to unfulfilled expectations. The positive income effect outweighs these negative non-income effects for poor women but not for relatively wealthier women.","[Van den Broeck, Goedele; Maertens, Miet] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Earth & Environm Sci, Celestijnenlaan 200E, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Van den Broeck, G (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Earth & Environm Sci, Celestijnenlaan 200E, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium.",goedele.vandenbroeck@kuleuven.be; miet.maertens@kuleuven.be,"Maertens, Miet/A-5509-2013; Van Den Broeck, Goedele/AAD-3865-2020","Maertens, Miet/0000-0001-7245-0375; Van Den Broeck, Goedele/0000-0002-8480-3526",IWT (Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology) PhD scholarship program; KU Leuven Research Fund (Methusalem Program),IWT (Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology) PhD scholarship program; KU Leuven Research Fund (Methusalem Program),"This research was funded by the IWT (Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology) PhD scholarship program and the KU Leuven Research Fund (Methusalem Program).

In each of the counties, seven local commune governments were chosen, in which the survey was conducted using an interview questionnaire addressed to the representatives of local authorities. The results indicate that the pro-innovation activities of the surveyed local governments should be regarded as insufficient, taken in a selective and not very common manner, they rarely go beyond the standard activities. As such, they are not an effective factor in the processes of local innovation. In particular, local authorities were too little involved in building local knowledge capital. It has been shown that, in this field, it is reasonable to strengthen the institutional environment of the implementation of the LIS. Moreover, local governments insufficiently built the basis for strengthening the innovation of the selected key sectors of the local economy.

Technical efficiency (TE) scores are estimated using the output-oriented variable returns to scale (VRS) data envelopment analysis (DEA) model based on the input measures: health expenditure, labour, hospital beds and education, and the output measures: healthy life expectancy and inverse mortality index. The efficiency scores are regressed against three explanatory variables: happiness index, population density, and healthcare share of gross domestic product (GDP). The analysis involved 121 selected countries using doublebootstrap DEA as proposed by Simar, L., Wilson, P.W J Econ 136:1-34, 2007.ResultsThe bootstrap truncated regression indicates that happiness is one of the factors that contributes significantly to health system efficiency. The study also revealed that the selected health systems perform well, on average, in terms of population density and healthcare share of GDP.ConclusionsIn addition to improving the economic standard of living, policy-makers should also consider ways to increase the happiness and well-being of society. Policies focusing on well-being and happiness can lead to improved well-being and improved health outcomes, which may ultimately reduce the healthcare burden and enhance healthcare performance.","[See, Kok Fong; Yen, Siew Hwa] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Distance Educ, Econ Programme, George Town, Malaysia; [See, Kok Fong] Natl Taiwan Univ, Ctr Advancement Humanities & Social Sci, Taipei, Taiwan",Universiti Sains Malaysia; National Taiwan University,"See, KF (通讯作者)，Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Distance Educ, Econ Programme, George Town, Malaysia.;See, KF (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Ctr Advancement Humanities & Social Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.",kfsee@usm.my,"See, Kok Fong/AAF-2104-2020","See, Kok Fong/0000-0002-3536-7131",Universiti Sains Malaysia's Research University Grant [1001/PJJAUH/816268],Universiti Sains Malaysia's Research University Grant(Universiti Sains Malaysia),The project is supported by the Universiti Sains Malaysia's Research University Grant (1001/PJJAUH/816268).,,37,28,28,5,27,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

On average, students have poorer outcomes in online courses in terms of the likelihood of course completion, course completion with a passing grade, and receiving an A or B. These estimates are robust across estimation techniques, different groups of students, and different types of classes. Accounting for differences in instructor characteristics (including through the use of instructor fixed effects) dampens but does not fully explain the estimated relationships. Online course-taking also has implications for downstream outcomes, although these effects are smaller. Students are more likely to repeat courses taken online, but are less likely to take new courses in the same subject following courses taken online.","[Hart, Cassandra M.

For the first time in the literature, we bring in macroeconomic panel data for 29 OECD countries over the period 1970-2010 to test the model. To check the robustness of the results for the determinants of medical spending identified by the model, we include additional covariates in an extreme bounds analysis (EBA) framework.

Our empirical results suggest that Greece is the country with the highest level of health polarization in both periods, whereas Ireland has the lowest one when we consider countries where the median category is very good, coinciding with the findings obtained in the inequality index.

Despite the diversity of works on the issue, few analyze the changes in the US approach to dolphin protection as a result of international and domestic pressures related to the tuna-dolphin controversy. This paper seeks to understand such changes and their consequences using the process tracing method. It shows that (1) the US approach to dolphin protection passed through a process of policy change motivated by trade and diplomatic concerns mediating dolphin protection, and that (2) it was partially reversed in court as an outcome of the concessions offered to get the policy change approved. Finally, the paper argues that (3) this process led to the lock-in of the US dolphin-safe' label and to its expansion in response to recent WTO decisions.","[Cezar, Rodrigo Fagundes] Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Geneva, Switzerland",,"Cezar, RF (通讯作者)，Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Geneva, Switzerland.",rodrigo.fagundes@graduateinstitute.ch,"Cezar, Rodrigo Fagundes/AAG-1381-2020","Cezar, Rodrigo Fagundes/0000-0002-9966-9972",,,,,83,5,5,0,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,OCT,2018,17.0,4,,,,,635,663,,10.1017/S1474745617000416,0.0,,,29,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,GX1QX,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447494100004,0

In this regard, the open innovation model seems to provide efficient support for the involvement of private firms in public collaborations, by ensuring that there is efficiency and affordability in the delivery of new and 'smart' city services. This inquiry aims to fill a gap in the main field of research: only a very few studies have tried to analyse the challenges encountered, and the strategies followed, by firms developing open innovation strategies with public partners in Smart City Projects (SCPs). In trying to fill this gap, exploratory and qualitative analysis was performed on the decision-making processes of multinational companies participating in SCPs. This study uses a multiple-case research method, based on 21 in-depth semi-structured interviews with the smart city managers of seven large multinational companies. With reference to and in line with these cases, interesting predictions emerge relating to public-private collaborations and the creation of different forms of explorative and exploitative project alliances in cities. In particular, companies that develop alliances with public partners consider the open innovation model to be a testbed for future technologies and the development of products and services, by supporting positive knowledge spill-oven that reduce the technological gap between the private and the public sector and-at the same time-stimulating the development of a smart city ecosystem when firms are looking for the cross-fertilization of ideas. The research sheds light on public-private partnerships and the open innovation approach in a new and complex context, that of the smart city, reframing managerial debates concerning innovation-driven collaborations between the private and the public sector.","[Ferraris, Alberto; Santoro, Gabriele] Univ Turin, Dept Management, Corso Unione Soviet 218 Bis, Turin, Italy; [Ferraris, Alberto] Ural Fed Univ, Lab Int & Reg Econ, Grad Sch Econ & Management, Ekaterinburg, Sverdlovskaya O, Russia; [Papa, Armando] Univ Turin, Management, Via Pessinetto 12, I-10149 Turin, TO, Italy",University of Turin; Ural Federal University; University of Turin,"Papa, A (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Management, Via Pessinetto 12, I-10149 Turin, TO, Italy.",alberto.ferraris@unito.it; gabriele.santoro@unito.it; armando.papa@unito.it,"Santoro, Gabriele/AER-0191-2022; Ferraris, Alberto/K-5240-2019; Santoro, Gabriele/AAD-5804-2022","Santoro, Gabriele/0000-0002-6407-483X; Ferraris, Alberto/0000-0003-3125-1710; Santoro, Gabriele/0000-0002-6407-483X",,,,,72,50,52,0,42,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,OCT,2018,103.0,,,,SI,,51,60,,10.1016/j.futures.2018.03.012,0.0,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,GX1MR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447481900006,0

Methods: We use a full sample of administrative data from the unselected, complete German hospital population for the years 2005 to 2007. We apply regression methods to analyze the association between volume and hospital quality. We measure hospital quality with a binary variable, which indicates whether the patient has died in hospital. Using simulation techniques we examine the impact of the minimum volume regulations on the accessibility of hospital services. Results: We find a highly significant negative relationship between case volume and mortality for complex interventions at the pancreas and oesophagus as well as for knee replacement. For liver, kidney and stem cell transplantation as well as for CABG we could not find a strong association between volume and quality. Access to hospital care is only moderately affected by minimum volume regulations. Conclusion: The effectiveness of minimum volume regulations depends on the type of intervention. Depending on the type of intervention, quality gains can be expected at the cost of slightly decreased access to care.","[Mennicken, Roman] FOM Univ Appl Sci, Essen Landschaftsverband Rheinland, Cologne, Germany; [Reifferscheid, Antonius; Wasem, Juergen] Univ Duisburg Essen, Essen, Germany; [Wuebker, Ansgar] RWI RUB & Leibniz Sci Campus Ruhr, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45127 Essen, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen,"Wübker, A (通讯作者)，RWI RUB & Leibniz Sci Campus Ruhr, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45127 Essen, Germany.",Corinna.Hentschker@rwi-essen.de; Ansgar.Wuebker@rwi-essen.de,"Wasem, Juergen/AAT-8398-2021",,Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung,Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),The background study was financed by the Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung.,,34,7,7,0,0,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

It then briefly reviews the current state of the chemical and biological arms control and disarmament regime as embodied in the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) and the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) following the 2016 8th Five Year Review Conference of the BTWC and in the lead up to the 2018 4th Five Year Review Conference of the CWC. Finally, our civil society initiative to assist in achieving a successful outcome of the 2018 CWC Review Conference is described. This initiative involves the production of a multi-authored edited book, to be published in advance of the Review Conference by the UK Royal Society of Chemistry that explores many of the critical issues facing the CWC States Parties as they seek to agree effective measures to prevent the development and use of chemical weapons, as the life and chemical sciences advance.","[Crowley, Michael; Shang, Lijun; Dando, Malcolm] Univ Bradford, Bradford, W Yorkshire, England",University of Bradford,"Dando, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bradford, Bradford, W Yorkshire, England.",mrdando@bradford.ac.uk,"Shang, Lijun/AAT-8172-2020","Shang, Lijun/0000-0001-5925-5903",,,,,26,1,1,1,21,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,SEP,2018,102.0,,,,SI,,125,133,,10.1016/j.futures.2018.01.006,0.0,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,GS4ZR,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000443666900012,0

The scribe industry has grown rapidly in recent years, but relatively little is known about its impact on health-care production. I use data from a randomized experiment in which scribes were assigned to some, but not all, physician shifts in three emergency rooms over nine months. Generally, I find that scribes significantly decrease physician overtime usage, increase the number of relative value units per shift, and decrease patient wait times. The size of the benefits of scribes varies considerably based on the types of shifts worked and characteristics of the physician matched with the scribe.","[Friedson, Andrew I.] Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Denver, CO 80202 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Denver,"Friedson, AI (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Denver, CO 80202 USA.",Andrew.Friedson@ucdenver.edu,,,ScribeAmerica; Essia Health,ScribeAmerica; Essia Health,The research in this study was determined to be exempt by the Institutional Review Board of Porter Adventist Hospital (Study Number 1552) and by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Colorado Denver (Protocol Number 15-2335).

Extreme heat significantly and immediately increases hospitalizations and deaths. This finding holds irrespective of whether we employ econometric models that are standard in economics or models that are standard in epidemiology; we compare and discuss both approaches. We find evidence for partial harvesting. At the end of a 30-day window, the immediate health effects are, on average, one quarter lower, but this reduction is primarily evident for cardiovascular and neoplastic diseases.

These risks share the prospect of causing outright human extinction were they to occur. In this approach, such identified existential risks are frequently characterised by relatively singular origin events and concrete pathways of harm which directly jeopardise the survival of humanity, or undercut its potential for long-term technological progress. While this approach aptly identifies the most cataclysmic fates which may befall humanity, we argue that catastrophic 'existential outcomes' may likely arise from a broader range of sources and societal vulnerabilities, and through the complex interactions of disparate social, cultural, and natural processes many of which, taken in isolation, might not be seen to merit attention as a global catastrophic, let alone existential, risk. This article argues that an emphasis on mitigating the hazards (discrete causes) of existential risks is an unnecessarily narrow framing of the challenge facing humanity, one which risks prematurely curtailing the spectrum of policy responses considered. Instead, it argues existential risks constitute but a subset in a broader set of challenges which could directly or indirectly contribute to existential consequences for humanity. To illustrate, we introduce and examine a set of existential risks that often fall outside the scope of, or remain understudied within, the field. By focusing on vulnerability and exposure rather than existential hazards, we develop a new taxonomy which captures factors contributing to these existential risks. Latent structural vulnerabilities in our technological systems and in our societal arrangements may increase our susceptibility to existential hazards. Finally, different types of exposure of our society or its natural base determine if or how a given hazard can interface with pre-existing vulnerabilities, to trigger emergent existential risks. We argue that far from being peripheral footnotes to their more direct and immediately terminal counterparts, these Boring Apocalypses may well prove to be the more endemic and problematic, dragging down and undercutting short-term successes in mitigating more spectacular risks. If the cardinal concern is humanity's continued survival and prosperity, then focussing academic and public advocacy efforts on reducing direct existential hazards may have the paradoxical potential of exacerbating humanity's indirect susceptibility to such outcomes. Adopting law and policy perspectives allow us to foreground societal dimensions that complement and reinforce the discourse on existential risks.","[Liu, Hin-Yan; Lauta, Kristian Cedervall; Maas, Matthijs Michiel] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Law, Ctr Int Law Conflict & Crisis, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Liu, HY (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Fac Law, Ctr Int Law Conflict & Crisis, Copenhagen, Denmark.",hin-yan.liu@jur.ku.dk; kristian.lauta@jur.ku.dk; matthijs.maas@jur.ku.dk,"Maas, Matthijs/AAK-8705-2020","Maas, Matthijs/0000-0002-6170-9393; Lauta, Kristian Cedervall/0000-0002-7059-2158",,,,,102,19,20,2,22,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,SEP,2018,102.0,,,,SI,,6,19,,10.1016/j.futures.2018.04.009,0.0,,,14,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,GS4ZR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000443666900002,0

Our identification strategy relies on the quasi-random assignment of students to different class sizes based on maximum class size rules. In Germany, students are tracked into more or less academic middle school types at about age ten based, to a large extent, on academic achievement in elementary school. We mostly find no or small effects of class size in elementary school on receiving a recommendation or on the actual choice to attend the more academic middle school type. For male students, we find that an increase in class size by 10 students would reduce their chance of attending the higher school track-which more than 40% of students attend-by 3 percentage points.","[Argaw, Bethlehem A.; Puhani, Patrick A.] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Arbeitsokon, Konigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; [Puhani, Patrick A.] UCL, CReAM, London, England; [Puhani, Patrick A.] Univ St Gallen, SEW, St Gallen, Switzerland; [Puhani, Patrick A.] GLO, Bonn, Germany; [Puhani, Patrick A.] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover; University of London; University College London; University of St Gallen; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Puhani, PA (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Arbeitsokon, Konigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",puhani@aoek.uni-hannover.de,,,,,,,26,3,5,2,19,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0272-7757,1873-7382,,ECON EDUC REV,Econ.

Applying a Q-method, we explore experts' attitudes towards forest related decision-making and governance in treeline areas to reveal the attitudinal divergences that exist and analyse patterns of shared assumptions forming attitude-related communities. Experiences, trends, opportunities and challenges in European treeline area decision-making are considered. Our results reveal four attitude-related communities, representing four distinctive types of expert attitudes. Findings demonstrate a number of similarities in attitudes among experts indicating, for example, that treeline area decision-making is hardly socially innovative as it tends to happen in a top-down manner. However, some do and others don't see tree-line governance beneficial from an ecological perspective. The attitudinal heterogeneity identified offers insights into treeline decision-making and could, therefore, be useful to public decision-makers in addressing the opinions of each attitudinal group on a case-by-case basis. The general conclusions are that forest related decision-making in treeline areas requires social innovation and a high level of stakeholder competence and capacity-building; and that an improved knowledge of experts' attitudes, together with an emphasis on increased participation in decision-making, could be of help to policy and practice communities in triggering innovative changes locally.","[Nijnik, Maria] James Hutton Inst, Social Econ & Geog Sci Grp, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland; [Nijnik, Anatoliy] Environm Network Ltd, Aboyne, Scotland; [Sarkki, Simo] Univ Oulu, Thule Inst, POB 7300, Oulu 90014, Finland; [Munoz-Rojas, Jose] Univ Evora, Landscape Dynam & Social Proc, Inst Ciencias Agr & Ambientais Mediterran, Apartado 94, P-7006554 Evora, Portugal; [Miller, David] James Hutton Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland; [Kopiy, Serhiy] Ukrainian Natl Forestry Univ, Henerala Chuprynky St 103, UA-79000 Lvov, Ukraine",James Hutton Institute; University of Oulu; University of Evora; James Hutton Institute; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Ukrainian National Forestry University,"Nijnik, M (通讯作者)，James Hutton Inst, Social Econ & Geog Sci Grp, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland.",maria.nijnik@hutton.ac.uk; anijnik@yahoo.com; simo.sarkki@oulu.fi; jmrojas@uevora.pt; david.miller@hutton.ac.uk,"Muñoz-Rojas, José/AFL-0687-2022; Nijnik, Maria/AAW-4987-2020; Kopiy, Serhiy/HZH-6368-2023; Miller, David/AAX-1809-2020","Muñoz-Rojas, José/0000-0001-5331-8344; Nijnik, Maria/0000-0003-0280-9543; Kopiy, Serhiy/0000-0002-7322-7244",COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology) [633054]; Scottish Government Environment Strategic Research Programme; European Commission from the European Union's Horizon 2020 Reaserch and Innovation Programme [677622],COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology)(European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)); Scottish Government Environment Strategic Research Programme; European Commission from the European Union's Horizon 2020 Reaserch and Innovation Programme,"This article is based upon work from Cost Action ES1203 Enhancing the Resilience Capacity of Sensitive Mountain Forest Ecosystem under Environmental Change (SENSFOR) and COST Action FP1207 Orchestring forest-related policy analysis in Europe (ORCHESTRA) supported by COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology) No. 633054.

The dataset was derived from two clinical trials, the ZMILE study in the Netherlands and the SMILE study in the UK. In both studies, patients' quality of life using the EQ-5D-5L and QOLIE-31P was measured at baseline and 12 months follow-up. Spearman's correlations, effect sizes (EF) and standardized response means (SRM) were calculated for both the EQ-5D-5L and QOLIE-31P domains and sub scores. Mapping functions were derived using ordinary least square (OLS) and censored least absolute deviations models. A total of 509 patients were included in this study. Low to moderately strong significant correlations were found between both instruments. The EQ-5D-5L showed high ceiling effects and small EFs and SRMs, whereas the QOLIE-31P did not show ceiling effects and also showed small to moderate EFs and SRMs. Results of the different mapping functions indicate that the highest adjusted R (2) we were able to regress was 0.265 using an OLS model with squared terms, leading to a mean absolute error of 0.103. Results presented in this study emphasize the shortcomings of the EQ-5D-5L in epilepsy and the importance of the development of condition-specific preference-based instruments which can be used within the QALY framework. In addition, the usefulness of the constructed mapping function in economic evaluations is questionable.","[Wijnen, Ben F. M.; de Kinderen, Reina J. A.; Evers, Silvia M. A.

Cost per-participant of the entire screening CTC pathway was a,notsign196.80. Average cost per-participant for the screening invitation process was a,notsign17.04 and a,notsign9.45 for the pre-examination consultation process. Average cost per-participant of the CTC execution and reading process was a,notsign146.08 and of the diagnostic assessment colonoscopy process was a,notsign24.23. Average cost per-subject with advanced neoplasia was a,notsign3777.30. Cost of screening CTC was a,notsign196.80 per-participant. Our data suggest that the more relevant cost of screening CTC, amenable of intervention, is related to CTC execution and reading process.","[Mantellini, Paola; Grazzini, Grazia; Mallardi, Beatrice; Castiglione, Guido; Carozzi, Francesca Maria; Ventura, Leonardo; Zappa, Marco] Canc Prevent & Res Inst ISPO, Via Cosimo il Vecchio 2, I-50139 Florence, Italy; [Lippi, Giuseppe] Azienda USL Toscana Ctr, Pza S Maria Nuova 1, Florence, Italy; [Sali, Lapo; Falchini, Massimo; Mascalchi, Mario; Milani, Stefano] Univ Florence, Dept Biomed Expt & Clin Sci Mario Serio, Viale Morgagni 50, Florence, Italy; [Delsanto, Silvia] Im3D SpA, Via Livorno 60, Turin, Italy","ISPRO Istituto per lo studio, la prevenzione e la rete oncologica; University of Florence","Mantellini, P (通讯作者)，Canc Prevent & Res Inst ISPO, Via Cosimo il Vecchio 2, I-50139 Florence, Italy.",p.mantellini@ispo.toscana.it,"Ventura, Leonardo/J-9132-2016; Sali, Lapo/K-8903-2016; Lippi, Giuseppe/X-7198-2018; Carozzi, Francesca/AAB-4985-2019; zappa, marco/AAB-3294-2019; SANI, CRISTINA/J-8722-2016","Carozzi, Francesca/0000-0002-6980-8011; zappa, marco/0000-0002-6606-9786; falchini, massimo/0000-0002-1597-548X; SANI, CRISTINA/0000-0001-8955-8913; milani, stefano/0000-0002-1337-9107","Tuscany Region, Italy [2009DUA000000000089835900120000000002]","Tuscany Region, Italy","The SAVE study was funded by a grant from the Tuscany Region, Italy (POR CREO FESR 2007-2013 LINEA D'INTER-VENTO 1.1.c, SAVE project, number 2009DUA000000000089835900120000000002).

By using occupational ergonomics approach, this paper aims to examine how the Indonesian mandatory SFM certification, the so-called Pengelolaan Hutan Produksi Lestari (PHPL) positioned forestry workers in its SFM scheme. This issue is important since forestry work is a well-known profession with high occupational safety and health (OSH) risk. Content analysis on occupational ergonomics-related national policies and the mandatory PHPL Criteria and Indicators (C&I), and interviews with forest managers, PHPL auditor, and forestry workers indicate the poor performance of the instrument to assess the occupational-ergonomics-related factors at a practical level. This study reveals that PHPL is more of administrative liability obligation fulfillments rather than performance-based fulfillments (meanwhile, OSH status should be seen as an outcome of a good safety culture rather than an artifact/document). This study verifies content-overlap among the verifiers, content mismatch between the verifiers and the actual characteristic of forest operation, and the absence of distinct assessment standard. This study also discovers the existence of ergonomics holes in the PHPL C&I: (1) promoting a safe working environment for forestry workers, (2) distinct organization structural linkage on safety responsibility assignments, (3) emergency procedure, (4) distinct qualification for heavy machine operator and chemical technician, (5) sub-contract workers, and (6) the importance of management commitment and workers' participation. Revision on PHPL should seriously consider integrating OSH and wellbeing aspect as mentioned in Indonesia's national policies concerning manpower and occupational safety.","[Yovi, Efi Yuliati; Nurrochmat, Dodik Ridho] Bogor Agr Univ, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest Management, Campus IPB Dramaga, Bogor 16680, West Java, Indonesia",Bogor Agricultural University,"Yovi, EY (通讯作者)，Bogor Agr Univ, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest Management, Campus IPB Dramaga, Bogor 16680, West Java, Indonesia.",eyyovi@apps.ipb.ac.id,"Nurrochmat, Dodik Ridho/GPK-2336-2022; Yuliati, Efi/Q-3292-2019","Nurrochmat, Dodik Ridho/0000-0002-4876-8612; Yovi, Efi Yuliati/0000-0002-2741-7979","JSPS-DG-RTHE of the Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education of the Republic of Indonesia [336/IT3.11/PN/2016]","JSPS-DG-RTHE of the Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education of the Republic of Indonesia","This work was supported by a grant 336/IT3.11/PN/2016 from JSPS-DG-RTHE of the Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education of the Republic of Indonesia to the first author.",,50,18,19,3,16,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,JUN,2018,91.0,,,,SI,,27,35,,10.1016/j.forpol.2017.11.007,0.0,,,9,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GG5VL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000432763700004,0

Here we examine another potential unintended consequence of protected areas: illegal activities. We use data from Colombia to estimate the impact that protected areas had on violence perpetrated by guerrilla groups. We find protected areas that were established prior to 2002 significantly increased the number of guerrilla attacks in affected municipalities during the surge of violence in the mid-2000s. Our results are robust to the choice of estimator and numerous additional tests. We find evidence that guerrillas were using protected areas as havens to conduct their operations and that our impact estimates are largely driven by protection in the most rural areas.

To help Vietnam effectively respond to this pressing challenge, the country has recently introduced a major program for reducing carbon emissions arising from deforestation and forest degradation, fostering conservation, managing forests sustainably, and enhancing forest carbon stocks (REDD+). Current policies in Vietnam provide a sound platform for the development of REDD+, and REDD+ can potentially greatly contribute to the reduction of deforestation and forest degradation. However, these policies and the REDD+ program are hindered by limited understanding of the extent of deforestation and forest degradation and their underlying causes. This study employed geographic information system (GIS) tools, a structural regression model (structural model), and a regression tree method to quantify the extent as well as the approximate causes of deforestation and forest degradation in Vietnam. Results show that around 1.77 and 0.65 million ha of forests were lost and degraded, respectively, between 2000 and 2010. Deforestation and forest degradation were most notable in the north central, northeast, central highland, and northwest areas of the nation. There were several underlying indicators of deforestation and forest degradation including initial forest cover, per capita income, agricultural production, governance, population growth, food, and poverty. Our results illustrate several important policy implications for forest restoration and the REDD+ program in Vietnam: Vietnam should focus most strongly on reducing poverty, preserving existing forests, improving provincial-level governance, and controlling population growth.","[Quy Van Khuc; Paschke, Mark W.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Forest & Rangeland Stewardship, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Bao Quang Tran] Vietnam Natl Univ Forestry, Dept Forest Resources & Environm, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Meyfroidt, Patrick] Catholic Univ Louvain, Georges Lemaitre Earth & Climate Res Ctr, Earth & Life Inst, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium",Colorado State University; Vietnam National University of Agriculture (VNUA); Universite Catholique Louvain,"Paschke, MW (通讯作者)，Dept Forest & Rangeland Stewardship, 1472 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",mark.peschke@colostate.edu,"Khuc, Van Quy/X-2279-2019; Paschke, Mark/E-3799-2013; Meyfroidt, Patrick/G-7768-2012","Khuc, Van Quy/0000-0001-9516-2413; Paschke, Mark/0000-0002-6345-5905; Tran Quang, Bao/0000-0003-4354-9602; Meyfroidt, Patrick/0000-0002-1047-9794",Vietnam Education Foundation [F12011M],Vietnam Education Foundation,"The authors would like to acknowledge the generous support of Vietnam Education Foundation (Grant F12011M).

And yet, it is an emblematic place to observe not only elite self-segregation, but the rise of inequality as well. Based on an ongoing empirical research, this article aims to fill this gap by linking the study of elites to the analysis of social-spatial inequality. It challenges the dominant narrative that simply focuses on elite newcomers charmed by the natural beauty of the area by showing that it took considerable work to adapt local amenities to their tastes. Departing from the common image associated with St Tropez as a show-off place of conspicuous consumption, it also highlights a trend towards 'conspicuous seclusion'. All in all, the case of St Tropez reveals how elites shape their environment through the physical and symbolical power they exert over space.","[Bruno, Isabelle] Univ Lille, CNRS, Lille Ctr European Res Adm Polit & Soc CERAPS, Lille, France; [Salle, Gregory] Univ Lille, CNRS, Lille Ctr Study & Res Econ & Sociol CLERSE, Lille, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Lille; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Lille,"Bruno, I (通讯作者)，Univ Lille, CNRS, Lille Ctr European Res Adm Polit & Soc CERAPS, Lille, France.",isabelle.bruno@univ-lille2.fr,,"Salle, Gregory/0000-0002-8025-5593",,,,,64,11,13,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

We estimate the effect of past public transit investment on the demand for automobile transportation by applying an instrumental variable approach that accounts for the potential endogeneity of public transit investment, and that distinguishes between the substitution effect and the equilibrium effect, to a panel dataset of 96 urban areas across the U.S. over the years 1991-2011. The results show that, owing to the countervailing effects of substitution and induced demand, the effects of increases in public transit supply on auto travel depend on the time horizon. In the short run, when accounting for the substitution effect only, we find that on average a 10% increase in transit capacity leads to a 0.7% reduction in auto travel. However, transit has no effect on auto travel in the medium run, as latent and induced demand offset the substitution effect. In the long run, when accounting for both substitution and induced demand, we find that on average a 10% increase in transit capacity is associated with a 0.4% increase in auto travel. We also find that public transit supply does not have a significant effect on auto travel when traffic congestion is below a threshold level. Additionally, we find that there is substantial heterogeneity across urban areas, with public transit having significantly different effects on auto travel demand in smaller, less densely populated regions with less developed public transit networks than in larger, more densely populated regions with more extensive public transit networks.

These programs allow parents (and children) to choose their school. In many cases, when students opt to attend a nonlocal school, the parent is responsible for transportation. This creates a trade-off between school quality and travel expenditure. This paper estimates the value of school quality in a random utility model framework, using data on rank-ordered preferences submitted in a school choice program in Garland, Texas. I find that a standard deviation of high school quality is valued between $495 and $783, substantially lower than hedonic estimates that include noneducational benefits associated with good schools. In addition to estimating the average value of school quality, this approach can also be used to estimate the value of school quality for demographic groups or for individual students.","[Eyer, Jonathan] Univ Southern Calif, Sol Price Sch Publ Policy, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California,"Eyer, J (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Sol Price Sch Publ Policy, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",jeyer@usc.edu,,,,,,,24,2,4,0,9,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

While international experience of marketised social care has demonstrated the vulnerability of social care workers to wage theft and other violations of employment laws, Australia's relatively strong industrial relations safety net might be expected to be better able to protect these low-paid workers. Nevertheless, there is emerging evidence of negative impacts on the pay and entitlements of frontline workers in the expanding community support and homecare workforce. This study investigates the paid and unpaid work time of disability support workers under Australia's new National Disability Insurance Scheme. The research takes a novel approach combining analysis of working day diaries and qualitative interviews with employees to expose how jobs are being fragmented and work is being organised into periods of paid and unpaid time, leaving employees paid below their minimum entitlement. The article highlights the role of social care policy along with inadequate employment regulation.","[Macdonald, Fiona; Bentham, Eleanor; Malone, Jenny] RMIT Univ, Sch Management, GPO Box 2476, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Macdonald, Fiona; Bentham, Eleanor; Malone, Jenny] RMIT Univ, CPOW, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Macdonald, F (通讯作者)，RMIT Univ, Sch Management, GPO Box 2476, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",fiona.macdonald@rmit.edu.au,,"Macdonald, Fiona/0000-0001-5139-5637","Australian Research Council [DP110102963, DE160100543]; Australian Research Council [DE160100543] Funding Source: Australian Research Council",Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"This article is based is based on research funded by two Australian Research Council Projects, (DP110102963 and DE160100543), 'From Margins to Mainstream: Gender Equality and Employment Regulation' and Workforce Challenges under Cash-for-Care Models: Regulating for Quality Jobs in Flexible Care Systems'.",,41,31,31,0,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

One method used is the Delphi method. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how the Delphi method has been used in transport scenario studies and to discuss the method's methodological considerations and future potential in transport studies. The review is based on publications within transport research in which the Delphi method is used to develop future scenarios. Reflections and discussions on the Delphi method are presented and highlight three aspects: context, consensus and combining methods. By sampling experts from a wide range of backgrounds and organisations, a number of differing views are incorporated in the studies. Researchers need to consider the context of the selected experts and how it affects the possibilities for consensus. Reaching consensus may limit exploration of new innovative and radical ideas. Instead of aiming for consensus, this paper points out that a dissensus Delphi can be used in order to explore divergent ideas about the future. Finally, the Delphi method can be combined with quantitative as well as qualitative methods.","[Melander, Lisa] Chalmers Univ, Dept Technol & Management & Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden",Chalmers University of Technology,"Melander, L (通讯作者)，Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Technol Management & Econ, Vera Sandbergs Alle 8, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden.",lisa.melander@chalmers.se,"Govik, Lisa/P-1814-2015; Melander, Lisa/AAW-2419-2020","Melander, Lisa/0000-0002-9732-5957",,,,,58,40,41,1,16,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,FEB,2018,96.0,,,,,,68,78,,10.1016/j.futures.2017.11.007,0.0,,,11,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,FX4EB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426024400006,0

These acts were done for the purpose of sharing and attract no commercial value, and, hence, may not be considered as culpable criminal conduct because of the lack of intention. The Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA) introduces enhanced criminal provisions which are much harsher than the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) with a view to fight online copyright piracy. Even though the United States of America (US) have withdrawn from the Agreement, the other eleven countries are attempting to revive the Agreement, minus the US. The possibility of the Agreement being eventually implemented by the eleven-member countries is still real. This article examines two new criminal provisions introduced by the TPPA. The first is the criminalization of wilful copyright infringement even if carried out on a non-commercial basis. The second is the culpability of aiding and abetting of copyright offences. As these provisions are already in place in US law, reported judgments from the US on corresponding provisions would be examined. The article concludes with choices that Malaysia could consider in the event these two new obligations are implemented.","[Abdul Ghani Azmi, Ida Madieha] Int Univ, Civil Law Dept, Ahmad Ibrahim Kulliyyah Laws, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Lim, Heng Gee] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Law, Shah Alam, Malaysia; [San Tay, Pek; Sik, Cheng Peng] Univ Malaya, Fac Law, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",International Islamic University Malaysia; Universiti Teknologi MARA; Universiti Malaya,"Abdul Ghani Azmi, IM (通讯作者)，Int Univ, Civil Law Dept, Ahmad Ibrahim Kulliyyah Laws, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",imadieha@iium.edu.my; henggeelim@yahoo.com; tayps@uni.edu.my; sikcp@um.edu.my,"Sik, Cheng Peng/R-1317-2017; SAN, TAY PEK/B-9932-2010","Abdul Ghani Azmi, Ida Madieha/0000-0003-3124-0317",,,,,23,2,2,1,7,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Understanding the implications of this impressive presence is even more important, given that the effects of this presence during macroeconomic crises and shocks have brought again in the spotlight criticism regarding the risks of globalisation on the stability of national banking systems. Such renewed criticism could moderate the optimistic arguments of the importance of foreign banks as strategic investors, leading to the improvement of the banks' efficiency and quality of financial intermediation, lowering the cost of lending and stimulating the modernisation of banking systems. In this context, our paper examines the relationship between foreign bank assets (as a percent of the total bank assets) and certain banks' indicators, from 1996 to 2013, for several CEE countries by using fixed and random effect models with panel data. We found a positive and significant impact of foreign bank assets on the bank credit to the private sector, as percent of GDP. Likewise, an increase in the assets of foreign banks in the banking systems of CEE countries reduces the non-performing loans by 0.39 percent and the real interest rate (bank lending rate minus inflation) by 0.20 percent.","[Badulescu, Daniel; Simut, Ramona; Morutan, Radu Alin] Univ Oradea, 1 Univ Str, Oradea, Romania",University of Oradea,"Badulescu, D (通讯作者)，Univ Oradea, 1 Univ Str, Oradea, Romania.",dbadulescu@uoradea.ro; simut.ramona@yahoo.com; raalmoru@yahoo.com,"Simut, Ramona/AAN-4689-2020; Badulescu, Daniel/O-4877-2017","Badulescu, Daniel/0000-0001-8653-0149",,,,,26,0,0,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,64,73,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400007,0

This means that the comparison of the economies should be considered as a multiple-criteria analysis task. Thus, in current research multiple-criteria decision analysis method (TOPSIS) was used. The standard TOPSIS method is based on the Euclidean distance of objects from positive and negative ideal solutions. However, in the case of current research TOPSIS method with generalized distance measure GDM was used. The measure was applied due to its universality, as it can be used in the case of variables measured on the ratio scale, interval scale, the ordinal scale or the nominal scale. The analysis was conducted for the years 2005, 2010 and 2015. It was based on the Eurostat data. The method allowed to propose ranking and to group the countries into homogenous classes.

In addition, the Balkan markets show lower correlation with the US than with the EU markets. Furthermore, correlation increased during the global financial crisis and it remained high during the European sovereign debt crisis. However, there was no significant increase in correlation during the stock market instability of summer 2015. Lastly, to determine whether the transmission mechanism to the emerging Balkan markets (excluding Greece) works through the EU index and Greece, we first control the role of the EU index and document that there is no significant correlation between the US and almost all the Balkan markets (save for Turkey). Further controlling the role of Greece does not have a major impact on Balkan markets.","[Bein, Murad A.] Cyprus Int Univ, Accounting & Finance Dept, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Lefkosa, Turkey",Cyprus International University,"Bein, MA (通讯作者)，Cyprus Int Univ, Accounting & Finance Dept, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Lefkosa, Turkey.",mbein@ciu.edu.tr,"Bein, Murad Abdurahman/KBB-6401-2024","Bein, Murad Abdurahman/0000-0002-3248-4316",,,,,21,1,1,1,6,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

The aim is to present the use and advantages of this alternative method of estimating the parameters of continuous probability distribution. The objective consists in presentation of the advantages of this method over the other methods of estimation of parameters (method of L-moments and maximum likelihood method), while the basic theoretical probability distribution is represented by three-parametric lognormal curves, whose parameters are estimated. The calculation of the sample LQ-moments and the construction of the various statistical characteristics of the level, variability, skewness and kurtosis of continuous probability distribution is also an important target of this research.","[Bilkova, Diana] Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Stat & Probabil, Sq W Churchill 1938-4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Bílková, D (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Stat & Probabil, Sq W Churchill 1938-4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",bilkova@vse.cz,"Bilkova, Diana/G-3694-2017",,"Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, University of Economics, Prague, Czech Republic [IP400040]","Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, University of Economics, Prague, Czech Republic","This paper was subsidized by the funds of institutional support of a long-term conceptual advancement of science and research number IP400040 at the Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, University of Economics, Prague, Czech Republic.",,14,0,0,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,164,182,,,,,,19,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400017,0

Young people do not really want to go to work in the real sector of the economy. The personnel working in the factories are now pre-retirement or retirement age. First of all, if a company wants to provide human resources security it attracts young people transferring best practices and knowledge from generation to generation and retaining young employees in the organization. That is why it is interesting to study the experience of industrial enterprises in these matters. The article analyzes the experience of 12 industrial enterprises of the Omsk region. The source of information is the results of a survey of heads of personnel services of industrial enterprises in the Omsk region (February, 2018). The main goal of the study is to study the best practices for attracting young staff, mentoring systems and keeping young people in factories. As a result of the research, the main characteristics of the problems encountered by industrial enterprises of the Omsk region were obtained. The article presents average values that confirm the general trend in the labor market. Also, the authors review the mentoring systems, which, unfortunately, are often only formal. However, there are some exceptions. The best practices of mentoring that are identified as a result of the research are also presented in the article. In addition, the article presents the experience of personnel services regarding the retention of young employees. The basic motive for working in difficult working conditions of an industrial enterprise, as the study has confirmed, is wages. How much and how to pay to beginners? The authors give an answer to this question, based on the opinion of heads of personnel services of industrial enterprises in the Omsk region.","[Borodina, Oksana; Shavrovskaya, Marina] Dostoevsky Omsk State Univ, Mira 55-a, Omsk 644077, Russia",Dostoevsky Omsk State University,"Borodina, O (通讯作者)，Dostoevsky Omsk State Univ, Mira 55-a, Omsk 644077, Russia.",bon1979@mail.ru; marina_bel@list.ru,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,3,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,225,238,,,,,,14,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400022,0

In a knowledge-based economy, where the information is still the most important source of power, the intangible assets of the company (the intellectual capital, with its three forms human capital, relational capital and structural capital) are playing the main role in the creation, development and survival of the company on this very demanding and competitive market. Consequently, employees are seen not only as resources for the company, but as values creators, exchanging their knowledge and the information and using their abilities and skills within various networks. In the current economy, change is a constant for the organizations and combining this reality with the fast pace development of technology, virtual teams have become one of the most common solutions for many companies, especially for multinational ones. In order to find the most effective strategy to use the knowledge about the intellectual capital and its components in virtual teams' management, we review books and articles from different areas like: management, sociology, organizational psychology and law, to discover all the aspects involved in this approach. We discovered that knowledge and understanding of the human and relational capital are playing a vital role for the management of virtual teams, considering the specificity of those teams.","[Cristea, Georgiana] Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, 30A Expozitiei Blvd, Bucharest 012104, Romania",National University of Political Studies & Public Administration (SNSPA) - Romania,"Cristea, G (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, 30A Expozitiei Blvd, Bucharest 012104, Romania.",georgiana.cristea@facultateademanagement.ro,,,"Ministry of Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI [PN-III-P1-1.1-TE-2016-0232]","Ministry of Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI(Consiliul National al Cercetarii Stiintifice (CNCS)Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii (UEFISCDI))","This work was supported by a grant of Ministry of Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI, project number PN-III-P1-1.1-TE-2016-0232, within PNCDI III.",,71,0,0,0,9,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,610,620,,,,,,11,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200054,0

Extending the model to the three-country-three-factor model, we compute the probability of declining international income inequality to be 70%, while the one of rising domestic income inequality to be 70%. Subsequently, from the viewpoint of innovation, we construct the Pareto-type or log-normal type income distribution for a society. The model is constructed from the idea of dynamic population growth and successive commodity invention. It is shown that when each sector producing the newly invented commodity is possessed solely by the workers specific to that sector, the income distribution tends to follow that of the Pareto-type; when each sector is possessed by the whole workers, it tends to follow that of normal type; and finally when each sector is partly possessed by part of the workers specific to that sector, it tends to follow that of the log-normal type.

State support for the development of this type of production is being implemented, as reflected in '3 + 5' as a strategy for the development of the agrarian sector of the economy for the period until 2020. Attention is drawn to the instability of the environment, insufficient development of demand and limitations of financial resources, which hinder the realization of Ukraine's potential in this segment of the agrarian sector. The conclusion on the necessity of applying marketing strategies for promoting and marketing organic products on domestic and foreign markets is drawn.

The results explain the gender gap in union membership among compositors, but not among cigar workers. Differences in union membership varied considerably across firms, with the largest differences found in low-union-density cigar firms where indirect costs (that is, uncertainty and risk) accrued in particular to women workers. The lack of gender differences in mutual aid membership indicates that women were not hard to organize but avoided organizations associated with greater risk for employer retaliation and uncertain returns according to a cost-benefit analysis.","[Karlsson, Tobias; Stanfors, Maria] Lund Univ, Dept Econ Hist, Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Karlsson, T (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ Hist, Lund, Sweden.",Tobias.Karlsson@ekh.lu.se; Maria.Stanfors@ekh.lu.se,,,"Institute for Evaluation of Labour Market and Education Policy (IFAU) [Dnr 2012/144]; Swedish Research Council (VR) [Dnr 421-2013-671, Dnr 2014-1491]",Institute for Evaluation of Labour Market and Education Policy (IFAU)(Institute for Evaluation of Labour Market and Education Policy (IFAU)); Swedish Research Council (VR)(Swedish Research Council),"The authors acknowledge financial support from the Institute for Evaluation of Labour Market and Education Policy (IFAU) [Dnr 2012/144]; and the Swedish Research Council (VR) [Dnr 421-2013-671 and Dnr 2014-1491].

Frequently in the context of scarcity of available data and estimation, but in case of credit scoring the modelling may be required for other reasons. When a model for an ROC curve is needed, several options are available. In the article binormal, bilogistic, bigamma and bibeta models are defined, along with the novel approach: a bifractal ROC curve model. The models are tested against publicly presented empirical ROC data. As it turns out, taking into account goodness of fit, all presented models, except for the bilogistic curve, are comparable and fit the data quite well. The choice of the model should therefore be driven by other features of the curves under consideration.","[Kochanski, Blazej] Gdansk Univ Technol, Fac Management & Econ, Gdansk, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; Gdansk University of Technology,"Kochanski, B (通讯作者)，Gdansk Univ Technol, Fac Management & Econ, Gdansk, Poland.",bkochanski@zie.pg.gda.pl,,"Kochanski, Blazej/0000-0001-8502-931X",,,,,12,0,0,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,853,863,,,,,,11,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400085,0

Driven by scepticism about multilateralism and binding dispute settlement, and a growing rivalry with China, the current US administration has elevated longstanding concerns about WTO dispute settlement to new heights. The collective inability of WTO members to exercise their authority to interpret the meaning of WTO commitments has meant that the Appellate Body is not subject to any checks and balances. As other WTO members blocked US efforts to negotiate more member control led nowhere, it turned to unpopular unilateral mechanisms, culminating in the current block on new appointments. Restoring the dispute settlement system and enhancing its legitimacy will now require some changes. This might include improving mechanisms for political oversight, diverting sensitive issues from adjudication, narrowing the scope of adjudication, improving institutional support and providing members more say over certain procedures. Preserving compulsory, binding and impartial dispute settlement in the WTO will require an accommodation of different perspectives on how that system should function. Achieving this, in whatever form, will contribute to maintaining and even strengthening multilateral cooperation on trade.","[McDougall, Robert] Ctr Int Governance Innovat, Geneva, Switzerland; [McDougall, Robert] Ctr Trade & Econ Integrat, Grad Inst, Geneva, Switzerland",,"McDougall, R (通讯作者)，Ctr Int Governance Innovat, Geneva, Switzerland.;McDougall, R (通讯作者)，Ctr Trade & Econ Integrat, Grad Inst, Geneva, Switzerland.",rob@robertmcdougall.com,,,,,,,55,26,28,1,16,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Drawing from content in superhero movies and books, the authors construct games to illustrate pure-strategy Nash equilibrium, Bayes-Nash equilibrium, mixed strategies, sub-game perfection, and perfect Bayesian equilibrium. To help instructors build students' skills in finding and interpreting game solutions, they translate comic book scenarios into specific game forms; however, not all scenarios are obvious so they suggest instructors help students develop their own game-theoretic judgments to determine what game forms, payoffs, and solution concepts might be appropriate for understanding a situation.","[O'Roark, Brian] Robert Morris Univ, Econ, 6001 Univ Blvd, Moon Township, PA 15108 USA; [Grant, William] James Madison Univ, Econ, Harrisonburg, VA 22807 USA",Robert Morris University; James Madison University,"O'Roark, B (通讯作者)，Robert Morris Univ, Econ, 6001 Univ Blvd, Moon Township, PA 15108 USA.",oroark@rmu.edu,,"Grant, William/0000-0001-5101-2456",,,,,24,4,4,2,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0485,2152-4068,,J ECON EDUC,J.

The analysis was carried out on the basis of relative statistical parameters calculated by periods of crisis range in the national economy. It was found that the positive balance of labor resources was achieved due to external influx, with a significant internal outflow of the most qualified part of the labor force to regions with higher social development indicators. By natural movement of the population there is a reduction in the rate of natural loss, but no positive balance was reached. The indicators of natural movement were not related to the nature of crises in the national economy, which confirms the effectiveness of the demographic development strategy. Indicators of the standard of living of the population are more significant than the demographic indicators in reflecting the crises range in the crisis periods. The crisis of 2014 did not practically have any impact on employment indicators in contrast to the income indicators of the population, whose growth rate by 2015 was lower than 100 %.

The analysis reaffirms that gender employment gaps in the UK respond to the business cycle, and it evaluates to what extent these short-term changes in the employment gap can be explained by the industry sectors and occupations where women and men work. A counterfactual analysis accounts for the specific role of combined gender segregation across industry sectors and occupations that existed at the onset of the Great Recession. The results contradict the existing narrative that men's employment was more harshly affected than women's employment; segregation accounts for over two and a half times the actual fall in the gender gap between 2007 and 2011.","[Razzu, Giovanni] Univ Reading, Dept Econ, Reading RG6 6AA, Berks, England; [Singleton, Carl] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Econ, 30 Buccleuch Pl, Edinburgh EH8 9JT, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Reading; University of Edinburgh,"Razzu, G (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Dept Econ, Reading RG6 6AA, Berks, England.",g.razzu@reading.ac.uk; carl.singleton@ed.ac.uk,,"Singleton, Carl/0000-0001-8247-8830",Economic and Social Research Council (UK) [ES/J500136/1],Economic and Social Research Council (UK)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We would like to thank the anonymous referees for their helpful comments.

In particular, these models predict that welfare decreases if firms rapidly switch between markets. Against this background, we show that policy makers have the opportunity to stabilize markets and thus to enhance welfare by regulating interacting markets. For instance, imposing profit taxes reduces the markets' profit differentials and thus slows down the firms' market entry and exit behavior. However, these stabilization policies may also lead to undesirable side effects, such as coexistence of attractors, hysteresis effects and, in a multi-region setting, failure of policy makers to coordinate on the globally optimal policy. Moreover, regulation may be subject to the lobbying efforts of special interest groups and thus not be optimal.","[Schmitt, Noemi; Westerhoff, Frank] Univ Bamberg, Dept Econ, Bamberg, Germany; [Tuinstra, Jan] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Tuinstra, Jan] Univ Amsterdam, CeNDEF, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Otto Friedrich University Bamberg; University of Amsterdam; University of Amsterdam,"Westerhoff, F (通讯作者)，Univ Bamberg, Dept Econ, Bamberg, Germany.",frank.westerhoff@uni-bamberg.de,"Westerhoff, Frank/GSN-6357-2022; Westerhoff, Frank/F-2933-2015; Westerhoff, Frank/ABG-4984-2021","Westerhoff, Frank/0000-0003-1666-4103; Westerhoff, Frank/0000-0003-1666-4103;",,,,,40,3,3,0,1,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,978-3-319-65627-4; 978-3-319-65626-7,SPRINGER PR COMPLEX,,,2018,,,,,,,137,152,,10.1007/978-3-319-65627-4_7,0.0,,,16,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL4WU,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450927000007,0

On the basis of quarterly data for the 2000-2016 period, it has been found that the budget surplus is expansionary and anti-inflationary, with an improvement in the current account. The tightening of monetary policy, as measured by a decrease in the money supply with respect to the equilibrium trend, is associated with an improvement in the current account and a negative effect upon the output gap, while being neutral with respect to PPI. Our findings are in line with the predictions of the dependent economy model when considering the money-based expectations of the exchange rate. The evidence does indicate that a higher PPI makes a positive contribution to the current account, while there is a negative effect upon output. There is a favorable temporary effect of the current account upon the output gap, with a weak reverse causality running from the latter to the former.

The strategy is formulaic, and the net effect is a curious one, which the authors refer to as the scenario planning paradox. Contributing fresh theory supposedly attends to the dismal state of theory, while contributing new typologies purportedly helps bring order to methodological chaos. Repeated over time, the contribution strategy breaks down. Effort to resolve the theoretical and methodological issue, which motivates re-statement of the claim in the first place, ultimately fails. In actuality, the field is distanced from its purported goals. The dismal state of theory encourages scholars to adopt theory that is not necessarily tethered to a common core, which does not contribute to a shared, foundational theoretical perspective in futures studies. Perceived chaos gives way to typologies, which, as they mount, contribute to the chaos they were meant to resolve. The end result, intended by no one, is that theory remains dismal and methods remain chaotic. This direction for the field is indefensible and untenable; either the field accepts this claim as a statement of truth, for which the solution is substantially enhanced empiricism, or rejects the claim and re-interprets the bounty produced by said claim to be a kind of richness in theory and method rather than the implicit paucity, poverty, and imperfection that they oft signify to the field now.","[Spaniol, Matthew J.] Danish Maritime, Symfonivej 18, DK-2730 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Spaniol, Matthew J.] Roskilde Univ, Univ Vej 1, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Rowland, Nicholas J.] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Roskilde University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Spaniol, MJ (通讯作者)，Danish Maritime, Symfonivej 18, DK-2730 Copenhagen, Denmark.;Spaniol, MJ (通讯作者)，Roskilde Univ, Univ Vej 1, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.;Rowland, NJ (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",matt@ruc.dk; njr12@psu.edu,,"Rowland, Nicholas/0000-0003-2917-578X; Spaniol, Matthew/0000-0002-1216-4630",Den Danske Maritime Fond [2013-028]; Danish Ministry of Science Technology and Innovation [135500110B],Den Danske Maritime Fond; Danish Ministry of Science Technology and Innovation,Matthew J.

A hypothesis has been formulated that all of the samples (groups) involved in the study are from the same population and therefore share the same median. Therefore the opinions of different groups regarding selected aspects of the functioning of telecommunications market are similar. The article is grounded in the results of research carried out by diverse entities: the Office of Electronic Communications (OEC), the National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) Associations in Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC), telecommunications operators operating in Poland, and telecommunications market experts. The theoretical part of this article presents selected issues related to telecommunications regulation. This becomes the basis for the analysis of the results of our own research. The analysis is preceded by the presentation of our research methodology. The study itself was carried out by PAPI and CAPI techniques. The obtained test results were subjected to statistical processing using KruskalWallis H test and Dunn's post hoc test. The article presents several key proposals related to the regulation of the telecommunications market. The proposals concern the criteria for assessing the state of telecommunications market development, compliance of regulations with the public interest and the interests of specific groups, and the impact of regulation on competition, as well as barriers hindering cooperation between the regulator of the telecommunications market and telecommunications operators.","[Szkudlarek, Piotr] Univ Szczecin, Szczecin, Poland",University of Szczecin,"Szkudlarek, P (通讯作者)，Univ Szczecin, Szczecin, Poland.",tatus@wneiz.pl,,,,,,,35,0,0,0,2,UNIV WISMAR,WISMAR,"PHILIPP-MULLER-STRASSE 14, WISMAR, 23966, GERMANY",,,978-3-942100-56-4,,,,2018,,,,,,,284,294,,,,,,11,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BN0CA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000472641400035,0

This system is complex and not easily understandable due to the involvement of several layers of administration and legislation. The general aim of the system is that a share of income tax revenue for a municipality (system output) should be a fixed part of the total income tax yield of each municipality (system input). Tools for the scientific exploration of empirical distributions are applied to the input and output variables of the system. The main finding is that, although the critical input variables are unimodally distributed, the output variable showed a bimodal distribution. The conclusion from this finding is that the system works in two distinct states: municipalities receive either a large share or a small share of the input. Relating these states of the system to the location of the municipality a distinct east-west gradient is found. A significantly larger percentage of East-German municipalities receive in average 5% less of the taxes share. This paper focuses on the methods and tools for such type of knowledge discovery.","[Thrun, Michael C.; Ultsch, Alfred] Univ Marburg, Data Bion Res Grp, Hans Meerwein Str 6, D-35032 Marburg, Germany",Philipps University Marburg,"Thrun, MC (通讯作者)，Univ Marburg, Data Bion Res Grp, Hans Meerwein Str 6, D-35032 Marburg, Germany.",mthrun@mathematik.uni-marburg.de; ultsch@mathematik.uni-marburg.de,"Thrun, Michael/AAM-3231-2020","Thrun, Michael/0000-0001-9542-5543","German Research Foundation [BE4234/3-1, UL159/10-1]",German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"This work shows that distribution analysis of features itself allows generating insights besides being the prerequisite for cluster analysis (Thrun, 2018, pp. 16-17). Further, the correct estimation of density is crucial for estimating the pdf and improves a scatterplot significantly. The methods are exemplarily applied to Germany's complex system of allocating tax revenues. The geographical distribution of the low-quota vs. high-quota municipalities reveals an evident east-west disparity (cf. Ultsch and Behnisch, 2017, p. 29, Fig. 9). The percentage of income tax revenues which a municipality received per taxpayer depends on the location of the municipality. If the municipality is located in western Germany, the municipality could expect about 15-30%.

However, insufficient regulatory techniques, outdated financial laws, and conservative regulatory concepts make it difficult for traditional regulations based on financial intermediaries to adapt to the current environment of decentralized financial transactions. Technology-driven regulations focused on data monitoring could be a remedy for the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of traditional financial regulations and enhance effective protection of financial consumers' rights and interests.

Therefore, this article examines the role of government intervention in the evolution of the network from the perspective of network structure. After reviewing the structure of the innovation network, the author set up an evolution model of industrial cluster innovation network based on weighted scale-free network. Through computer simulations, it is learned that government intervention has a great impact on the evolution of industrial cluster innovation network. In the network formation stage, the impact of government intervention on the average shortest path exhibits as a U-shaped trend. In this stage, the government should intervene moderately to keep a short distance and close contact between the subjects. In the network stabilization stage, the effect of government intervention on the average shortest path is in the shape of an inverted U. In this case, the government should reduce the intervention, encourage enterprise innovation, and reduce the innovation risk of the whole network. The findings provide valuable reference for research in relevant fields.","[Zhong, Qi; Tang, Tang] Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Dalian 116025, Peoples R China",Dongbei University of Finance & Economics,"Zhong, Q (通讯作者)，Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Dalian 116025, Peoples R China.",593351446@qq.com,,,,,,,38,19,21,5,70,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

According to the way long-lasting development is understood, as well as the application of the concept, there can be a long-lasting development politics where consumption and production are done by preserving the resources and qualities of the environment. In 1992, at Rio de Janeiro decided to lay the grounds of a long-lasting development commission as a UNO organism in order to implement the measures comprised by Agenda 21. Nowadays, economic growth ca be achieved only as an economic-ecological growth based on a multi energetically consume and on a superior energy and material recycling, in which humans should respect nature's laws and be aware of the capacity of reproduction. A national strategy of lasting economic-social development should consider the services as a priority sector, able to develop and redress the Romanian economy in the context of its integration in the European Union. Environmental conservation strategies should be accepted on a global scale, and people should start thinking about a significant reduction in energy consumption without sacrificing comfort. In other hand, with current technology available, the global destruction of the environment could be stopped. In fact, Romania evolved from a very poor country until 2000 to a poor country until the EU accession and then to a not so poor country since 2007, but this achievement didn't help much in reducing widespread poverty. Last year, Romania outpaced Greece in GDP size for the first time in decades, to become the biggest economy in the Balkans. Integrating sustainable development goals at the heart of economic activities involves changing patterns of production and consumption. This change can be done through regulations, taxation, legal decisions, requests from the public.","[Zota, Elena Florentina] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 7 Aleea Valea Viilor,Dist 6, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Zota, EF (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 7 Aleea Valea Viilor,Dist 6, Bucharest, Romania.",elena.zota@rocketmail.com,,,,,,,13,1,1,0,4,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,75,85,,,,,,11,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200007,0

While most previous research focuses on China's regional disparities measured using provincial data, this article investigates intra-provincial disparities which reflect the dispersion among cities within a given province. Using data on 282 prefecture-level cities in 25 provinces from 2003 to 2012, the relationship between economic disparity and financial disparity is investigated, after which the effects of the intra-provincial disparities on provincial economic growth are examined. It is found that intra-provincial financial disparity and economic disparity are positively correlated. The results also show that intra-provincial economic disparity has no effect on provincial economic growth. The intra-provincial financial disparity, however, has a negative effect on the local economic growth rate. Therefore, developing financial inclusion and narrowing financial disparity are important measures to maintain sustainable and inclusive economic growth.","[Zou, Ke; He, Jing] Hunan Univ, Coll Finance & Stat, CN-410079 Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Zou, Ke] Guangdong Univ Finance, Key Lab Technol Finance, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Hunan University; Guangdong University of Finance,"He, J (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ, Coll Finance & Stat, CN-410079 Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.",hejing@hnu.edu.cn,,"he, jing/0000-0002-5641-5155; zou, ke/0000-0002-5513-8408",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China in Hunan University [531107050178]; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Technology and Finance & Big Data Analysis [2017B030301010],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China in Hunan University; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Technology and Finance & Big Data Analysis,The authors acknowledge the support from the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China (531107050178) in Hunan University and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Technology and Finance & Big Data Analysis (2017B030301010).,,35,12,12,4,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The aim of this study was to develop a statistical model to test the correlation between utilisation and possible determinants in selected European countries. A sample of 31 medicines for cancer treatment that obtained EU-wide marketing authorisation between 2000 and 2012 was selected. Annual data on medicines' utilisation covering the in- and out-patient public sectors were obtained from national authorities between 2008 and 2013. Possible determinants of utilisation were extracted from HTA reports and complemented by contacts with key informants. A longitudinal mixed effect model was fitted to test possible determinants of medicines utilisation in Belgium, Scotland and Sweden. In the all-country model, the number of indications reimbursed positively correlated with increased consumption of medicines [one indication 2.6, 95% CI (1.8-3.6); two indications 2.4, 95% CI (1.4-4.3); three indications 4.9, 95% CI (2.2-10.9); all P < 0.01], years since EU-wide marketing authorisation [1.2, 95% CI (1.02-1.4); p < 0.05], price per DDD [0.9, 95% CI (0.998-0.999), P < 0.01], and Prescrire rating [0.5, 95% CI (0.3-0.9), P < 0.05] after adjusting for time and other covariates. In this study, the most important correlates of increased utilisation in a sample of cancer medicines introduced in the past 15 years were: medicines coverage and time since marketing authorisation. Prices had a negative effect on consumption in Belgium and Sweden. The positive impact of financial MEAs in Scotland suggests that the latter may remove the regressive effect of list prices on consumption.","[Ferrario, Alessandra] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Social Policy, London, England; [Ferrario, Alessandra] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, LSE Hlth, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Ferrario, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Social Policy, London, England.;Ferrario, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, LSE Hlth, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",a.ferrario@lse.ac.uk,,"Ferrario, Alessandra/0000-0002-1572-3581",,,,,29,1,2,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

In the face of these factors, we derive conditions for a feasible bond scheme and the amount of additional insurance a landowner can ask from a harvester in the form of a higher than strictly needed bond payment. We then determine the effect of confiscation risk on the feasibility of bond schemes, with this risk stemming from the presence of a corrupt inspector and taking the form of either collusive or non-collusive corruption. We show that confiscation risk can seriously limit the range of possible bond payments and the effects differ between the corruption types. An empirical example evaluates these results in the context of enforcement of reduced impact logging techniques in tropical concession management. The results will help governments better apply bond schemes and in particular adjust them in the presence of risks and external constraints.","[Kuusela, Olli-Pekka] Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Engn Resources & Management, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Amacher, Gregory S.] Virginia Tech, Dept Forest Resources & Environm Conservat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Moeltner, Klaus] Virginia Tech, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Oregon State University; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Kuusela, OP (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Engn Resources & Management, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",olli-pekka.kuusela@oregonstate.edu,,"Kuusela, Olli-Pekka/0000-0003-3878-5440","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture, McIntire Stennis project [1009830]","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture, McIntire Stennis project","This material is based upon work that is supported by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture, McIntire Stennis project under 1009830.

To determine the extent to which financial constraints justify the reluctance of Indonesian forest industries to intensify their silviculture at operational scales, we develop a series of scenarios to compare the financial viability of enrichment planting along cleared lines through twice logged forest (TPTJ) with the common practice of selective logging alone (TPTI). Because TPTJ also increases carbon stocks relative to the logged-only option, we consider carbon payments in some scenarios. With a discount rate of 6% and a cutting cycle of 30 years, TPTJ yields higher net present values (NPVs) than TPTI (US$442 vs $145/ha, respectively). TPTJ still provides higher NPVs than TPTI with discount rates up to 8% and cutting cycles of 25-30 years. With carbon payments of US$9.6/Mg CO2e, TPTJ maintains a positive NPV with discount rates up to 13%. In contrast, TPTI has positive NPVs with discount rates up to 12% with cutting cycles of 25-30 years. At all discount rates with positive NPVs, TPTJ yields higher NPVs than TPTI for all comparisons with equal cutting cycle durations (US$69-3,370/ha vs. US$68-393/ha). Given its substantial impacts on forest structure and composition, the more intensive TPTJ treatment should be implemented in only small and appropriately selected portions of managed landscapes.","[Ruslandi; Romero, C.; Putz, F.

Data was collected through the random sampling method in all the ten regions of Ghana. A probit estimation with marginal effects was adopted to examine the factors influencing the willingness and the likelihood while the generalized Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition was used to examine the extent to which individual characteristics influence the acceptance gap between high income and low-income earners. Our results indicated that, at the individual level, high income, being employed, awareness and smaller household size were the significant factors influencing the willingness and the likelihood to accept capitation. We also observed that the acceptance gap between high income and low-income earners was largely influenced by unexplained factors other than individual characteristics of high income earners. Since the willingness and the likelihood to accept capitation are mixed across regions and largely dependent on high incomes, the intention to roll out and implement the capitation system should be as a complementary payment system to the already existing one, being the diagnosis related grouping. We recommend that the current payment system, the diagnosis-related-grouping be maintained and complemented with capitation while measures to reduce, if not eliminate, the abuse associated with it be put in place.","[Sackey, Frank Gyimah; Amponsah, Peter N.] Catholic Univ, Coll Ghana, Sunyani, Ghana",,"Sackey, FG (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ, Coll Ghana, Sunyani, Ghana.",franksackey@yahoo.com,"Sackey, Frank Gyimah/AAE-6367-2021","Sackey, Frank Gyimah/0000-0002-6412-2678",,,,,20,9,10,0,2,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

Policymakers are faced with choices on the implementation of a specific cost sharing design. One of the guiding principles in this decision process could be which design leads to the strongest CCI. Despite the vast amount of literature on the effects of cost sharing, the relative effects of specific cost sharing designs-e.g., a traditional deductible versus a doughnut hole-will mostly be absent for a certain context. This papers aims at developing a simulation model to approximate the relative effects of different deductible modalities on the CCI. We argue that the CCI depends on the probability that healthcare expenses end up in the deductible range and the expected healthcare expenses given that they end up in the deductible range. Our empirical application shows that different deductible modalities result in different CCIs and that the CCI under a certain modality differs across risk-groups.","[Cattel, D.; van Kleef, R.

A large literature estimates these returns, often carefully addressing issues such as selection into wage employment and endogeneity in terms of completed schooling. There has been much less exploration of whether the estimates of Mincerian returns depend on how information about wage work is collected. Relying on a survey experiment in Tanzania, this paper finds that estimates of the returns to education vary by questionnaire design, but not by whether the information on employment and wages is self-reported or collected by a proxy respondent. The differences derived from questionnaire type are substantial, varying from higher returns of 5 percentage points among the most well educated men to 16 percentage points among the least well educated women. These differences are at magnitudes similar to the bias in ordinary least squares estimation, which receives considerable attention in the literature. The findings demonstrate that survey design matters in the estimation of returns to schooling and that care is needed in comparing across contexts and over time, particularly if the data are generated through different surveys.

Managing coral catastrophe,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Coral management; Anticipating bleaching; Catastrophe governance; Calculability; Resilience; Climate change,RESILIENCE; FUTURE; CRISIS,"Corals have recently emerged as both a sign and a measure of the imminent catastrophic future of life on earth and, as such, have become the focus of intense conservation management. Bleached! draws on in-depth interviews and participatory observations with coral scientists and managers to explore the management of the corals' ecological catastrophe to come. The article starts by describing the unique life of corals, the importance of calculability in catastrophe management, and the coral scientists' preoccupation with classifying, counting, and seeing in their attempt to comprehensibly monitor corals and anticipate their decline. Algorithmic models and elaborate temporal analyses are central to this governmental project of knowing bleaching. What happens after such bleaching events are foreseen is the topic of my next exploration, which highlights the emergence of yet more monitoring as the central coral conservation action in the face of the looming catastrophe. The resilience concept is of growing importance in the world of coral management. Since it underlines unpredictability and nonlinearity, resilience as well seems to fly in the face of any anticipatory action, instead scientifically justifying forms of inaction. Finally, Bleached! discusses the heated debates among coral scientists about whether to focus present actions on buying time for corals, or whether the only way to prevent or limit imminent coral catastrophe is to deal directly with the elephant in the room: the global regulation of climate change. I argue that, in the case of corals at least, scientific knowledge is not power. Quite the contrary, the real political story here seems to lie in the ways in which scientists' knowledge is neutralized and prevented from having political effects, such that it does not lead to anticipatory action to restore the ecological order. As one of the prominent coral scientists I interviewed for this project put it: current conservation efforts are akin to reorganizing the chairs on the Titanic, rather than to changing the ship's deadly course.

Their main task has been to identify economic and non-economic sources of well-being to define policies aimed at maximising happiness in nations. As yet, it has not been precisely explained why happiness economics' is actually a part of economic science. In this article, we show that happiness can be an economic concept providing a critical review of the literature on (a) economic applications of happiness data and (b) economic consequences of happiness. Happiness data have been used to analyse microeconomic phenomena and to value non-market goods. Happiness may act as a determinant of economic outcomes: it increases productivity, predicts one's future income and affects labour market performance. A growing number of happiness studies indicate a role of personality traits in understanding the link between well-being and economic outcomes.","[Piekalkiewicz, Marcin] Univ Siena, Siena, Italy",University of Siena,"Piekalkiewicz, M (通讯作者)，Univ Siena, Dept Econ & Stat, Piazza San Francesco 7, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",marcin.piekalkiewicz@gmail.com,,,,,,,99,24,26,3,60,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Due to the long-term nature of forest investment, forest managers must integrate risks and uncertainties into their decisions. Our objective is to build a decision support tool to optimize forest management under multiple risks: extreme events and price variations. Our method integrates, into an economic model, different types of models on forest growth, price functions, predicted storm intensity and intervals, and damage functions. A numerical simulation applied to European beech (Fagus sylvatica) in Northwestern France shows that price variation as between 1974 and 2016 produces higher economic loss than does storm damage. We conclude on the need to concentrate forest policy on the development of new technologies and wood industry practices to increase the value of this natural resource. However, future climate change may well influence storm frequency and intensity, and this places limits on our conclusions.","[Rakotoarison, Hanitra] ONF, RDI Dept, Blvd Constance, F-77300 Fontainebleau, France; [Loisel, Patrice] Univ Montpellier, Montpellier SupAgro, INRA, MISTEA, Montpellier, France",INRAE; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Universite de Montpellier,"Rakotoarison, H (通讯作者)，ONF, RDI Dept, Blvd Constance, F-77300 Fontainebleau, France.",hanitra.rakotoarison@onf.fr; patrice.loisel@inra.fr,,,"Economic, Human and Social Science Researchers Network of Ecofor [ECOFOR 2012-24]","Economic, Human and Social Science Researchers Network of Ecofor","This research received financial support from the Economic, Human and Social Science Researchers Network of Ecofor, (grant number ECOFOR 2012-24).

Most of Slovenian forest is owned by SPFOs. To understand why these forest estates are relatively poorly managed, the owners' values and objectives were analysed. We conducted a questionnaire-based survey (n=387) and based our typology on three values and four management variables. The typology was constructed automatically, using the k-medoids clustering algorithm. Clustering resulted in two clusters, which were our basis for two types of owners: engaged and detached. We analysed these two types through socio-economic and broader geo-spatial perspectives. We found that multi-objective orientation and high valuation of production function are positively related to active forest management and to the likelihood that the forest will be managed in the future. Conversely, higher value to environmental and social function corresponds to lower management levels. Spatial patterns of owners residencies and forest estates influence managing decisions. Results confirm the importance of spatial factors and owner values and objectives for understanding forest management. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Patients (>= 18 years old) were identified from the Premier Research Database of US hospitals if they had any of the following types of elective surgical resections between 1/2008 and 12/2014: lung lobectomy, lower anterior resection of the rectum (LAR), liver wedge resection, or total hysterectomy. Cancer status was determined based on ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes. Operating room time (ORT), length of stay (LOS), and total hospital costs, as well as frequency of bleeding and infections during hospitalization were evaluated. The impact of cancer status on outcomes (from a hospital perspective) was evaluated using multivariable generalized estimating equation models; analyses were conducted separately for each resection type. Results: Among the identified patients who underwent surgical resection, 23 858 (87.9% with cancer) underwent lung lobectomy, 13 522 (63.8% with cancer) underwent LAR, 2916 (30.0% with cancer) underwent liver wedge resection and 225 075 (11.3% with cancer) underwent total hysterectomy. After adjusting for patient, procedural, and hospital characteristics, mean ORT, LOS, and hospital cost were statistically higher by 3.2%, 8.2%, and 9.2%, respectively for patients with cancer vs. no cancer who underwent lung lobectomy; statistically higher by 6.9%, 9.4%, and 9.6%, respectively for patients with cancer vs. no cancer who underwent LAR; statistically higher by 4.9%, 14.8%, and 15.7%, respectively for patients with cancer vs. no cancer who underwent liver wedge resection; and statistically higher by 16.0%, 27.4%, and 31.3%, respectively for patients with cancer vs. no cancer who underwent total hysterectomy. Among patients who underwent each type of resection, risks for bleeding and infection were generally higher among patients with cancer as compared to those without cancer. Conclusions: In this analysis, we found that patients who underwent lung lobectomy, lower anterior resection of the rectum (LAR), liver wedge resection or total hysterectomy for a cancer indication have significantly increased hospital resource utilization compared to these same surgeries for benign indications.","[Kalsekar, Iftekhar; Yadalam, Sashi; Yoo, Andrew] Johnson & Johnson, 1Med Devices Epidemiol, New Brunswick, NJ 08933 USA; [Hsiao, Chia-Wen; Cheng, Hang; Chen, Brian Po-Han; Goldstein, Laura] Ethicon Inc, Franchise Hlth Econ & Market Access, Cincinnati, OH USA",Johnson & Johnson; Johnson & Johnson USA,"Kalsekar, I (通讯作者)，Johnson & Johnson, 1Med Devices Epidemiol, New Brunswick, NJ 08933 USA.",ikalseka@its.jnj.com,,"yoo, andrew/0000-0001-7208-3587",Johnson Johnson,Johnson Johnson(Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson USA),"This research and preparation of this manuscript was supported by Johnson & Johnson.

The staggered introduction of the policy measure creates a credible natural experiment and a natural control group for births and air pollution measurements in cities that enact low emission zones. I show that the introduction of the most restrictive type of low emission zone decreases average levels of fine particulate matter by about 4 percent and by up to 8 percent at a city's highest-polluting monitor. Low emission zones also reduce the number of days per year on which legal pollution limits are exceeded by three. However, these reductions are too small to translate into substantial improvements in infant health. My results are not driven by changes in maternal or city specific characteristics, and are robust to variations in specification and to the choice of control group. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, little is known about the magnitude of non-market benefits of afforestation and how these benefits spatially differ. In this article, we propose a novel method to spatially explicitly predict marginal willingness to pay for afforestation. The approach is illustrated with data from a discrete choice experiment on local land use changes in Germany. GIS data on the respondent's place of residence allows inferring their current endowment with forest, which enters the utility specification of each respondent's status quo alternative. Marginal willingness to pay estimates therefore represent the value of changes in local forest cover relative to the observed status quo. This relationship can be utilized to predict willingness to pay at the county level. We find that marginal willingness to pay decreases as the current endowment with forest increases.

It is key to Swedish forest politics and used to capture the essence of a sustainable way of managing forests. However, the ideas, institutions and practices comprising the model have not been comprehensively analyzed previously. Addressing this knowledge gap, we use frame analysis and a Pathways approach to investigate the underlying governance model, focusing on the way policy problems are addressed, goals, implementation procedures, outcomes and the resulting pathways to sustainability. We suggest that the institutionally embedded response to pressing sustainability challenges and increasing demands is expansion, inclusion and integration: more of everything. The more-of-everything pathway is influenced by ideas of ecological modernization and the optimistic view that existing resources can be increased. Our findings suggest that in effect it prioritizes the economic dimension of sustainability. While broadening out policy formulation it closes down the range of alternative outputs, a shortcoming that hampers its capacity to respond to current sustainability challenges. Consequently, there is a need for a broad public debate regarding not only the role of forests in future society, but also the operationalization of sustainable development. (C) 2015 The Authors.

In this article, we propose that different degrees of uncertainty require different bases of trust. We distinguish between three different forms of trust production (process-based, characteristics-based and institution-based) and develop hypotheses regarding their relative effectiveness under low versus high levels of product and performance uncertainty. Using survey data on 392 interorganizational buyer-seller relationships, we find support for our position that a high degree of uncertainty favours process-based trust production, whereas characteristics-based trust production is relatively more effective when uncertainty is low. The effectiveness of institution-based trust production is not significantly affected by uncertainty. We derive implications for organizational trust production under different degrees of uncertainty, which should encourage new research on trust.","[Schilke, Oliver] Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Wiedenfels, Gunnar] ProSiebenSat 1 Media AG, D-85774 Unterfohring, Germany; [Brettel, Malte] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, D-52056 Aachen, Germany; [Zucker, Lynne G.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of Arizona; RWTH Aachen University; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Zucker, LG (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",zucker@ucla.edu,"Schilke, Oliver/AAJ-8217-2021; Schilke, Oliver/GSI-6840-2022; Zucker, Lynne G/C-1467-2008","Schilke, Oliver/0000-0001-6832-1677; Schilke, Oliver/0000-0001-6832-1677;",,,,,119,14,17,1,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

This study adopts a three-round dissensus-based Delphi approach in order to explore our key research question of how the pulp and paper industry may change strategically, and what is the potential for value creation in the year 2030. According to our expert panel, the main drivers of competitiveness in 2030 will include energy and material efficiency, sustainability, as well as new innovations in products to serve customer needs better. According to the projected 2030 scenario, the pulp and paper industry will produce more diversified products, focus on higher value-added, and aim at consumer segments with higher environmental awareness. On average, 40 percent of the turnover will according to the panel come froth genuinely new products. Strategic cross-sectorial partnerships will have a key role in making this big leap, while simultaneously acknowledging the changing needs of sustainability-conscious customers and other stakeholders.

The technological regime of sectors affects the chance for latecomers to catch up, but the final outcomes also depend on the actions of governments and firms. A successful catch-up requires the growth of indigenous firms rather than dependence on foreign direct investment. The government has an important role, but different forms of intervention across sectors must be identified. For firms, adopting a path-following strategy does not bring ultimate success, whereas leapfrogging is often required. Any uniqueness in the catch-up pattern of China can be attributed to its large size leading to bargaining power in technology transfer.

This study more widely discusses the effects of economic globalization on forest transition, and explores the links between trade, adjustment of trade structure, FDI and forest transition in nine Asian countries. The study also expands the scope of forest transition study and integrates the analysis of both forest quantity and quality change in forest transition research. The result suggests that the proportion of forestry products in total exports has significantly negative effects on forest area, forest volume and forest density, while tilt total export value has positive effects on forest area and forest density. It indicates that one country or region may improve forest resources condition through upgrading the export structure by absorbing FDI in manufacturing and service sectors to develop export-oriented manufacturing and service industries. This study demonstrates the need to introduce forest quality analysis in forest transition study. It also indicates that When exploring the relationship between economic globalization and forest transition, one should consider the overall situations how one country participates in economic globalization and the development and adjustment of its industries in the process of economic integration.

Such spatialized scenarios and their implications allow societies to reduce the uncertainty of the future by exploring various strategies for land use changes. Despite the wide diversity in existing scenario-building techniques, two different approaches can be distinguished (exploratory vs. normative) for their methodological implications. The originality in this study comes from the use of a relevant exploratory (dynamic) approach to map normative scenarios which, in most cases, are represented throughout the combination of narratives and synchronic land use and cover maps. The objective of the article is to apply this dynamic exploratory simulation approach to spatialize normative scenarios within the framework of forest management in southern Chile.

This paper offers a case study of an experiential futures/design fiction project co-created with workshop participants at the inaugural Emerge festival, an explicitly futures-themed hybrid arts and science event staged at Arizona State University in the city of Phoenix in 2012. The People Who Vanished was a live intervention, via performance and associated artifacts created for the occasion, reflecting on a possible future for the Phoenix area. The workshop's compressed timeline prompted the authors to create for participants a basic framework for producing experiential scenarios.

Some researchers believe that self-awareness is an emergent property of a complex neural network. If this is so, then high self-awareness should appear when a neural network approaches the complexity of the human brain (.90 billion neurons and 10(14) synapses). If one takes a much broader view and considers all of humanity as a neural network, then today there are similar to 7 billion individual human elements, of whom similar to 3 billion are interconnected via computers, smart phones, tablets, and the Internet. By morphological analogy, as human interconnectivity continues to grow and strengthen, eventually humanity will approach similar to 70 billion interconnected humans, at which point we will become highly self-aware as a single human super-organism. This organismal selfawareness may manifest itself as the elimination of wars, hunger, and strife, and as the collaboration of all individual elements working together for the greater good of humanity. It is projected that this organismal self-awareness will occur between the years 2400 and 2600. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Modeling the supply of this material with spatially-explicit potential demand locations allows for a realistic analysis of the feasibility of such a market to stimulate rural development. We model multiple scenarios for the utilization of harvest residues within the current forest products market in western Oregon. Sensitivity analysis explored the effects of cost of the depots on feasibility, including. policy designed to support depot establishment through subsidies. Scenarios were also used to assess the effects of increases in federal harvest activities. Results suggest that with relatively high biomass prices, there is some potential for investment in depots to aid rural communities in western Oregon, but there is little change in either the overall feasibility or the location of depot establishment under scenarios of increased federal harvest.

In Italy, cultural factors and low availability of formal childcare services define gender roles that are generally based on the male breadwinner model, in which childcare is almost completely entrusted to women. The analysis is carried out through an extension of the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition and is based on data from the 2007 Italian National Institute for Workers' Professional Development (ISFOL). The results are consistent with gender discrimination on wages and suggest that women's occupational paths are often an outcome of limited choices, and that women's unpaid domestic work negatively interferes with the energy women can put into paid work. These findings support the need to ensure gender equality in and out of the labor market, especially through deep changes in Italian social norms and through the development of formal childcare.","[Cutillo, Andrea] Italian Natl Inst Stat ISTAT, Directorate Social Stat & Populat Census, Via Cesare Balbo 6, I-00184 Rome, Italy; [Centra, Marco] Italian Inst Workers Profess Dev ISFOL, Labor Market Dept Corso Italia 33, I-00198 Rome, Italy",,"Cutillo, A (通讯作者)，Italian Natl Inst Stat ISTAT, Directorate Social Stat & Populat Census, Via Cesare Balbo 6, I-00184 Rome, Italy.",cutillo@istat.it; m.centra@isfol.it,,,,,,,41,30,31,4,51,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

This article focuses on understanding the marketing of seafood products in grocery retail stores with special emphasis on four major southern aquaculture products (catfish, shrimp, clams and crawfish). The study used store-based as well as household-based scanner data from the Nielsen Company. Results show that frozen/chilled finfish sales (in value) are increasing faster than total frozen seafood sales. Shrimp is the major type of frozen seafood sold in the United States. Among unbreaded finfish, tilapia, whiting, salmon, catfish and flounder occupied the top five ranks in terms of cumulative 5-year sales from 2005-06 to 2009-10. The share of tilapia in retail markets has risen consistently and steeply over the years. Sales performance of products in a market is correlated positively with the degree of promotional pricing given to that product. The study found that the U.S. aquaculture industry needs to develop market-specific strategies to gain further market share in retail stores.

Our case is the accommodation of citizens with disabilities during the voting process in Denmark. Here disability makes explicit how Danish democracy is produced as disability rubs up against implicit, normalized and mundane infrastructures and practices. We investigate disability as critique in this sense of affording a both analytic and practical 'breakup'. To do so, we promote a 'compositionist' post-actor-network theory approach to disability and to polling and investigate what entry-point for critique this offers. We analyze an incident at a polling booth during the 2013 Danish Municipal election. This renders visible some of the complex socio-material processes through which citizens and the Danish state co-enact and co-authorize one another. We highlight how 'detachments' are vital to such processes and we examine parts of the historical background for the production of authority in the context of managing disability as exception during polling. In doing so we point out that as the organization of electoral processes evolves, new potentialities for infra-critique also emerge.","[Gad, Christopher; Dalsgaard, Steffen] Univ Copenhagen, IT, Technol Practice Res Grp, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Gad, C (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, IT, Technol Practice Res Grp, Copenhagen, Denmark.",chga@itu.dk,,,Danish Council for Strategic Research [10-092309],Danish Council for Strategic Research(Danske Strategiske Forskningsrad (DSF)),This work was supported by The Danish Council for Strategic Research [10-092309].,,47,4,5,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

We analyze the type of firms and financial environments that are associated with a relatively more intense use of financial credit and, consistent with the mainstream literature, we find that trade credit financing is chosen by firms that have more restricted access to financial credit.

The system is formulated for the twin objective of fish growth and plant fertilization to maximize the benefits by optimal and efficient use of resources from aquaculture. The state equations, basically mass balances, required by the optimization algorithms are given in the form of differential equations for the number of fish in the stock, their average weight as mediated through metabolism and appetite, the water recirculation and waste treatment, hydroponic nutrient requirements and their loss functions. Six parameters, that is, water temperature, flow rate, stock density, feed ration size per fish, energy consumption rate and the quality of food (percentage of digestible proteins) are used to control the system under dynamic conditions. The time to harvest is treated as a static decision variable that is repeatedly adjusted to find the profit-maximizing solution. By modeling the complex interactions between the economic and biological systems, it is possible to obtain the most efficient decisions with respect to diet composition, feeding rates, harvesting time and nutrient releases. Some sample numerical results using data from a tilapia-tomato farm are presented and discussed.","[Karimanzira, Divas; Rauschenbach, Thomas] Fraunhofer IOSB AST, Dept Surface Water & Maritime Syst, Ilmenau, Germany; [Keesman, Karel] Wageningen Univ, Dept Biobased Chem & Technol, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Kloas, Werner] Humboldt Univ, Inst Biol, Dept Endocrinol, Berlin, Germany; [Baganz, Daniela] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Biol & Ecol Fishes, Berlin, Germany",Wageningen University & Research; Humboldt University of Berlin; Leibniz Institut fur Gewasserokologie und Binnenfischerei (IGB),"Karimanzira, D (通讯作者)，Fraunhofer IOSB AST, Dept Surface Water & Maritime Syst, Ilmenau, Germany.",divas.karimanzira@iosb-ast.fraunhofer.de,,"Baganz, Daniela/0000-0002-0876-9100",EU FP7-ENV-WATER-INNO-DEMO,EU FP7-ENV-WATER-INNO-DEMO,The authors of this study acknowledge the financial support of the EU FP7-ENV-2013-WATER-INNO-DEMO and the technical support of all the INAPRO project partners.,,24,19,21,1,77,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

Through the evolutionary process, changing the way of functioning, the European Union has gradually evolved into a powerful integration in transition between an international organization and a transnational community promoting peace, preserving freedom, security and justice without internal frontiers, establishing the Internal Market and promoting sustainable development while promoting economic, social and territorial cohesion. However, the current withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union has created an atmosphere of insecurity and skepticism that has gradually shifted to aversion over the prevailing policy and all levels of European institutions. In this respect, the accession countries of the European Union have been particularly vulnerable, which have begun to re-examine the relevance of the European project in new circumstances and consequently to formulate priorities dictating the pace of the reform of harmonization. In accordance with the above mentioned issue, the purpose of this paper is to examine the challenges of the European Union after the process of breaking up with the United Kingdom. Approach to European integration as a subject of research in this paper has been holistic, and its complexity has undergone qualitative research, starting with defined research goals. Thus, the implications of Brexit on the acceding countries of the European Union were analyzed and the relevance of the current EU model of functioning after Brexit was examined. The results of the research have shown that Brexit is the occasion for a deep analysis of the principles of action of the European Union, which, faced with new challenges, must be adaptive and ready for new changes. At the same time, the results confirmed the need to continue the enlargement of the European Union to the accession countries, regardless of Brexit. The results of this research can contribute to the advancement of existing knowledge and wider understanding of the European integration phenomena and the policy of its expansion at a contemporary moment.","[Licul, Ivana] Univ Rijeka, Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management, Rijeka, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Licul, I (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management, Rijeka, Croatia.",ivana.licul@fthm.hr,"Licul, Ivana/T-4170-2018","Licul, Ivana/0000-0001-8238-8317",,,,,33,0,0,0,6,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,618,627,,,,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6MR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426857700067,0

The author argues that globalization has promoted an increasing fragmentation of production, that is, in a dynamic economic efficiency and open trade environment, much of manufacturing today is trade in components from different sources, and seeking to produce all of them locally would be contrary to division of labour and undermines the very existence of the WTO's mandate to preserve the basic principles and to further the overriding objectives underlying the multilateral trading system, which is to reduce barriers to trade and to the elimination of discriminatory treatment in international trade relations. Therefore, a key distinction in thinking about policy is that as an instrument of government policy the patent working requirement is, on its own, insufficient, less prudence and not the smartest route to secure rapid socio-economic growth, as countries have more to lose from a confrontational scenario of implementing patent working requirements, and more to gain when they join the global supply chain to exploit its numerous opportunities.","[Manu, Thaddeus] Queen Mary Univ London, Ctr Commercial Law Studies, London WC2A 3JB, England; [Manu, Thaddeus] Univ Hertfordshire, Sch Law Criminol & Polit Sci, Hatfield AL10 9EU, Herts, England",University of London; Queen Mary University London; University of Hertfordshire,"Manu, T (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Ctr Commercial Law Studies, London WC2A 3JB, England.;Manu, T (通讯作者)，Univ Hertfordshire, Sch Law Criminol & Polit Sci, Hatfield AL10 9EU, Herts, England.",t.manu@qmul.ac.uk,,,,,,,94,0,0,1,3,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Complementing the argument developed by Palier and Thelen-originally developed to characterize the situation in Continental Europe-we provide a new explanation to the kind of dualization (age-based) that characterizes Southern Europe, Anglo-Saxon countries and (a few) Nordic countries. High deindustrialization and social conflict are the cornerstone of the theoretical argument developed in this article. It is argued that the former reduces the share of available stable jobs and the latter brings about an uneven distribution of risk across different social groups. Using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), we show that these two factors are crucial to explain high levels of outsiderness among young people. To complement the fsQCA analysis, a qualitative discussion is provided of three case studies (Portugal, UK and Denmark).","[Marques, Paulo; Salavisa, Isabel] Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, DINAMIA CET IUL, Lisbon, Portugal",Instituto Universitario de Lisboa,"Marques, P (通讯作者)，Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, DINAMIA CET IUL, Lisbon, Portugal.",paulo_miguel_marques@iscte.pt,"Salavisa, Isabel/AAC-3077-2020","Salavisa, Isabel/0000-0002-5734-4395; Marques, Paulo/0000-0001-5053-8827","FCT Foundation of Science and Technology, of Ministry of Education and Science [SFRH/77536/2011]","FCT Foundation of Science and Technology, of Ministry of Education and Science","Paulo Marques acknowledges the financial support provided by FCT Foundation of Science and Technology, of Ministry of Education and Science (FCT doctoral grant no.

The study showed that the kujawsko-pomorskie province is a front runner in terms of the share of renewable energy in the country's total balance. Renewable sources of energy are a promising direction of development of the energy sector of the kujawsko-pomorskie province, mostly due to the conditions favourable to the development of such energy sector.

The new EP and Council Regulation from 2013 constitutes the continuation of directions of changes implemented in 2007. Moreover, the horizontal approach to market regulation has been maintained that leads to further moving away from the sectoral approach. The regulation integrates previously delegated provisions in one act which allowed for taking the comprehensive look at the way of conducting market policy. The agricultural market has been extended to include three new sectors, that is, the markets of apiculture products, silkworm rearing as well as ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin. A comprehensive look at agricultural markets in the European scale is not always reflected in all member states.

After deriving an investment function in which a firm's investment is subject to financial restriction, we analyze whether financial development has reduced a firm's financial restriction and analyze whether financial development has reduced a firm's financial restriction by expanding available external financing that the firm faces. Using firm-level data in Korea from 1994 to 2011, we find that financial development affects a firm's investment by reducing the firm's financial restrictions. However, the effects of financial development on a firm's financial restrictions are varied by industry or firm size. We also find that the financial crisis could deteriorate the effect of financial development on corporate investment.","[Ro, Young-Jin; Kim, In-Chul] Korea Inst Ind Econ & Trade, Sejong, South Korea; [Kim, Jin Woong] Dong A Univ, Dept Int Trade, Busan, South Korea",Korea Institute for Industrial Economics & Trade (KIET); Dong A University,"Kim, JW (通讯作者)，Dong A Univ, 225 Gudeok Ro, Busan 602760, South Korea.",jwkim01@dau.ac.kr,,,Dong-A University research fund,Dong-A University research fund,"This work was supported by the Dong-A University research fund and is a revised version of the KIET Industrial Economic Review 17(3): 5-14 (May/June, 2012).",,19,14,14,4,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

This capital primarily consists of the knowledge and skills of the creative use of ICT. Recognizing the limitations of small separate groups in this sector, began their association in order to achieve better positions in the regional and global market, find new market niches, as well as to create educational centers parallel to the official teaching at schools and universities.

Its aim is to increase the attractiveness of IT development profession in Osijek, encourage IT entrepreneurship, networking and design of cooperation programs. Today, Osijek Software City brings together more than 40 companies and dozens of individuals.

The ageing of the voting electorate is contributing to the political imbalance between the old and young generations, and has the potential to levy excessive burden on future generations. With this background in mind, this research seeks to point out, through reform of the electoral system, the,problems of silver democracy caused by societal ageing, and to suggest ways to achieve political equilibrium between generations. Key suggestions are: 1) changing the basis of electoral districts from geographic area to age-cohort; 2) establishment of a new future generations district which can speak for the rights of those who are currently underage; and 3) weighting of votes cast by the younger generations, who may be at a numerical disadvantage in elections.

While informal care is projected to decrease in Germany, the use of home- and community-based services (HCBS) can be expected to increase in the future. Preference-based data on aspects of HCBS is needed to optimize person-centered care.ObjectiveTo investigate preferences for home- and community-based long-term care services packages.DesignDiscrete choice experiment conducted in mailed survey.Setting and participantsRandomly selected sample of the general population aged 45-64years in Germany (n=1.209).Main variables studiedPreferences and marginal willingness to pay (WTP) for HCBS were assessed with respect to five HCBS attributes (with 2-4 levels): care time per day, service level of the HCBS provider, quality of care, number of different caregivers per month, co-payment.ResultsQuality of care was the most important attribute to respondents and small teams of regular caregivers (1-2) were preferred over larger teams. Yet, an extended range of services of the HCBS provider was not preferred over a more narrow range. WTP per hour of HCBS was Euro8.98.ConclusionsOur findings on preferences for HCBS in the general population in Germany add to the growing international evidence of preferences for LTC. In light of the great importance of high care quality to respondents, reimbursement for services by HCBS providers could be more strongly linked to the quality of services.","[Lehnert, T.; Guenther, O.

Nevertheless, in reality, it remains a rare occurrence. We examine local-level (street-level) collaboration in the context of public forest management in Germany where, historically, public forests were solely under the forest management agency's authority. With the establishment of a nature conservation agency and subsequent legislative changes, responsibilities and authorities were increasingly distributed among both agencies. Today, the two agencies are connected through a system of approval procedures and expected to collaborate to further nature conservation objectives. We aim to understand how the mandate to collaborate is put into practice, and find a diversity of local level agency relationships. While the literature suggests the benefits of inter-agency collaboration stems from including a diversity of disciplines and compensating for limited resources, we find these aspects to pose significant challenges in local level practices. Aside from actor-related factors, we also found systemic and societal actors to be a strong influence on inter-agency exchange.","[Maier, Carolin; Wirth, Kristina] State Forest Res Inst Baden Wuerttemberg, Dept Forest & Soc, Wonnhaldestr 4, D-79100 Freiburg, Germany",,"Maier, C (通讯作者)，State Forest Res Inst Baden Wuerttemberg, Dept Forest & Soc, Wonnhaldestr 4, D-79100 Freiburg, Germany.",Carolin.Maier@forst.bwl.de,,,,,,,70,7,7,1,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,NOV,2018,96.0,,,,,,102,111,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.08.014,0.0,,,10,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GV3HM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445985000011,0

Almost all the victims were textile workers. The causes of the collapse were the addition of an unpermitted, poorly engineered four stories coupled with substandard building materials. The building's owner and factory operators ignored an engineer's warning of dangerous cracks in the structure the day before the collapse. Instead, workers were ordered back into the building. The aftermath witnessed the arrests of 42 individuals, including the owner of the building, five factory owners, and a dozen national and local officials, including Savar's mayor.(1) The Bangladesh arrests of those responsible for the Rana Plaza tragedy raise the legal issue of criminal prosecutions in disasters and tragedies arising from both natural and human causes. I noticed in the aftermath of the Rana Plaza collapse an increasing application of criminal law in these incidents, giving rise to several theses: 1) A substantial increase globally in criminal prosecutions in non-terrorist disasters and tragedies in the New Millennium; 2) A high percent of the incidents are in Asia and the Pacific Islands; 3) Several cases include the prosecution of government officials and employees for corruption and other derelictions of duty(2); and 4) The surge in prosecutions may be prompted by the ubiquity of smart phones, tablets, and social media. A plausible hypothesis is the increase in hand held digital cameras and cell phones coupled with the advent of social media to globally disseminate incidents, disasters, and tragedies. The New Millennium ushered in smart phones, Google, and the Internet. Popular knowledge and reaction to tragedies prompts a call for action, resulting in prosecutors taking action.(3) This paper presents an analysis of the results of the study. It lays out the need for criminal prosecutions, followed by the methodology. It summarizes the findings, and discusses a few situations which stand out. It also looks at the special case of South Korea, which has been most proactive in responding to incidents, not only with criminal prosecutions, but also with changes in government and society.

Findings are that under TBL, student grades were higher, both overall and on a final examination that remained unchanged across the two instructional formats. In addition, TBL students performed better on three measures used to assess student learning of basic course concepts of supply and demand, exchange rates and net exports, and economic policy. Further, students in the TBL sections report more engagement and better ability to think independently, as measured by student course evaluations. Overall, the study suggests that the Principles of Macroeconomics classroom is adaptable to the TBL format, and that TBL is correlated with positive outcomes for students. In addition to these results, this paper includes discussion and examples illustrating the process through which TBL was implemented.","[Odell, Kathleen E.] Dominican Univ, Brennan Sch Business, 7900 West Div St, River Forest, IL 60304 USA",,"Odell, KE (通讯作者)，Dominican Univ, Brennan Sch Business, 7900 West Div St, River Forest, IL 60304 USA.",kodell@dom.edu,,,,,,,27,10,10,0,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1477-3880,2352-4421,,INT REV ECON EDUC,Int.

Yet, some fundamental philosophical problems concerning the possibility of translating an alien language have hardly been raised in this context. The proponents of Active SETI assume that, abswould an extra-terrestrial intelligent (ETI) entity choose to contact us, they would use radio signals to convey a coded message that would be possible for us to decode and translate. Furthermore, they argue, were we to transmit a message, then this message would also be possible to translate. However, any interstellar message would, for obvious reasons, be conveyed without context and without the possibility of meaningful interaction over timescales relevant to us. According to the most influential research program in the philosophy of language, the meaning of an utterance is derived from its use in a context and is not intrinsic to the utterance by which it was conveyed. Therefore, while radical translation, i.e. learning an unknown language, is possible, it requires contextualized interaction. Only then can semantic behavior be observed, and utterances linked to meaning. Thus, merely an exchange of signals cannot produce meaningful communication. If this claim is true, there are important game-theoretical consequences of interstellar contact. An informal game theoretical analysis of this scenario, A Game of Stars, is described. This analysis suggests that the lack of communication may lead players into a Hobbesian Trap, where fear impels the players to a risk dominant strategy, potentially resulting in mutual destruction. Our conclusion is that interstellar contact is an underestimated existential risk. If true and given the relative ease of contacting an ETI given the knowledge of its location, information about the existence and location of an ETI would be very dangerous to spread. Thus, knowledge of an ETI and its location would constitute an information hazard.","[Jebari, Karim] Inst Futures Studies, Hollandargatan 13, S-10131 Stockholm, Sweden; [Olsson-Yaouzis, Niklas] Stockholm Univ, Dept Philosophy, Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Jebari, K (通讯作者)，Inst Futures Studies, Hollandargatan 13, S-10131 Stockholm, Sweden.",karim.jebari@iffs.se; niklas.olsson-yaouzis@philosophy.su.se,"Jebari, Karim/HGF-3034-2022","Jebari, Karim/0000-0002-7378-3662",,,,,41,5,5,0,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,AUG,2018,101.0,,,,,,46,54,,10.1016/j.futures.2018.06.007,0.0,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,GO1CS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439683600005,0

This paper reflects on an Australian geoengineering scenario project as a practical and innovative platform for informing governance. We produce multi-scale scenarios-representing Australia and the world- built on four fundamentally different archetypes, in which three include geoengineering. According to the four scenarios: greenhouse gas emissions continue increasing to 2050 but not long beyond; except with accelerated technology development and adoption, climate change impacts by 2050 become globally relevant; the risk of unilateral geoengineering deployment without adequate governance is low; and the framing of geoengineering deployment can be characterized as either climate mitigation, adaptation or optimization. Australia's role in geoengineering can be described as passive in the global context, but Australia can benefit from an early transition to a low-carbon economy. A review of the evolution of ideas throughout the exercise reveals a process of shared learning that helps to focus governance discussions around key issues. This study is one step towards increasing the presence and influence of the Asia-Pacific in geoengineering discussions, and highlights the value that a tailored scenario exercise can bring to governance discussions.","[Talberg, Anita; Thomas, Sebastian; Wiseman, John] Univ Melbourne, Australian German Climate & Energy Coll, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Talberg, Anita; Thomas, Sebastian] Univ Melbourne, Sustainabil Sci Lab, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Talberg, Anita] Univ Melbourne, Sch Earth Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Thomas, Sebastian] Univ Melbourne, Sch Ecosyst & Forest Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Wiseman, John] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sustainable Soc Inst, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne,"Talberg, A (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Australian German Climate & Energy Coll, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.;Talberg, A (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Sustainabil Sci Lab, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.;Talberg, A (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Sch Earth Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",anita.talberg@unimelb.edu.au,,"Wiseman, John/0000-0003-2276-5517; Talberg, Anita/0000-0002-4762-2355; Thomas, Sebastian/0000-0002-3345-9120",EU Centre on Shared Complex Challenges; European Commission; University of Melbourne,EU Centre on Shared Complex Challenges; European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); University of Melbourne(University of Melbourne),"This work was partly supported by the EU Centre on Shared Complex Challenges, which is co-funded by the European Commission and The University of Melbourne.",,82,4,4,0,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,AUG,2018,101.0,,,,,,67,79,,10.1016/j.futures.2018.06.003,0.0,,,13,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,GO1CS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439683600007,0

We develop a general equilibrium model of an RPS policy that captures key features such as a fixed factor renewable endowment, substitution across sectors of the economy, and endogenous price responses. We analytically decompose the effects of an RPS into a) a substitution effect, b) an output-tax effect, and c) an output effect. We show that an increase in the RPS can either deliver large resource booms or large emissions savings but not both.

According to the US, in some of his decisions, the member has made overreaching findings that amount to obiter dicta. As obiter dictum is a unique concept in the Common Law system, the US argument may only stand if the concept may be found in the WTO legal system as well. With a careful analysis of the concept of dicta in Common Law and a close examination of the effects of past panel and Appellate Body decisions in WTO dispute settlement, the paper rejects the US argument by refuting each of the three premises of the US argument, i.e., the WTO legal system based on Common Law; WTO follows stare decisis; and the WTO has rules against dicta.

A structured questionnaire was submitted by email to a sample of 1520 secondary wood manufacturers, having a response rate of 8% (121 manufacturers). The results show that the main factors that influence the consumption/choice of secondary wood manufacturers are the durability of wood products and the personal knowledge of the seller. In addition, the results show that 29.7% of respondents would be willing to pay a mean premium price of 2.40% for certified wooden planks, while 19.0% of them are willing to pay a premium of 2.68% for certified wooden panels. With regard to local wood materials, the results show that 23.1% of respondents would be willing to pay a mean premium price of 2.95% to buy local wooden planks, and 20.7% of them a premium of 4.13% for local wooden panels.

Defining who the expert is, and thus who should participate, is crucial to the success of any Delphi exercise. While participant selection does not aim for representativeness, selection equity, transparency and fairness is paramount in addition to levels of appropriate knowledge and expertise. This is particularly the case when considering possible future opportunities for the multi-faceted bioeconomy; a concept that is marred with competing interests. Using renewable biological resources to meet future food, feed, fuel and fibre needs, balanced and inclusive bioeconomy development requires input, compromise and consensus from a diverse range of public, private and civil society actors across agriculture, food, marine, forestry, chemical, material and energy sectors. This paper reflects on the process of defining and recruiting Delphi experts in the bioeconomy context. Appropriate selection strategies, applicable to other futures studies, include adherence to value chain and web approaches, an expert closeness continuum and considered screening criteria. These selection strategies also facilitate reporting on the types of experts involved (and thus identifying potential sources of bias) whilst maintaining anonymity. Themes related to expert confidence, objective participation and the power of social learning are also explored. The paper concludes by outlining the benefit of the Delphi methodology as a tool of active stakeholder engagement for enhancing reflection and fostering open-mindedness towards a more sustainable future.","[Devaney, Laura; Henchion, Maeve] Teagasc Food Res Ctr, Rural Econ Dev Programme, Dept Agrifood Business & Spatial Anal, Dublin 15, Ireland",Teagasc,"Devaney, L (通讯作者)，Teagasc Food Res Ctr, Rural Econ Dev Programme, Dept Agrifood Business & Spatial Anal, Dublin 15, Ireland.",laura.devaney@teasgac.ie,,"Henchion, Maeve/0000-0001-7842-1516","Irish Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM); DAFM's competitive research programme (Research Stimulus Fund) [14/SF/857]","Irish Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM); DAFM's competitive research programme (Research Stimulus Fund)","The authors would like to acknowledge the Irish Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) for funding the BioEire project from which this paper arose.

Drawing on sixty interviews and written records from nine member states across the EU, we identify variables to explain differences in the levels of political support, and formal and practical implementation of the Regulation. Through systematic assessment, we find that countries that are relatively wealthy, are significant importers of high risk wood, and that have active civil societies were most likely to support the Regulation and to implement its requirements in a timely manner. In contrast the poorest countries least engaged in high risk imports face the greatest challenges with compliance, suggesting an unequal distribution of costs relative to responsibilities.","[McDermott, Constance L.] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Environm Change Inst, 5 South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Sotirov, Metodi] Univ Freiburg, Inst Environm Social Sci & Geog, Forest & Environm Policy Grp, Tennenbacher Str 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany",University of Oxford; University of Freiburg,"McDermott, CL (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Environm Change Inst, 5 South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",constance.mcdermott@ouce.ox.ac.uk,"Sotirov, Metodi/T-8199-2019","Sotirov, Metodi/0000-0002-3548-707X; McDermott, Constance/0000-0002-5238-0936",European Union [FP7-282887],European Union(European Union (EU)),"We thank our collaborators Mareike Blum, Laura Dieguez, Eva Kehayova, Panagiotis Koulelis, Gaia Pasqualotto, Sophie Schwer, and Maike Stelter for their support throughout data collection and data analysis.

CBF has been practised for nearly 40 years in Nepal and has resulted in the restoration of forest cover to a considerable proportion of the mountain regions. In the Phewa watershed, restored forests are important for the subsistence of local communities and the provision of economically valuable recreation, aesthetic and cultural services for a wider group of stakeholders. In that context, this study aims to assess the social values of ecosystem services (ES) and their relative importance to different stakeholders. Community perceptions and expert opinions to assess and prioritise ES in the watershed were sought through focus group discussions and key informant surveys. There were 23 ecosystem services relevant to the local communities and other stakeholders in the watershed. Sediment retention, recreation and ecotourism, freshwater, firewood and timber were priority ES for local benefits, while recreation and ecotourism, biodiversity maintenance, sediment retention and carbon stock were priority ES for wider (regional global) benefits. Priority ES revealed key areas of correlation and conflict between different services and between stakeholder groups. For local benefits, trade-offs were identified between provisioning services and regulating, habitat and cultural services. Synergies were predominant between regulating, cultural and habitat services. The study indicated that the social values concept is a promising tool for eliciting people's preferences in the ES assessment and analysis of trade-offs and synergies in developing countries where community involvement is the dominant approach of forest management.","[Paudyal, Kiran; Keenan, Rodney John] Univ Melbourne, Fac Sci, Sch Ecosyst & Forest Sci, Carlton, Vic 3010, Australia; [Baral, Himlal] Ctr Int Forestry Res, Jalan CIFOR, Bogor 16115, Barat, Indonesia",University of Melbourne; CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR),"Paudyal, K (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Fac Sci, Sch Ecosyst & Forest Sci, Carlton, Vic 3010, Australia.",kiran.paudyal@gmail.com; H.Baral@cgiar.org; rkeenan@unimelb.edu.au,"Paudyal, Kiran/X-2917-2019","Paudyal, Kiran/0000-0003-4185-7484",Australia Awards Scholarship Program,Australia Awards Scholarship Program,"The authors wish to thank the Australia Awards Scholarship Program for providing financial support to the first author.

To large-scale global or regional grids or to self-sufficient disconnected prosumers? Although numerous studies have previously dealt with the future of the electricity system, there is a lack of studies that attempt to monitor the development of more complete sets of socio-technical system elements that support alternative futures. This paper addresses this gap by first identifying and characterizing three idealized electricity system futures: 'the Super-grid', 'the Smart-grid' and 'the Off-grid', and then using the characterization to monitor the emergence, accumulation and alignment of socio-technical elements indicating the initial formation of new systems. Besides tracing the ongoing structural build-up at the niche level, we explore how the emerging systems relate to the existing electricity regime, other sectors and discourses. While the final outcome is undecided, the findings indicate that all three of the investigated systems have gained momentum over the last decade, partly relying on growth trends in shared elements such as the rise of renewables and climate change concerns, but also building on different technologies, actor networks, related industries and political and cultural discourses.","[Hojckova, Kristina; Sanden, Bjorn; Ahlborg, Helene] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Technol Management & Econ, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden",Chalmers University of Technology,"Hojcková, K (通讯作者)，Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Technol Management & Econ, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden.",hojckova@chalmers.se,,"Ahlborg, Helene/0000-0002-6506-6751",Swedish Energy Agency,Swedish Energy Agency(Swedish Energy Agency),"This research is funded by the Swedish Energy Agency as a part of the 'New networks of power: on the emergence, diffusion and impact of alternative electricity system architectures' project.

The interactions during the policy formulation and decision-making stages are observed with special attention to the role of scientists. Representatives of three target groups were interviewed: forestry officials, stakeholders and forestry scientists. The stakeholders tend to believe their main form of participation in policy processes is decision-making, not realising that the final decisions are made by forestry officials or by politicians: the minister, government or Parliament. Consensual proposals or decisions are important because these usually form the basis for final formulations in policy documents. The policy processes are mostly facilitated by forestry officials whose mediation skills need improvement. There is a major conflict between stakeholders representing timber production and environmental protection. In policy discussions, the environmentalists should provide more analysis, otherwise their viewpoints are ignored. Forestry scientists fall short in their most important role as honest brokers; they must learn how to integrate themselves into policy processes. Very often scientists act as observers, but other participants expect them to actively bring scientific information and knowledge into discussions. In addition to the face-to face meetings, new communication tools (e-consultation and e-participation) are available, but they are underused in the policy formulation processes.","[Teder, Meelis; Kaimre, Paavo] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Forestry & Rural Engn, Kreutzwaldi 5, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia",Estonian University of Life Sciences,"Teder, M (通讯作者)，Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Forestry & Rural Engn, Dept Forest Ind, Kreutzwaldi 5, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia.",meelis.teder@emu.ee; paavo.kaimre@emu.ee,"Teder, Meelis/E-4269-2017; Kaimre, Paavo/AAY-8534-2021","Teder, Meelis/0000-0003-1151-267X;",,,,,42,17,18,1,26,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,APR,2018,89.0,,,,SI,,54,62,,10.1016/j.forpol.2017.05.007,0.0,,,9,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GD8IN,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430756200007,0

To bound the true implicit prices, researchers sometimes study high profile cases involving significant media and community attention. However, prior research finds that high-profile cases may lead to stigma effects that can confound interpretation of the results. This study compares these opposing effects at sixteen of the highest profile underground storage tank releases across the United States over the last thirty years. Using covariate matching and difference-in-differences hedonic regressions, we estimate the change in housing values around each site. We then conduct a cross-site meta-analysis to estimate the average treatment effects. We find an average housing price depreciation of 2-6% upon discovery of a release, which is an upper bound on the implicit price of contamination at more typical sites. Following cleanup, we find a housing price appreciation of a similar magnitude, suggesting that even in high-profile cases, surrounding neighborhoods do not experience persistent stigma.

Moreover, optimal marginal abatement investment costs differ across sectors of the economy. It may be preferable to spend $25 to avoid the marginal ton of carbon in a sector where abatement capital is expensive, such as public transportation, or in a sector with large abatement potential, such as the power sector, than $15 for the marginal ton in a sector with lower cost or lower abatement potential. The reason, distinct from learning spillovers, is that reducing greenhouse gas emissions requires investment in long-lived abatement capital such as clean power plants or public transport infrastructure. The value of abatement investment comes from avoided emissions, but also from the value of abatement capital in the future. The optimal levelized cost of conserved carbon can thus be higher than the optimal carbon price. It is higher in sectors with higher investment needs: those where abatement capital is more expensive or sectors with larger abatement potential. We compare our approach to the traditional abatement-cost-curve model and discuss implications for policy design.

However, literature search suggests studies on the participation of the youth groups are almost non-existent. Our research aimed to assess how youth delegates perceive their participation in the international forest-related conferences, and to identify areas that they think can improve their engagement in the international forest-related fora. We surveyed the youth participants of three international forest-related decision-making processes and fora: United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), United Nations Forum on Forests (UNFF), and Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Although they felt their participation was valued, a large majority of them suggested that the opportunities to express their opinions and ideas remain limited. More importantly, they were afraid that their views and ideas on how to deal with the current forest challenges were not taken into consideration. They further argued that the forest-related international conferences should provide more opportunities for youth to facilitate engagement with other groups, to share ideas, wisdom and solutions.","[Yunita, Sekar A.

Using administrative data from a large public university, we account for both student and instructor fixed effects. Consistent with a large literature, we find a positive time of day effect. That is, students earn higher grades in classes that start later. However, contrary to previous literature, we find students earn higher grades in classes with fewer meeting times when not accounting for instructor fixed effects. This effect is entirely explained by instructor sorting on course schedules. Instructors that assign higher grades, either due to quality of instruction or grade leniency, are more likely to meet twice a week rather than three times a week. Including instructor fixed effects, we find no difference in two-day a week classes and three-day a week classes. However, grades are lower in classes that meet just once a week.","[Cotti, Chad] Univ Wisconsin, 800 Algoma Blvd, Oshkosh, WI 54901 USA; [Gordanier, John; Ozturk, Orgul] Univ South Carolina, 1014 Greene St, Columbia, SC 29208 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"Ozturk, O (通讯作者)，Univ South Carolina, 1014 Greene St, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",cottic@uwosh.edu; jgordanier@moore.sc.edu; odozturk@moore.sc.edu,"Ozturk, Orgul/ACY-8203-2022",,,,,,24,10,13,3,19,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0272-7757,1873-7382,,ECON EDUC REV,Econ.

We find that the provision of infrastructure varies across development stages; there is a focus on basic infrastructure, such as transport, water, and sanitation, during early stages, and an emphasis on advanced infrastructure, such as power and especially information and communication technology, in later stages. Better-performing MICs tend to invest more on infrastructure. They also have more information and communication technology infrastructure.

Equally important, according to these theories, is the logic of debt investment which is often at odds with the logic of equity investment. This article demonstrates that overlooked influential actors in the field of corporate finance that subscribe to this logic of debt investment, i.e. bond rating agencies, are actively discouraging the spread of shareholder value-driven corporate practices via the bond rating process.

Although universities have been created as places dedicated to teaching and learning, they are not learning organization by default. There is a widespread confusion between the process of individual learning, which is specific for students learning, and organizational learning, which is an organizational process developing at the university level. A university can become a learning organization if and only if its leadership creates strategies for transforming local and spontaneous organizational learning into a generic and organization-wide process based on clearly defined strategies. The university governance should become a strategic driving force and knowledge management should replace the traditional administration management. Universities in the knowledge economy need to create and disseminate new knowledge and to contribute through research and innovation to the community development. Thus, the vision and mission of the university should incorporate new attributes and the academic leadership should be able to implement all of these changes in the operational academic management. The methodology used in this paper is based on literature review and a conceptual analysis concerning the challenges of the university for the 21st century. The results show that universities can become learning organizations if and only if their leadership create a set of specific conditions and all the members of the academic community share the new vision and mission developed by the university leaders.","[Bratianu, Constantin] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 6 Piata Romana,Sect 1, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Bratianu, C (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 6 Piata Romana,Sect 1, Bucharest, Romania.",constantin.bratianu@gmail.com,"CONSTANTIN, BRATIANU/L-3402-2018","CONSTANTIN, BRATIANU/0000-0002-1029-7384",,,,,61,2,2,3,6,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,545,554,,,,,,10,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200049,0

This study investigates consumer preferences for product attributes of shellfish and seaweed salad focusing on production source (farm-raised, wild-harvested), certification status (organic, sustainably harvested, non-certified), and product origin (home state, U.S., imported). We analyze data from a nationwide online survey of coastal residents capturing consumption choices for oysters, clams, mussels, scallops, and seaweed salad. Analysis reveals that while consumers express preferences for wild-harvested products, the magnitude may differ for shellfish and seaweed salad products in comparison to previous findings regarding finfish preferences. Further, consumers are willing to pay more for products that bear a certification label or are from their home state. Results from this study suggest that seafood marketing strategies and development of labeling programs must account for the influence of multiple attributes on consumer choice.","[Brayden, W.

J,"Briguet, J",,,,"Briguet, Julien",,,The State's Invisible Hand: Chinese SOEs Facing EU Antitrust Law,JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"We argue that the European Commission (EC) case law on mergers involving Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) suffers from several flaws. First, it is inconsistent with the set of criteria initially set out in the EC case law for SOEs. Secondly, the EC's assessment is based on an ownership bias that ignores the institutional environment in which Chinese SOEs operate. Third, it violates the basic legal rationale to maintain and ensure competitive neutrality between private and public companies in merger review. We argue in favour of a more systematic application of the single entity theory to restore the consistency of the case law. This appears a necessity in the case of Chinese investments in the EU. Indeed, due to its broad influence over its economy and its financial system, Chinese SOEs may enjoy an exorbitant privilege that could jeopardize the principle of competitive neutrality at the core of EU competition law. One should recognize that the antitrust law is a point of tension between the Western understanding of corporate law and the Chinese state capitalism based on a radically different institutional environment. A more consequential implementation of the principle of competitive neutrality is necessary to take into account this institutional environment.","[Briguet, Julien] Swiss Dept Foreign Affairs FDFA, Bern, Switzerland",,"Briguet, J (通讯作者)，Swiss Dept Foreign Affairs FDFA, Bern, Switzerland.",julien.briguet@eda.admin.ch,,,,,,,12,2,3,1,11,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

OBOR is President Xi Jinping's most important project and it marks a radical change in China's foreign policy as it constitutes a new economic model that also aims to strengthen China's position as an economic superpower. Despite its major impact on international trade and investment, OBOR does not belong to present-day categories of international pacts and treaties. For the first time in its modern history, China is attempting to export its development model, that is, China is relying on massive investment in infrastructure, roads, ports, and railways, at home and abroad, to accelerate industrial development throughout the region.

Acting in a competitive market is another source of uncertainty as the insurer characteristics may be essential in being preferred by a possible client. Thus, in real-life, there are many situations in which the information cannot be assessed precisely in numerical values. Fuzzy phenomena exist in nature and are encountered within human society. The notion of a fuzzy set has been introduced by L. A. Zadeh in 1965 and has been since developed in many directions. As well, researchers and practitioners have identified applications in many fields. In this paper, we assume that the characteristics of the insurance products with respect to the attribute are represented by intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. The purpose of this paper is to develop an aggregation procedure based on a weighted intuitionistic fuzzy Bonferroni mean and an aggregation procedure introduced by Xu and Yager in 2011, for the multi-attribute decision making and selection of the insurance product.","[Covrig, Mihaela; Tanasescu, Paul; Mircea, Iulian] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Covrig, M (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",mihaela.covrig@csie.ase.ro; paul.tanasescu@fin.ase.ro; iulian.mircea@csie.ase.ro,"Covrig, Mihaela/JFS-6073-2023","Covrig, Mihaela/0009-0004-3427-2917",,,,,20,0,0,0,7,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Demographic variables also matter importantly in low-income countries. In middle-income countries, in contrast, measures of the financial system no longer appear to matter as importantly, as if inefficiencies in banking and financial systems are no longer as binding a constraint as at earlier stages of financial development; nor are demographic variables as important as before.

It results from many reasons, such as a necessity to possess and develop practical skills and abilities, to gain job experience, to earn money and support themselves financially, etc. Working in the T&H industry is characterized by long, irregular and unsocial hours, night and weekend schedules, or having to deal with heavy workload and stress. All these demands of working in T&H may interfere with students' academic life and can be reflected in their fatigue, tiredness and strain when studying or attending classes. This study develops and tests a research model that investigates the relationships between time workload experienced by working students and their exhaustion from their studies. Additionally, an attempt was made to answer the question whether the reasons why young people decide to work while studying may have any consequences for their feeling of study exhaustion, as one of the dimensions of students' burnout. This study was conducted among tourism and hospitality (T&H) students who, at the time of the research, were both studying and working in T&H. It means that only students with current working experience took part in this study. A questionnaire survey was conducted to elicit responses concerning students' work, their attitudes toward the undertaken studies and their socio-demographic characteristics. 121 questionnaires were analyzed in this study. The findings revealed that there are positive and significant relationships between time workload experienced by working students, reflected in a number of days per week at work and a number of hours per day at work, and the students' exhaustion. The results show that only earning money to cover the living expenses positively and significantly relates to students' exhaustion. Noteworthy, in the case of these respondents, having some kind of pressure to work (to cover the living expenses) may put a particular strain on their successful management of their work and student roles.

The results allowed authors to define a number of problems that significantly limit the modernization of the Russian economy and that will be addressed by the traditional sectors of the Russian economy in the next decade. The main measure of success should be the rational choice of the optimal trajectory of the industrial and technological development of the country between evolutionary and revolutionary scenarios.

How does society respond to the collapse of both welfare-state and market mechanisms? I examine these issues through the study of one working class community in Athens over 2012-13. Since the onset of the crisis, my informants experienced a simultaneous drop in living standards, loss of social status, and debasement of their symbolic construction of reality. To respond to these pressures, they relied on a combination of material survival strategies, the reconfiguration of social resources, and the reconstruction of cultural imaginaries. To explain these findings, the article draws on Karl Polanyi's analysis of counter-movements to marketization and commodification. I argue in favour of augmenting the definition of countermovements to capture local-level responses, emphasising cultural aspects of social protection, and tracing the micro-foundations of countermovements that are nonetheless shaped by the macro-institutional context shaping action. This reading of Polanyi's work seeks to integrate many moving-and potentially contradictory-parts into a holistic analysis of societal responses to rapid and radical socioeconomic change.","[Kentikelenis, Alexander E.] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Kentikelenis, Alexander E.] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Oxford; University of Amsterdam,"Kentikelenis, AE (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford, England.;Kentikelenis, AE (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",alexander.kentikelenis@trinity.ox.ac.uk,,"Kentikelenis, Alexandros/0000-0002-1543-4595",Harvard University; Greek State Scholarships Foundation; Onassis Foundation; Cambridge Political Economy Society Trust; Centre for Business Research at the Cambridge Judge Business School,Harvard University; Greek State Scholarships Foundation(Greek Ministry of Development-GSRT); Onassis Foundation; Cambridge Political Economy Society Trust; Centre for Business Research at the Cambridge Judge Business School,"Financial support by Harvard University, the Greek State Scholarships Foundation, the Onassis Foundation, the Cambridge Political Economy Society Trust, and the Centre for Business Research at the Cambridge Judge Business School is gratefully acknowledged.",,99,11,14,1,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

If the mega-RTA provides rules of origin based on the change in tariff classification (CTC)-with-exception criterion such as yarn-forward rules, the rules of origin will become more restrictive with respect to the imports of the excluded intermediate goods from the single-agreement parties after the formation of the mega-RTA than before, thus failing to meet the requirement under GATT Article XXIV:5. The exclusionary rules of origin of the mega-RTA draw the trade away from the single-agreement parties, causing 'fracture' in the mega-RTA's overlapping RTA. As a legal remedy to the problem, the mega-RTA should eliminate the restriction from the CTC-with-exception criterion by adopting the rules of origin based on the non-exclusionary criteria such as the value-added or the CTC criterion that does not presumptively exclude the use of certain non-originating intermediate inputs.","[Kim, Jong Bum] Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Seoul, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Kim, JB (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Seoul, South Korea.",jongbumkim@yonsei.ac.kr,,,,,,,23,1,1,4,30,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JAN,2018,17.0,1,,,,,121,144,,10.1017/S1474745617000040,0.0,,,24,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,GA4CM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428277200005,0

However, leisure is the time in which people create. In this paper the emphasis has been put on the creative potential of free time, and in this connection, the idea of hobby culture development as a catalyst for entrepreneurship. The reason lies in the complementarity of the hobby culture and entrepreneurial culture. If we distinguish between innovation and entrepreneurial risk as the two fundamental theoretic determinants of the concept of entrepreneurship, we will see that hobby activity unobtrusively solves the underlying problem of encouraging the expansion of entrepreneurial behavior. The hobby itself hides the potential for mitigating risk aversion. The reason lies in an interesting phenomenon that deserves more attention, for the purposes of this paper we call it a phenomenon of double benefits; hobbyists are often prepared to bear a serious financial loss, just to satisfy their interest. This tendency of general spending often turns into a tendency to capital spending, ie investment. The reason for this kind of behavior is hidden in the promise of double benefits. For a hobbyist, investment is not only a promise of future higher spending geared towards meeting its interests and needs, but it additionally meets the present need to deal with its hobby. There is also another effect of the hobbyist activity that contributes to the reduction of aversion to risk. A hobby in its essence is a game, the consequence of such pursuit of leisure is feelings of enthusiasm and optimism. Such is the effect of hobbies on the nature of things because the hobby is, among other things, a quest for pleasure. On the contrary, the fact is that the pessimistic social climate is one of the reasons for the insufficient development of the entrepreneurship. The active pursuit of leisure time in the form of hobbies also promotes creative behavior that creates a suitable climate for the emergence and development of innovations.","[Komljenovic, Niko] Univ Zagreb, Fac Law, Zagreb, Croatia; [Rancic, Nenad; Pilipovic, Ozren] Univ Zagreb, Fac Law, Dept Econ, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb; University of Zagreb,"Komljenovic, N (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Law, Zagreb, Croatia.",niko.komljenovich@gmail.com; nrancic@pravo.hr; opilipovic@pravo.hr,"rancic, nenad/ABB-6385-2021",,,,,,24,1,1,1,8,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,273,281,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO8KK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000527683300030,0

The scientific novelty of the study is that it has developed a holistic approach to studying the problem of changing (increasing) the retirement age in the context of demographic processes, the situation in the labor market and in the pension sector. The article compares the age of retirement and the average life expectancy after retirement for the Russian Federation, Moscow, the Volgograd region, and some selected countries for analysis. According to the results of the study, the size of the minimum and average pensions in the countries selected for analysis is presented and the average life expectancy after retirement for men and women is predicted in 2021, based on various retirement-age scenarios. Using the age-shifting method, the prognosis of the number of the able-bodied population of the Volgograd Region in 2021 is provided. The results of calculations of the pension, potential and general workload indicators for men and women in the Volgograd Region in 2016 and 2021 are given. for different scenarios of retirement age. In the course of this study, an analysis was made of the optimality of the age composition of the population, in the forecast period by the Rosstat method.

The relationship between the sectors is further analyzed using the utility analysis method based on ecological network analysis. The empirical results show that although the traditional energy-intensive industries are the major energy-consuming sectors from a direct energy consumption perspective, large energy consumption by energy-intensive industries is transferred to downstream industries through intermediate products after the I-O adjustment. Specifically, the building industry and service sector are the sectors with the highest real energy consumption. With the upgrading and optimization of the industrial structure, the proportion of energy-intensive sectors in China is declining. However, the development of the service sector and infrastructure construction still requires large intermediate inputs. Thus, industrial restructuring cannot significantly reduce China's total energy consumption.","[Lin, Boqiang] Xiamen Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Sch Management, Xiamen, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Guanglu] Xiamen Univ, China Ctr Energy Econ Res, Sch Econ, Xiamen, Fujian, Peoples R China",Xiamen University; Xiamen University,"Lin, BQ (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Sch Management, Xiamen, Fujian, Peoples R China.",bqlin@xmu.edu.cn,"Lin, Boqiang/G-3960-2010","Lin, Boqiang/0000-0002-1308-400X",,,,,26,9,9,6,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Based on the 2010 China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), regression results indicate that total work burden is negatively related to the mental health of both men and women, consistent with the idea that additional work hours reduce time available for rest and leisure. Women have longer working hours and are more likely to be time poor than men, and this gender inequality in total work burden contributes to the gender gap in mental health. The relationships between the components of total work burden - paid and unpaid work - and mental health shed further light on the strength of gender norms and the barriers to redistribution of unpaid work from women to men necessary to reduce the gender gap in mental health.","[Liu, Lan] Peking Univ, Inst Populat Res, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [MacPhail, Fiona] Univ Northern British Columbia, Econ, 3333 Univ Way, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, Canada; [Dong, Xiao-yuan] Univ Winnipeg, Econ, 515 Portage Ave, Winnipeg, MB R3B 2E9, Canada",Peking University; University of Northern British Columbia; University of Winnipeg,"Liu, L (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Inst Populat Res, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",liulan@pku.edu.cn; fiona.macphail@unbc.ca; x.dong@uwinnipeg.ca,,,International Development Research Center of Canada (IDRC) [107579],International Development Research Center of Canada (IDRC),"The authors would like to thank the anonymous referees and the guest editors for their instructive comments, as well as Professor Xiaoyan Lei for helpful comments on an earlier version of the study.

Anchored within the world of finance - an industry predicated on mathematical theorizing, neoclassical economic thought, and omission of relational values - the inclusion of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reporting, a commonly used term for nonfinancial information in SRI, in investment decision making confronts several barriers. One such barrier concerns care: who cares for what, and where. In an environment where an atomistic-individualistic ontology dominates, and a relational-values ontology is omitted, the study investigates the possibilities for ESG to have a wider uptake. It considers the changes required to align the inherently relational aspect of care within a culture of economic reasoning reliant on the exclusion of care. It concludes with suggestions for how a relational caring perspective can be incorporated to accommodate and encourage SRI in the world of financial management.","[Mussell, Helen] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Inst Sustainabil Leadership, 1 Trumpington St, Cambridge CB2 1QA, England",University of Cambridge,"Mussell, H (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Inst Sustainabil Leadership, 1 Trumpington St, Cambridge CB2 1QA, England.",hjm47@cam.ac.uk,"Mussell, Helen/GZL-0170-2022",,,,,,47,7,10,5,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

According to the literature, such classification is essential to assess both market liquidity and dimensions of market liquidity based on high frequency intraday data. The main problem is that trade and quote data is not publicly available for many stock markets and researchers have to utilize indirect methods to infer trade side. The aim of this paper is to investigate major problems in assessing accuracy of trade side classification algorithms. We evaluate and compare four most frequently utilized procedures using intraday data for 105 companies from the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE). Moreover, an analysis of the robustness of the results is provided over the whole sample period from January 2, 2005 to December 30, 2016, and three consecutive sub-periods of equal size, covering the pre-crisis, crisis, and post-crisis periods. The empirical experiment shows that the Lee-Ready (1991) algorithm and tick rule perform better than other methods on the WSE, regardless of the choice of the sample.","[Olbrys, Joanna; Mursztyn, Michal] Bialystok Tech Univ, Fac Comp Sci, Wiejska 45 A, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland",Bialystok University of Technology,"Olbrys, J (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Fac Comp Sci, Wiejska 45 A, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland.",j.olbrys@pb.edu.pl; m.mursztyn@student.pb.edu.pl,"Olbrys, Joanna/P-8237-2018","Olbrys, Joanna/0000-0002-0928-0040",National Science Centre in Poland [2016/21/B/HS4/02004],"National Science Centre in Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)",This research has been supported by the grant No. 2016/21/B/HS4/02004 from the National Science Centre in Poland.,,16,0,0,0,0,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",2545-1227,,978-83-65907-20-2,SOC ECON MODEL FOREC,,,2018,1.0,,,,,,335,344,,10.14659/SEMF.2018.01.34,0.0,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BQ1LQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000576774700034,0

The analysis of the personality of the Smithian economic agent from the tax perspective leads to the conclusion that these features are not verified under the conditions of the market economy. Thus, in theory, the perfect rationality of homo oeconomicus would mean that each taxpayer would avoid the payment of tax liabilities, and the generalization of this behavior would lead to the impoverishment of the state treasury. Also, the reality contradicts the validity of the latter two features because the market economy is not characterized by perfect competition (i.e., see tax monopolies), and most taxpayers comply with legislation, although their income is affected by existing tax levy. The joining of the two realities - an anthropological, another economic - with all the truth they contain, sets the attitude towards taxes in the sign of the gloom, the reluctance, and the anguish. The risk of taking over and repeating such messages, whether voicemail or not, is to create in the collective mind some dangerous behavioral prejudices, a kind of Pascal's abyss, an abyss between the taxpayer and the authorities, all ending with frustration, repudiation and ultimately avoidance of tax obligations. Although the importance and value of tax payments are undeniable, we do not consider the exuberant apologetics of tax obligations to be appropriate, but we do not even think that we should be discouraged in the face of a fatalist rhetoric. We rather think that the discourse on tax obligations and their payment must be balanced and rational, giving the prospect of a call for taxes, taxes, and contributions, on the one hand, and responsibility for implementing an effective fiscal policy, on the other. The central objective of the paper is the presentation of some benchmarks in the evolution of fiscal behavior in order to understand the forms covered by the tax obligations and the transformations recorded over time by the taxpayer interaction of the authorities.","[Oprisan, Oana; Condrea, Elena; Popovici, Norina] Ovidius Univ Constanta, 1 Univ St, Constanta 900470, Romania",Ovidius University,"Oprisan, O (通讯作者)，Ovidius Univ Constanta, 1 Univ St, Constanta 900470, Romania.",oana.oprisan@yahoo.com; elenacondrea2003@yahoo.com; norinapopovici@yahoo.com,"Condrea, Elena/ABE-2893-2021; Oprisan, Oana/GLN-4249-2022","Condrea, Elena/0000-0002-1930-5694; Oprisan, Oana/0000-0001-7850-2359",,,,,12,0,0,0,1,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,232,241,,,,,,10,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200021,0

The applied research tool was propensity score matching method, based on so-called counterfactual results, i.e. potential results possible to be achieved, if the status of treating the given object was different than observed. The study used data from the Farm Accountancy Data Network for individual Polish farms for 2008-2015. The results show that the positive effect of investment subsidies occurred only in 2011. Back then, the farms which in 2010 received the analysed support, were characterised, on average, by 39 percentage points higher annual increase in the labour productivity compared to the control group. In the remaining years, in turn, the impact of investment support on the increase in labour productivity was negative. However, given relatively high standard errors, the differences between farms which received and did not receive analysed payments were not statistically significant.","[Pawlowska, Aleksandra] Inst Agr & Food Econ, Natl Res Inst, Math Applicat Agr Econ Dept, Swietokrzyska 20, PL-00002 Warsaw, Poland",Institute of Agricultural & Food Economy,"Pawlowska, A (通讯作者)，Inst Agr & Food Econ, Natl Res Inst, Math Applicat Agr Econ Dept, Swietokrzyska 20, PL-00002 Warsaw, Poland.",Aleksandra.Pawlowska@ierigz.waw.pl,"Pawłowska, Aleksandra/HHZ-0768-2022","Pawłowska, Aleksandra/0000-0001-8964-3624",,,,,15,0,0,0,2,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",2545-1227,,978-83-65907-20-2,SOC ECON MODEL FOREC,,,2018,1.0,,,,,,365,374,,10.14659/SEMF.2018.01.37,0.0,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BQ1LQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000576774700037,0

The Fisher index is the most popular among superlative indices and it is called ideal since it satisfies most of tests derived from the axiomatic price index theory, including time reversibility. Nevertheless, the Fisher price index makes use of current-period expenditure data, and thus its usefulness in CPI measurement is limited.

Drawing on cases in the UK and Finland, we identified seven bundles forestry practices: creating an attractive place to live, pursuing forest-based leisure practices, wildlife and biodiversity preservation, heritage conservation, renewable heat production, animal husbandry and timber production. By assessing the place of these forest-based practices within larger practice 'complexes' (such as farming, urban employment, family recreation), we demonstrate disconnections to current incentive programmes, which are largely oriented towards professional farmers or foresters. We found that study participants were largely unopposed to achieving national policy objectives (afforestation in the UK and commercial timber production in Finland); instead, their limited active engagement reflected available competencies and the lack of resources (particularly time) available to non-commercial forest managers. We argue that using practice theory helps to identify new opportunities to influence existing practices, such as increasing competences in harvesting of continuous growth forestry in Finland and encouraging small-scale renewable heat production in the UK.","[Sutherland, Lee-Ann] James Hutton Inst, Social Econ & Geog Sci Grp, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland; [Huttunen, Suvi] Finnish Environm Inst, Helsinki, Finland",James Hutton Institute; Finnish Environment Institute,"Sutherland, LA (通讯作者)，James Hutton Inst, Social Econ & Geog Sci Grp, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland.",Lee-Ann.Sutherland@hutton.ac.uk; Suvi.Huttunen@ymparisto.fi,,"Huttunen, Suvi/0000-0002-8484-9014",Academy of Finland [277896]; Scottish Government's Strategic Research Programmes; Academy of Finland (AKA) [277896] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA),Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); Scottish Government's Strategic Research Programmes; Academy of Finland (AKA)(Research Council of Finland),"This research was funded by the Academy of Finland, grant number 277896 and the Scottish Government's Strategic Research Programmes (2011-2016 and 2016-2021).

However, the journey to success overseas is not smooth. While implementing the internationalization strategy of the economy to the world, Chinese enterprises are also faced with various risks brought by them, including political, financial, legal, cultural, taxation and operational risks. Among them, the T company implements a transnational business strategy, so it will face the differences in tax laws and regulations and collection and management regulations. Through the investigation of the financial management practices implemented by Chinese enterprises in the past few decades, it is found that the concept of tax management in China is far from foreign countries. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the management of overseas tax risks. For enterprises, they must also pay attention to the importance of tax management. Otherwise, they will not be able to adapt to the development of overseas strategies, and they will not be able to effectively control risks. In the face of fierce international competition, they will not take advantage and will bring losses to the company.","[Wan, Gang] Xinxing Cathay Resources Dev Co Ltd, Beijing 101100, Peoples R China",,"Wan, G (通讯作者)，Xinxing Cathay Resources Dev Co Ltd, Beijing 101100, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,7,FRANCIS ACAD PRESS,LONDON,"35 IVOR PL, LOWER GROUND, LONDON, NW1 6EA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-912407-98-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,143,146,,,,,,4,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BL4ID,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450418800030,0

For college students, better campus life could hardly be achieved without a safe and clean dormitory or harmonious relationship between room-mates. However, due to their strong individuality and self-consciousness, modern college students are often overwhelmed by various problems arising in the dormitory life. These problems, if not dealt with properly, could have negative effects on the quality of students' campus life and therefore hinder the health growth and development of college students both physically and psychologically. Xi proposed the concept of global governance-Wide Consultation, Joint Contribution and Shared Benefits. This paper believes the concept is also the golden principle of creating a better dormitory life for college students. Moreover, the paper analyses how the principle could be applied to help students to deal with problems arising in dormitory life and create a better dormitory life, so as to enjoy health growth and development in college.","[Wang, Dan-Ping] Ningbo Dahongying Univ, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Ningbo University of Finance & Economics,"Wang, DP (通讯作者)，Ningbo Dahongying Univ, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",271575026@qq.com,,,,,,,5,0,0,3,5,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",2475-8868,,978-1-60595-552-0,DESTECH TRANS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,425,427,,,,,,3,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL4IA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450405000081,0

In a monopoly with threat of market entry, this paper analyzes the potential competitor entry decisions in the presence of strategic use of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) by the incumbent and, therefore, the potential anticompetitive effect of CSR. We consider profit sharing (with stakeholders, i.e. a firm's donation) as a form of CSR that is valued by consumers and affects their purchase decisions. An incumbent adopting CSR creates product market differentiation and thus weakens the price competition amongfirms. On the other hand, weaker price competition can encourage potential entrants. To show this result, we develop a three-stage entry game. In the first stage, the incumbent monopolist determines the level of CSR. In the second stage, the potential rival decides whether to enter. In the case of entry, Bertrand competition among the two rivals takes place in the product market in the third stage. Solving the game using backward induction to obtain subgame perfect Nash equilibria, we find that natural barriers to entry (sunk costs) and CSR activity are strategic substitutes, and either of two equilibria can arise: accommodation with a market segmentation or blockaded entry of the potential competitor, depending on the cost structure offirms. This result is in line with the observation that CSR activity can lead to higher market concentration, market segmentation, or both.","[Wojna, Michal; Buccella, Domenico] Kozminski Univ Warsaw, Dept Econ, Warsaw, Poland",Kozminski University,"Wojna, M (通讯作者)，Kozminski Univ Warsaw, Dept Econ, Warsaw, Poland.",michwoj@kozminski.edu.pl; buccella@kozminski.edu.pl,"Buccella, Domenico/F-8981-2019",,,,,,17,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,248,254,,,,,,7,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO8KK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000527683300027,0

Its uniqueness lies in the emphasis on the sociality of language and the emphasis on behavior. From Quine's naturalistic standpoint, he conceived two typical scenes of children's language learning and linguists' translation of strange language. These two scenes highlight their naturalistic position. In the question of how to determine the consistency of stimuli meaning, Quine and his student Davidson proposed the idea of triangulation to explain, and the translation of strange language became an example of applying this strategy. The acquisition of stimulating meaning is related to the symbolization of human beings, whether it is objects or behaviors that are understood as symbols, and the idea of triangulation is easily associated with Pierce's symbolic triangle theory. An attempt to explain Quine's stimulating meaning theory with Pierce's semiotic thinking not only expanded the theoretical perspective of meaning exploration, but also fundamentally treated language as a symbol, which enabled him to gain new insights into the meaning issue. Breakthrough. In the tide of analytic philosophy, the American philosopher WV Quine's practice of turning meaning into the external behavior of people and transforming meaning into stimulating meaning can be described as a sharp alienation, but starting from Frege's From the perspective of psychologism, it can be said that it can be said that it is similar to the others. In the various tasks after the turn of language, the question of what is the meaning is the question that must be faced and solved in the analytical philosophy that this is the core research object.","[Yang, Gao] Yunnan Normal Univ, Sch Philosophy Polit Sci & Law, Kunming 650500, Yunnan, Peoples R China",Yunnan Normal University,"Yang, G (通讯作者)，Yunnan Normal Univ, Sch Philosophy Polit Sci & Law, Kunming 650500, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,1,FRANCIS ACAD PRESS,LONDON,"35 IVOR PL, LOWER GROUND, LONDON, NW1 6EA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-912407-98-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,92,94,,,,,,3,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BL4ID,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450418800019,0

While there is mixed empirical evidence on whether teacher training improves student achievement, some interventions that follow a comprehensive approach on teacher training show positive impacts. In this study we analyze the effect of the Georgian Primary Education Project, an initiative that provided teacher training and other teacher support activities in 122 schools in the Republic of Georgia between 2013 and 2015. We use a quasi-experimental design, specifically a Value-Added model, to estimate the effect of the program on math and Georgian test scores of students that were in grades 1-4 in 2013. We find that the program increased math test scores by 0.27 standard deviations; these gains were observed mostly in students that were in grades 1-3 in 2013, while no effects are observed for students that were in grade 4 in 2013. For Georgian we analyze the results for students that speak Georgian as their native language and for students in minority schools that speak Georgian as a second language. For native speakers we find an average effect of 0.15 standard deviations, in this case, the observed gains are also concentrated in students that were in grades 1-3 in 2013, and no impact is observed on students that were in grade 4 in 2013.

The study evaluates the benefits of an analytical platform for regulatory mechanisms in the healthcare system. Methods: The correspondence analysis is applied to the entire data set containing information regarding medical equipment distribution and mortality. Results: The results highlight regional differences in the use of medical equipment throughout the analysed period from 2008 to 2014. The total amount of medical equipment increased slightly to 9192 devices during the time span. In 2014, there was a significant decrease of 16.44%. Disparities are found in the frequencies and structure of medical equipment. In some regions, medical equipment is not present or is present in low numbers. Conclusions: The results regarding regional disparities demonstrate the regional development of the amount of medical equipment. The deployment of medical equipment is not proportional, and not all of the analysed devices are available in each region. The tests also indicate the appropriateness of the amount of medical equipment and create a platform for further investigation. The results of the analysis suggest the unsuitable distribution of medical equipment throughout the Slovak regions, where there are significant regional disparities.

The challenge to the WTO legal regime is commercial, given the size of SOEs and their share of Chinese output, and political, given worries that trade and investment by SOEs may be driven by public policy goals. And both challenges may be exacerbated by the murky world of Chinese SOEs. In this article, I first review whether Chinese SOEs are a problem for the WTO, and whether more sunshine on their operations might be a useful discipline. I then ask what we know about SOEs inside the WTO, including in the Trade Policy Review Mechanism. Since the answer is, not much, I consider whether mega-regional trade negotiations offer a better approach. My answer being negative, I finally consider whether an attempt to negotiate a WTO Reference Paper on SOEs might help. I conclude that transparency is likely to be a better discipline on the spillovers associated with SOEs than a search for binding rules, while also helping everyone better understand the efficiency effects.","[Wolfe, Robert] Queens Univ, Sch Policy Studies, Kingston, ON, Canada",Queens University - Canada,"Wolfe, R (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Sch Policy Studies, Kingston, ON, Canada.",Robert.wolfe@queensu.ca,,,,,,,41,20,21,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,OCT,2017,16.0,4,,,,,713,732,,10.1017/S1474745617000283,0.0,,,20,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,FK0ML,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413173800009,0

Though evidence suggests improvement in maternal and child health, little is known on the change in OOPE and catastrophic health spending (CHS) since the launch of NHM. Aim: The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive estimate of OOPE and CHS on maternal care by public and private health providers in pre and post NHM periods. Data and method: The unit data from the 60th and 71st rounds of National Sample Survey (NSS) is used in the analyses. Descriptive statistics is used to understand the differentials in OOPE and CHS. The CHS is estimated based on capacity to pay, derived from household consumption expenditure, the subsistence expenditure (based on state specific poverty line) and household OOPE on maternal care. Data of both rounds are pooled to understand the impact of NHM on OOPE and CHS. The log-linear regression model and the logit regression models adjusted for state fixed effect, clustering and socio-economic and demographic correlates are used in the analyses. Results: Women availing themselves of ante natal, natal and post natal care (all three maternal care services) from public health centres have increased from 11% in 2004 to 31% by 2014 while that from private health centres had increased from 12% to 20% during the same period. The mean OOPE on all three maternal care services from public health centres was US$60 in pre-NHM and US$86 in post-NHM periods while that from private health center was US$170 and US$300 during the same period. Controlling for socioeconomic and demographic correlates, the OOPE on delivery care from public health center had not shown any significant increase in post NHM period. The OOPE on delivery care in private health center had increased by 5.6 times compared to that from public health centers in pre NHM period. Economic well-being of the households and educational attainment of women is positively and significantly associated with OOPE, linking OOPE and ability to pay. The extent of CHS on all three maternal care from public health centers had declined from 56% in pre NHM period to 29% in post NHM period while that from private health centres had declined from 56% to 47% during the same period. The odds of incurring CHS on institutional delivery in public health centers (OR.03, 95% CI 0.02, 06) and maternal care (OR 0.06, 95% CI 0.04, 0.07) suggest decline in CHS in the post NHM period. Women delivering in private health centres, residing in rural areas and poor households are more likely to face CHS on maternal care. Conclusion: NHM has been successful in increasing maternal care and reducing the catastrophic health spending in public health centers. Regulating private health centres and continuing cash incentive under NHM is recommended.","[Mohanty, Sanjay K.] Int Inst Populat Sci, Dept Fertil Studies, Govandi Stn Rd, Mumbai 400088, Maharashtra, India; [Kastor, Anshul] Int Inst Populat Sci, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",International Institute for Population Sciences; International Institute for Population Sciences,"Mohanty, SK (通讯作者)，Int Inst Populat Sci, Dept Fertil Studies, Govandi Stn Rd, Mumbai 400088, Maharashtra, India.",sanjayiips@yahoo.co.in,"Mohanty, Sanjay K/AAR-7658-2020","Mohanty, Sanjay K/0000-0001-9041-5952",,,,,50,48,50,1,7,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

Evidence from SHARE,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Retirement; Health behaviour; Fixed effects; Instrumental variables; SHARE,PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; DRINKING; SMOKING; AGE; INTERVENTIONS; VARIABLES; EVENTS; ADULTS; JOB,"This paper investigates changes in health behaviours upon retirement, using data drawn from the Survey of Health Ageing and Retirement in Europe. By exploiting changes in eligibility rules for early and statutory retirement, we identify the causal effect of retiring from work on smoking, alcohol drinking, engagement in physical activity and visits to the general practitioner or specialist. We provide evidence about individual heterogeneous effects related to gender, education, net wealth, early-life conditions and job characteristics. Our main results--obtained using fixed-effect two-stage least squares--show that changes in health behaviours occur upon retirement and may be a key mechanism through which the latter affects health. In particular, the probability of not practicing any physical activity decreases significantly after retirement, and this effect is stronger for individuals with higher education. We also find that different frameworks of European health care systems (i.e. countries with or without a gate-keeping system to regulate the access to specialist services) matter in shaping individuals' health behaviours after retirement. Our findings provide important information for the design of policies aiming to promote healthy lifestyles in later life, by identifying those who are potential target individuals and which factors may affect their behaviour. Our results also suggest the importance of policies promoting healthy lifestyles well before the end of the working life in order to anticipate the benefits deriving from individuals' health investments.","[Celidoni, Martina; Rebba, Vincenzo] Univ Padua, Dept Econ & Management Marco Fanno, Via Santo 33, I-35123 Padua, Italy",University of Padua,"Rebba, V (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dept Econ & Management Marco Fanno, Via Santo 33, I-35123 Padua, Italy.",martina.celidoni@unipd.it; vincenzo.rebba@unipd.it,,"Celidoni, Martina/0000-0002-8399-8755; REBBA, VINCENZO/0000-0003-4685-1890","University of Padua (POPA_EHR-Population aging-economics, health, retirement and the welfare state); Fondazione Farmafactoring","University of Padua (POPA_EHR-Population aging-economics, health, retirement and the welfare state); Fondazione Farmafactoring(Fondazione CarifeFondazione Caritro)","This study was funded by the University of Padua (POPA_EHR-Population aging-economics, health, retirement and the welfare state); Martina Celidoni received research grants from Fondazione Farmafactoring (Bando 2014).",,71,38,41,1,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

We trace a dialectical and inter-twined relationship between technologies of environmental anticipation and forecasting, and technologies of anti-environmentalist anticipation and counter-intervention, one which we argue shapes not only the contemporary politics of anticipation, but in a very material sense, the future conditions of biological and social life on Earth. In so doing we want to address the possible contributions that the field of futures studies can make to reimagining collective agency and ways of being on Earth, whilst reflecting critically upon its genealogical relations to the political reason and strategic horizons of powerful fossil fuel interests, from the crisis of the 1970s to the present. The article also offers a more in-depth contextualization to the other articles in this special issue of Futures on The Politics of Environmental Anticipation. The aim is to bring to the fore the role that social scientists play in environmental anticipation - i.e. drawing attention to the fact that the future could always have been otherwise.","[Granjou, Celine] Univ Grenoble Alps, IRSTEA Grenoble, 2 Rue Papeterie,BP 76, F-38400 St Martin Dheres, France; [Granjou, Celine] Interdisciplinary Lab Sci Innovat & Technol LISIS, UMR PACTE, IRSTEA, 2 Rue Papeterie,BP 76, F-38400 St Martin Dheres, France; [Walker, Jeremy] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Social & Polit Sci, POB 123, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia; [Salazar, Juan Francisco] Western Sydney Univ, Inst Culture & Soc, Parramatta, NSW 2150, Australia",INRAE; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); INRAE; Universite Gustave-Eiffel; University of Technology Sydney; Western Sydney University,"Granjou, C (通讯作者)，Univ Grenoble Alps, IRSTEA Grenoble, 2 Rue Papeterie,BP 76, F-38400 St Martin Dheres, France.;Granjou, C (通讯作者)，Interdisciplinary Lab Sci Innovat & Technol LISIS, UMR PACTE, IRSTEA, 2 Rue Papeterie,BP 76, F-38400 St Martin Dheres, France.",celine.granjou@irstea.fr; jeremy.walker@uts.edu.au; j.salazar@westernsydney.edu.au,,"Walker, Jeremy/0000-0003-0789-3457; Granjou, Celine/0000-0001-5867-0646",,,,,52,67,68,0,12,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,SEP,2017,92.0,,,,SI,,5,11,,10.1016/j.futures.2017.05.007,0.0,,,7,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,FJ9WY,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413133400002,0

In this paper, drugs considered are tobacco and alcohol, which are legal, plus those that are illegal. The social cost is the sum of the external cost: value of loss in quality of life, value of years of life lost and value of loss in productivity, plus public expenditure. Public expenditure consists of public spending on medical care, prevention, and law enforcement, minus savings from unpaid pensions and taxes levied on tobacco and alcohol. The parameters for the calculations have used the recommendations of a French governmental working group (2013) Quinet, L',valuation socio,conomique des investissements publics [Internet], Centre d'Analyse Strategique, 2013, http://www.strategie.gouv.fr/sites/strategie.gouv.fr/files/archives/CGSP_Evaluation_socioeconomique_17092013.pdf, and the health data were derived from the scientific literature. The social costs are a,notsign122 billion for tobacco, a,notsign118 billion for alcohol, and a,notsign8.7 billion for illegal drugs. The largest fraction of the costs (53, 56, and 31 %, respectively) derives from the number of deaths, 79,000 for tobacco, 49,000 for alcohol, and 1600 for illegal drugs, given the high cost of a year of life lost (a,notsign115,000). The external cost corresponds to 86, 97, and 68 % of the social cost, respectively, for tobacco, alcohol, and illegal drugs. The annual drug-related net expenditure represents a,notsign13.9, a,notsign3.0, and a,notsign2.3 billion, respectively, for tobacco, alcohol, and illegal drugs.

Ambiguity as to whether gig-economy workers are independent contractors, dependent contractors or employees allows the undermining of traditional labour standards governing minimum wages and other legislated employment conditions. Labour law and institutions need to catch up to the new reality of this form of work and develop new tools to protect and enhance minimum standards for workers in digital platform businesses. Unions, business and government all have a role to play in the long term. Meanwhile, direct engagement between these new firms and workers' advocates can also help to mitigate the risks posed to labour standards by digital business models, by addressing regulatory gaps.

This paper studies whether the GI Bill, one of the largest public financial aid policies for education, affected low education levels in addition to its documented effects on college education, and whether it increased economic well-being for its beneficiaries. I use the 1970 Census and the variation in WWII military participation rate across birth cohorts and states of birth for men. I find that the WWII GI Bill significantly increased the probability of completing high school by 13 percentage points and reduced the probability of being below the poverty line by 4 percentage points for black and white men.

This policy increased the number of private schools that low income children could access free of charge. I identify the impact of the policy by combining its introduction with variation from a date of birth enrollment cutoff. I show that the differentiated voucher lowered, but only slightly, the probability that students used public schools. Students more likely to move to private schools experienced better school characteristics but no increase in test scores. Further analysis suggests a rise in test scores for students most likely to stay in public schools. These results suggest that the effects of the policy on test scores were caused by responses from public schools, instead of by the re-sorting of students into private schools. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Tourism is a major economic sector that represents approximately 10% of the global GDP and has the potential to drive major changes in forest activities. In the last three decades the boom of coastal tourism created new markets for the emergent community forestry sector in Quintana Roo (SE Mexico). Employing ethnobotanical and archival research methods we analyzed the evolution of management and use of three distinct forest products used in tourism architecture: polewood, thatching materials and chicozapote tree (Manilkara zapota) posts. Current models explain processes of forest product substitution and management intensification either in terms of economic efficiency and resource depletion, or power differences. Our results suggest the need to expand our understanding of extractive cycles to explicitly incorporate multi-scale governance, shifting values, and external shocks (i.e., hurricanes) as major drivers of change of forest products.

There is a widely acknowledged need for more integrated approaches to sustainable land use that reconcile multiple landscape functions, sectors and stakeholders. However, this faces a number of challenges in practice, including the lack of policy coherence and institutional conflicts across agricultural and forest sectors. In this context, the global climate change mitigation mechanism of reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) has been flagged as a unique opportunity to stimulate the development and institutionalization of more integrated, landscape approaches to sustainable land use. In this article, we provide a reality check for the prospects of REDD+ to deliver on this promise, through analyzing three pioneer cases of REDD+ development and implementation in Brazil, Ecuador, and Mexico. We analyze how REDD+ has operated in each of these three contexts, based on field work, key-informant interviews, and analysis of primary and secondary documents. Our findings suggest that REDD+ has stimulated development of niche sustainable land-use investments in each case, which aim to integrate forest conservation and agricultural development goals, but has done so while competing with business as-usual incentives. We conclude that national and international political commitment to more integrated and sustainable land-use approaches is a precondition for, rather than a result of, transformative REDD+ interventions.

Buy-and-hold abnormal returns and cumulative abnormal returns measure the preliminary abnormal returns, zero -investment portfolio approach with rolling regression evaluates the market -based risk premiums, and panel data analyses capture the relative advantages of REITs over their competitors within the timber industry. On average, annualized abnormal returns of 0.5% and 8.9% are identified before and after the REIT conversions. There is no difference between variances of pre-and post-event annualized abnormal returns. Therefore, structural changes have added values to the timber firms in the long run.

This segmentation has appeared in the form of artificial boundaries such as state-managed, community-managed, private concessions etc. Each of these governance modes, on its own, does not have all the strengths and capabilities needed for effective forest governance, especially public forests. These open access forests have multiple and overlapping uses, scale-determined production of goods and services, and high costs of excluding free-riding individuals. The paper shows that by selectively mixing useful elements from each of the modes of governance, we can achieve equity and sustainability in forest governance to a greater extent. These hybrid forms of governance mechanisms ensure accountable and transparent decision-making, include diverse and local perspectives, and co-produce innovative ideas to solve the complex and multi-scaler forestry problems. We demonstrate this through an experiment in the Indian Himalayas, where the unique strengths of each mode - state (authority, scientific expertise), community (local knowledge), elected governments (democratic space and deliberations) were selectively combined to address the principal weaknesses of the existing policy for the distribution of subsidized timber trees from public forests to local households. The paper calls for unpacking hybridity in forest governance through greater conceptual exploration of relational spaces in which different actors interact and negotiate environmental aspects, and co-produce innovative solutions to complex, scaler and interdependent problems. The study is highly relevant in the context that majority of forests in the developing world are state-owned and managed and any introduction of elements of hybrid forms through state-mode can potentially improve social and ecological outcomes.

Although existing studies largely indicate overall trade to be pro-environment, the consequences of IIT may differ owing to greater varieties of intermediate and final goods, easier technology diffusion via trade in similar goods, productivity gains from within-sector reallocations, and increased innovation. However, identification of the causal effect is plagued by the potential endogeneity of IIT attributable to crucial unobservables and measurement error. In this light, utilizing an instrumental variables strategy and data on multiple environmental indicators from roughly 200 countries over 2000-2005, we investigate IIT's impact on the environment. To measure IIT, we rely on two indexes of within-industry specialization based on changes in and levels of sector level trade. Regardless of the indicator of IIT or environmental performance, across several sets of instruments, we mostly find (i) IIT to benefit the environment, (ii) overall trade to be less pro-environment than IIT, and (iii) concerns over endogeneity to be relevant.

Or is the current crisis, a crisis of collapse of manufacturing and wages and under-consumption due to the loss of redistributive power by key socio-political agents, possibly the final crisis of unionism, as argued by Wolfgang Streeck? Some on the political left, such as Streeck, argue that a new phase has been reached where redistributive and oppositional power of organised labour has been not just defeated but destroyed, with enormous consequences for the future of workers and capitalism itself. This article rejects such an overly pessimistic interpretation and asks what the possibility is of the labour movement's again playing its historic role of transforming capitalism. It explores the potential role of organised labour in re-embedding the economy within democratic society, as Karl Polanyi argued, and building a socio-economic structure that is both stable and enhancing of social and environmental health. This problem is approached through a critique of the theories of Polanyi and Streeck and an examination of the unfortunate embrace of labourism and accommodation to neo-liberalism in the Australian labour movement.

We use a unique student-teacher dataset containing variables on a wide set of very specific uses of computer and ICT by teachers matched with data on national standardized tests for 10th grade students. Our identification strategy relies on a within-student between-subject estimator and on a rich set of teacher's controls. We find that computer-based teaching methods increase student performance when they increase students' awareness in ICE use and when they enhance communication. Instead, we find a negative impact of practices requiring an active role of the students in classes using ICE. Our findings suggest that the effectiveness of ICE at school depends on the actual practice that teachers make of it and on their ability to integrate ICE into their teaching process.

Multiculturalism has for long been one the corner stones of the European project but recently, there has been more and more doubt of its sustainability. This paper aims to show that multiculturalism is still alive but it needs thorough reconsiderations if it is to be retained. We argue that it is necessary to look more towards a more dynamic model, such as interculturalism or civic integration. Looking into the problem from three levels, we want to show the need for a theoretical and practical rethinking of European national and political relations. Firstly, from the micro level, public opinion polls will be examined to show how people feel about other nations and minorities. Secondly, from the macro level, legal and institutional changes concerning citizenship status and minority rights will be researched, to show the new ways of states' dealing with the inflow of migrants. Finally, what could be considered as a mid-level, we will look at the political landscape of the European Union, to explore which political parties and coalitions are in power and whether or not it makes a significant shift from the previous decade and the beginning of the twentieth century. The three stated levels of research will provide evidence on the question of the state of multiculturalism in Europe at the moment, which will be discussed from a theoretical overview. It is a matter of the utmost importance due to the recent inflow of migrants and their future status, which is a question on which there is still no agreement at the level of the EU.","[Boskovic, Branko] Univ Donja Gorica, Humanities, Podgorica, Montenegro",University of Donja Gorica,"Boskovic, B (通讯作者)，Univ Donja Gorica, Humanities, Podgorica, Montenegro.",,"Boskovic, Branko/K-3403-2019","Boskovic, Branko/0000-0001-6967-6795",,,,,23,0,0,0,0,Univ Amer College Skopje,Skopje,"Treta Makedonska Brigada nr. 60,, Skopje, MACEDONIA",,,978-608-4607-39-7,,,,2017,,,,,,,99,112,,,,,,14,Demography; Economics; International Relations,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics; International Relations,BO5LL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000518175100007,0

In order to educate visitors about gender equality and reduce the notion of a sex-oriented business precinct, a suitable interpretation is needed and suggested by compromising all of the significant dimensions and presenting it in a provocative way to stimulate visitor's critical thinking through real-world experiences.","[Choomgrant, Korakit] Dhurakij Pundit Univ, Fac Tourism & Hospitality, Bangkok, Thailand",,"Choomgrant, K (通讯作者)，Dhurakij Pundit Univ, Fac Tourism & Hospitality, Bangkok, Thailand.",korakit.cho@dpu.ac.th,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-311-1,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,26.0,,,,,,261,267,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431391300029,0

The CFEBT risk triangle is applied in form of a case study aimed at risk detection of occurrence of accounting errors and frauds for a selected sample of companies. A detailed analysis of a risk of impact of accounting errors and frauds is illustrated in the case study of an accounting unit chosen from the sample of companies evaluated. The CFEBT risk triangle was designed as an analytical tool for detection and management of accounting errors and frauds in the context of Czech accounting standards and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and as a tool for reduction of information asymmetry between creators and users of accounting reports. The risk triangle of accounting errors and frauds may be used for various groups of users of financial statements to enable these users to make decisions at individual levels of access to accounting information. Future research into the CFEBT risk triangle focuses on performance of complex analyses for individual types of business activities of small and middle-sized companies in the context of Czech accounting standards and IFRS.,"[Drabkova, Zita] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Econ, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice,"Drábková, Z (通讯作者)，Univ South Bohemia, Fac Econ, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",drabkova@ef.jcu.cz,"Drábková, Zita/N-2700-2014",,[IGS05C1],,This paper was supported by grant nr.

Hedge effectiveness in accounting theory is understood as a relative measure determining an extent of mutual offset of changes in the market value of the hedged position by changes in the market value of the hedging instrument. Hedge effectiveness assessment aims to demonstrate that a derivative used to hedge the balance sheet item or planned transaction actually meets (or will meet) its objective. This is due to the fact that accounting and financial reporting in particular, allow to hide to some extent the use of derivatives, which can be used for speculative purposes, not hedging. An intention of using derivatives is crucial for potential investors in estimating the risk of investing in entity's shares. The measurement of hedge effectiveness has been widely researched in finance, econometrics and in hedge accounting regulations. IFRS 9 introduces some crucial changes to derivatives accounting and effectiveness testing and therefore it should be critically reviewed. The purpose of this paper is to present the idea of hedge effectiveness measurement and compare the current approach under IAS 39 with those introduced by IFRS 9. This will allow to define advantages and disadvantages of IFRS 9 and assess its impact on quality and usefulness of financial statements in terms of presenting true and fair view of hedging and risk management.","[Dunal, Patryk; Andrzejewski, Mariusz; Ozga, Pawel] Cracow Univ Econ, Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Dunal, P (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Krakow, Poland.",patrykdunal@gmail.com; andrzejm@uek.krakow.pl; p.ozga@interia.pl,,,,,,,9,0,0,2,12,ANGLO-AMER UNIV,PRAHA 1,"LETENSKA 5, PRAHA 1, 118 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-906585-4-7,,,,2017,,,,,,,300,307,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393100023,0

Previous studies have examined how powerful shareholders and shareholder-value-oriented managers promoted this change, but they have failed to capture the fuller extent of the underlying inter-class power dynamics, overlooking how labour contested the change. Building on models of both temporary and permanent layoff announcements made by 679 large US companies from 1984 to 2006, this article examines labour unions' resistance to the shift from temporary to permanent layoffs. Results suggest that labour unions resisted the shift, both by bargaining with firms for more reliance on temporary layoffs, when workforce adjustment was unavoidable, and by discouraging firms from making permanent layoffs through direct confrontation. The results further suggest that the hostile political environment in the 1980s and the early 1990s significantly undermined unions' ability to maintain temporary layoffs, contributing to the shift.","[Jung, Jiwook] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Sociol, Singapore, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Jung, J (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Sociol, Singapore, Singapore.",socjjw@nus.edu.sg,"Jung, Jiwook/H-7612-2013","Jung, Jiwook/0000-0002-9784-1206",National Science Foundation [SES-0926934],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This research was in part supported by National Science Foundation grant SES-0926934 (principal investigator Frank Dobbin).,,85,15,17,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

A two-step estimation procedure is adopted to calibrate Heston's model. First, we find that the option price is affected by both the moneyness and the maturity. Second, Heston's model is more likely to overprice options, whereas the BS model tends to underestimate options. Finally, Heston's model, by employing volatility as a random process, significantly improves the pricing accuracy compared to the BS model. Therefore, Heston's model is tractable to analyze the Chinese stock market indices, and there is volatility risk that must not be overlooked in the Chinese stock market.","[Liu, Guifang; Xu, Weijun] South China Univ Technol, Sch Business Adm, 381,Wushan Rd, Guangzhou 510640, Guangdong, Peoples R China",South China University of Technology,"Xu, WJ (通讯作者)，South China Univ Technol, Sch Business Adm, 381,Wushan Rd, Guangzhou 510640, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",xuwj@scut.edu.cn,"xu, wei/HHD-2891-2022",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71471065, 71171086]; Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University [NCET-10-0401]; Guangzhou Financial Services Innovation and Risk Management Research Base",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University(Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET)); Guangzhou Financial Services Innovation and Risk Management Research Base,"The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71471065, 71171086), the Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (No. NCET-10-0401), and the Guangzhou Financial Services Innovation and Risk Management Research Base.",,16,2,2,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The authors question the national procedure(s), its transparency and the margins of State's discretionary power to decide if and who to award the restructuring aid and initiate the procedure before the European Commission. It is being argued that the wider the discretionary power of the competent authorities who grant restructuring aid, the wider is the potential of negative social, financial and market-wise consequences both for the State as well as the recipient undertaking.

This article has made an initial attempt to study the portfolio diversification strategies for sukuk portfolios across heterogeneous investment horizons. Our findings critically indicate that returns between local currency sukuk in different markets generally have low levels of correlations across different investor holding periods, thus enabling both short and long-run portfolio diversification benefits. However, in contrast, international currency sukuk issued in different markets exhibits high levels of correlations in the longer-term investor holding periods. Also, in the domestic market context, returns on different classes of domestic sukuk are found to exhibit strong correlations in the longer-holding periods.

It is broadly accepted that the relationship between financial depth and GDP growth is non- linear and has the shape of an inverted U - financial depth fosters growth, but only up to a certain threshold, after which it becomes a drag on economic growth. In line with the growth theory, a distinction is made between total factor productivity (TFP) and labour and capital input as the sources of economic growth. Purpose of the article: Our main goal is to examine the consequences of the level and dynamic of financial depth (measured as credit/GDP ratio) for the TFP change. Methodology/methods: We use OLS fixed effect panel and dynamic panel estimation strategies to study relationships between financial depth (level and change) and TFP change, controlling distance to frontier and other control variables. Findings & Value added: Our preliminary results are mixed: there is no empirical evidence supporting the initial view that there is a positive relationship between financial depth and TFP change.","[Pietrucha, Jacek] Univ Econ Katowice, Fac Econ, 1 Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Pietrucha, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, Fac Econ, 1 Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland.",jacek.pietrucha@ue.katowice.pl,"Pietrucha, Jacek/R-5765-2018","Pietrucha, Jacek/0000-0001-5777-9666",,,,,18,0,0,0,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,378,385,,,,,,8,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6MR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426857700040,0
