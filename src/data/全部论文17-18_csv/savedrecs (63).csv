The assignment decision aims to assign a set of transit vehicles from their current locations to trip tasks in a given timetable, where the routing decision needs to route different vehicles to perform the assigned tasks and return to the depot or designated layover locations. When applying the general purpose solvers and task-oriented Lagrangian relaxation framework for real world instances, a thorny issue is that different but indistinguishable vehicles from the same depot or similar locations could commit to the same set of tasks. This inherent solution symmetry property causes extremely difficult computational barriers for effectively eliminating identical solutions, and the lower bound solutions could contain many infeasible vehicle-to-task matches, leading to large optimality gaps. To systematically coordinate the assignment and routing decisions and further dynamically break symmetry during the solution search process, we adopt a variable-splitting approach to introduce task-specific and vehicle-distinguishable Lagrangian multipliers and then propose a sequential assignment process in order to enhance the solution quality for the augmented models with tight formulations. We conduct the numerical experiments to offer the managerial interpretation and examine solution quality of the proposed approach in a wider range of applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, given a nominal timetable for a set of trains and a set of modifications due to delays or other resources unavailability, we are aiming at defining a set of actions which must be implemented to grant safety, e.g., to avoid potential conflicts such as train collisions or headway violations, and restore quality by reducing the delays. To be compatible with real-time management, the required actions must be determined in a few seconds, hence specialized fast heuristics must be used. We propose a fast and effective parallel algorithm that is based on an iterated greedy scheduling of trains on a time-space network. The algorithm uses several sortings to define the initial train dispatching rule and different shaking methods between iterations. The performance is further enhanced by using various sparsification methods for the time space network. The best algorithm configuration is determined through extensive experiments, conducted on a set of instances derived from real-world networks and instances from the literature. The resulting heuristic proved able to consistently resolve the existing conflicts and obtaining excellent solution quality within just two seconds of computing time on a standard personal computer, for instances involving up to 151 trains and two hours of planning time horizon.

We propose a practical solution approach for the GVRP that uses a mixed-integer linear formulation and a reduction procedure. The newly formulation offers two significant advantages: compactness and flexibility. We provide empirical evidence that the formulation and the reduction procedure enable to derive optimal solutions for medium-sized instances using a general-purpose solver. We show that the proposed exact approach consistently outperforms a state-of-the-art branch-and-cut algorithm and constitutes an appealing and practical alternative for optimally solving GVRPs.

This study provides an improved analytical model to mathematically estimate pedestrian delay using renewal theory, which considers driver yielding and vehicle platooning. A generalized model is first provided to accommodate different traffic flow and driver behavior assumptions. Then the proposed model is developed on the basis of a mixture of free traffic and platooned traffic with consideration of driver yielding behaviors to better replicate field conditions in an urban setting. A second application using the HCM 2010 assumptions is also derived to compare it to the HCM 2010 model. Lastly, field data were collected and used for validation from two locations: Gainesville, FL and Washington, D.C. A simulation via MATLAB is performed to evaluate the model results for a variety of cases. The comparisons to the field data as well as the simulation confirm the applicability and accuracy of the proposed model. It is also found that the current HCM 2010 model overestimates the pedestrian delay compared with field data. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: This retrospective cohort study used administrative claims data for a national insurer. Treatment persistence (without switching again, restarting, or discontinuing), treatment effectiveness (defined below), and costs were assessed for the 12-month post-switch period. Patients were effectively treated if they satisfied all six criteria for a treatment effectiveness algorithm (high adherence, no dose increase, no new conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug, no subsequent switch in therapy, no new/increased oral glucocorticoids, and < 2 glucocorticoid injections). Multivariable logistic models were used to adjust for baseline factors. Results: The database included 581 new MOA switchers and 935 TNFi cyclers. New MOA switchers were 39% more likely than TNFi cyclers to persist after the switch (odds ratio [OR]=1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.12-1.74; p=.003) and 36% less likely to switch therapy again (OR=0.64; 95% CI=0.51-0.81; p <.001). New MOA switchers were 43% more likely than TNFi cyclers to be effectively treated (OR=1.43; 95% CI=1.11-1.85; p=.006). New MOA switchers had 16% lower drug costs than TNFi cyclers (cost ratio=0.84; 95% CI=0.79-0.88; p <.001) and 11% lower total costs of rheumatoid arthritis-related medical care (cost ratio=0.89; 95% CI=0.84-0.94; p <.001). Limitations: Claims payments may not reflect rebates or other cost offsets. Medical and pharmacy claims do not include clinical end-points or reasons that lead to new MOA switching vs TNFi cycling. Conclusions: These results support switching to a new MOA after a patient fails treatment with a TNFi, which is consistent with recent guidelines for the pharmacologic management of established rheumatoid arthritis.","[Chastek, Benjamin; Becker, Laura K.] Optum, Eden Prairie, MN USA; [Chen, Chieh-I] Regeneron Pharmaceut Inc, 777 Old Saw Mill River Rd, Tarrytown, NY 10591 USA; [Mahajan, Puneet] Sanofi, Bridgewater, NJ USA; [Curtis, Jeffrey R.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Birmingham, AL USA",Optum; Regeneron; Sanofi-Aventis; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham,"Chastek, B (通讯作者)，Optum, Hlth Econ Observat Res, 11000 Optum Circle, Eden Prairie, MN 55344 USA.",benjamin.chastek@optum.com,,"Curtis, Jeffrey R/0000-0002-8907-8976",Regeneron Pharmaceuticals; Sanofi,Regeneron Pharmaceuticals(Regeneron); Sanofi,Employees of the study sponsors (Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi) participated in the design and analysis of the study and the preparation of this article.,,46,31,33,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

This paper deals with the user equilibrium (UE) problems for the mixed BEVs and traditional gasoline vehicles (GVs) in transportation networks with battery swapping stations and road grade constraints. Under the assumption that electricity consumption rate is not affected by traveling speed or traffic flow, a nonlinear minimization model in terms of path flows is first formulated by incorporating effects of road grade on the electricity consumption rate. The battery swapping action based paths are defined for BEVs in the represented network to facilitate the model building with flow dependent dwell time at the battery swapping stations. The Frank-Wolfe (F-W) algorithm, where descent direction is found by the multi-label method in a pseudo-polynomial time, is adopted to solve the model. Moreover, the aforementioned assumption about the flow independent electricity consumption rate is then relaxed and a system of inequalities has been proposed to formulate the UE conditions. For the nonlinear minimization model, two numerical examples are presented to assess the propose model and algorithm, as well as to analyze the impact of usable battery capacity, BEVs' market share and some attributes of battery swapping stations on the equilibrium link flows and/or swapping flows. The system of inequalities is exactly solved for a small network by path enumeration to demonstrate the non-uniqueness of UE link flow solutions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This study assesses long-term clinical and economic outcomes of peginterferon beta-1a compared with other self-injectable DMTs (interferon beta-1a [22mcg, 30mcg, and 44mcg], interferon beta-1b, and glatiramer acetate 20mg) in the treatment of RRMS, from the National Health Service and Personal Social Services perspective in Scotland. Methods: A previously published, validated Markov cohort model was adapted for this analysis. The model estimates changes in patient disability, occurrence of relapses, and other adverse events, and translates them into quality-adjusted life years and costs. Natural history data came from the ADVANCE trial of peginterferon beta-1a, the London Ontario (Canada) database, and a large population-based MS survey in the UK. The comparative efficacy of each DMT vs placebo was obtained from a network meta-analysis. Costs (2015 British Pounds) were obtained from public databases and literature. Clinical and economic outcomes were projected over 30 years and discounted at 3.5% per year.Results: Over 30 years, peginterferon beta-1a was dominant compared with interferon beta-1a (22, 30, and 44mcg), and interferon beta-1b, and cost-effective compared with glatiramer acetate 20mg. Results: were most sensitive to variations in each DMT's efficacy and acquisition costs. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results.Limitations: The impact of improved adherence with peginterferon beta-1a on clinical and economic outcomes and the impact of subsequent DMTs after treatment discontinuation were not considered. Oral and infused DMTs were not included as comparators. Conclusion: Long-term treatment with peginterferon beta-1a improves clinical outcomes, while its cost profile makes it either dominant or cost-effective compared with other self-injectable DMTs for the treatment of RRMS in Scotland.","[Hernandez, Luis; Guo, Shien; Toro-Diaz, Hector] Evidera Inc, 500 Totten Pond Rd,5th Floor, Waltham, MA 02451 USA; [Carroll, Stuart; Farooq, Syed Feisal Syed] Biogen, Maidenhead, Berks, England",Evidera,"Hernandez, L (通讯作者)，Evidera Inc, 500 Totten Pond Rd,5th Floor, Waltham, MA 02451 USA.",luis.hernandez@evidera.com,"Hernandez, Luis/AAH-1819-2021","Hernandez, Luis/0000-0002-9532-546X; Carroll, Stuart/0000-0002-1237-0370",Biogen,Biogen(Biogen),"This study and resulting manuscript were funded by Biogen, the manufacturer of Peginterferon beta-1a (Plegridy).

J,"Zhang, C; Osorio, C; Flötteröd, G",,,,"Zhang, Chao; Osorio, Carolina; Flotterod, Gunnar",,,Efficient calibration techniques for large-scale traffic simulators,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,,URBAN-TRANSPORTATION PROBLEMS; DESTINATION DEMAND ESTIMATION; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; ASSIGNMENT MODELS; OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHMS; FRAMEWORK; MITIGATION; PREDICTION; MATRICES,Road transportation simulators are increasingly used by transportation stakeholders around the world for the analysis of intricate transportation systems. Model calibration is a crucial prerequisite for transportation simulators to reliably reproduce and predict traffic conditions. This paper considers the calibration of transportation simulators. The methodology is suitable for a broad family of simulators. Its use is illustrated with stochastic and computationally costly simulators. The calibration problem is formulated as a simulation based optimization (SO) problem. We propose a metamodel approach. The analytical meta model combines information from the simulator with information from an analytical differentiable and tractable network model that relates the calibration parameters to the simulation-based objective function. The proposed algorithm is validated by considering synthetic experiments on a toy network. It is then used to address a calibration problem with real data for a large-scale network: the Berlin metropolitan network with over 24300 links and 11300 nodes. The performance of the proposed approach is compared to a traditional benchmark method. The proposed approach significantly improves the computational efficiency of the calibration algorithm with an average reduction in simulation runtime until convergence of more than 80%. The results illustrate the scalability of the approach and its suitability for the calibration of large-scale computationally inefficient network simulators. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: IBS-D patients aged > 18 years with > 1 medical claim for IBS (ICD-9-CM 564.1x) and either >= 2 claims for diarrhea (ICD-9-CM 787.91, 564.5x), >= 1 claim for diarrhea plus >= 1 claim for abdominal pain (ICD-9-CM 789.0x), or >= 1 claim for diarrhea plus > 1 pharmacy claim for a symptom-related prescription within 1 year of an IBS diagnosis were identified from the Truven Health MarketScan database. Inadequate symptom control, resource use, and costs were assessed up to 1 year following the index date. Inadequate symptom control included any of the following: (1) switch or (2) addition of new symptom-related therapy; (3) IBS-D-related inpatient or emergency room (ER) admission; (4) IBS-Drelated medical procedure; (5) diagnosis of condition indicating treatment failure; or (6) use of a more aggressive prescription. Generalized linear models assessed incremental costs of inadequate symptom control. Results: Of 20,624 IBS-D patients (mean age = 48.5 years; 77.8% female), 66.4% had evidence of inadequate symptom control. Compared to those without inadequate symptom control, patients with evidence of inadequate symptom control had significantly more hospitalizations (12.0% vs 6.0%), ER visits (37.1% vs 22.6%), use of outpatient services (73.0% vs 60.7%), physician office visits (mean 11.0 vs 8.1), and prescription fills (mean 40.0 vs 26.7) annually (all p<. 01). Incremental costs associated with inadequate symptom control were $ 3,065 (2013 US dollars), and were driven by medical service costs ($ 2,391; 78%). Limitations: Study included US commercially insured patients only and inferred IBS-D status and inadequate symptom control from claims. Conclusions: Inadequate symptom control associated with available IBS-D therapies represents a significant economic burden for both payers and IBS-D patients.","[Buono, Jessica L.; Andrae, David A.] Allergan Plc, Jersey City, NJ USA; [Mathur, Kush; Averitt, Amelia J.] Axtria Inc, Berkeley Hts, NJ USA",AbbVie; Allergan,"Buono, JL (通讯作者)，185 Hudson St, Jersey City, NJ 07931 USA.",jessica.abel@allergan.com,,,Allergan plc,Allergan plc(AbbVieAllergan),Funding for this manuscript was provided by Allergan plc.

Existing models including day-to-day variability usually represent all variability as unpredictable fluctuations. In reality, however, some of the differences in flows on a road may be predictable for transport planners with access to historical data. For example, flow profiles may be systematically different on Mondays compared to Fridays due to predictable differences in underlying activity patterns. By identifying days of the week or times of year where flows are predictably different, models can be developed or model inputs can be amended (in the case of day-to-day dynamical models) to test the robustness of proposed policies or to inform the development of policies which vary according to these predictably different day types. Such policies could include time-of-day varying congestion charges that themselves vary by day of the week or season, or targeting public transport provision so that timetables are more responsive to the day of the week and seasonal needs of travellers. A statistical approach is presented for identifying systematic variations in daily traffic flow profiles based on known explanatory factors such as the day,of the week and the season. In order to examine day-to-day variability whilst also considering within-day dynamics, the distribution of flows throughout a day are analysed using Functional Linear Models. F-type tests for functional data are then used to compare alternative model specifications for the predictable variability. The output of the method is an average flow profile for each predictably different day type, which could include day of the week or time of year. An application to real-life traffic flow data for a two-year period is provided. The shape of the daily profile was found to be significantly different for each day of the week, including differences in the timing and width of peak flows and also the relationship between peak and inter-peak flows. Seasonal differences in flow profiles were also identified for each day of the week. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Crawford, F.; Watling, D. P.; Connors, R.

Methods: The Blincyto Global Economic Model (B-GEM), a partitioned survival model, was used to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of blinatumomab vs SOC. Response rates, eventfree survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), numbers of cycles of blinatumomab and SOC, and transplant rates were estimated from TOWER. EFS and OS were estimated by fitting parametric survival distributions to failure-time data from TOWER. Utility values were based on EORTC-8D derived from EORTC QLQ-C30 assessments in TOWER. A 50-year lifetime horizon and US payer perspective were employed. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% per year. Results: The B-GEM projected blinatumomab to yield 1.92 additional life years and 1.64 additional quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared with SOC at an incremental cost of $ 180,642. The ICER for blinatumomab vs SOC was estimated to be $ 110,108/QALY gained in the base case. Cost-effectiveness was sensitive to the number and cost of inpatient days for administration of blinatumomab and SOC, and was more favorable in the sub-group of patients who had received no prior salvage therapy. At an ICER threshold of $ 150,000/QALY gained, the probability that blinatumomab is cost-effective was estimated to be 74%. Limitations: The study does not explicitly consider the impact of adverse events of the treatment; no adjustments for long-term transplant rates were made. Conclusions: Compared with SOC, blinatumomab is a cost-effective treatment option for adults with R/R Ph - B-precursor ALL from the US healthcare perspective at an ICER threshold of $ 150,000 per QALY gained. The value of blinatumomab is derived from its incremental survival and health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) benefit over SOC.","[Delea, Thomas E.; Amdahl, Jordan; Boyko, Diana; Hagiwara, May] PAI, Four Davis Court, Brookline, MA 02445 USA; [Zimmerman, Zachary F.; Franklin, Janet L.; Hechmati, Guy] Amgen Inc, Global Dev, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320 USA; [Cong, Ze] Amgen Inc, Global Hlth Econ, San Francisco, CA USA; [Stein, Anthony] City Hope Natl Med Ctr, Dept Hematol & Hematopoiet Cell Transplantat, Duarte, CA USA",Policy Analysis Inc; Amgen; Amgen; City of Hope,"Delea, TE (通讯作者)，PAI, Four Davis Court, Brookline, MA 02445 USA.",tdelea@pai2.com,"cong, z/KCF-0053-2024",,"Amgen, Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA","Amgen, Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA(Amgen)","This work was supported by Amgen, Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA.",,38,18,19,0,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The aim of the present analysis was to evaluate the short-term cost-effectiveness of once-daily liraglutide 1.8mg vs once-daily lixisenatide 20g as an add-on to metformin for treatment of type 2 diabetes in the US by assessing the cost per patient achieving HbA1c-focused and composite treatment targets.Materials and methods: Percentages of patients achieving recommended targets were obtained from the LIRA-LIXI trial, which compared the efficacy and safety of once-daily liraglutide 1.8mg and once-daily lixisenatide 20g as an add-on to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes failing to achieve glycemic control with metformin. Annual costs were estimated from a healthcare payer perspective. An economic model was developed to evaluate the annual cost per patient achieving target (cost of control) with liraglutide 1.8mg vs lixisenatide 20g for five end-points.Results: Annual treatment costs were higher with liraglutide 1.8mg than lixisenatide 20g, but this was offset by greater clinical efficacy, and the cost of control was lower with liraglutide 1.8mg than lixisenatide 20g for all five end-points. The annual cost of control was USD 3,850, USD 11,404, USD 3,807, USD 4,299, and USD 6,901 lower for liraglutide 1.8mg than lixisenatide 20g for targets of HbA1c<7.0%, HbA1c 6.5%, HbA1c<7.0% and no weight gain, HbA1c<7.0% with no weight gain and no confirmed hypoglycemia, and HbA1c<7.0% with no weight gain and systolic blood pressure <140mmHg, respectively.Conclusions: Once-daily liraglutide 1.8mg was associated with greater clinical efficacy than once-daily lixisenatide 20g, which resulted in a lower annual cost of control for HbA1c-focused and composite treatment targets.","[Hunt, B.; McConnachie, C.

Demands are stochastic, can be non-stationary, and are forecast using any model that provides the expected demands and their error term distribution, which can be any theoretical or empirical distribution. We offer a detailed discussion on the modeling of demand stochasticity, focusing on the probabilities and cost effects of undesirable events, such as stock-outs, breakdowns and route failures, and their associated recourse actions. Tractability is achieved through the ability to pre-compute or at least partially pre-process the stochastic information, which is possible under mild assumptions for a general inventory policy. We integrate the stochastic aspect into a mixed integer non-linear program, illustrate applications to various problem classes, and show how to model specific problems through the lens of inventory routing. The case study is based on two sets of realistic instances, representing a waste collection inventory routing problem and a facility maintenance problem, respectively. We analyze the effects of our assumptions on modeling realism and tractability, and demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms deterministic policies in its ability to limit the number of undesirable events for the same routing cost.

The known apparatus in transportation research offers several opportunities to estimate panel effects for well-known and widely applied models such as hazard and dynamic logit models. However, the transportation research community is not endowed with a rich set of methods to account for panel effects in dynamic probabilistic decision trees, which have been used as a formalism for the representation of decision heuristics. Building on scarce prior work in statistics, we elaborate an approach to estimate panel effects in dynamic probabilistic decision trees with multinomial action states. Given that panel data naturally have a hierarchical structure with repeated measures nested within individuals, we implement a mixed-effects model that simultaneously accounts for population-level effects (fixed effects), between-individual variances (random effects), and within-individual variances (autocorrelations). The approach uses an iterative estimation procedure between CHAID-based probabilistic tree induction and Bayesian generalized linear mixture modeling (GLMM). When extracting the dynamic probabilistic decision trees, it is assumed that the random effects are known, while it is assumed that the fixed effects are known when estimating the Bayesian GLMM. This iterative process continues until convergence is reached. A Monte Carlo technique is used to navigate between aggregate choice probabilities and individual level multinomial choices. We also test the significance of temporal autocorrelation within individuals. The suggested approach is illustrated using charging station choice of users of Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEV). Results support the potential value of the suggested approach. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Currently, such conflicts are typically resolved manually by experienced dispatchers. However, it is impossible for them to fully anticipate the impact of their actions on the entire network. This paper proposes a conflict prevention strategy which focuses only on the relevant part of the network and traffic and, consequently, proposes a solution for that part only. The proposed strategy first looks for possible rerouting options by using an optimization model. If no solution is found, a solution based on delaying one of the trains is required. This retimingireordering heuristic uses information from an offline calculation, for determining related conflicts that frequently occur. In this way, a so-called dynamic impact zone is created online for each conflict. When deciding which train to delay, the potential conflicts and the incurred delays of all trains in this dynamic impact zone are taken into account. The performance of this new Conflict Prevention Strategy is compared to a common dispatching strategy, other heuristics, and an exact method. Extensive experiments on a large part of the Belgian railway network show that by considering this dynamic impact zone the total delay can be decreased by at least 67% compared to the basic First Come, First Served decision rule. Moreover, the dynamic impact zone has a reasonable size and scales well to large networks as only the relevant conflicts and their expected consequences are considered. This makes our Dynamic Impact Zone heuristic very fast. The computation time for returning a resolution to a conflict with the proposed conflict prevention strategy is, for 95% of the conflicts, less than two seconds, and at most 26 s, including the creation of the dynamic impact zone of the conflict.

However, there is little consensus on whether this tolling should be in the form of dollars (traditional congestion pricing schemes or price regulation) or in the form of tokens (credit based mobility schemes or quantity regulation). Although the comparison of price and quantity regulation has received significant attention in the economics community, the literature is relatively sparse in the context of transportation systems. The two systems differ not only in terms of transaction costs but also in their efficiency in dealing with demand and capacity shocks, frequent in road transport systems. This difference has been explored by economists in market contexts but the possible parallel in transport systems has largely been overlooked. This paper develops a methodology to compare the performance of price and quantity instruments under uncertainty using a simple transportation network consisting of parallel highway routes and a public transport alternative. Tolls (in dollars or tokens) are differentiated across roads and the permits or tokens can be traded across roads at fixed rates. The demand for each route is determined by a logit mixture model and the supply consists of static congestion. The comparison is based on the optimum social welfare which is computed for each instrument by solving a non-convex optimization problem involving stochastic user equilibrium constraints. Equity considerations are also examined. Numerical experiments across a wide range of demand/supply inputs lead us to the following insights. First, when the tolls in dollars and tokens can be fully adapted to demand and supply shocks (i.e. are day-to-day adaptive), both instruments are equivalent and attain the same optimum social welfare. Second, when the tolling system is not day-to-day adaptive and the supply of tokens is fixed, the quantity instrument performs better than the price instrument typically when the marginal external congestion function has a steeper slope than the demand function. Third, when the tolling system is non-adaptive, but the supply of tokens is day-to-day adaptive, the quantity instrument always outperforms the price instrument in terms of social welfare. Fourth, when the toll revenues and permits are distributed uniformly, this has a positive equity effect but the quantity instrument is more equitable than the price instrument. In view of these results, we argue the case for quantity control in the presence of uncertainty and strongly convex congestion costs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The formulation begins with a modification of the standard ordered response model to adopt the count outcomes nature. This modification is accomplished by introducing a non-linear asymmetric interdependence structure among the error terms using the copula-based model. To avoid simulation maximum-likelihood for evaluating the multi outcome density, we utilize the composite marginal likelihood (CML) approach. The proposed copula-based model with the CML approach allows for asymmetric (tail) dependency without a need for a simulation mechanism. Non-parametric graphical techniques with the empirical copula as well as conventional goodness-of-fit statistics are utilized to guide copula selection. In addition, unobserved heterogeneity across observations is also addressed through a heterogeneous dispersion parameter in the proposed model. The heterogeneous dispersion parameter model is a suitable alternative to random parameter count models in that captures heterogeneity in variance, while allowing for closed form while the latter needs numerical integration or simulation. We apply these techniques to study the interdependence structure among four types of traffic crashes using three years (2005-2007) of cross-sectional crash data record for 274 multilane freeway segments in the State of Washington, USA. These four categories of crash types are the rear end; sideswipe; fixed objects and other crash types. The empirical results show a significant presence of unobserved heterogeneous dependency across these types of crashes. The results indicate the important role of unobserved heterogeneity in variance and covariance structure estimation. An important outcome of this result is that it can affect inference on the relative impact of roadway geometrics on crash occurrence. For example, we find that horizontal curve related parameters on freeway segments substantially increase the joint likelihood of rear-end, sideswipe, fixed objects and other crash types, when compared to the characteristics of vertical curves.

Methods: An observational study assessed infusion time including: clinic visit duration, RA medication preparation and infusion time, and infusion process time. Satisfaction was assessed by a modified Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (patient) and study-specific questionnaires (patient and clinic personnel). Comparative statistical testing for patient data utilized analysis of variance for continuous measures, and Fisher's exact or Chi-square test for categorical measures. Multivariate analysis was performed for the primary time endpoints and patient satisfaction. Results: One hundred and fifty patients were enrolled from six US sites (72 GLM-IV, 78 IFX). The majority of patients were female (80.0%) and Caucasian (88.7%). GLM-IV required fewer vials per infusion (3.7) compared to IFX (4.9; p = .0001). Clinic visit duration (minutes) was shorter for GLM-IV (65.1) compared to IFX (153.1; p < .0001), as was total infusion time for RA medication (32.8 GLM-IV, 119.5 IFX; p < .0001) and infusion process times (45.8 GLM-IV, 134.1 IFX; p < .0001). Patients treated with GLM-IV reported higher satisfaction ratings with infusion time (p < .0001) and total visit time (p = .0003). Clink personnel reported higher satisfaction with GLM-IV than IFX specific to medication preparation time, ease of mixing RA medication, frequency of patients requiring pre-medication, and infusion time. Limitations: Findings may not be representative of care delivery for all RA infusion practices or RA patients. Conclusions: Shorter overall clinic visit duration, infusion process, and RA medication infusion times were observed for GLM-IV compared to IFX. A shorter duration in infusion time was associated with higher patient and clinic personnel satisfaction ratings.","[Daniel, Shoshana R.; McDermott, John D., Jr.] Covance Market Access Serv Inc, Gaithersburg, MD USA; [Le, Cathy] Covance Market Access Serv Inc, San Diego, CA USA; [Pierce, Christine A.] Resource Grp, Richfield, OH USA; [Ziskind, Michael A.] Janssen Biotechnol Inc, Horsham, PA USA; [Ellis, Lorie A.] Janssen Sci Affairs LLC, Horsham, PA USA",Covance; Covance; Johnson & Johnson; Janssen Pharmaceuticals,"Ellis, LA (通讯作者)，Janssen Sci Affairs LLC, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, 800 Ridgeview Dr, Horsham, PA 19044 USA.",lellis@its.jnj.com,,,"Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC; Covance Market Access Services, Inc.","Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC; Covance Market Access Services, Inc.","Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC sponsored the study, and Covance Market Access Services, Inc. received funding for the research and manuscript development.",,16,6,6,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Objective: To investigate differences by SOC in treatment patterns, quality, and cost among patients with cancer undergoing first-line infusion therapy. Research design and methods: This retrospective analysis identified adult patients from Humana medical claims who initiated infusion therapy from 2008-2012 for five common cancer types in which infusion therapy is likely, including early stage breast cancer; metastatic breast, lung, and colorectal cancers; and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Differences by SOC in first-line treatment patterns and quality of care at end-of-life, defined as infusions or hospitalizations 30 days prior to death, were evaluated using Wilcoxon-Rank Sum and Chi-square tests where appropriate. Differences in cost by SOC were evaluated using risk-adjusted generalized linear models. Main outcome measures: Treatment patterns, quality of care at end of life, healthcare costs. Results: There were differences in duration of therapy and number of infusions for some therapy regimens by SOC, in which patients in the HO had shorter duration of therapy and fewer infusions. There were no differences in quality of care at end-of-life by SOC. Total healthcare costs were 15% higher among patients in HO ($55,965) compared with PO ($48,439), p<.0001. Limitations: Analyses was restricted to a claims-based population of cancer patients within a health plan. Conclusion: This study, in an older, predominantly Medicare Advantage oncology cohort, found differences by SOC in treatment patterns and cost, but not quality. Where differences were found, patients receiving care in the HO had shorter duration of therapy and fewer infusions for specific treatment regimens, but higher healthcare costs than those treated in a PO.","[Hopson, Sari; Casebeer, Adrianne; Stemkowski, Stephen; Antol, Dana Drzayich; Tao, Zhuliang; Howe, Andrew] Humana, Comprehens Hlth Insights, Louisville, KY USA; [Patton, Jeffrey] Tennessee Oncol, Nashville, TN USA; [Small, Art; Masaquel, Anthony] Genentech Inc, San Francisco, CA USA",Humana Inc.; Tennessee Oncology; Roche Holding; Genentech,"Hopson, S (通讯作者)，515 W Market St,7th Floor, Louisville, KY 40202 USA.",sari.hopson@gmail.com,,"Hopson, Sari/0000-0002-9835-0839","Genentech, Inc.","Genentech, Inc.(Roche HoldingGenentech)","This research project was funded by Genentech, Inc.

With the availability of newer agents like ixekizumab and secukinumab, there is a need for cost-effectiveness analyses to better reflect current clinical practice. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of a sequence of biologic therapies containing first-line ixekizumab vs first-line secukinumab in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in the UK. Materials and methods: A Markov model with a lifetime horizon was developed to compare the cost- effectiveness of ixekizumab and secukinumab treatment sequences: ixekizumab -> ustekinumab -> infliximab -> best supportive care (BSC) vs secukinumab -> ustekinumab -> infliximab -> BSC. The model used monthly cycles, and included four health states: trial period, treatment maintenance, BSC, and death. At the end of the trial period, responders transitioned to maintenance therapy; non-responders transitioned to the next biologic in the sequence. An annual discontinuation rate of 20% was assumed for maintenance therapy. Results: The ixekizumab sequence provided cost savings of 898 pound (.176,203 pound vs 177,101) [year 2015 values] and gained 0.03 more quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs: 1.45 vs 1.42) vs the secukinumab sequence over the lifetime horizon. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed an 89.8% likelihood that the ixekizumab sequence would be cost-effective at a threshold of 20,000 pound per QALY gained. Limitations: The analysis used list prices for drugs rather than confidential, preferentially priced Patient Access Scheme costs. In addition, efficacy input data were based on a network meta-analysis, as there were no head-to-head trials comparing ixekizumab and secukinumab. Conclusion: First-line treatment with ixekizumab as part of a specific sequential biologic therapy for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in the UK provided slight advantages in cost savings and QALYs gained over a similar treatment sequence initiated with secukinumab. In view of the small magnitude of these differences, factors such as patient preferences (e.g. for number of injections) and long-term safety (e.g. related to time on the market) may also be important for clinical decision-making.","[Johansson, Erin Colleen; Svedbom, Axel] Mapi Grp, Klarabergsviadukten 90,Hus B, S-11164 Stockholm, Sweden; [Hartz, Susanne; Kiri, Sandeep Himatlal; Kumar, Gayathri] Eli Lilly & Co Ltd, London, England",Eli Lilly,"Johansson, EC (通讯作者)，Mapi Grp, Klarabergsviadukten 90,Hus B, S-11164 Stockholm, Sweden.",ejohansson@mapigroup.com,,,Eli Lilly and Company,Eli Lilly and Company(Eli Lilly),This study was funded by Eli Lilly and Company.,,46,5,6,2,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Methods: The Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle study collected health service utilization and health-related expenditure data at the 2011-2012 follow-up surveys. Costing data were available for 4,409 participants. Unit costs for 2016-2017 were used where available or were otherwise inflated to 2016-2017 dollars. Age- and sex-adjusted costs per person were estimated using generalized linear models. Results: The annual total direct cost ranged from $1,998 per person with normal weight to $2,501 per person with obesity in participants without diabetes. For those with diabetes, total direct costs were $2,353 per person with normal weight, $3,263 per person with overweight, and $3,131 per person with obesity. Additional expenditure as government subsidies ranged from $5,649 per person with normal weight and no diabetes to $8,085 per person with overweight and diabetes. In general, direct costs and government subsidies were higher for overweight and obesity compared to normal weight, regardless of diabetes status, but were more noticeable in the diabetes sub-group. The annual total excess cost compared with normal weight people without diabetes was 26% for obesity alone and 46% for those with obesity and diabetes. Limitations: Participants included in this study represented a healthier cohort than the Australian population. The relatively small sample of people with both obesity and diabetes prevented a more detailed analysis by obesity class. Conclusion: Overweight and obesity are associated with increased costs, which are further increased in individuals who also have diabetes. Interventions to prevent overweight and obesity or reduce weight in people who are overweight or obese, and prevent diabetes, should reduce the financial burden.","[Lee, Crystal Man Ying; Colagiuri, Stephen] Univ Sydney, Boden Inst Obes Nutr Exercise & Eating Disorders, Level 2 Charles Perkins Ctr D17, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Lee, Crystal Man Ying] Curtin Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Perth, WA, Australia; [Goode, Brandon; Nortoft, Emil] Novo Nordisk AS, Soborg, Denmark; [Shaw, Jonathan E.; Magliano, Dianna J.] Baker Heart & Diabet Inst, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Sydney; Curtin University; Novo Nordisk; Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute,"Colagiuri, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Boden Inst Obes Nutr Exercise & Eating Disorders, Level 2 Charles Perkins Ctr D17, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",stephen.colagiuri@sydney.edu.au,,"Colagiuri, Stephen/0000-0002-2398-4781; Magliano, Dianna/0000-0002-9507-6096; Lee, Crystal/0000-0001-6613-5491",Novo Nordisk A/S; National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) [233200]; Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing; Abbott Australasia Pty Ltd; Alphapharm Pty Ltd; AstraZeneca; Bristol-Myers Squibb; City Health Centre-Diabetes Service-Canberra; Department of Health and Community Services-Northern Territory; Department of Health and Human Services-Tasmania; Department of Health-New South Wales; Department of Health-Western Australia; Department of Health-South Australia; Department of Human Services-Victoria; Diabetes Australia; Diabetes Australia Northern Territory; Eli Lilly Australia; Estate of the Late Edward Wilson; GlaxoSmithKline; Jack Brockhoff Foundation; Janssen-Cilag; Kidney Health Australia; Marian FH Flack Trust; Menzies Research Institute; Merck Sharp Dohme; Novartis Pharmaceuticals; Novo Nordisk Pharmaceuticals; Pfizer Pty Ltd; Pratt Foundation; Queensland Health; Roche Diagnostics Australia; Royal Prince Alfred Hospital; Sydney; Sanofi Aventis; Sanofi Synthelabo; Victorian Government's OIS Program,Novo Nordisk A/S(Novo Nordisk); National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia); Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Health & Ageing); Abbott Australasia Pty Ltd(Abbott Laboratories); Alphapharm Pty Ltd; AstraZeneca(AstraZeneca); Bristol-Myers Squibb(Bristol-Myers Squibb); City Health Centre-Diabetes Service-Canberra; Department of Health and Community Services-Northern Territory; Department of Health and Human Services-Tasmania; Department of Health-New South Wales; Department of Health-Western Australia; Department of Health-South Australia; Department of Human Services-Victoria; Diabetes Australia; Diabetes Australia Northern Territory; Eli Lilly Australia(Eli Lilly); Estate of the Late Edward Wilson; GlaxoSmithKline(GlaxoSmithKline); Jack Brockhoff Foundation; Janssen-Cilag(Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson USAJanssen Biotech Inc); Kidney Health Australia; Marian FH Flack Trust; Menzies Research Institute; Merck Sharp Dohme(Merck & Company); Novartis Pharmaceuticals(Novartis); Novo Nordisk Pharmaceuticals(Novo Nordisk); Pfizer Pty Ltd(Pfizer); Pratt Foundation; Queensland Health; Roche Diagnostics Australia; Royal Prince Alfred Hospital; Sydney; Sanofi Aventis(Sanofi-Aventis); Sanofi Synthelabo; Victorian Government's OIS Program,"Boden Institute has received funding from Novo Nordisk A/S to conduct this costing study.

We address two questions: (1) Are mainstream economic assumptions of utility-maximization realistic approximations of people's actual behavior? (2) Do people maximize subjective expected utility, particularly in choosing from among the available options? In doing so, we illustrate-in terms of a hypothetical experimental sample of patients with dry eye diagnosiswhy and how utility in pharmacoeconomic assessments might be valued differently by patients when subjective psychological, social, cognitive, and emotional factors are considered. While experimentally-observed or surveyed behavior yields stated (rather than revealed) preferences, behaviorism offers a robust toolset in understanding drug, medical device, and treatment-related decisions compared to the optimizing calculus assumed by mainstream economists. It might also do so more perilously than economists have previously understood, in light of the intractable uncertainties, information asymmetries, insulated third-party agents, entry barriers, and externalities that characterize healthcare. Behavioral work has been carried out in many sub-fields of economics. Only recently has it been extended to healthcare. This offers medical economists both the challenge and opportunity of balancing efficiency presumptions with relatively autonomous patient choices, notwithstanding their predictable, yet seemingly consistent, irrationality. Despite its comparative youth and limitations, the scientific contributions of behaviorism are secure and its future in medical economics appears to be promising.","[Mendoza, Roger Lee] Wilmington Univ, Sch Business, 31 Reads Way, New Castle, DE 19720 USA",Wilmington University,"Mendoza, RL (通讯作者)，Wilmington Univ, Sch Business, 31 Reads Way, New Castle, DE 19720 USA.",roger.l.mendoza@wilmu.edu,"Mendoza, Roger Lee/AAX-2110-2020",,,,,,27,3,4,1,18,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The addition of the monoclonal antibody rituximab to standard chemotherapy has been shown to improve survival in adults with ALL. However, it is unknown whether the addition of rituximab is cost-effective. The objective was to determine the economic impact of rituximab in addition to standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy vs SOC alone in newly-diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-negative, CD20-positive, B-cell precursor ALL. Methods: A decision analytic model was constructed, based upon the Canadian healthcare system. It included the following health states over a lifetime horizon (max approximate to 60 years): event-free survival (EFS), relapsed/resistant disease, cure, and death. SOC was either hyper-CVAD or the Dana Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) ALL consortium. EFS, overall survival, and serious adverse event (SAE) rates were derived from a large randomized controlled trial. Costs of the model included: first-line treatment and administration, disease management, second-line and third-line treatment and administration, palliative care, and SAE-related treatments. Inputs were sourced from provincial and national public data, the literature, and cancer agency input. Results: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) increased by 2.20 QALYs with rituximab in addition to SOC. The resulting mean Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) was C$21,828/QALY. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of C$100,000/QALY, the probability of being cost-effective was 98%. Decision outcomes were robust to the probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses, including the SOC backbone as either hyper-CVAD or DFCI. Limitations: The results of this analysis are limited by generalizability of the chemotherapy backbone to Canadian practice. Conclusions: For adults with ALL, rituximab in addition to SOC was found to be a cost-effective intervention, compared to SOC alone. The addition of rituximab is associated with increased life years and increased QALYs at a reasonable incremental cost.","[Nam, Julian; Milenkovski, Robert; Yunger, Simon] Hoffmann La Roche Ltd, 7070 Mississauga Rd, Mississauga, ON L5N 5M8, Canada; [Geirnaert, Marc; Paulson, Kristjan; Seftel, Matthew] CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Paulson, Kristjan; Seftel, Matthew] Univ Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada",CancerCare Manitoba Foundation; University of Manitoba,"Nam, J (通讯作者)，Hoffmann La Roche Ltd, 7070 Mississauga Rd, Mississauga, ON L5N 5M8, Canada.",julian.nam@roche.com,"Seftel, Matthew/L-9607-2019","Nam, Julian/0000-0002-2403-1704",,,,,38,7,8,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

In doing so, while incorporating evacuation time considerations, we also take a cost perspective in designing an effective evacuation network. Both the network design and the associated cost considerations in evacuation planning are commonly ignored in the literature due to a focus on evacuation time and the associated flow routing objective. We propose a mathematical model for Strategic Evacuation Network Design (SEND) that prescribes shelter regions and capacities, intermediate locations that support/supply for en route evacuees as well as road segments and their capacities under evacuation time constraints. To solve our model, we devise an efficient Benders Decomposition based approach enhanced with surrogate constraints, strengthened Benders cuts, heuristics, and the use of multi-cuts. We apply our methodology to solve test instances developed based on real data from Central Texas. We demonstrate by our analysis that the resulting approach does not only provide us with a means to design evacuation networks but also serves as a tool to study the trade-offs involved in design and operational performance measures as it captures the essence of high-level interactions between them.

HRV testing could be combined with putative ANS biologic pathways to improve treatment response for RA patients. This study explored potential costs and health outcomes of introducing HRV testing into RA treatment, without and with ANS optimization. Methods: A decision tree exploratory economic model compared HRV testing to standard care in moderate-to-severe biologic-eligible patients over a 10-year time horizon. HRV data was derived from an observational study of RA patients (n=33). Patients were stratified into treatment groups based on HRV test scores indicating low probability of response and moderate to high probability of response. This study explored adding ANS optimization based on HRV score followed by clinically-appropriate treatment. Costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for the US population were estimated. Results: HRV testing in biologic-eligible patients decreased non-effective biologic use, reducing US healthcare costs by $34.6 billion over 10 years with QALYs unchanged. When combined with ANS optimization in biologic-eligible patients, HRV testing could increase costs by $3.6 billion over 10 years but save over 350,000 QALYs. Among all RA patients, HRV testing with ANS optimization could save over $8 billion and over 100,000 QALYs over 10 years, depending on the positive predictive value (PPV) of the HRV test. Conclusions: The potential economic impact of introducing HRV testing and ANS optimization into RA treatment appears substantial and cost-effective based on the exploratory analysis. Additional rigorous studies are warranted in larger patient samples to better inform decision-making.","[Zimmermann, Marita; Vodicka, Elisabeth; Garrison, Louis P., Jr.] Global Hlth LLC, Seattle, WA USA; [Holman, Andrew J.] Inmedix LLC, Seattle, WA USA",,"Zimmermann, M (通讯作者)，1523B NW 64th St, Seattle, WA 98107 USA.",marita@cghllc.org,,,"Inmedix, Inc.","Inmedix, Inc.","This study was funded by Inmedix, Inc.",,54,4,6,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

We present two models corresponding to two scenarios: port competition when port companies invest in port capacity for profit and port competition when port cities invest in port capacity for local GDP. It is verified that the profit-oriented investment in a multi-port region may reach Nash equilibrium, while the GDP-oriented investment cannot reach Nash equilibrium. The results of the case study show that the GDP-oriented investment is much greater than the profit-oriented investment. When the investment capacities of port cities are approximately the same, all port cities will actively invest in their ports, and a city's higher average investment return may decrease its willingness to invest in its ports.

In this study, we propose a first-order behavioral model of capacity drop at a continuous lane-drop bottleneck. By extending the theoretical framework for analytically solving the generalized Riemann problem in Jin (2017), we introduce vehicles' bounded acceleration on the LWR (Lighthill-Whitham-Richards) stationary states inside the lane-drop zone as an additional constraint for the optimization formulation of the entropy condition. We demonstrate that the optimization problem is uniquely solved with well-defined instantaneous continuous standing waves, comprised of the LWR stationary states inside the lane-drop and the bounded acceleration stationary states in the downstream acceleration zones. In the solutions to the generalized Riemann problem, the boundary flux as well as the stationary states and kinematic waves on both upstream and downstream links are the same as those in the phenomenological model of capacity drop proposed in Jin et al. (2015). This is a behavioral model of capacity drop, since both the dropped capacity and the capacity drop ratio are endogenous and can be calculated from the factors related to the fundamental diagram, road geometry, bounded acceleration, and lane changes. We present the Cell Transmission Model for the behavioral and phenomenological models and verify the theoretical results with numerical examples. We calibrate and validate the model with observed stationary speeds at a lane-drop bottleneck. Combined with Jin (2017), this study provides a proof of the conjecture by Hall and Agyemang-Duah (1991) that capacity drop results from the acceleration process when drivers accelerate away from the (upstream) queue.

However, these predictions are inherently uncertain due to factors, such as weather. This paper presents a novel computationally efficient algorithm to address uncertainty in ATFM by using a chance-constrained optimization method. First, a chance-constrained model is developed based on a previous deterministic Integer Programming optimization model of ATFM to include probabilistic sector capacity constraints. Then, to efficiently solve such a large-scale chance-constrained optimization problem, a polynomial approximation-based approach is applied. The approximation is based on the numerical properties of the Bernstein polynomial, which is capable of effectively controlling the approximation error for both the function value and gradient. Thus, a first-order algorithm is adopted to obtain a satisfactory solution, which is expected to be optimal. Numerical results are reported in order to evaluate the polynomial approximation-based approach by comparing it with the brute-force method. Moreover, since there are massive independent approximation processes in the polynomial approximation-based approach, a distributed computing framework is designed to carry out the computation for this method. This chance-constrained optimization method and its computation platform are potentially helpful in their application to several other domains in air transportation, such as airport surface operations and airline management under uncertainties.

(iii) First-best charges can lead capacity investment to be socially efficient. However, weight-related per-flights charges result in under-investment, whereas the MOC pricing results in over-investment in runway capacity. (iv) Private hubs that charge positive movement-related per-flight charges subsidize passengers through per-passenger charges.

Methods: The data used in this study was from the 2014 national insurance database sponsored by the China Health Insurance Research Association (CHIRA), that covers national urban employees and residents. ICD-10 codes and keywords indicating heart failure diagnoses were used to identify patients with heart failure. Drug utilization, hospital visits, re-admission, and treatment costs in different service categories were examined. Results: A total of 7,847 patients were included in this analysis, of which 1,157 patients had a 1-year complete follow-up period. In total, 48.16% of patients received the combination treatment of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) and beta-blockers (BB); and 22.87% of patients received the combination treatment of ACEI/ARB, beta-blockers and Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs). The annual treatment cost per patient with HF diagnosis was RMB 28,974, of which 66% was for inpatient care. The cost on HF medications accounted for 8.2% of annual cost. Treatment cost was much higher in provincial-level municipalities than that of prefecture-level and other cities. Discussion and conclusion: Hospitalization is a major driver of HF treatment cost. Compared to the requirements in international treatment guidelines, HF standard of care medication treatment was under-utilized among HF patients in China. The high re-admission rate among Chinese patients indicates that the management of HF needs to be improved. The percentage of GDP spent on treating HF patients was much lower than that in the developed countries.","[Huang, Jun] Nanjing Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Yin, Hongjun] Centennial Sci Co Ltd, Warren, NJ USA; [Zhang, Milun; Ni, Qian] Novartis Pharmaceut China, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xuan, Jianwei] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Hlth Econ Res Inst, Guagzhou, Peoples R China",Nanjing Medical University; Sun Yat Sen University,"Yin, HJ (通讯作者)，Centennial Sci Co Ltd, Med Res, 37 Sneider Rd, Warren, NJ 07059 USA.",henry.yin@centiennialmed.com,"Yin, Hong/AAC-5784-2020",,Novartis AG,Novartis AG,Novartis AG sponsored this study.,,17,48,55,4,42,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

This study aimed to evaluate clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, and the socio-economic burden of COPD in Eastern-Europe, taking Bulgaria as a reference case. Methods: A representative sample of Bulgarian patients with COPD was randomly chosen by pulmonologists, based on the following inclusion criteria: COPD diagnosis with at least 1 year of living with COPD, >= 40 years of age, and use of COPD medication. Patient characteristics, treatment, quality-of-life, healthcare resource use, and costs were systematically assessed. Results: A total of 426 COPD patients were enrolled. Approximately 69% were male, 40% had occupational risk factors, 45% had severe and 11% had very severe COPD. Mean CAT scores were 13.80 (GOLD A), 21.80 (GOLD B), 17.35 (GOLD C), and 26.70 (GOLD D). Annual per-patient costs of healthcare utilization were Euro579. Yearly pharmacotherapy costs were Euro693. Indirect costs (reduced and lost work productivity) outnumbered direct costs three times. Conclusions: Bulgaria has relatively high percentages of (very) severe COPD patients, resulting in considerable socio-economic burden. High smoking rates, occupational risk factors, air pollution, and a differential health system may be related to this finding. Eastern-European COPD strategies should focus on prevention, risk-factor awareness, and early detection.","[Kamusheva, Maria; Dimitrova, Maria; Mitov, Konstantin; Doneva, Miglena; Petkova, Valentina; Petrova, Guenka] Med Univ Sofia, Dept Org & Econ Pharm, Fac Pharm, Sofia, Bulgaria; [van Boven, Job F.

It contributes to the spatial analysis field by allowing a flexible and parametric skew-normal distribution for the kernel error term in traditional specifications of the spatial model. The resulting model is estimated using Bhat's (2011) maximum approximate composite marginal likelihood (MACML) inference approach. The model is applied to an analysis of bicycling frequency, using data from the 2014 Puget Sound household travel survey undertaken in the Puget Sound region in the State of Washington in the United States. Our results underscore the important effects of demographic variables, as well as the miles of bicycle lanes in an individual's immediate residential neighborhood, on bicycling propensity. An interesting finding is that women and young individuals (18-34 years of age) in particular warm up to bicycling as more investment is made in bicycling infrastructure, thus leading not only to a larger pool of bicyclists due to bicycling infrastructure enhancements, but also a more diverse and inclusive one. The results highlight the importance of introducing social dependence effects and non-normal kernel error terms from a policy standpoint. Specifically, our results suggest that ignoring these effects, as has been done by all earlier bicycling studies, can underestimate the impacts of bicycling infrastructure improvements and public campaigns on bicycle use frequency, potentially leading to under-investments in bicycling infrastructure projects.

This study compared ENZA with AA in chemotherapy-naive mCRPC by calculating the number needed to treat (NNT) and associated incremental costs to achieve one additional chemotherapy-naive patient with mCRPC free of radiographic progression, chemotherapy, or death over a 1-year time horizon. Methods: Clinical outcomes were obtained from the PREVAIL and COU-AA-302 trials. Three outcomes were evaluated: radiographic progression-free survival, time to cytotoxic chemotherapy initiation, and overall survival at 1 year. NNT was calculated as the reciprocal of the outcome event rate difference for ENZA compared with AA. The incremental costs to achieve one additional outcome at 1 year were calculated as the difference in cost per treated patient multiplied by the NNT. Per-treated-patient costs were considered from a US payer perspective and included medications, monitoring, adverse events, post-progression treatments, and end-of-life care. Results: Within a 1-year time horizon, the total cost per treated patient for ENZA was $2,666 less than AA. Compared with AA, treating 14 patients with ENZA resulted in one additional patient free of progression or death over 1 year; treating 26 patients with ENZA resulted in one additional patient with chemotherapy delayed over 1 year; and treating 91 patients with ENZA resulted in one additional patient free of death over 1 year. Therefore, ENZA is cost-effective compared with AA for all three outcomes evaluated, and the modeled results suggest ENZA is associated with potentially improved clinical outcomes in delaying chemotherapy initiation and disease progression for chemotherapy-naive patients. The results are robust in sensitivity analyses, where the effect of changes in key model inputs and assumptions were tested. Conclusion: The results modeled in the present study suggest ENZA is cost-effective compared with AA for treating chemotherapy-naive patients with mCRPC.","[Massoudi, Marjan; Bui, Cat N.; Pandya, Bhavik J.; Brown, Bruce; Flanders, Scott] Astellas Pharma Inc, 1 Astellas Way, Northbrook, IL 60062 USA; [Balk, Mark; Barlev, Arie] Medivation Inc, San Francisco, CA USA; [Yang, Hongbo; Guo, Jenny; Song, Yan; Wu, Eric Q.] Anal Grp, Boston, MA USA",Astellas Pharmaceuticals; Medivation; Analysis Group Inc.,"Massoudi, M (通讯作者)，Astellas Pharma Inc, 1 Astellas Way, Northbrook, IL 60062 USA.",marjan.massoudi@astellas.com,,,"Astellas Pharma, Inc.; Medivation, Inc.","Astellas Pharma, Inc.(Astellas Pharmaceuticals); Medivation, Inc.","This research was sponsored by Astellas Pharma, Inc. and Medivation, Inc., the co-developers of enzalutamide.",,41,17,17,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Further, free molecular monitoring has been provided to patients at top clinical centers as part of a pilot study that has changed the local treatment pattern and outcomes of patients with CML. This study evaluates the impact of medical insurance coverage and the molecular monitoring frequency on outcomes of patients with CML treated at a central hospital in Jiangsu, China, according to patient-level data. Methods: The study investigated 335 CML patients receiving medical treatment in a central hospital between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2014. Demographic and clinical characteristics were extracted from the patients' clinical records. Univariate and multivariate analyses using the logistic regression model were performed to identify the differences in outcomes of major molecular response (MMR) or complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) between patients who were insured vs uninsured, or between patients with frequency of PCR monitoring <= 2 times vs <= 3 times per year. Results: Both the achievement of MMR (BCR-ABL(IS) <= 0.1%) (50.4% vs 37.5%) and CCyR (80.7% vs 62.8%) at 12 months have shown significant differences that favored patients with insurance coverage of imatinib, while there was no significant difference in the outcome of BCR-ABLIS <= 1% between insured and non-insured groups (56.0% vs 51.3%) at 6 months. The long-term results at 24 months demonstrated that there was a statistically significant difference in MMR rates between the group with 3 or more PCR monitoring tests per year and the group of patients with 2 or less PCR tests per year (76.9% vs 52.2%). Conclusions: The study findings suggest that CML patients benefit from insurance coverage of imatinib and higher frequency (>= 3) of regularly scheduled molecular monitoring PCR in China.","[Sheng, Guangying; Chen, Suning; Zhang, Ri; Miao, Miao; Wu, Depei] Soochow Univ, Dept Hematol, Jiangsu Inst Hematol, Key Lab Thrombosis & Hemostasis,Minist Hlth,Affil, Suzhou, Peoples R China; [Tan, Seng Chuen] IMS Hlth Asia Pacific, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Singapore, Singapore; [Liu, Chao] Novartis Oncol China, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xiong, Tengbin] IMS Hlth China, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Soochow University - China,"Xiong, TB (通讯作者)，IMS Hlth, 12-F,Garden Sq,968 West Beijing Rd, Shanghai 200041, Peoples R China.",tbxiong@cn.imshealth.com,"miao, miao/KBP-8629-2024; Sheng, Guangying/JQW-2717-2023; Chen, Su/IXX-1915-2023",,Novartis,Novartis(Novartis),This project was sponsored by Novartis.,,32,4,4,1,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

A mobile application, Karada-no-kimochi, predicts the menstrual cycle based on recorded data, and provides the information regarding menstruation. This study investigates the effectiveness of the application from health condition and labor productivity loss perspectives, and evaluates its cost-effectiveness for employed women in Japan. Materials and methods: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was performed to compare the use of the application and non-intervention in female workers (20-45 years) based on an online survey. A discrete-event model based on the RCT data, published literature, and claims data was used for the cost-effectiveness analysis. Results: The intervention and non-intervention groups comprised 612 and 914 women, respectively. In the intervention group, the incidences of depression (0.16%) and dysmenorrhea (0.33%) were significantly lower than those of the non-intervention group (0.77% and 1.31%, respectively) in the third month. While labor productivity and absenteeism varied, presenteeism showed almost no change across groups. The quality-adjusted life year in the intervention group was 6.84 (0.07 higher than that in the non-intervention group). By analyzing medical expenses and making assumptions regarding productivity, we estimated that the aggregate of medical expenses, productivity loss, and application fee for the intervention group could be lower than that of the non-intervention group by over JPY 130,000 (USD 1,170, as of December 2017) per individual. Limitations: The subjects included were willing or relatively willing to use the application. Because all outcomes were based on online surveys, the results depended on the objectivity and preciseness of the reports provided by users, and those with severe symptoms might not provide reports. Conclusions: The results suggest that using the application is cost-effective and might reduce the incidence of dysmenorrhea and depression.","[Song, Mihyon] Marunouchi Mori Ladies Clin, Tokyo, Japan; [Kanaoka, Hidenobu] Docomo Healthcare Inc, Tokyo, Japan",,"Kanaoka, H (通讯作者)，Docomo Healthcare Inc, Shibuya Ku, 1-19-19 Ebisu, Tokyo 1500013, Japan.",hidenobu.kanaoka.hk@d-healthcare.co.jp,,,"docomo Healthcare, Inc.","docomo Healthcare, Inc.","This study was supported by docomo Healthcare, Inc.",,34,11,11,1,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The resulting MILP has a clear network structure and requires fewer binary variables and constraints as compared with those in the existing formulations. We then extend the problem so as to treat the stochastic fluctuations in traffic demand. We here develop an accurate and efficient approximation method of expected delays and a solution method for the stochastic version of the signal optimization by exploiting the network structure of the problem. Using a set of proposed methods, we finally examine the optimal control parameters for deterministic and stochastic coordinated signal controls and discuss their characteristics.

In Part 1 of the paper (Luan et al., 2018), three integrated optimization problems, namely the P-NLP problem (NLP: nonlinear programming), the P-PWA problem (PWA: piecewise affine), and the P-TSPO problem (TSPO: train speed profile option), have been developed for real-time traffic management that inherently include train control. A two-level approach and a custom-designed two-step approach have been proposed to solve these optimization problems. In Part 2 of the paper, aiming at energy-efficient train operation, we extend the three proposed optimization problems by introducing energy-related formulations. We first evaluate the energy consumption of a train motion. A set of nonlinear constraints is first proposed to calculate the energy consumption, which is further reformulated as a set of linear constraints for the P-TSPO problem and approximated by using a piecewise constant function for the PNLP and PPWA problems. Moreover, we consider the option of regenerative braking and present linear formulations to calculate the utilization of the regenerative energy obtained through braking trains. We focus on two objectives, i.e., delay recovery and energy efficiency, through using a weighted-sum formulation and an epsilon-constraint formulation. With these energy-related extensions, the nature of the three optimization problems remains same to Part 1. In numerical experiments conducted based on the Dutch test case, we consider the P-NLP approach and the P-TSPO aspects; the P-PWA approach is neglected due to its bad performance, as evaluated in Part 1. According to the experimental results, the P-TSPO approach still yields a better performance within the required computation time. The trade-off between train delay and energy consumption is investigated. The results show the possibility of reducing train delay and saving energy at the same time through managing train speed, by up to 4.0% and 5.6% respectively. In our case study, applying regenerative braking leads to a 22.9% reduction of the total energy consumption. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The two networks intersect and interweave with each other throughout the city to furnish various route options for serving transit patrons with distinct ODs. The optimal design problem of this bimodal transit system, however, has not been well explored in the literature, partly due to the difficulty of modeling the patrons' complex route choice behavior in the bimodal networks. In light of this, we formulate parsimonious continuum models for minimizing the total cost of the patrons and the transit agency for an intersecting bimodal transit network in a grid city, where the perpendicular local and express lines intersect at transfer stops. Seven distinct route types are identified in this network, which represent realistic intra- and inter-modal route options. A lower-level assignment problem between these routes is embedded in the upper-level network design optimization problem. We develop an efficient method to find near-optimal designs of the intersecting network. Numerical results unveil a number of insightful findings, e.g., that sizable cost savings are observed for the intersecting bimodal design as compared to the single-mode designs for moderate to high demand levels, and that only moderate benefits are observed as compared to the trunk-feeder designs under certain operating conditions. We also show that the conventional practice of designing the local and express networks separately would greatly undermine the benefit of the bimodal system. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The presence of temporal, spatial and directional demand imbalances is unavoidable in a public transport network. It is not obvious, however, how the magnitude of demand imbalances may affect its economic and financial performance. We show in a simple back-haul setting with elastic demand, controlling for total willingness to pay in the network, that asymmetries in market size reduce the attainable social surplus of a service, while variety in maximum willingness to pay leads to higher aggregate social surplus and lower subsidy under efficient pricing. The analysis of multi-period supply sheds light on the relationship between urban structure, daily activity patterns, and public transport performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, this work did not examine other high-cost patients in depth or whether they had any MHA-related costs. The objective of this analysis was to examine the role of MHA-related care among other high-cost patients.Methods: Using administrative healthcare data from Ontario, Canada, this study selected all patients in the 90th percentile of the cost distribution in 2012. It focused primarily on two groups based on the percentage of MHA-related costs relative to total costs: (1) high-cost patients with some MHA-related costs (0%>and <50%) and (2) high-cost patients with no MHA-related costs (0%). We examined socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, utilization and costs for both groups, and modeled patient-level costs using appropriate regression techniques. We also compared these groups with high-cost patients with a majority of MHA-related costs (>50%).Results: High-cost patients with some MHA-related costs incurred over 40% more costs than those without ($27,883 vs $19,702). Patients with some MHA-related costs were older, lived in poorer neighborhoods, and had higher levels of comorbidity compared to those without. After controlling for relevant variables, having any type of MHA-related utilization increased costs by $2,698. Having a diagnosis of psychosis had a large impact on costs.Limitations: This study did not examine children and adolescents. We were only able to account for 91% of all costs incurred by the public third-party payer; addiction-related costs from community-based agencies were not available.Conclusions: High-cost patients with MHA incur higher costs compared to those without. When considering interventions aimed at high-cost patients, policy-makers should consider their complex nature, specifically both their physical and MHA-related comorbidities.","[de Oliveira, Claire; Rehm, Juergen; Kurdyak, Paul] CAMH, 33 Russell St,Room T414, Toronto, ON M5S 2S1, Canada; [de Oliveira, Claire; Cheng, Joyce; Kurdyak, Paul] ICES, Toronto, ON, Canada; [de Oliveira, Claire; Kurdyak, Paul] Univ Toronto, IHPME, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Rehm, Juergen] Univ Toronto, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Rehm, Juergen] Tech Univ Dresden, Dresden, Germany; [Kurdyak, Paul] Univ Toronto, Dept Psychiat, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto; Centre for Addiction & Mental Health - Canada; University of Toronto; University of Toronto; University of Toronto; Technische Universitat Dresden; University of Toronto,"de Oliveira, C (通讯作者)，CAMH, 33 Russell St,Room T414, Toronto, ON M5S 2S1, Canada.",claire.deoliveira@camh.ca,,"Kurdyak, Paul/0000-0001-8115-7437; de Oliveira, Claire/0000-0003-3961-6008",,,,,32,11,11,0,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Materials and methods: This cross-sectional study identified adults with type 1 or 2 DM (T1D, T2D) in the Optum database. The main independent variable was provider (endocrinologist or primary care). Regression analysis compared total medical and pharmacy costs, adjusting for health status and other patient differences, by provider. Results: For all patients, HbA1C improvement was greater, and medical costs significantly lower with an endocrinologist rather than a primary care provider. The largest HbA1C improvement (4%) occurred for insulin-dependent patients seen by endocrinologists. Significant medical savings with endocrinologist management occurred within the Medicare Advantage population in every sub-group of patients, with 14% lower costs ($4,767) for patients with T1D, 11% lower costs ($3,160) for patients with macro-and microvascular complications, and 10% lower costs ($2,237) for insulin-dependent patients. Within the commercial insurance population, medical costs were reduced by >= 9% in every sub-group of patients, with a 20% reduction ($8,450) for patients with micro- and macrovascular complications. Overall total costs {medical and pharmacy) were 8% ($1,541) higher for patients receiving endocrinologist rather than primary care, although endocrinologist care resulted in a 9% reduction (-$3,710) in costs for Medicare Advantage patients with T1D. Total medical costs (excluding pharmacy costs) may be a more accurate indicator of costs associated with patients in various stages of DM. Limitations: There was insufficient data to develop risk-adjustment payments for pharmacy costs based on disease severity. The cross-sectional design identifies associations and not cause-effect relationships. Conclusion: DM management by an endocrinologist was associated with greater HbA1C improvement and significantly lower medical costs. Total costs were higher with an endocrinologist, but for patients with T1D lower costs were seen, ranging from 2-9% regardless of insurance type.","[Gill, Max; Chhabra, Harmeet; Shah, Mona; Zhu, Cyrus] Medtron Diabet, 18000 Devonshire St, Northridge, CA 91325 USA; [Lando, Howard] Med Specs Northern VA, Alexandria, VA USA; [Caldarella, Felice] Ctr Endocrine Hlth, Bridgewater, NJ USA",,"Chhabra, H (通讯作者)，Medtron Diabet, 18000 Devonshire St, Northridge, CA 91325 USA.",harmeet.chhabra@medtronic.com,,"Zhu, Cyrus/0000-0002-7322-1731",Medtronic - Diabetes,Medtronic - Diabetes,"Sarah Staples, MA, ELS, assisted with manuscript preparation and was paid by Medtronic - Diabetes.",,10,5,5,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Materials and methods: Adults with MDD and antidepressant treatment (ADT) who newly initiated adjunctive aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, lurasidone, or quetiapine between October 1, 2014 and September 30, 2015 were identified in the IQVIA Real-World Data Adjudicated Claims database; the index date was the date of the first AAP claim. Patients were stratified into three cohorts: AAP initiated in the first year (Y1); in the second year (Y2); and more than 2 years (Y3) of first ADT use. Within each cohort, HRU and costs were compared between the 12 months before and after the index date. Pre-post changes in HRU and costs were then compared between cohorts. Results: Five hundred and six (36.7%) patients were categorized as Y1; 252 (18.3%) as Y2; and 622 (45.1%) as Y3. AAP use was associated with significantly decreased rates of all-cause and MDD-related hospitalization and emergency department visits, and increased rates of pharmacy fills and physician office visits; and the magnitude of changes was largest in cohort Y1. Cohort Y1 had the largest reductions in mean (SD) all-cause medical costs per patient (-$10,496 +/-$85,022, p=.015) compared to Y2 (-$2,474 +/-$85,022, p=.572) and Y3 (-$472 +/-$31,334, p=.823), mainly due to the reduction in hospitalization. After adjusting for differences in baseline characteristics, the largest reductions in hospitalization and medical costs were observed in cohort Y1. Similar increases in all-cause pharmacy costs were seen in all cohorts. A similar trend in costs was observed in MDD-related healthcare services. Limitations and conclusions: AAP treatment was associated with reductions in all-cause and MDD-related medical costs, primarily in decreased hospitalization. The reductions were largest among patients who initiated treatment in the first year.","[Seetasith, Arpamas; Burudpakdee, Chakkarin] IQVIA, Fairfax, VA USA; [Greene, Mallik] Otsuka Pharmaceut Dev & Commercializat Inc, Princeton, NJ USA; [Hartry, Ann] Lundbeck, Deerfield, IL USA",IQVIA; Otsuka Pharmaceutical,"Greene, M (通讯作者)，Otsuka Pharmaceut Dev & Commercializat Inc, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, 508 Carnegie Ctr, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",mallik.greene@otsuka-us.com,"Burudpakdee, Chakkarin/AAE-7316-2019",,"Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development & Commercialization, Inc; Lundbeck, USA","Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development & Commercialization, Inc(Otsuka Pharmaceutical); Lundbeck, USA","This study was funded by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development & Commercialization, Inc and Lundbeck, USA.

Electric vehicles have been successfully introduced into the market. However, their use seems to be limited to urban transport since recharging facilities are readily available only near home and work. Planning recharging infrastructure for electric vehicles is highly relevant because this will enable longer trips, including inter-state travel which requires multiple battery charges. Among various models to determine optimal locations of recharging stations, a flow refueling location model (FRLM) is considered in this study. It determines locations for recharging stations to maximize the flow that can travel between origin and destination pairs by refueling at built facilities. FRLM is extended by introducing a probabilistic consideration of the travel range which might vary depending on various factors including road conditions. We develop a mixed integer nonlinear programming formulation and propose a Benders-and-Price algorithm by combining the Benders decomposition and column generation to solve the proposed formulation. The proposed algorithm is validated using extensive computational experiments on two transport networks, including a real-life Texas highway network. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In our problem the number of service routes and their design are an endogenous part of the problem. The cost of a route is a set function mapping a subset of edges, vessel types and quantities to deploy to the set of non-negative real numbers. Since such cost structures cannot be accommodated in a compact formulation, our modelling framework, which is based on the paradigm of the Benders reformulation, integrates separate problems aiming to obtain a solution to the integrated problem. In this work we look at the Benders approach as a tool for integrating separate optimization problems rather than decomposing an integrated holistic optimization problem. Our numerical experiments show that the method is very efficient in solving instances of this problem with respect to both the problem size and the computational time. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In many existing methods, model parameters and initial states have to be given in order to estimate traffic states, which limits the accuracy of the results as well as their transferability to different locations and times. In this paper, we propose a new framework to simultaneously estimate model parameters and traffic states for a congested road segment based on Newell's simplified kinematic wave model (Newell, 1993). Given both Eulerian traffic count data and Lagrangian vehicle reidentification data, we formulate a single optimization problem in terms of the initial number of vehicles and model parameters. Then we decouple the optimization problem such that the initial number of vehicles can be analytically solved with a closed-form formula, and the model parameters, including the jam density and the shock wave speed in congested traffic, can be computed with the Gauss-Newton method. Based on Newell's model, we can calculate individual vehicles' trajectories as well as the average densities, speeds, and flow-rates inside the road segment. We also theoretically show that the optimization problem can have multiple solutions under absolutely steady traffic conditions. We apply the proposed method to the NGSIM datasets, verifying the validity of the method and showing that this method yields better results in the estimation of average densities than existing methods.

We studied an integrated inventory model consisting of a single vendor and multiple buyers with warehouse capacity sharing via transshipment. We proposed an optimal transshipment policy by developing nonlinear programming models and genetic algorithms as well as obtaining Karush-Kuhn-Tucker points. This inventory policy can significantly reduce the channel-wide cost and the performance is influenced by the consideration of fixed transshipment costs. Sensitivity analyses show that parameters have different impacts on the channel-wide cost and the performances of the algorithms.

From there we define and formulate the stochastic user equilibrium (SUE) traffic assignment in which no driver, by unilaterally changing its PSR, can lower its perceived expected generalized costs. Recognizing the interdependency between PSR flows, travel times and parking probabilities, we propose a queuing model in order to compute endogenous parking probabilities accounting for these factors as well as maximum admissible search times. To solve the SUE assignment with equilibrated PSR we propose a solution algorithm, including a method for PSR choice set generation. The model is implemented and applied both to a number of experimental cases to verify its properties and to a real-life setting to illustrate its usefulness in parking-related studies.

A coupled state space model for the evolution of the departure time and the passenger load of each train at each station is explicitly developed. The dwell time of the train is affected by the number of entering and exiting passengers. Combining dynamic train regulation and passenger flow control, a dynamic optimisation problem that minimises the timetable and the headway deviations for metro lines is developed. By applying a model predictive control (MPC) method, we formulate the problem of finding the optimal joint train regulation and passenger flow control strategy as the problem of solving a set of quadratic programming (QP) problems, under which an optimal control law can be numerically calculated efficiently using a quadratic programming algorithm. Moreover, based on the Lyapunov stability theory, the stability (convergence) of the metro line system under the proposed optimal control algorithm is verified. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Aim: To estimate the budget impact and cost-effectiveness of introducing defibrotide to a transplant center. Methods: The authors developed a budget impact model from the perspective of a bone-marrow transplant center. It was estimated that 2.3% of adults and 4.2% of children would develop VOD with MOD following HSCT based on a retrospective hospital database analysis and the effect that treating patients with defibrotide would have on costs for adult and pediatric centers was estimated. A cost-utility analysis (CUA) was also developed to capture the long-term cost-effectiveness of defibrotide. Projected life expectancies in the two groups were estimated based on trial data, transplant registry data, studies of long-term survival among HSCT patients, and US population life-tables. Results: There was an estimated 3% increase ($330,706) per year in total adult transplantation center costs associated with adopting defibrotide, and a < 1% increase ($106,385) for pediatric transplant centers, assuming 100 transplants per year. In the CUA, the lifetime increase in cost per patient was $106,928, life expectancy increased by 3.74 years, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) increased by 2.24. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $47,736 per QALY gained; 88% probability defibrotide was cost-effective at a $100,000/QALY threshold. Conclusion: The budget impact of defibrotide for a transplant center is relatively modest compared to the overall cost of transplantation. Defibrotide provides an important survival advantage for VOD with MOD patients, and the life years gained lead to defibrotide being highly cost-effective.","[Veenstra, David L.; Guzauskas, Gregory F.; Boudreau, Denise M.] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Villa, Kathleen F.] Jazz Pharmaceut Inc, Palo Alto, CA USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Jazz Pharmaceuticals,"Veenstra, DL (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Dept Pharm, PORPP, Box 357630,Hlth Sci Bldg,Room H-375P, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",veenstra@uw.edu,,,"Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","This analysis was funded by Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",,25,6,6,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

This could render the resulting signal timings sub-optimal especially in dense urban areas with significant pedestrian traffic, or when two-stage pedestrian crosswalks are present. This paper proposes a convex (quadratic) programming approach to optimize traffic signal timings for an isolated intersection with one- and two-stage crosswalks, assuming undersaturated vehicular traffic condition. Both vehicle and pedestrian traffic are integrated into a unified framework, where the total weighted delay of pedestrians and vehicles at different types of crosswalks (i.e. one- or two-stage) is adopted as the objective function, and temporal and spatial constraints (e.g. signal phasing plan and spatial capacity of the refuge island) are explicitly formulated. A case study demonstrates the impacts of incorporating pedestrian delay as well as geometric and spatial constraints (e.g., available space on the refuge island) in the signal optimization. A further analysis shows that a two-stage crosswalk may outperform a one-stage crosswalk in terms of both vehicle and pedestrian delays in some circumstances. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The study aim was to describe healthcare utilization and compare medical costs for patients with IBS-C or CIC vs matched controls from a community-based sample. Methods: A nested case-control sample (IBS-C and CIC cases) and matched controls (1:2) for each case group were selected from Olmsted County, MN, individuals responding to a community-based survey of gastrointestinal symptoms (2008) who received healthcare from a participating Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP) provider. Using REP healthcare utilization data, unadjusted and adjusted standardized costs were compared for the 2- and 10-year periods prior to the survey for 115 IBS-C patients and 230 controls and 365 CIC patients and 730 controls. Two time periods were chosen as these conditions are episodic, but long-term. Results: Outpatient costs for IBS-C ($6,800) and CIC ($6,284) patients over a 2-year period prior to the survey were significantly higher than controls ($4,242 and $5,254, respectively) after adjusting for co-morbidities, age, and sex. IBS-C outpatient costs ($25,448) and emergency room costs ($6,892) were significantly higher than controls ($21,024 and $3,962, respectively) for the 10-year period prior. Unadjusted data analyses of cases compared to controls demonstrated significantly higher imaging costs for IBS-C cases and procedure costs for CIC cases over the 10-year period. Limitations: Data were collected from a random community sample primarily receiving care from a limited number of providers in that area. Conclusions: Patients with IBS-C and CIC had significantly higher outpatient costs for the 2-year period compared with controls. IBS-C patients also had higher ER costs than the general population.","[Herrick, Linda M.; Saito, Yuri A.] Mayo Clin, Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Rochester, MN USA; [Herrick, Linda M.] South Dakota State Univ, Brookings, SD USA; [Spalding, William M.] Ironwood Pharmaceut, Cambridge, MA USA; [Moriarty, James] Mayo Clin, Ctr Sci Hlth Care Delivery, Rochester, MN USA; [Schleck, Cathy] Mayo Clin, Biomed Stat & Informat, Rochester, MN USA","Mayo Clinic; South Dakota State University; Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Mayo Clinic; Mayo Clinic","Herrick, LM (通讯作者)，Mayo Clin, 200 1st St SW, Rochester, MN 55905 USA.",Herrick.Linda@mayo.edu,"Herrick, Linda M./I-2884-2019","Moriarty, James/0000-0002-5139-1932",National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health [R01 AG034676]; Ironwood Pharmaceuticals,National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); Ironwood Pharmaceuticals,"Study data were obtained from the Rochester Epidemiology Project, which is supported by the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health (grant R01 AG034676).

A sample-based representation is adopted to allow time-dependent link travel time data to be spatially and temporally correlated. A number of novel reformulation methods are introduced to establish equivalent linear integer programming models that can be easily solved. A Lagrangian decomposition approach is further developed to dualize the non-anticipatory coupling constraints across different samples and then decompose the relaxed model into a series of computationally efficient time-dependent least cost path sub-problems. Numerical experiments are implemented to demonstrate the solution quality and computational performance of the proposed approaches. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: Efficacy and safety outcomes were obtained from GetGoal Duo-2, a 26-week phase 3 trial comparing lixisenatide vs insulin glulisine (IG) once daily (QD) and three times daily (TID). Response at week 26 was extrapolated to 52 weeks, assuming a maintained treatment effect, based on long-term evidence in other T2DM populations. Responders were defined using composite end-points, based on an HbA1c threshold and/or no weight gain and/or no hypoglycemia. The HbA1c threshold was varied in sensitivity analyses. Annual treatment costs were estimated in euros (1 GBP = 1.26 EUR), including drug acquisition and resource use costs. Cost per responder was computed by dividing annual treatment costs per patient by the proportion of responders. Results: Lixisenatide was associated with the lowest cost per responder for all composite end-points that included a weight-related component. For the main composite end-point of HbA1c <= 7.5% AND no weight gain AND no symptomatic hypoglycemia, cost per responder results were: UK: 6,867(sic), 8,746(sic), and 12,410(sic); Italy: 7,057(sic), 9,160(sic), and 12,844(sic); Spain: 8,370(sic), 11,365(sic), and 17,038(sic), for lixisenatide, IG QD, and TID, respectively. The NNT analysis showed that, for every 6.85 and 5.86 patients treated with lixisenatide, there was approximately one additional responder compared to IG QD and TID, respectively. Limitations: A limitation of the clinical inputs is the lack of 52-week trial data from GetGoal Duo-2, which led to the assumption of a maintained treatment effect from week 26 to 52. Conclusions: This analysis suggests lixisenatide is an efficient economic resource allocation in the UK, Italy, and Spain.","[Afonso, Marion; Lew, Elisheva] Sanofi, Chilly Mazarin, France; [Ryan, Fay; Pitcher, Ashley] QuintilesIMS, London, England",Sanofi-Aventis; Sanofi France; IQVIA,"Ryan, F (通讯作者)，210 Pentonville Rd, London N1 9JY, England.",fay.ryan@quintilesims.com,,,Sanofi,Sanofi,"The study was funded by Sanofi.

Methods: This BIM incorporated epidemiologic data, market uptake assumptions, and drug utilization costs, simulating the treatment mix for patients who are candidates for biologics before (Scenario #1) and after (Scenario #2) the introduction of C/BD foam. Predicted outcomes were expressed in terms of the annual cost of treatment (COT) and the COT per member per month (PMPM). Results: At year 1, C/BD foam had the lowest per-patient cost ($9,913) necessary to achieve a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)-75 response compared with etanercept ($73,773), adalimumab ($92,871), infliximab ($34,048), ustekinumab ($83,975), secukinumab ($113,858), apremilast ($47,960), and ixekizumab ($62,707). Following addition of C/BD foam to the formulary, the annual COT for moderate-to-severe psoriasis would decrease by $36,112,572 (17.91%, from $201,621,219 to $165,508,647). The COT PMPM is expected to decrease by $3.00 (17.86%, from $16.80 to $13.80). Limitations: Drug costs were based on Medi-Span reference pricing (January 21, 2016); differences in treatment costs for drug administration, laboratory monitoring, or adverse events were not accounted for. Potentially confounding were the definition of moderate-to-severe and the heterogeneous efficacy data. The per-patient cost for PASI-75 response at year 1 was estimated from short-term efficacy data for C/BD foam and apremilast only. Conclusions: The introduction of C/BD foam is expected to decrease the annual COT for moderate-to-severe psoriasis treatable with biologics by $36,112,572 for a hypothetical US healthcare plan with 1 million plan members, and to lower the COT PMPM by $3.00.","[Asche, Carl V.; Kim, Minchul] Univ Illinois, Coll Med, One Illini Dr, Peoria, IL 61656 USA; [Asche, Carl V.] Univ Illinois, Coll Pharm, Chicago, IL USA; [Feldman, Steven R.] Wake Forest Univ, Bowman Gray Sch Med, Winston Salem, NC USA; [Zografos, Panagiotis; Lu, Minyi] LEO Pharma Inc, Madison, NJ USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Peoria; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; Wake Forest University; Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center; LEO Pharma,"Asche, CV (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Coll Med, One Illini Dr, Peoria, IL 61656 USA.",cva@uic.edu,"Feldman, Steven R./AAH-6971-2021","Feldman, Steven R./0000-0002-0090-6289; Asche, Carl V/0000-0002-3193-6800","LEO Pharma, Inc.","LEO Pharma, Inc.","This study was sponsored and funded by LEO Pharma, Inc.",,16,5,5,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Methods: A Markov-like economic model consisting of 28 distinct health states was used. Model population data were obtained from US linked claims and electronic medical records, with inclusion criteria based on diagnostic guidelines. Inputs came from recent clinical trials, meta-analyses, and cost-effectiveness analyses. The base-case scenario was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of adding ezetimibe 10mg to statin in patients aged 35-74 years with a history of coronary heart disease (CHD) and/or stroke, and with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels >= 70mg/dL over a lifetime horizon, assuming a 90% price reduction of ezetimibe after 1 year to take into account the impending patent expiration in the second quarter of 2017. Sub-group analyses included patients with LDL-C levels >= 100mg/dL and patients with diabetes with LDL-C levels >= 70mg/dL. Results: The lifetime discounted incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for ezetimibe added to statin was $9,149 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for the base-case scenario. For patients with LDL-C levels >= 100mg/dL, the ICER was $839/QALY; for those with diabetes and LDL-C levels >= 70mg/dL, it was $560/QALY. One-way sensitivity analyses showed that the model was sensitive to changes in cost of ezetimibe, rate reduction of non-fatal CHD, and utility weight for non-fatal CHD in the base-case and sub-group analyses. Limitations: Indirect costs or treatment discontinuation estimation were not included. Conclusions: Compared with statin monotherapy, ezetimibe with statin therapy was cost-effective for secondary prevention of CHD and stroke and for primary prevention of these conditions in patients whose LDL-C levels are >= 100mg/dL and in patients with diabetes, taking into account a 90% cost reduction for ezetimibe.","[Davies, Glenn M.] Merck & Co Inc, Kenilworth, NJ USA; [Vyas, Ami] Rutgers State Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Piscataway, NJ USA; [Vyas, Ami] Univ Rhode Isl, Coll Pharm, Dept Pharm Practice, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Baxter, Carl A.] MSD Ltd, Hoddesdon, England",Merck & Company; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; University of Rhode Island; Merck & Company,"Davies, GM (通讯作者)，351 N Sumneytown Pike, N Wales, PA 19454 USA.",glenn_davies@merck.com,,,"Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA","Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA","This study was funded by Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA.",,36,11,11,1,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

This analysis was developed as a follow-up to this prior analysis, to evaluate the cost-consequence of using FLOSEAL vs SURGIFLO in major and severe spine surgery. Methods: A cost consequence model was constructed from a US hospital provider perspective. Model parameters combined clinical inputs from the published retrospective analysis with supplemental analyses on annual spine surgery volume using the 2012 National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database. Cost of hemostatic matrices, blood product transfusion, and operating room time were identified from published literature. Various one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: The base case for a medium volume hospital showed that, compared to SURGIFLO, patients receiving FLOSEAL required three fewer blood product transfusions and saved 27 h of OR time, resulting in annual savings of $151 per major and $574 per severe spine surgery. Additional scenarios for high and low volume hospitals supported cost savings in the base case. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed FLOSEAL was cost-saving in 76% of simulations in major spine and 97% of iterations in severe spine surgery. Conclusions: This economic analysis indicates that use of FLOSEAL instead of SURGIFLO hemostatic matrices to induce hemostasis in both major and severe spine surgery could potentially lead to sizable cost savings in US hospitals, regardless of spinal surgery case-mix.","[Makhija, D.; Rock, M.; Ikeme, S.; Kuntze, E.] Baxter Healthcare Corp, One Baxter Pkwy, Deerfield, IL 60015 USA; [Epstein, J.

Therefore, to weaken the policy factors, 48 cases of IPO companies dated from January 2014 to February 2014 (before price guidance of 23x P/E ratio ceiling) are selected as samples and an approach of grey relational analysis is adopted to analyze the degree on which different factors are able to have an influence. The results show that in general, internal enterprise value factors are likely to play a more important role when compared with external environmental factors. More specifically, profitability, growth potential, operating efficiency, industry characteristics, solvency, capital scale and structure are factors that are more influencing on the offering price, while the market overview and individual stock overview are ones that play a less important role.

Methods: This retrospective cohort study was based on US Commercial and Medicaid claims databases. Healthcare costs were compared between matched hyperprolactinemia and hyperprolactinemia-free cohorts using a two-part model. Risk of hyperprolactinemia was compared between patients receiving AAs with a mechanism of action associated with no/low (no/low prolactin elevation cohort) vs high/moderate prolactin elevation (high/moderate prolactin cohort) using logistic regression. Results: In the commercially insured sample, compared to the hyperprolactinemia-free cohort (n = 499), the hyperprolactinemia cohort (n = 499) was associated with incremental total healthcare costs of $5,732 ($20,081 vs $14,349; p = .004), and incremental medical costs of $3,861 ($13,218 vs $9,357; p = .040), mainly driven by hyperprolactinemia-related costs. In the Medicaid-insured sample, compared to the hyperprolactinemia-free cohort, the hyperprolactinemia cohort was associated with incremental total healthcare costs of $10,773 ($30,763 vs $19,990; p = .004), and incremental medical costs of $9,246 ($20,859 vs $11,613; p = .004), mainly driven by hyperprolactinemia-related and mental health-related costs. The odds of hyperprolactinemia in the no/low prolactin elevation cohort were 4-5-times lower than that in the high/moderate prolactin elevation cohort (odds ratio =0.21; p < .001). Limitations: Hyperprolactinemia may be under-reported in claims data. Conclusions: Hyperprolactinemia is associated with substantial healthcare costs. AAs associated with no/low prolactin elevation reduce the risk of hyperprolactinemia by 4-5-times compared to AAs associated with moderate/high prolactin elevation. Treatment options with minimal impact on prolactin levels may contribute to reducing hyperprolactinemia burden in AA-treated patients.","[Cloutier, Martin; Gagnon-Sanschagrin, Patrick; Guerin, Annie] Anal Grp Inc, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Greene, Mallik] Otsuka Pharmaceut Dev & Commercializat Inc, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Touya, Maelys] Lundbeck, Deerfield, IL USA",Analysis Group Inc.; Otsuka Pharmaceutical,"Greene, M (通讯作者)，Otsuka Pharmaceut Dev & Commercializat Inc, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, 508 Carnegie Ctr, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",mallik.greene@otsuka-us.com,,,"Otsuka Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Lundbeck, LLC","Otsuka Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Lundbeck, LLC","This research was funded by Otsuka Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Lundbeck, LLC.

In this problem, a set of restoration crews are dispatched from depots to a road network to restore the disrupted infrastructure network. Two mathematical formulations are presented to scheduling and sequencing disrupted network components to restoration crews and route the crews towards disrupted components to maximize network resilience progress in any given time horizon. In the first formulation, the number of restoration crews assigned to each disrupted component, the arrival time of each assigned crew to each disrupted component and consequently the restoration rate associated with each disrupted component are considered as variables to increase the flexibility of the model in the presence of different disruptive events. Along with the contributions applies in the first formulation, in the second formulation, each disrupted component can be partially active during its restoration process. To find the coordinated routes, we propose a relaxed mixed integer program as well as a set of valid inequalities which relates the planning and scheduling efforts to decision makers policies. The integration of the relaxed formulation and valid inequalities results in a lower bound for the original formulations. We further introduce a feasibility algorithm to derive a strong initial solution for the routing restorative capacity problem. Computational results on gas, water, and electric power infrastructure network instances from Shelby County, TN data, demonstrates both the effectiveness of the proposed model formulation, in solving small to medium scale problems, the strength of the initial solution procedure, especially for large scale problems.

In this context of random taste heterogeneity, the standard multinomial probit (MNP) has seen limited applicability largely owing to the normal distributional assumption of model parameters that will invariably result in (a) counter-intuitive taste sensitivities for a significant proportion of the population, and (b) WTP distributions without finite moments. In this paper, a Generalized MNP (GMNP) model that allows constrained random parameters with multivariate truncated normal distribution was developed. The ability of the maximum simulated likelihood inference method to retrieve the model parameters was demonstrated on synthetic data using the GHK simulator with quasi-Monte Carlo sequences. The bias in the parameters of the MNP model that ignores the constraints on model parameters was also demonstrated. Also, the proposed model was used to analyze car parking preferences in Jerusalem while ensuring (a) negative taste sensitivities for cost and time attributes, and (b) finite moments of the WTP measures associated with walk and search times.

Limited data is available on the economic burden of DRM and the cost-benefit of nutrition therapy in high-risk populations in Latin America. The aims of the present study were to estimate the economic burden of DRM and evaluate the cost-benefit of supplemental parenteral nutrition (SPN) in critically ill patients who fail to receive adequate nutrient intake from enteral nutrition (EN) in Latin America. Methods: Country-specific cost and prevalence data from eight Latin American countries and clinical data from studies evaluating outcomes in patients with DRM were used to estimate the costs associated with DRM in public hospitals. A deterministic decision model based on clinical outcomes from a randomized controlled study and country-specific cost data were developed to examine the cost-benefit of administering SPN to critically ill adults who fail to reach >= 60% of the calculated energy target with EN. Results: The estimated annual economic burden of DRM in public hospitals in Latin America is $10.19 billion (range, $8.44 billion-$11.72 billion). Critically ill patients account for a disproportionate share of the costs, with a 6.5-fold higher average cost per patient compared with those in the ward ($5488.35 vs. $839.76). Model-derived estimates for clinical outcomes and resource utilization showed that administration of SPN to critically ill patients who fail to receive the targeted energy delivery with EN would result in an annual cost reduction of $10.2 million compared with continued administration of EN alone. Limitations: The cost calculation was limited to the average daily cost of stay and antibiotic use. The costs associated with other common complications of DRM, such as prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation or more frequent readmission, are unknown. Conclusions: DRM imposes a substantial economic burden on Latin American countries, with critically ill patients accounting for a disproportionate share of costs. Cost-benefit analysis suggests that both improved clinical outcomes and significant cost savings can be achieved through the adoption of SPN as a therapeutic strategy in critically ill patients who fail to receive adequate nutrient intake from EN.","[Toulson Davisson Correia, Maria Isabel] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Perman, Mario Ignacio] Italian Hosp Buenos Aires, Dept Med, Adult Intens Care Unit, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Pradelli, Lorenzo; Omaralsaleh, Abdul Jabbar] AdRes Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Turin, Italy; [Waitzberg, Dan Linetzky] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Gastroenterol, Med Sch, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais; University of Buenos Aires; Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires; Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Correia, MITD (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Med Sch, Av Carandai 246 Apt 902, BR-30130060 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.",isabel_correia@uol.com.br,"Pradelli, Lorenzo/H-2824-2019; Correia, Maria Isabel Toulson Davisson/I-8617-2012","Pradelli, Lorenzo/0000-0002-7648-8917; Correia, Maria Isabel Toulson Davisson/0000-0002-3503-4302",Fresenius Kabi Deutschland GmbH,Fresenius Kabi Deutschland GmbH,This study was funded by Fresenius Kabi Deutschland GmbH.,,68,26,26,1,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The travel preferences towards risk and ambiguity are distinguished by adopting the criterion of ambiguity-aware Constant Absolute Risk Aversion (CARA) travel time. We first examine the dynamic user equilibrium for a single route model with a homogeneous preference towards risk and ambiguity. Compared with risk-neutral commuters, we find that departure time window is shifted earlier for the risk averse commuters and shifted later for the risk-seeking commuters. We also study the single bottleneck with a risk-averse class and a risk-seeking class. We show that with a larger gap between the two classes' preferences, the congestion pattern will change from one peak to two peaks. It implies that preference heterogeneity may stagger the departure time choices and thereby relieve the average congestion. Last, we examine a two-route problem with homogeneous preference. Commuters choose between a fast and risky route (highway) and a slow and safe route (local arterial). We prove the monotonicity of the traffic flow distribution between the two routes with respect to the maximum variation in travel time. Furthermore, we find that reducing the uncertainty on the highway by providing information will reduce the total system cost and the total expected congestion simultaneously for risk-averse commuters. However, it will reduce the total expected congestion but increase the total system cost for risk-seeking commuters. In the numerical section, the price of anarchy is analyzed by varying the risk preference and the ambiguity preference. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In an urban environment, EFVs are typically charged at a central depot and rarely use public charging stations during delivery routes. Therefore, the charging schedule at the depot must be planned ahead of time so as to allow the vehicles to complete their routes at minimal cost. Vehicle fleet operators are subject to commercial electricity rate plans, which should be accounted for in order to provide an accurate estimation of the energy-related costs and restrictions. In addition, high vehicle utilization rates can accelerate battery aging, thereby requiring degradation mitigation considerations. We develop and solve a comprehensive mathematical model that incorporates a large variety of features associated with the use of EFVs. These include a realistic charging process, time-dependent energy costs, battery degradation, grid restrictions, and facility-related demand charges. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted in order to draw managerial insights regarding the impact of such features on the charging schedules of EFVs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We present here equivalent second-order continuum and car-following models with bounded accelerations that encompass existing models, including the LWR model with bounded acceleration, Lebacque's two-phase model, and the bounded acceleration version of Newell's car-following model. Analytical solutions are presented for (i) an accelerating rarefaction wave on a homogeneous road, where traffic is still in equilibrium in the acceleration zone, and (ii) an inhomogeneous road with varying speed limits, where an accelerating standing wave is continuous over an acceleration zone and traffic states are non-equilibrium but stationary. We find that traffic states with bounded acceleration can be equilibrium or not and stationary or not, and bounded acceleration does not lead to capacity drop with variable speed limits. These theoretical results are verified with numerical solutions of corresponding lead-vehicle problems. This study provides a theoretical foundation of applying variable speed limits to eliminate capacity drop at lane-drop, sag, tunnel, and other bottlenecks. In the future we are interested in extending such bounded acceleration models for other bottlenecks with inhomogeneous jam densities and time gaps. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper a multi-commodity rail inventory transportation planning problem for chemicals is proposed. The aim is to generate transportation plans for chemicals and rail cars such that product demands are fulfilled and total logistics cost is minimized. To solve the problem, heuristics based on a rolling-horizon decomposition are proposed. A case study illustrates the applicability of the heuristics. The results show that near-optimal solutions can be generated quickly by the heuristics. Thus, an instrument is offered to transport managers which helps them to optimize chemical logistics processes.","[Kirschstein, Thomas] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Sch Econ & Business, Gr Steinstr 73, D-06108 Halle, Germany",Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Kirschstein, T (通讯作者)，Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Sch Econ & Business, Gr Steinstr 73, D-06108 Halle, Germany.",thomas.kirschstein@wiwi.uni-halle.de,,"Kirschstein, Thomas/0000-0002-4081-4549",,,,,31,2,2,2,11,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1366-5545,,,TRANSPORT RES E-LOG,Transp.

Methods: Adults diagnosed with metastatic breast, non-small cell lung (NSCLC), colorectal, head and neck, ovarian, and uterine cancer (2010Q1-2015Q1) were identified in the OptumHealth Care Solutions claims database and followed from first metastatic diagnosis for >= 1 month and until the end of data availability. Utilization was assessed for each cancer cohort (all and patients aged >= 65 years); per-patient-per-month (PPPM) medical service costs were assessed for all patients. Testing frequency estimates were applied to Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program data to estimate the number of untested patients (2010-2014). Results: Patients with metastatic cancer (n = 8,193; breast [n = 3 ,41 4], NSCLC [n = 2,231], colorectal [n=1,611], head and neck [n=511], ovarian [n=275], and uterine [n=151]) were 63 years old (mean), with 11.1-22.2 months of observation. Biopsy and molecular diagnostic testing frequencies ranged from 7% (uterine) to 73% (ovarian), and from 34% (head and neck) to 52% (breast), respectively. Few were treated with GMTT (breast, 11%; NSCLC, 9%; colorectal, 6%). Treatment with UTT ranged from 0.7% (uterine) to 21% (colorectal). Biopsy, diagnostic testing, and anti-cancer drug therapy were less frequent for those >= 65 years. Medical service costs (PPPM, mean) ranged from $6,618 (head and neck) to $9,940 (ovarian). The estimated number of untested new patients with metastatic cancer was 636,369 (all) and 341,397 (>65). Limitations: In addition to the limitations of claims analyses, diagnostic testing frequency may be under-estimated if patients underwent testing prior to study inclusion. Conclusions: The low frequency of molecular diagnostic testing suggests there are opportunities to better inform management of patients with advanced cancer, particularly decisions to treat with GMTT.","[Chawla, Anita] Anal Grp Inc, Menlo Pk, CA USA; [Peeples, Miranda; Li, Nanxin; Signorovitch, James] Anal Grp Inc, Boston, MA USA; [Anhorn, Rachel; Ryan, Jason] Fdn Med Inc, Cambridge, MA USA",Analysis Group Inc.; Analysis Group Inc.; Foundation Medicine,"Chawla, A (通讯作者)，1010 El Camino Real,Suite 310, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA.",anita.chawla@analysisgroup.com,"Li, Nanxin/D-9755-2011",,"Foundation Medicine, Inc.","Foundation Medicine, Inc.","This study was funded by Foundation Medicine, Inc.

The purpose of the study was to determine the contribution of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) to household food and income security and the extent to which NTFPs contribute to resilient rural livelihoods in the face of climate change. The study employed both quantitative and qualitative data-collection methods. Questionnaires were utilized to obtain data from randomly selected respondents in various communities across the northern, upper-west, and upper-east regions of Ghana. Additionally, key informant interviews, observations, and focus group discussions were employed to obtain further information on specific aspects of NTFPs. Market surveys were also conducted in selected markets to obtain information related to the marketing of NTFPs. The findings revealed that NTFPs contribute significantly to rural livelihoods by way of food, employment, and income, particularly for the poor and vulnerable. However, recent trends indicate that the resource base of NTFPs is dwindling, partly because of overexploitation and expansion of agricultural lands. Climate change has highlighted the need to explore options to ensure a more resilient food system in Northern Ghana by way of optimizing the benefits of the agriculture and forestry sectors in a mutual fashion. Consequently, this chapter concludes by proposing a framework and innovative pathways for achieving this goal.","[Issaka, Yakubu Balma] Univ Dev Studies, Fac Agribusiness & Commun Sci, Dept Agribusiness Management & Finance, Nyankpala Campus, Tamale, Ghana",University for Development Studies,"Issaka, YB (通讯作者)，Univ Dev Studies, Fac Agribusiness & Commun Sci, Dept Agribusiness Management & Finance, Nyankpala Campus, Tamale, Ghana.",yissaka@outlook.com,"Issaka, Yakubu Balma/AAY-8271-2021",,,,,,22,2,3,0,9,SPRINGER JAPAN,TOKYO,"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG E, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN",2197-7348,,978-981-10-4796-1; 978-981-10-4794-7,SCI SUSTAIN SOC,,,2018,,,,,,,179,192,,10.1007/978-981-10-4796-1_10,0.0,,,14,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Ecology; Environmental Studies; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography,BK9QR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000444861300010,0

Materials and methods: IQVIA PharMetrics Plus administrative claims data were linked with Modernizing Medicine Data Services Electronic Health Record data and used to select adult psoriasis patients between April 1, 2010 and December 31, 2014. Eligible patients were classified by disease severity (mild, moderate, severe) using a hierarchy of available clinical measures. One-year outcomes included all-cause and psoriasis-related outpatient, emergency department, inpatient, and pharmacy HCRU and costs. Results: This study identified 2,130 biologic-treated psoriasis patients: 282 (13%) had mild, 116 (5%) moderate, and 49 (2%) severe disease; 1,683 (79%) could not be classified. The mean age was 47.6 years; 45.4% were female. Relative to mild psoriasis patients, patients with moderate or severe disease had more median all-cause outpatient encounters (28.0 [mild] vs 32.0 [moderate], 36.0 [severe]), more median psoriasis-related outpatient encounters (6.0 [mild] vs 7.5 [moderate], 8.0 [severe]), and a higher proportion of overall claims for medications that were psoriasis-related (28% [mild] vs 37% [moderate], 34% [severe]). Relative to mild psoriasis patients, patients with moderate or severe disease had higher median all-cause total costs ($37.7k [mild] vs $42.3k [moderate], $49.3k [severe]), higher median psoriasis-related total costs ($32.7k [mild] vs $34.9k [moderate], $40.5k [severe]), higher median all-cause pharmacy costs ($33.9k [mild] vs $36.5k [moderate], $36.4k [severe]), and higher median psoriasis-related pharmacy costs ($32.2k [mild] vs $33.9k [moderate], $35.6k [severe]). Limitations: The assessment of psoriasis disease severity may not have necessarily coincided with the timing of biologic use. The definition of disease severity prevented the assessment of temporality, and may have introduced selection bias. Conclusions: Biologic-treated patients with moderate or severe psoriasis cost the healthcare system more than patients with mild psoriasis, primarily driven by higher pharmacy costs and more outpatient encounters.","[Murage, Mwangi J.; Ojeh, Clement K.; Muram, Talia M.; Araujo, Andre B.] Eli Lilly & Co, Indianapolis, IN 46221 USA; [Anderson, Amanda; Oliveria, Susan A.; Casso, Deborah] IQVIA, Epidemiol & Drug Safety, Plymouth Meeting, PA USA; [Merola, Joseph F.] Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Boston, MA USA",Eli Lilly; IQVIA; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Brigham & Women's Hospital,"Murage, MJ (通讯作者)，Eli Lilly & Co, GPORWE, LCT South Bldg 172-2,Drop Code 5028, Indianapolis, IN 46221 USA.",murage_mwangi_james@lilly.com,"Muram, Talia/AAC-1208-2022","Merola, Joseph/0000-0001-6514-4353",Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly),Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly),"This study was funded by Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly).

Methods: An individual patient state transition microsimulation model was developed to project health outcomes and costs over 10 years, using a payer perspective. The incremental benefit estimates for golimumab were driven by induction response and risk of a flare. Flare risks post-induction were derived for golimumab from the PURSUIT maintenance trial and extension study, while those for SoC were derived from the placebo arms of the Active Ulcerative Colitis Trials (ACT) 1 and 2. Other inputs were derived from multiple sources, including retrospective claims analyses and literature. Costs are reported in 2014 Canadian dollars. A 5% annual discount rate was applied to costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Results: Compared with SoC, golimumab was projected to increase the time spent in mild disease or remission states, decrease flare rates, and increase QALYs. These gains were achieved with higher direct medical costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for golimumab vs SoC was $63,487 per QALY. Limitations: The long-term flare projections for SoC were based on the data available from the ACT 1 and 2 placebo arms, as data were not available from the PURSUIT maintenance or extension trial. Additionally, the study was limited to only SoC and golimumab, due to the availability of individual patient data to analyze. Conclusion: This economic analysis concluded that treatment with golimumab is likely more cost-effective vs SoC when considering cost-effectiveness acceptability thresholds from $50,000-$ 100,000 per QALY.","[Stern, Sean] Evidera, Bethesda, MD USA; [Ward, Alexandra J.] Evidera, Waltham, MA USA; [Thibault, Catherine Saint-Laurent] Evidera, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Camacho, Fernando] Damos, N York, ON, Canada; [Rahme, Elham] McGill Univ, Hlth Ctr, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Naessens, Dominik] Janssen Pharmaceut BV, Beerse, Belgium; [Aumais, Guy] Maisonneuve Rosemont Hop, CIUSS Est Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Aumais, Guy; Bernard, Edmond-Jean] Univ Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Bernard, Edmond-Jean] Hotel Dieu Montreal CHUM, IBD Clin, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Bourdages, Raymond] Hotel Dieu Levis, CISSS Chaudiere Apalaches, Levis, PQ, Canada; [Bourdages, Raymond; Pare, Pierre] Univ Laval, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Cohen, Albert] Jewish Gen Hosp, Div Gastroenterol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Cohen, Albert] McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Pare, Pierre] Hop St Sacrement, CHU Quebec, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Dyrda, Peter] Janssen Inc, Toronto, ON, Canada",Evidera; Evidera; McGill University; Johnson & Johnson; Janssen Pharmaceuticals; Universite de Montreal; Laval University; Universite de Montreal; Laval University; Laval University; McGill University; McGill University; Laval University; Johnson & Johnson,"Stern, S (通讯作者)，7101 Wisconsin Ave,Suite 1400, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",sean.stern@evidera.com,,"Saint-Laurent Thibault, Catherine/0000-0002-5415-1045","Janssen Biotech, Inc.","Janssen Biotech, Inc.(Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson USAJanssen Biotech Inc)","The cost-effectiveness study and this resulting article were funded in full by the manufacturer of golimumab, Janssen Biotech, Inc.

We propose an efficient modeling approach based on the cell transmission model for simulating the spatio-temporal evolution of flow and congestion on taxiway and apron networks. The existence of link-based fundamental diagram that expresses the functional relationship between link density and flow is demonstrated using empirical data collected in Guangzhou Baiyun airport. The proposed CTM-based network model is shown to be an efficient and accurate method capable of supporting air traffic prediction and decision support. In addition, using both CTM-based simulation and empirical data, we further reveal the existence of an aggregate relationship between traffic density and runway throughput, which is referred to as macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) in the literature of road traffic. The MFD on the airport surface is analyzed in depth, and utilized to devise several robust off-block control strategies under uncertainties, which are shown to significantly outperform existing off-block control methods.

CONTROL; SUPPLY CHAIN; COMPONENT PROCUREMENT; MANAGEMENT; CONTRACTS; INFORMATION; PRODUCTS; PERSPECTIVE; PERFORMANCE,"In the recent years, the fashion and apparel industry has seen intense competition and increasing production quantity, along with growing concern about the sustainability issues and the environmental impacts. Many companies in fashion supply chains have tried various approaches to be more green, and procurement is one of the most important functions which influences supply chain sustainability, because procurement does not only affect the supply chain output but also change the supply chain structure. In this paper, we consider a typical fashion supply chain comprising of an apparel manufacturer, a retailer and a logistic service provider (LSP), where we analyze two commonly used procurement strategies: control and agency. We examine the effects of two widely used government regulations: punishing and subsidizing, on the management of sustainable fashion procurement. We show that, there exist conflicts between supply chain profit goals and sustainability goals: The retailer will obtain more profits under control, but the price is that it determines a larger order size and the supply chain becomes less sustainable. To improve sustainability, a local government can either punish or subsidize the retailer. We show that, punishing can only reduce the order size, while subsidizing may induce the retailer to change its procurement strategy from control to agency, when the subsidy exceeds a threshold. We also find that the objectives of improving sustainability and maximizing social welfare may be conflicting, so it is an important task to find a balance between them for the government.","[Niu, Baozhuang; Chen, Lei] South China Univ Technol, Sch Business Adm, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jie] Guangdong Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Business Adm, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",South China University of Technology; Guangdong University of Finance & Economics,"Zhang, J (通讯作者)，Guangdong Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Business Adm, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",bmniubz@scut.edu.cn; jayden_business@foxmail.com; jiezh@alumni.ust.hk,"Niu, Baozhuang/HMD-9527-2023","Zhang, Jie/0000-0002-6546-7301; Niu, Baozhuang/0000-0002-7374-9835","NSFC [71571194, 71301032, 71633002, 71201175]; Research Foundation from Ministry of Education of China [16JZD026]; GDUPS; Foundation for the Excellent Youth Scholars of Guangdong Universities and Colleges [YQ2015078]; Hong Kong Polytechnic University [G-UA7Y]","NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Research Foundation from Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); GDUPS; Foundation for the Excellent Youth Scholars of Guangdong Universities and Colleges; Hong Kong Polytechnic University(Hong Kong Polytechnic University)","The authors are grateful to the managing editor and the two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments and suggestions.

Link travel time correlation significantly affects path reliability, but also greatly increases the complexity of the RSP problem due to the quadratic form of the standard deviation term. Lagrangian relaxation (LR) based on problem reformulation, which only needs to solve a series of shortest path problems, has been recognized as an efficient method to obtain near-optimal RSPs with the optimality gap guarantee. This paper proposes a novel LR approach based on a new convex problem reformulation, and new methods to update Lagrangian multipliers and handle negative cycles of the resulting shortest path problems. Different from existing LR approaches, which adopt the classical subgradient method to solve the dual problem, a constraint generation (CG) algorithm and a subgradient projection (SP) algorithm are proposed to update Lagrangian multipliers effectively, and both algorithms are further modified to handle negative cycles. We also reveal the connection between different reformulations of the RSP problem and show that the proposed approach has a smaller duality gap than existing ones. Experiments on real transportation networks validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of convergence rate, run time, duality gap and optimality by comparison with the existing LR approaches and the outer approximation algorithm.

The study investigates theoretical and practical aspects of TGR implementation in real world. In particular, two essential problems on operation strategy and policy making of TGR are examined. First, we investigate the optimal assignment of a set of passengers for the sake of maximizing total saved travel miles. Second, we analyze different behaviors of passengers and drivers in participating taxi group rides, and explore the best incentives for TGR in order to maximize efficiency under optimal assignment. The optimal assignment is formulated as an integer linear programming problem and is further converted into an equivalent graph problem. While the problem is NP-hard, efficient algorithms are needed for real-world on-line implementations. We develop an exact algorithm and a heuristic algorithm to solve the TGR problem, and compare the results with a bounded-error greedy algorithm. The numerical experiments suggest that the heuristic algorithm is capable of solving real-world TGR instances efficiently with good solution quality. To explore the best incentives for grouped taxi rides, comprehensive numerical experiments are conducted using taxi trip data from New York City (US), Wuhan (China), and Shenzhen (China). Our numerical results show that over 47% of the total taxi trip mileage may be saved if proper level of incentives are provided and if passengers are matched optimally. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, even if routes are updated continuously, in practice, some decisions once made are difficult to reverse. At times, it may thus be valuable to wait for additional information before acting on a decision. We use the theory of optimal stopping to determine the optimal timing of a recourse action when vehicles are likely to miss customer deadlines due to travel-time stochasticities and backup services are available. The factors involved in making this decision - that is, the likelihood that the primary vehicle will arrive late, the location of the backup vehicle, and value of waiting for additional travel-time information - each change dynamically over time. We develop a recourse model that accounts for this complexity. We formulate the optimal recourse policy as a stochastic dynamic program. Properties of the optimal policy are derived analytically, and its solution is approximated with a binomial lattice method used in the pricing of American options. Finally, we develop a two-stage stochastic optimization approach to show how the opportunity to take recourse dynamically might be integrated into a priori scheduling and routing. The framework is demonstrated for a stochastic dial-a -ride application in which taxis serve as backup to ridesharing vehicles. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Since assessments must be performed quickly, visiting all of the sites in the affected region may not be possible. Therefore, assessment teams must decide which sites to select and visit during the assessment horizon. In this paper, we address site selection and routing decisions of the rapid needs assessment teams which aim to evaluate the post-disaster conditions of different community groups, each carrying a distinct characteristic. We define the Selective Assessment Routing Problem (SARP) that constructs an assessment plan to cover different characteristics in a balanced way. The SARP is formulated as a variant of the team orienteering problem with a coverage objective. We develop an efficient tabu search heuristic, which produces high-quality solutions for the SARP. We illustrate our approach with a case study, which is based on real-world data from the 2011 Van earthquake in Turkey. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This also means adjusting the timetable due to long maintenance or constructions' possessions. In this article, we introduce the Train Timetable Adjustment Problem (TTAP), which for given station and open-track possessions, finds an alternative timetable that minimizes the deviation from the original timetable. We propose a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for solving TTAP, and apply retiming, reordering, short-turning and cancellation to generate alternative timetables. The model represents an extended periodic event scheduling problem (PESP) formulation and introduces new constraints for cancelling and retiming train lines, while short-turning is being applied in a preprocessing step. In order to solve larger and more complex instances, we use a row generation approach to add station capacity constraints. The model solves real-life instances with multiple possessions for a large area of the Dutch railway network in reasonable time, and could be up-scaled to the complete Dutch network. Additionally, it may be applicable for disruption management after some modifications. Operators and infrastructure managers could use it to automatically generate optimal alternative timetables on the macroscopic level in case of maintenance or construction works and thus, coordinate traffic for the complete network.

To ensure operational robustness in transportation networks, it is necessary to identify the most vital or critical roads (or links), then reinforce them to increase their resilience. In the literature, conventional approaches to analyze road network robustness have involved efforts to first remove selected road segments (one by one, not collectively), then measure the impact of these changes. Based on these results, the levels of impact are ranked and links that demonstrate the most significant impacts are deemed to be the most critical. One of the most significant limitations of such approaches, however, is that they disregard the combined effect of road connectivity. This study advances the state of knowledge in transportation-based resilience analysis through the development of an approach to assess the impact of critical combination scenarios. The methodology involves a two-phase process. The first phase is based on the sensor (loop detector) location problem, within which, a selected number of high demand roads are identified as candidate critical links. Then, the second phase employs a series of discrete network design problem (DNDP) to find a variety of critical combination scenarios. The DNDPs are solved based on a system optimal relaxation method using Bender's Decomposition. Building further from these results, the extent to which a road network is robust (or fragile) is analyzed. The results of the DNDP solutions are demonstrated to be similar to a Lorenz Curve in which the area under the Lorenz Curve (in percentage) can be viewed as a global robustness index. This index can be used to compare and assess the robustness of different road networks and mitigation scenarios. To illustrate the practical utility of this method, this research applied the methodology to the Winnipeg, Canada road network. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: A comparative review of key features of the pharmacoeconomic guidelines in SA was undertaken using the Comparative Table of Pharmacoeconomic Guidelines developed by the International Society of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research, and published country-level pharmacoeconomics guidelines. A random sample of guidelines in high-and middle-income countries were analyzed if data on all key features were available. Key features of the pharmacoeconomic guidelines in SA were compared with those in other countries, and divergent features were identified and elaborated. Results: Five upper middle-income countries (Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Malaysia, and Mexico), one lower middle-income country (Egypt), and six high-income countries (Germany, Ireland, Norway, Portugal, Taiwan, and the Netherlands) were analyzed. The pharmacoeconomic guidelines in SA differ in important areas when compared with other countries. In SA, the study perspective and costs are limited to private health-insurance companies, complex modelling is discouraged and models require pre-approval, equity issues are not explicitly stated, a budget impact analysis is not required, and pharmacoeconomic submissions are voluntary. Conclusions: Future updates to the pharmacoeconomic guidelines in SA may include a societal perspective with limitations, incentivize complex and transparent models, and integrate equity issues. The pharmacoeconomic guidelines could be improved by addressing conflicting objectives with policies on National Health Insurance, incentivize private health insurance companies to disclose reimbursement data, and require the inclusion of a budget impact analysis in all pharmacoeconomic submissions. Further research is also needed on the impact of mandatory pharmacoeconomic submissions in middle-income countries.","[Carapinha, Joao L.] Carapinha & Co, 25 New Chardon St, Boston, MA 02114 USA",,,joao@carapinha.com,,"Carapinha, Joao/0000-0002-5566-2787",,,,,26,7,7,0,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

This study assessed the direct healthcare costs of common AEs among mCRC patients in the US. Methods: Adult mCRC patients treated with chemotherapy or targeted therapies were identified from administrative claims databases (2009-2014). Up to the first three mCRC treatment episodes per patient were considered and categorized as with or without the AE system/organ category during the episode. Total healthcare costs (2014 USD) were measured by treatment episode and reported on a monthly basis. Treatment episodes with the AE category were matched by treatment type and line of treatment to those without the AE category. Adjusted total cost differences were estimated by comparing costs during treatment episodes with vs without the AE category using multivariate regression models; p-values were estimated with bootstrap. Results: A total of 4158 patients with >= 1 mCRC treatment episode were included (mean age=59 years; 58% male; 60% with liver and 14% with lung metastases; 2,261 [54%] with a second and 1,115 [27%] with a third episode). On average, two treatment episodes were observed per patient with an average length of 166 days per episode. Adjusted monthly total cost difference by AE category included hematologic ($1,480), respiratory ($1,253), endocrine/metabolic ($1,213), central nervous system (CNS; $1,136), and cardiovascular ($1,036; all p<.05). Limitations: Claims do not include information on the cause of AEs, and potentially less severe AEs may not have been reported by the physician when billing the medical service. This study aimed to assess the association between costs and AEs and not the causation of AEs by treatment. Conclusions: The most costly AEs among mCRC patients were hematologic, followed by respiratory, endocrine/metabolic, CNS, and cardiovascular.","[Latremouille-Viau, Dominick; Guerin, Annie; Shi, Sherry] Anal Grp, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Chang, Jane; Wang, Ed; Ngai, Christopher] Bayer Pharmaceut, Whippany, NJ USA; [Yu, Justin] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Yu, Justin] Allergan Plc, Parsippany Troy Hills, NJ USA",Bayer AG; Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; AbbVie; Allergan,,dominick.latremouille-viau@analysisgroup.com,,,Bayer Pharmaceuticals,Bayer Pharmaceuticals(Bayer AG),This study was funded by Bayer Pharmaceuticals.,,37,17,18,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

These outcome improvements in cardiac surgery procedures may translate to economic savings for hospitals and payers. Objective: The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-consequence of two flowable hemostatic matrices (FLOSEAL or SURGIFLO) in cardiac surgeries for US hospitals. Methods: A cost-consequence model was constructed using clinical outcomes from a previously published retrospective comparative effectiveness study of FLOSEAL vs SURGIFLO in adult cardiac surgeries. The model accounted for the reported differences between these products in length of surgery, rates of major and minor complications, surgical revisions, and blood product transfusions. Costs were derived from Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's National Inpatient Sample (NIS) 2012 database and converted to 2015 US dollars. Savings were modeled for a hospital performing 245 cardiac surgeries annually, as identified as the average for hospitals in the NIS dataset. One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed to test model robustness. Results: The results suggest that if FLOSEAL is utilized in a hospital that performs 245 mixed cardiac surgery procedures annually, 11 major complications, 31 minor complications, nine surgical revisions, 79 blood product transfusions, and 260.3 h of cumulative operating time could be avoided. These improved outcomes correspond to a net annualized saving of $1,532,896. Cost savings remained consistent between $1.3m and $1.8m and between $911k and $2.4m, even after accounting for the uncertainty around clinical and cost inputs, in a one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis, respectively. Conclusions: Outcome differences associated with FLOSEAL vs SURGIFLO that were previously reported in a comparative effectiveness study may result in substantial cost savings for US hospitals.","[Makhija, D.; Rock, M.; Arnold, M.

Previous economic modeling used Markov models; applying one alternative technique, discrete event simulation (DES) modeling, allows re-treatment and long-term adverse events (AEs) to be included in the analysis. Methods: A DES was adapted to model relapse-triggered re-treatment with alemtuzumab and the effect of including ongoing quality-adjusted life year (QALY) decrements for AEs that extend beyond previous 1-year Markov cycles. As the price to the NHS of fingolimod in the UK is unknown, due to a confidential patient access scheme (PAS), a variety of possible discounts were tested. The interaction of re-treatment assumptions for alemtuzumab with the possible discounts for fingolimod was tested to determine which DMT resulted in lower lifetime costs. The lifetime QALY results were derived from modeled treatment effect and short- and long-term AEs. Results: Most permutations of fingolimod PAS discount and alemtuzumab re-treatment rate resulted in fingolimod being less costly than alemtuzumab. As the percentage of patients who are re-treated with alemtuzumab due to experiencing a relapse approaches 100% of those who relapse whilst on treatment, the discount required for fingolimod to be less costly drops below 5%. Consideration of treatment effect alone found alemtuzumab generated 0.2 more QALYs/patient; the inclusion of AEs up to a duration of 1 year reduced this advantage to only 0.14 QALYs/patient. Modeling AEs with a lifetime QALY decrement found that both DMTs generated very similar QALYs with the difference only 0.04 QALYs/patient. Conclusions: When the model captured alemtuzumab re-treatment and long-term AE decrements, it was found that fingolimod is cost-effective compared to alemtuzumab, assuming application of only a modest level of confidential PAS discount.","[Montgomery, Stephen M.; Kusel, Jeanette] Costello Med Consulting Ltd, Cambridge, England; [Nicholas, Richard] Imperial Coll Healthcare NHS Trust, Charing Cross Hosp, London, England; [Adlard, Nicholas] Novartis Pharmaceut UK Ltd, Camberley, Surrey, England",Costello Medical Consulting; Imperial College London; Novartis,"Adlard, N (通讯作者)，Novartis Pharmaceut UK Ltd, 200 Frimley Business Pk, Frimley GU16 7SR, Surrey, England.",nicholas.adlard@novartis.com,"; Montgomery, Stephen/B-5683-2011","Adlard, Nicholas/0000-0001-6912-1685; Montgomery, Stephen/0000-0002-8481-5850","Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Limited, Camberley, UK","Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Limited, Camberley, UK","This study was funded by Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Limited, Camberley, UK.",,37,12,14,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Materials and methods: Burden of CVD was assessed using the UK-based Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) in order to capture complete CV burden including CV mortality. Patients on standard of care (SOC; high-intensity statins) in CPRD were selected based on eligibility criteria of FOURIER, a phase 3 CV outcomes trial of evolocumab, and categorized into four cohorts: high-risk prevalent atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) cohort (n = 1448), acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (n = 602), ischemic stroke (IS) (n = 151), and heart failure (HF) (n = 291) incident cohorts. The value-based price range for evolocumab was assessed using a previously published economic model. The model incorporated CPRD CV event rates and considered CV event reduction rate ratios per 1 mmol/L reduction in low-density lipo-protein- cholesterol (LDL-C) from a meta-analysis of statin trials by the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists Collaboration (CTTC), i.e. CTTC relationship. Results: Multiple-event rates of composite CV events (ACS, IS, or coronary revascularization) per 100 patient-years were 12.3 for the high-risk prevalent ASCVD cohort, and 25.7, 13.3, and 23.3, respectively, for incident ACS, IS, and HF cohorts. Approximately one-half (42%) of the high-risk ASCVD patients with a new CV event during follow-up had a subsequent CV event. Combining these real-world event rates and the CTTC relationship in the economic model, the value-based price range (credible interval) under a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000/ quality-adjusted life-year gained for evolocumab was $11,990 ($9,341-$14,833) to $16,856 ($12,903-$20,678) in ASCVD patients with baseline LDL-C levels >= 70 mg/dL and >= 100 mg/dL, respectively. Conclusion: Real-world CVD burden is substantial. Using the observed CVD burden in CPRD and the CTTC relationship, the cost-effectiveness analysis showed that, accounting for uncertainties, the expected value-based price for evolocumab is higher than its current annual cost, as long as the payer discount off list price is greater than 20%.","[Toth, Peter P.] CGH Med Ctr, Sterling, IL USA; [Toth, Peter P.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Ciccarone Ctr Prevent Heart Dis, Lutherville Timonium, MD USA; [Danese, Mark] Outcomes Insights Inc, Westlake Village, CA USA; [Villa, Guillermo] Amgen Europe GmbH, Zug, Switzerland; [Qian, Yi; Beaubrun, Anne; Lira, Armando] Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320 USA; [Jansen, Jeroen P.] Precis Hlth Econ, Oakland, CA USA",Johns Hopkins University; Amgen; AMGEN Europe; Amgen,"Toth, PP (通讯作者)，CGH Med Ctr, 101 East Miller Rd, Sterling, IL 61081 USA.",peter.toth@cghmc.com,"qian, yi/HZH-4175-2023; Toth, Peter/GMW-6552-2022","Jansen, Jeroen Paul/0000-0003-2686-9217",Amgen Inc.,Amgen Inc.(Amgen),This study was sponsored by Amgen Inc.,,47,42,43,2,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Gender is a key determinant of many healthcare behaviors and outcomes. Understanding variation in CRN by gender may provide opportunities to reduce disparities and improve outcomes. Aims: This study aims to examine the differential rates in CRN by gender across a spectrum of socio-economic factors among the adult population in the US. Method: Data from the 2015 National Financial Capability Study (NFCS) were used for this study. CRN is identified if a respondent indicated not filling a prescription for medicine because of the cost and/or skipping a medical test, treatment, or follow-up recommended by a doctor because of the cost in the past 12 months. The differential rates in CRN by gender were assessed across socio-economic strata. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the difference in CRN rates by gender, controlling for potential confounders. Results: A total of 26,287 adults were included in the analyses. Overall, the weighted CRN rate in the adult population is 19.8% for men and 26.2% for women. There was a clear pattern of differential rates in CRN across socio-economic strata by gender. Overall, men were less likely to report CRN (AOR=0.74; 95% CI=0.69-0.79), controlling for other risk factors. Conclusions: More research is needed to understand the behavioral aspects of gender difference in CRN. Patient-centered healthcare needs to take gender difference into account when addressing cost-related non-adherence behavior.","[Zhang, James X.; Meltzer, David O.] Univ Chicago, Dept Med, 5841 S Maryland Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Crowe, James M.] Univ Chicago, Sch Social Serv Adm, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Meltzer, David O.] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Meltzer, David O.] Univ Chicago, Harris Sch Publ Policy, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago; University of Chicago; University of Chicago; University of Chicago,"Zhang, JX (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Dept Med, Sect Hosp Med, 5841 S Maryland Ave,MC 5000, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",xzhang1@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu,"Zhang, James/HHS-8616-2022; Zhang, James X./AFN-7901-2022","Zhang, James X./0000-0002-6251-0474",,,,,24,13,15,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Examples include network origin-destination (OD) flow rates and visitor counts at sites, for example transit stations and public parks. From a modeling perspective, these data are aggregate counts at the top level, but are comprised of individual discrete choices at the lower level. Models of count data are widely applied in the transportation and traffic fields. However, only a moderate level of applications jointly model count observations at the top level with discrete choice models at the bottom level under a random utility maximization (RUM) framework. This paper considers modeling count data with an underlying choice process as a joint model that merges an observed event count process with a discrete choice process, where the count level is Poisson distributed. This model captures both processes within a single random utility framework that preserves a direct mapping between the count intensity and the utility of the chosen alternative, including unobserved variables and latent factors. The decision-making context examines discretionary activity type choice for activities completed within a one-day period. The results show that a model of count with endogenous choices can account for the mapping of impacts of choice attributes from the lower level towards the observed count at the top level emerging from choices, including the idiosyncratic term associated with the utility of choice alternatives. Furthermore, since this model preserves the linkage between the maximizing utility and rate parameter in the joint model, identifying the contribution of attributes between the two levels is possible.

The problem is to re-schedule flights and re-assign aircraft in real time with minimized recovery cost for airlines after disruptions occur. In most published studies, airport capacity and flexible maintenance are not considered simultaneously via an optimization approach. To bridge this gap, we propose a column generation heuristic to solve the problem. The framework consists of a master problem for selecting routes for aircraft and subproblems for generating routes. Airport capacity is explicitly considered in the master problem and swappable planned maintenances can be incorporated in the subproblem. Instead of discrete delay models which are widely adopted in much of the existing literature, in this work flight delays are continuous and optimized accurately in the subproblems. The continuous-delay model can improve the accuracy of the optimized recovery cost by up to 37.74%. The computational study based on real-world problems shows that the master problem gives very tight linear relaxation with small, often zero, optimality gaps. Large-scale problems can be solved within 6 min and the run time can be further shortened by parallelizing subproblems on more powerful hardware. In addition, from a managerial point of view, computational experiments reveal that swapping planned maintenances may bring a considerable reduction in recovery cost by about 20% and 60%, depending on specific problem instances. Furthermore, the decreasing marginal value of airport slot quota is found by computational experiments. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This study assessed the impacts of different irrigation applications on rice yield using the AquaCrop model. Experiments were conducted at two sites (On-station and On-farm) during the 2012/2013 and 2013/2014 dry seasons using five different irrigation treatments: field capacity (FC) moisture content (W1), saturated soil moisture content (SC; W-2), continuous flooding (CF; W-3), 10ETc (crop water requirement) (W-4), and 15ETc (W-5). A 115-day rice variety, Gbewaa (Jasmine 85), was transplanted with a spacing of 20 cm x 20 cm for the experiments. The AquaCrop model was calibrated in terms of green canopy cover (CC), aboveground dry biomass, harvest index (HI), and paddy rice yield. The model was validated using various efficiency criteria (coefficient of determination, root mean square error (RMSE), RMSE-observations, standard deviation ratio, index of agreement, and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency), and satisfactory simulation results were obtained for biomass, HI, yield, and green CC. The AquaCrop model proved to be robust and applicable for paddy rice under various irrigation methods, although it underestimated dry biomass and grain yield for all treatments except FC. The simulated rice yield was highly sensitive to the maximum CC. This study represents the first site-specific application of the AquaCrop model to paddy rice in Northern Ghana; therefore, the model should be further tested for different climatic conditions, soil types, and crop varieties in Ghana.","[Abdul-Ganiyu, Shaibu] Univ Dev Studies, Tamale, Ghana; [Kyei-Baffour, Nicholas; Agyare, Wilson Agyei] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Kumasi, Ghana; [Dogbe, Wilson] Savannah Agr Res Inst, Tamale, Ghana",University for Development Studies; Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology,"Abdul-Ganiyu, S (通讯作者)，Univ Dev Studies, Tamale, Ghana.",sganiyu2000@gmail.com,,,,,,,26,6,6,0,5,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG E, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN",2197-7348,,978-981-10-4796-1; 978-981-10-4794-7,SCI SUSTAIN SOC,,,2018,,,,,,,93,116,,10.1007/978-981-10-4796-1_6,0.0,,,24,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Ecology; Environmental Studies; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography,BK9QR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000444861300006,0

SRE patients (index= first post-diagnosis SRE) were propensity score matched 1:1 to patients without SRE (assigned pseudo-index) using baseline characteristics, and >= 1 month of continuous enrollment after index/pseudo-index date was required. Per-patient-per year (PPPY) HRU and costs (2016 US$) were determined for inpatient, outpatient, emergency department (ED), and outpatient pharmacy services during follow-up. Wilcoxon signed rank for means and McNemar's tests for proportions were used to assess differences. Negative binomial regression and generalized linear regression analyses estimated differences in HRU and costs, respectively, for the comparison of single vs multiple SREs. Results: Each cohort included 848 patients (mean age=61 - 62 years, 57% male) with no significant differences in pre-index demographic or clinical characteristics between matched cohorts. Versus nonSRE patients, SRE patients had significantly higher PPPY use (p < .0001) of inpatient hospitalizations, ED visits, outpatient pharmacy, and higher direct medical costs ($188,723 vs $108,160, p < .0001). Adjusted PPPY total costs were $209,820 in patients with multiple SREs; $159,797 in patients with one SRE. Limitations: SRE misclassification and residual confounding are possible. Conclusions: Among patients with MM, average annual costs were substantially higher in patients with SRE compared with matched non-SRE patients. The economic burden of SRE increased further with multiple events.","[Bhowmik, Debajyoti] Amgen Inc, One Amgen Ctr Dr,MS 28-3-A, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320 USA; [Hines, Dionne M.; Wade, Rolin L.] IQVIA, Plymouth Meeting, NC USA; [Intorcia, Michele] Amgen Europe GmbH, Zug, Switzerland",Amgen; IQVIA; Amgen; AMGEN Europe,"Bhowmik, D (通讯作者)，Amgen Inc, One Amgen Ctr Dr,MS 28-3-A, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320 USA.",dbhowmik@amgen.com,,,Amgen Inc.,Amgen Inc.(Amgen),This study was sponsored by Amgen Inc.,,28,12,13,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

In the model, patients could undergo surgery, or experience post-surgery complications, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, or die. Transition probabilities, costs, and utilities were derived from the literature. The impact of different surgical methods on body mass index (BMI) level in the base-case analysis was informed by the Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Registry and the Swedish Obese Subject (SOS) study. Healthcare resource use and costs were obtained from Belgian sources. A base-case analysis was performed for the population, the characteristics of which were obtained from surgery candidates in Belgium.Results: In the base-case analysis over a 10-year time horizon, the increment in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained from bariatric surgery vs CMM was 1.4 per patient, whereas the incremental cost was Euro3,788, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of Euro2,809 per QALY. Over a lifetime, bariatric surgery produced savings of Euro9,332, an additional 1.1 life years and 5.0 QALYs. Bariatric surgery was cost-effective at 10 years post-surgery and dominant over conventional management over a lifetime horizon.Limitations: The model did not include the whole scope of obesity-related complications, and also did not account for variation in surgery outcomes for different populations of diabetic patients. Also, the data about management of patients after surgery was based on assumptions and the opinion of a clinical expert.Conclusions: It was demonstrated that a current mix of bariatric surgery methods was cost-effective at 10 years post-surgery and cost-saving over the lifetime of the Belgian patient cohort considered in this analysis.","[Borisenko, Oleg] Synergus AB, Hlth Econ & Market Access, Stockholm, Sweden; [Lukyanov, Vasily] Synergus AB, Hlth Econ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Debergh, Isabelle; Dillemans, Bruno] AZ Sint Jan Brugge Oostende AV, Dienst Algemene Vaat & Kinderheelkunde, Campus Sint Jan,Ruddershove 10, B-8000 Brugge, Belgium",,"Lukyanov, V (通讯作者)，Synergus AB, Kevinge Strand 20, S-18257 Stockholm, Sweden.",vasily.lukyanov@synergus.com,,"Lukyanov, Vasily/0000-0001-9748-386X; Debergh, Isabelle/0000-0002-3852-0146","Medtronic, Inc.","Medtronic, Inc.(Medtronic)","This study was funded by Covidien, Inc.

Measures of health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) are widely used in health research. Such measures are effective in determining the presence or absence of symptoms and functional ability. However, HRQoL measures were not intended, nor designed, to determine the value to patients of alternative health states. Functions have no intrinsic value-they are a means to fulfil human needs. However, needs can be met in a variety of ways, for example by adopting different functions or by the provision of social services. It is possible to analyze all functions in terms of the needs they satisfy. A needs model has been applied in health research since the 1990s. It is concerned with the extent to which human needs are fulfilled in the presence of disease and its treatment. It is argued that this is the major concern of the patient. Needs-based measures are patient-centric and produce a valid unidimensional index of outcome. Consequently, they provide a direct means of measuring patient value. This approach provides the possibility of evaluating health services in terms of the value they provide to consumers and payers. It also has a role to play in real-world evidence studies and outcomes-based reimbursement. It is recommended that greater attention is given in future to the development of patient-reported outcome measures that provide direct assessments of patient value.","[McKenna, Stephen P.; Wilburn, Jeanette] Galen Res Ltd, B1 Chorlton Mill,3 Cambridge St, Manchester M1 5BY, Lancs, England; [McKenna, Stephen P.] Univ Manchester, Sch Hlth Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"McKenna, SP (通讯作者)，Galen Res Ltd, B1 Chorlton Mill,3 Cambridge St, Manchester M1 5BY, Lancs, England.",smckenna@galen-research.com,,"Thorpe, Jeanette/0000-0002-9168-5716",,,,,56,14,14,0,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

In doing so, we identify relevant literature to address the following questions: (1) What definitive guidance can clinical evidence offer eye physicians and their patients? (2) What aspects of omega-3 supplementation lack definitive evidence, and how might economic assessments help? Methods: A targeted and systematic search strategy based on PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) was designed in this study for refereed clinical trials of omega-3s in dry eye treatment. Four key databases were accessed. Records were filtered through a three-step process using predetermined inclusion criteria. Data was extracted for experimental design, sample population characteristics, content of test and control groups, symptoms and associated opthalmologic conditions, diagnostic measures, patient health outcomes, adverse events, and model time horizon. Results: A total of 219 records were initially identified, of which 21 prospective clinical trials, with a total of 2,973 participants, were admitted for review. Clinical evidence indicates that daily oral supplementation with omega-3s statistically correlates with dry eye treatment in the general symptomatic population as well as induced sub-populations. Reported adverse events are minimal. These trials nonetheless exhibit considerable heterogeneity in clinical endpoints, particularly as a result of the multi-factorial character of dry eye as well as continuous advances in scientific knowledge and technology. Their findings and recommendations appear to be of limited external validity. And causal inferences are needed, but difficult to establish. These have encouraged and sustained wide variations in ophthalmologic practice and normative decision-making. Conclusions: Comparability of omega-3 therapeutic efficacy and effectiveness remains a major challenge in dry eye disease management. Notwithstanding its multi-factorial character, addressing prevailing methodological and empirical issues in clinical trials will help reduce knowledge gaps and normative choices among eye physicians and patients alike. In this regard, pharmacoeconomics offers a useful and robust toolset through which analysis of cost-minimization, cost-effectiveness, and cost-utility as well as meta-analysis can be comparatively pursued. Blending measures of costs and outcomes puts in perspective the heterogeneity of clinical endpoints in keratoconjunctivitis sicca.","[Mendoza, Roger Lee] Wilmington Univ, Sch Business, 31 Reads Way, New Castle, DE 19720 USA",Wilmington University,"Mendoza, RL (通讯作者)，Wilmington Univ, Sch Business, 31 Reads Way, New Castle, DE 19720 USA.",roger.l.mendoza@wilmu.edu,"Mendoza, Roger Lee/AAX-2110-2020",,,,,,51,5,5,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Separating explicitly theses rules from the assignment procedure allows for a great deal of flexibility to model various priority rules. When the actual rules are endogenous, the framework can easily be embedded in a fixed-point specification. Computational experiments are performed on a realistic case study based on the morning rush hours of the timetable of Canton Vaud, Switzerland. The algorithm is able to assign the demand in very low computational times. The results provide evidences that the ordering of the passengers does not have a significant impact on aggregate performance indicators (such as average delay and level of unsatisfied demand), but that the variability at the individual passenger level is substantial. Thanks to its flexibility, our framework can easily be implemented by a railway operator who wishes to evaluate the effects of different policies in terms of passenger priorities.

Without empirical microscopic data, plausible but incorrect hypotheses perpetuate in the vacuum. The Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) project was undertaken to collect such data and the NGSIM data set has become the de facto standard, underlying the vast majority of empirically based advances of the past decade. But there has been a growing minority of researchers who have found unrealistic relationships in the NGSIM data. To date, the critical findings have almost exclusively come from the existing NGSIM database itself. Unfortunately, as this paper shows, the NGSIM errors are beyond anything that could be corrected strictly through cleaning or interpolation of the reported NGSIM data. This paper takes the deepest evaluation yet of the NGSIM data. This research manually re-extracts the vehicle trajectories from a portion of the original NGSIM video to explicitly quantify NGSIM errors, e.g., piecewise constant speeds punctuated by brief periods of large acceleration exhibited by the NGSIM data were not evident in the newly extracted trajectories. This point is particularly troublesome for applications that rely on acceleration, e.g., most car following models. The magnitude of errors exhibit a dependency on speed, location and vehicle length. Examples are shown Where a real vehicle stopped but the NGSIM trajectory does not and then overruns the location of the real leader. Needless to say, the re-extracted trajectories showed much cleaner speed-spacing relationships than the corresponding raw NGSIM trajectories. Finally, this work tracked the original NGSIM vehicles seen in one camera and added another 236 vehicles (11%) visible before/after the period of NGSIM tracking. As of publication, the manually re-extracted data from this paper will be released to the research community. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Through sharing real-time locations and receiving guidance from infrastructure, a CAV's arrival and request for green light at intersections can be approximately predicted along their routes. When many CAVs from multiple approaches at intersections place such requests, a central challenge is how to develop an intersection automation policy (IAP) to capture complex traffic dynamics and schedule resources (green lights) to serve both CAV requests (interpreted as request for green lights on a particular signal phase at time t) and traditional vehicles. To represent heterogeneous vehicle movements and dynamic signal timing plans, we first formulate the IAP optimization as a special case of machine scheduling problem using a mixed integer linear programming formulation. Then we develop a novel phase-time-traffic (PTR) hypernetwork model to represent heterogeneous traffic propagation under traffic signal operations. Since the IAP optimization; by nature, is a special sequential decision process, we also develop sequential branch-and-bound search algorithms over time to IAP optimization considering both CAVs and traditional vehicles in the PTR hypernetwork.

These disruptions may or may not occur during operations, and hence they need to be indirectly incorporated into the planned schedule by anticipating their likely occurrence times. We present a unique recovery method to handle these potential disruptions. Our method is based on partially swapping two planned routes in such a way that the effect on the planned schedule is minimal, if these disruptions are actually realized. The mathematical programming model for the multi-depot vehicle scheduling problem, which incorporates these robustness considerations, possesses a special structure. This special structure causes the conventional column generation method fall short as the resulting problem grows also row-wise when columns are generated. We design an exact simultaneous column-and-row generation algorithm to find a valid lower-bound. The novel aspect of this algorithm is the pricing subproblem, which generates pairs of routes that form recovery solutions. Compromising on exactness, we modify this algorithm in order to enable it to solve practical-sized instances efficiently. This heuristic algorithm is shown to provide very tight bounds on the randomly generated instances in a short computation time. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Ucar, Ezgi; Birbil, S.

We show that positive per-passenger charges might be able to support the implementation of monopoly fares at slot-constrained airports.

Unfortunately, disruptions disturb passenger railway transportation on a daily basis. Such a disruption causes infeasibilities in the timetable, rolling stock circulation, and crew schedule. We propose a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming model to tackle the RSRP. This formulation includes the possibility of using dead-heading trips (moving empty trains) during, and after, a disruption. Furthermore, passenger flows are included to handle the adjusted passenger demand after the occurrence of a disruption. Many rolling stock rescheduling models are unable to cope with changing passenger demand. In this paper we include passenger demand on a more accurate level in the RSRP. We have tested the model on different cases from Netherlands Railways. The results show that dead-heading trips are useful to reduce the number of cancelled trips and that adjusted passenger demand has a large influence on the rescheduled circulation.

In practice, we have observed that both OS and IS companies canvass for cargos. In addition, we have observed that more and more IS companies are forming alliances to obtain a better price from the OS companies by hiring a negotiation agent. We solve the strategy matrix based on the following questions: Who canvasses for cargos? Should a negotiation agent be hired? We find that when an OS company canvasses for cargos, a negotiation agent can raise the IS service price; however, when IS companies canvass for cargos, a negotiation agent can weaken an OS company's monopolistic advantage. We show that there exists a win-win situation when an OS company canvasses for cargos without a negotiation agent and that this win-win situation is Pareto-optimal for all shipping supply chain parties. Interestingly, by comparing the equilibriums under optimal strategies and equilibrium strategies, we identify a lose-lose situation. That is, a classic Prisoner's Dilemma occurs when IS companies canvass for cargos and a negotiation agent is hired.

Although such a measure is beneficial for the network performance, it creates virtual queues that do not interact with the rest of the traffic and assumes small unrestricted flow (i.e. almost zero disturbance). In reality, these queues can have a negative impact to traffic conditions upstream of the protected network that is not modelled. In this work an adaptive optimization scheme for perimeter control of heterogeneous transportation networks is developed and the aforementioned boundary control limitation is dropped. A nonlinear model is introduced that describes the evolution of the multi-region system over time, assuming the existence of well-defined MFDs. Multiple linear approximations of the model (for different set-points) are used for designing optimal multivariable integral feedback regulators. Since the resulting regulators are derived from approximations of the nonlinear dynamics, they are further enhanced in real-time with online learning/adaptive optimization, according to performance measurements. An iterative data-driven technique is integrated with the model-based design and its objective is to optimize the gain matrices and set-points of the multivariable perimeter controller based on real-time observations. The efficiency of the derived multi-boundary control scheme is tested in microsimulation for a large urban network with more than 1500 roads that is partitioned in multiple regions. The proposed control scheme is demonstrated to achieve a better distribution of congestion (by creating artificial inter-regional queues), thus preventing the network degradation and improving total delay and outflow.

The service is a sequence of ports (harbor cities) that the cruise ship visits. In this decision problem, the constraint about the availability of berths at each port is taken into account. In reality, if a cruise service is executed by the ship repeatedly for several times, the profit earned by the cruise service in each time decreases gradually. This effect of decreasing marginal profit is also considered in this study. We propose a nonlinear integer programming model to cater to the concavity of the function for the profit of operating a cruise service repeatedly. To solve the nonlinear model, two linearization methods are developed, one of which takes advantage of the concavity for a tailored linearization. Some properties of the problem are also investigated and proved by using the dynamic programming (DP) and two commonly used heuristics. In particular, we prove that if there is only one candidate cruise service, a greedy algorithm can derive the optimal solution. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed models and the efficiency of the proposed linearization methods. In case some parameters needed by the model are estimated inexactly, the proposed decision model demonstrates its robustness and can still obtain a near-optimal plan, which is verified by experiments based on extensive real cases.

We first present an iterative nonlinear programming (INP) approach, where the solutions of the original MINLP problem are obtained by solving a nonlinear programming problem and a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem iteratively. Moreover, an equivalent MILP formulation of the original MINLP model is developed and an approximated MILP approach is proposed to reduce the number of constraints introduced by passenger demand. A case study is conducted based on the practical data of the Beijing Yizhuang line, where the three proposed approaches are compared with a state-of-the-art approach and a practical method used by the traffic planners.

Choosing therapies that are both effective and cost-effective is becoming increasingly important. The aim of the present analysis was to assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of IDegLira for treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus not meeting glycemic targets on basal insulin, vs insulin glargine U100 plus insulin aspart, in the US setting. Materials and methods: Long-term projections of cost-effectiveness outcomes were made using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model. Clinical inputs were based on the DUAL VII trial, with costs (accounted from a healthcare payer perspective) and utilities based on published sources. Future costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 3% annually. Results: IDegLira was associated with increased discounted life expectancy by 0.02 years and increased discounted quality-adjusted life expectancy by 0.22 quality-adjusted life years compared with insulin glargine U100 plus insulin aspart. Evaluation of direct medical costs suggested that the mean cost per patient with IDegLira was $3,571 lower than with insulin glargine U100 plus insulin aspart. The cost saving was driven predominantly by the lower acquisition cost of IDegLira compared with insulin glargine U100 plus insulin aspart, with further cost savings identified as a result of avoided treatment of diabetes-related complications. IDegLira was associated with improved clinical outcomes at a reduced cost compared with insulin glargine U100 plus insulin aspart. Conclusions: Based on clinical trial data, the present analysis suggests that IDegLira is associated with improved clinical outcomes and cost savings compared with treatment with insulin glargine U100 plus insulin aspart for patients with type 2 diabetes not achieving glycemic control on basal insulin in the US. Therefore, IDegLira is likely to be considered dominant (cost saving and more effective) and, consequently, highly cost-effective in the US setting.","[Dempsey, Michael] Endocrine & Metab Consultants, Rockville, MD USA; [Mocarski, Michelle] Novo Nordisk Inc, Plainsboro, NJ USA; [Langer, Jakob] Novo Nordisk Pharma Ltd, Tokyo, Japan; [Hunt, Barnaby] Ossian Hlth Econ & Commun, Basel, Switzerland",Novo Nordisk; Novo Nordisk,"Hunt, B (通讯作者)，Ossian Hlth Econ & Commun GmbH, Baumleingasse 20, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland.",hunt@ossianconsulting.com,"Dempsey, Michael/GSM-7774-2022",,Novo Nordisk A/S,Novo Nordisk A/S(Novo Nordisk),The present cost-effectiveness analysis was supported by funding from Novo Nordisk A/S.,,43,6,6,2,14,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

We study the strategic formation of airline-HSR partnerships (depending on sunk costs and firms' bargaining power) and their effects on consumer surplus and social welfare. We assume that airline-HSR agreements serve to offer a bundle of domestic HSR and international air services. In a capacity purchase (CP) agreement, the airline buys train seats to sell the bundle, whereas in a joint venture (JV) agreement firms create a distinct business unit. We find that both agreements increase traffic in the network, and thereby may not reduce congestion at hub airports. We provide antitrust authorities with a simple two-tier test for the CP agreement to improve consumer surplus. Contrary to airline-HSR mergers, the JV agreement benefits consumers independent of hub congestion and mode substitution. Simulation results show that, in case of cooperation, public agencies should prefer firms to create a JV, unless the related sunk costs are far greater than the costs of the CP agreement.

In this paper, we consider a parcel delivery company interested in optimizing the rate of successful deliveries. By doing so, the company is able to offer a differentiated service, increasing customer satisfaction, and reducing the costs related to failed delivery attempts. In order to achieve this, routes must be designed in a way that visiting times are convenient for the customers. Revisits to some customers may also be planned, so that the expected number of successful deliveries increases. We propose availability profiles to represent the availability of customers during the delivery period. Using these profiles, we are able to compute the expected number of successful hits in a given route. We model the delivery problem as a set-partitioning problem, and solve it with a branch-and-price algorithm. The corresponding pricing problem is solved with a labeling procedure, in which reduced cost bounds are employed to discard unpromising partial routes. We show that the reduced cost of route extensions is bounded by the optimal solution to an orienteering problem, and efficiently compute bounds for that problem within the labeling procedure. Computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach for solving instances with up to 100 customers. A tradeoff analysis suggests that significant hit rate improvement can be achieved at the expense of small additional transportation cost. The results also indicate that flexibility regarding maximum route duration translates into an improved hit rate, and that planning revisits may reduce expected unsuccessful deliveries by more than 10%.

Everyday, a third-party logistics (3PL) company receives a number of orders from several auto manufacturers and needs to assign the orders to available trucks which pick up the orders from the warehouses where the orders are kept and deliver them to dealers. Each order corresponds to a specific car required by a given dealer and is associated with a value and one of the three car types, small, medium or large. The value of an order is defined by whether it is an emergency order and how many days it has been waiting to be assigned to a truck. Each delivery truck is allowed to visit a pre-specified subset of cities, and is associated with a specific capacity configuration, which specifies the number of slots available for each of the three car types. The problem is to assign a subset of the orders to available trucks and create a route for each truck to maximize the total reward of the assigned orders, defined as a given weight times the total value of the assigned orders minus the total transportation cost incurred, subject to a number of constraints. A column generation based heuristic algorithm is developed where the LP relaxation of the problem is decomposed into a master problem solved by a LP solver and a number of sub-problems solved by a dynamic programming based algorithm. The proposed algorithm is evaluated by comparing its solutions to upper bounds and shown to be capable of generating near-optimal solutions for practically sized problems in reasonable computational time. The algorithm is also compared to a rule-based greedy method used in practice based on real data sets from a 3PL company and shown to outperform the greedy method by a large margin.

Optimal control problems using the cell transmission model are usually non-convex, due to the nonlinear fundamental diagram, but a convex relaxation in which demand and supply constraints are relaxed is often used. Previous works have established conditions under which solutions of the relaxation can be made feasible with respect to the original constraints. In this work, we generalize these conditions and show that the control of flows into merging junctions is sufficient to do so if the objective is to minimize the total time spent in traffic. We derive this result by introducing an alternative system representation. In the new representation, the system dynamics are concave and state-monotone. We show that exactness of the convex relaxation of finite horizon optimal control problems follows from these properties. Deriving the main result via a characterization of the system dynamics allows one to treat arbitrary monotone, concave fundamental diagrams and several types of control for merging junctions in a uniform manner. The derivation also suggests a straightforward method to verify if the results continue to hold for extensions or modifications of the models studied in this work. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of the proposed TAS is to minimize the impact to both terminal and drayage operations. In regard to terminal operations, the TAS seeks to distribute the truck arrivals evenly throughout the day to avoid gate and yard congestion. In regard to drayage operations, the TAS explicitly considers the drayage truck tours and seeks to provide appointment times such that trucks do not have to deviate greatly from their original schedule. The proposed TAS is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP) and the model is solved using the Lingo commercial software. Experimental results indicate that the proposed TAS reduces the drayage operation cost by 11.5% compared to a TAS where its aim is only to minimize gate queuing time by making truck arrivals uniform throughout the day.","[Torkjazi, Mohammad; Huynh, Nathan; Shiri, Samaneh] Univ South Carolina, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 300 Main St, Columbia, SC 29208 USA",University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"Huynh, N (通讯作者)，Univ South Carolina, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 300 Main St, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",nathan.huynh@sc.edu,,,,,,,32,48,54,15,124,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1366-5545,,,TRANSPORT RES E-LOG,Transp.

In this paper, we propose, for the first time, a new flexible closed form MDCEV model that breaks the tight linkage between the discrete and continuous choice dimensions of the traditional MDC models. We do so by (1) employing a linear utility function of consumption for the first outside good (which removes the continuous consumption quantity of the outside good from the discrete consumption decision, and also helps in forecasting), and (2) using separate baseline utilities for the discrete and continuous consumption decisions. In the process of proposing our new formulation, we also revisit two issues related to the traditional MDC model. The first relates to clarification regarding the identification of the scale parameter of the error terms, and the second relates to the probability of the discrete choice component of the traditional MDC model (that is, the multivariate probability of consumption or not of the alternatives). We show why the scale parameter of the error terms is indeed estimable when a gamma-profile is used, as well as show how one may develop a closed-form expression for the discrete choice consumption probability. The latter contribution also presents a methodology to estimate pure multiple discrete choice models without the need for information on the continuous consumptions. Finally, we also develop forecasting procedures for our new MDC model structure. We demonstrate an application of the proposed model to the case of time-use of individuals. In a comparative empirical assessment of the fit from the proposed model and from the traditional MDCEV models, our proposed model performs better in terms of better predicting both the discrete outcome data as well as the continuous consumptions.

Considering specially satellites' real-time transshipment capacity (RTC) varying with transshipment and consolidation operations, we introduce the two-echelon distribution system considering the real-time transshipment capacity varying (called the 2E-DS-RTC). The 2E-DS-RTC adopts RTC constraints and time constraints to make routings of the two echelons interacting. Of each satellite, the RTC is constrained by the maximal transshipment capacity (MTC) and the occupied transshipment capacity. A mixed integer linear programming model for the 2E-DS-RTC is proposed. The savings-based algorithm followed by the variable neighborhood search phase is provided. The mathematical formulation and the two stage heuristic are tested by using 20 randomly-generated small-scale instances and 99 realistic instances with up to 30 satellites and 900 customers. Some small-scale instances can be solved directly by CPLEX to find exact solutions. The computational results of realistic instances indicate that the heuristic can solve various scale instances of the 2E-DS-RTC such that the solution quality and the computation time are acceptable.

Several structural results for special cases of the problem are derived and studied. A solution method based on the outer approximation of the nonlinear terms is developed to solve the problem. The efficiency of the proposed model and solution approach is investigated through extensive numerical studies. Ignoring correlations can increase the total costs of a production-location-inventory system. Accounting for correlations may lead to changes in supply chain configuration. The effect of capacity on computational times was more pronounced in lower correlations than higher correlations.

Limiting bus bunching, hence, is important for urban bus operations. In this study, we analyze a two-way-looking self equalizing control method for both deterministic and stochastic running times, derive its convergence properties, study the knock-on effect, and optimize its control parameter as a function of the number of buses operating in the route. By comparing the headways from both upstream and downstream of the control point, the control scheme will hold buses, if needed, at the control point to gradually restore the common headway of the system. By utilizing properties of the headway transition matrices associated with the control scheme, we prove that the bus headways will self-equalize under deterministic travel time. In addition, under the context of stochastic travel time variations, we prove that the headway variance of all buses will be reduced to a certain value by the control scheme. Further, we analyze the headway control parameter to determine its optimal value and adopt the scheme for dynamic control. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to illustrate the performance of this control scheme, with promising results. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Our implementation is easy to code for individuals familiar with matrix-based coding. Further, our new matrix-based implementation for the ME algorithm allows us to efficiently write the analytic matrix-based gradients of the approximated MVNCD function with respect to the abscissae and correlation parameters, an issue that is important in econometric model estimation. In addition, we propose four new analytic methods for approximating the MVNCD function. The paper then evaluates the ability of the multiple approximations for individual MVNCD evaluations as well as multinomial pro bit model estimation. As expected, in our tests for evaluating individual MVNCD functions, we found that the traditional GHK approach degrades rapidly as the dimensionality of integration increases: Concomitant with this degradation in accuracy is a rapid increase in computational time. The analytic approximation methods are also much more stable across different numbers of dimensions of integration, and even the simplest of these methods is superior to the GHK-500 beyond seven dimensions of integration. Based on all the evaluation results in this paper, we recommend the new Two-Variate Bivariate Screening (TVBS) method proposed in this paper as the evaluation approach for MVNCD function evaluation.

To provide flexible match schemes and increase the trading scale, we allow all-or-nothing principle for demanders and one-to-many principle for suppliers. Based on the parking slot allocation rule and the transaction payment rule, we first relax the single output restriction (suppliers can only submit bids on a single unit of one commodity) and propose a demander competition padding method (DC-PM) auction mechanism, which is used to solve potential budget deficit. To avoid the likely distorted social welfare resulted by the DC-PM auction mechanism and to add budget surplus, we further modify the parking slot allocation rule and the transaction payment rule in the DC-PM auction mechanism, and propose a modified demander competition padding method (MDC-PM) auction mechanism. Three economical properties of both auction mechanisms, i.e. incentive compatibility, individual rationality and budget balance, are proved, Numerical experiments show that the proposed two auction mechanisms can realize asymptotic efficiency as both demanders and suppliers approach infinity. Moreover, the DC-PM auction mechanism is superior to the MDC-PM auction mechanism with respect to participants' utilities and can maintain the strict lexicographic allocation order, and the MDC-PM auction mechanism outperforms the DC-PM auction mechanism in terms of welfare efficiency and platform's payoff. Issues of managerial implications for shared parking problem are further discussed in this paper. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: This study used a Markov model that employed a life-time time horizon, modeling patients from symptom onset of stroke until end of life. Clinical efficacy and safety data were taken from an individual patient level data (IPD) meta-analysis of clinical studies. The treatment effect of MT compared to usual care was measured by changes in modified Rankin Score (mRS). Post-treatment mRS scores were used to determine short- and long-term stroke care costs. Treatment costs were modeled, with health state utility values determined by literature review. All analyses were conducted using Microsoft Excel. Results: In comparison to usual care, MT is associated with higher costs ($10,666 per patient) and additional quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (0.8281 per patient), resulting in an incremental cost per QALY of $12,880. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated the reliability of the base case results across a range of assumptions. The higher cost associated with MT is, to an extent, offset by the cost savings resulting from lower stroke care costs due to improved patient outcomes. The life-time cost savings in terms of stroke care costs are estimated to be more than $8,000 per patient for patients who had received MT in combination with usual care. Limitations: Stroke care costs based on patient disability/functional level were not available and were derived. As a consequence, long-term care costs for patients with poorer outcomes may be under-estimated. Patient outcomes at 90 days were extrapolated to a lifetime horizon, but this approach was supported by long-term evidence on stroke survival. Conclusions: Mechanical thrombectomy is a cost-effective treatment option for AIS, with clinical benefits translating to short- and long-term cost benefits. This analysis supports rapid update of stroke care pathways to incorporate this therapy as a treatment option.","[Arora, Nimita; Makino, Koji; Tilden, Dominic] THEMA Consulting Pty Ltd, Pyrmont, NSW, Australia; [Lobotesis, Kyriakos] Imperial Coll Healthcare NHS Trust, Charing Cross Hosp, London, England; [Mitchell, Peter] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Gillespie, John] Medtron Australasia Pty Ltd, 2 Alma Rd, Macquarie Pk, NSW 2113, Australia",Imperial College London; University of Melbourne,"Gillespie, J (通讯作者)，Medtron Australasia Pty Ltd, 2 Alma Rd, Macquarie Pk, NSW 2113, Australia.",john.gillespie@medtronic.com,,,Medtronic,Medtronic(Medtronic),"This work was funded by Medtronic, the manufacturer of Solitaire stent retrievers.",,43,39,40,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Crisaborole ointment is a non-steroidal, phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor for the treatment of mild-to-moderate AD. In December 2016, crisaborole was approved in the US for mild-to-moderate AD in patients >= 2 years of age. Aims: To evaluate real-world utilization and cost of TCS and TCI in the US and estimate the budget impact of crisaborole over 2 years from a third-party payer perspective. Methods: TCS and TCI prescriptions in 2015 for patients >= 2 years of age with >= 1 AD diagnosis in the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan Commercial and Medicare Supplemental Research Databases were analyzed for patients receiving TO or TCS alone or in combination (TCS/TCI population) and patients receiving TCI alone or in combination with TCS (TCI population). A budget impact model used TCS and TCI market shares, annual use, and cost per prescription. Crisaborole uptake rates of 4.7% (TCS) and 20.2% (TCI), with an annual increase of 1% in year 2, were assumed. Budget impact was calculated as total and per-member-per-month (PMPM) cost over 2 years for a health plan of 1 million members. Results: Annual prescriptions/patient ranged from 1.36-6.41; annual cost/patient was $53-$1,465. The budget impact of crisaborole over 2 years in the TCS/TCI population was $350,946 (PMPM, $0.015), with increases of $162,106 in year 1 (PMPM, $0.014) and $188,841 in year 2 (PMPM, $0.016). The budget impact in the TCI population was -$22,871, with decreases of $11,160 in year 1 and $11,712 in year 2 (each PMPM, -$0.001). For both populations, one-way sensitivity analyses showed that budget impact was most sensitive to changes in crisaborole cost and annual use. Conclusions: From US payer perspectives, adoption of crisaborole results in modest pharmacy budget impact/savings.","[Clark, Ryan; Bozkaya, Duygu] Xcenda LLC, 4114 Woodlands Pkwy,Suite 402, Palm Harbor, FL 34685 USA; [Levenberg, Mark] Pfizer Inc, Collegeville, PA USA; [Faulkner, Steven; Smith, Timothy W.] Pfizer Inc, New York, NY USA; [Gerber, Robert A.] Pfizer Inc, Groton, CT 06340 USA","AmerisourceBergen Corporation; Xcenda, LLC; Pfizer; Pfizer; Pfizer","Clark, R (通讯作者)，Xcenda LLC, 4114 Woodlands Pkwy,Suite 402, Palm Harbor, FL 34685 USA.",ryan.clark@xcenda.com,,,Pfizer Inc.,Pfizer Inc.(Pfizer),"This study was funded by Pfizer Inc., which manufactures crisaborole ointment, 2%.",,29,6,7,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Methods: Budget impact was calculated over 2 years for a hypothetical US payer with 10-million commercial members. Model inputs were derived from published sources and from a case-matched analysis of Blue Health Intelligence (BHI) claims data for the years 2012-2016. To calculate the budget impact, the Status Quo budget (i.e. total cost for LE and sequelae-related medical treatment) was compared to the budget under each of three Alternate Payer Policy scenarios which assumed that a sub-set of patients was redistributed from their initial treatment groups to a group that received FLX. Model outputs included cumulative payer costs, net budget impact, and breakeven point. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the impact of model inputs on results. Results: Increasing access to FLX yielded a favorable budget impact in every scenario. For LE patients with comorbid CVI, the three alternate scenarios resulted in cumulative 2-year budget impacts of -$52,841, -$173,317, and -$375,601, respectively. For LE patients with comorbid frequent infections, the three alternate scenarios resulted in cumulative 2-year budget impacts of -$192,729, -$259,339, and -$613,179, respectively. Limitations: Use of claims data assumes accurate coding and does not allow one to control for disease severity or treatment adherence. Also, the distribution of patients between treatment arms was determined using claims data from a specific payer organization, and could differ for health plans with different coverage policies. Conclusions: While previous studies have illustrated cost savings with adoption of FLX, US commercial health plans may also achieve tangible cost savings by expanding access to FLX for LE patients with comorbid CVI and multiple infections.","[Cohen, Adam; Gaebler, Julia A.; Izhakoff, Jessica; Gullett, Laura] Hlth Advances LLC, 9 Riverside Rd, Weston, MA 02493 USA; [Niecko, Timothy] Niecko Hlth Econ LLC, Tierra Verde, FL USA; [O'Donnell, Thomas] Tufts Univ, Sch Med, Tufts Med Ctr, Cardiovasc Ctr,Dept Surg, Boston, MA 02111 USA; [O'Donnell, Thomas] Tactile Med, Minneapolis, MN USA",Tufts University; Tufts Medical Center,"Cohen, A (通讯作者)，Hlth Advances LLC, 9 Riverside Rd, Weston, MA 02493 USA.",acohen@healthadvances.com,,"Izhakoff Yellin, Jessica/0000-0002-2736-060X","Tactile Medical (Minneapolis, MN),","Tactile Medical (Minneapolis, MN),","This study was sponsored by Tactile Medical (Minneapolis, MN), the company that manufactures the Flexitouch pneumatic compression device for the treatment of lymphedema.",,31,3,3,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Multivariable analysis was used to compare the frequency of inpatient and outpatient revisits up to 6 months after an index encounter for CCO- vs medicinal honey-treated PUs.Results: The study identified 48,267 inpatients and 2,599 outpatients with PUs treated with CCO or medicinal honeys. Among study inpatients, n=44,725 (93%) were treated with CCO, and n=3,542 (7%) with medicinal honeys. CCO and medicinal honeys accounted for 1,826 (70%) and 773 (30%), respectively, of study outpatients. In adjusted models, those treated with CCO had lower odds for inpatient readmissions (OR=0.86, 95% CI=0.80-0.94) after inpatient index visits, and outpatient re-encounters both after inpatient (OR=0.73, 95% CI=0.67-0.79) and outpatient (OR=0.78, 95% CI=0.64-0.95) index visits in 6 months of follow-up.Limitations: The study was observational in nature, and did not adjust for reasons why patients were hospitalized initially, or why they returned to the facility. Although the study adjusted for differences in a variety of demographic, clinical, and hospital characteristics between the treatments, we are not able to rule out selection bias.Conclusion: Patients with CCO-treated PUs returned to inpatient and outpatient hospital settings less often compared with medicinal honey-treated PUs. These results from real-world administrative data help to gain a better understanding of the clinical characteristics of patients with PUs treated with these two debridement methods and the economic implications of debridement choice in the acute care setting.","[Dreyfus, Jill; James, Roberta; Gayle, Julie] Premier Inc, Charlotte, NC USA; [Delhougne, Gary; Waycaster, Curtis] Smith & Nephew, Ft Worth, TX USA","Premier, Inc.; Smith & Nephew","Dreyfus, J (通讯作者)，13034 Ballantyne Corp Pl, Charlotte, NC 28277 USA.",jill_dreyfus@premierinc.com,,,Smith Nephew,Smith Nephew,This study was funded by Smith & Nephew.,,36,6,6,0,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of dulaglutide vs insulin glargine for the management of T2DM from a Japanese healthcare perspective, in accordance with recently approved Japanese Cost-Effectiveness Guidelines. Methods: The IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model (version 9) was used to estimate the long-term costs and effects of treatment with dulaglutide and insulin glargine. Direct comparative data from the Araki 2015 trial (NCT01584232) was used to inform the analysis. Costs associated with treatment and complications were derived from Japanese sources wherever possible and inflated to 2015 Japanese Yen (JPY). Utilities were based upon a European systematic review of diabetes utilities and adjusted for use in a Japanese population. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (OWSA and PSA) were conducted on all inputs and key modeling assumptions. Results: Dulaglutide 0.75 mg was associated with higher quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), life years (LYs), and total costs, compared to insulin glargine, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 416,280 JPY/QALY gained. Treatment with dulaglutide increased the time alive and free from diabetes-related complications by 4 months. OWSA and PSA indicated that results were robust to plausible variations in input parameters and modeling assumptions. Limitations: Key limitations of this study are similar to other cost-utility analyses of diabetes, including the extrapolation of short-term clinical trial data into lifelong durations. In addition, due to the lack of robust published Japanese data, some values were derived from non-Japanese sources. Conclusions: This analysis suggests that dulaglutide 0.75 mg may be a cost-effective treatment alternative to insulin glargine for patients with T2DM in Japan.","[Ishii, Hitoshi] Nara Med Univ, Dept Diabetol, Kashihara, Nara, Japan; [Madin-Warburton, Matthew; Thornton-Jones, Lucy] IQVIA, London, England; [Strizek, Alena] Eli Lilly Australia, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Suzuki, Shuichi] Eli Lilly Japan KK, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan",Nara Medical University; IQVIA; Eli Lilly; Eli Lilly,"Suzuki, S (通讯作者)，Eli Lilly Japan KK, Chuo Ku, 7-1-5 Isogamidori, Kobe, Hyogo 6510086, Japan.",suzuki_shuichi@lilly.com,,"Suzuki, Shuichi/0000-0001-8922-7428",Eli Lilly and Company,Eli Lilly and Company(Eli Lilly),This paper was funded by Eli Lilly and Company.,,61,8,8,1,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The objective was to evaluate the economic value of HUK vs NBP for patients with AIS from a Chinese payees perspective. Methods: An economic evaluation based on data of patients who have been treated with either HUK (n = 488) or NBP (n = 885) from a prospective, phase IV, multi-center, clinical registry study (Chinese Acute Ischemic Stroke Treatment Outcome Registry, CASTOR) was conducted to analyze the cost and effectiveness of HUK vs NBP for AIS in China. Before the analysis, the patients were matched using propensity score. Both a cost-minimization analysis and a cost-effectiveness analysis were conducted to compare the matched pairs. A bootstrapping exercise was conducted for the matched arms to demonstrate the probability of one intervention being cost-effective over another for a given willingness-topay for an extra quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Results: After propensity score matching, 463 pairs were matched. The overall medical cost in the HUK arm is USD 2,701.20, while the NBP arm is USD 3,436.83, indicating HUK is preferred with cost-minimization analysis. Although the QALY gained in the HUK arm (0.77176) compared with the NBP arm (0.76831) is statistically insignificant (p==.4862), the cost-effectiveness analysis as exploratory analysis found that, compared with NBP, HUK is a cost-saving strategy with the lower costs of USD 735.63 and greater QALYs gained of 0.00345. Among the 5,000 bootstrapping replications, 100% indicates that HUK is cost-effective compared with NBP under a 1-time-GDP threshold; and 97.12% indicates the same under a 3-time-GDP threshold. Conclusion: This economic evaluation study indicates that administrating HUK is a cost-saving therapy compared with NBP for managing blood flow during AIS in the Chinese setting.","[Lin, Ziyi] Shanghai Centennial Sci Co Ltd, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Rao, Xiuqin; Zhang, Zhijun] Techpool Biopharma Co Ltd, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Xuan, Jianwei] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Hlth Econ Res Inst, 132 Waihuan Dong Rd, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University,"Xuan, JW (通讯作者)，Sun Yat Sen Univ, Hlth Econ Res Inst, 132 Waihuan Dong Rd, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",xuanjw3@sysu.edu.cn,,"Lin, Ziyi/0000-0002-3656-3601","Techpool Bio-pharma Co., Ltd.","Techpool Bio-pharma Co., Ltd.","This study was funded by Techpool Bio-pharma Co., Ltd.",,25,2,4,0,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

To this end, a model was used that factored in insomnia and the risk for hip fractures, which have devastating effects on the elderly. Methods: Data were derived from published papers. The target population was a virtual cohort of elderly patients (>= 65 years) with insomnia residing in Japan. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio as effectiveness measures. The investigators assumed the perspective of healthcare payers. Results: In the base-case analysis, suvorexant was cost-saving (suvorexant: $252.3, zolpidem: $328.7) and had higher QALYs gained (suvorexant: 0.0641, zolpidem: 0.0635) for elderly Japanese patients with insomnia compared with zolpidem, indicating that suvorexant was dominant. In the sensitivity analysis, the outcome changed from dominant to dominated due to the relative risk for hip fractures associated with suvorexant. However, when the other parameters were varied from the lower to the upper limits of their ranges, suvorexant remained dominant compared to zolpidem. Limitations: The relative risk for hip fractures for suvorexant used in the model was based on data from pre-approval clinical trials. More precise data may be needed. Conclusions: Suvorexant seemed to be more cost-effective than the alternative zolpidem. The findings suggested that suvorexant might be a viable alternative to zolpidem for elderly patients with insomnia. A sensitivity analysis showed that outcome varied depending on the relative risk for hip fractures associated with suvorexant. Further investigations may be needed for more precise results.","[Nishimura, Shinichi] MSD KK, Med Affairs, Tokyo, Japan; [Nishimura, Shinichi; Nakao, Mutsuhiro] Teikyo Univ, Grad Sch Publ Hlth, Tokyo, Japan; [Nakao, Mutsuhiro] Teikyo Univ Hosp, Div Psychosomat Med, Tokyo, Japan",Merck & Company; Teikyo University; Teikyo University,"Nishimura, S (通讯作者)，2-11-1 Kaga,Itabashi Ku, Tokyo 1028667, Japan.",sph-snishimura@med.teikyo-u.ac.jp,,"Nishimura, Shinichi/0000-0001-6013-8296",,,,,49,6,6,0,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Case studies on the introduction of Vetiver technology in Ethiopia and Nigeria revealed the multiple benefits of this technique. In Ethiopia, the percentages of water lost as runoff in 2001 were 14% for bare land, 10% for land protected with Vetiver strips, and 11% for coffee fields integrated with Vetiver buffer strips (VBSs); in 2002, the corresponding values were 13%, 6%, and 5%, respectively, and the runoff rates in 2003 were 11%, < 0.5%, and < 0.5%, respectively. On a steep field in southeastern Nigeria, the percentages of rainfall lost as runoff under usual farming practice (UP) were 29% and 21% in 2010 and 2011, respectively. In contrast, in 2010, the percentages of water loss in the plots with Vetiver intervention were 7%, 12%, and 13% for plots with VBSs at intervals of 5, 15, and 25 m, respectively; the corresponding values in 2011 were 8%, 11%, and 11%, respectively. Soil organic carbon losses in fields under UP were 118% and 400% higher than those in fields with VBSs at 5-m intervals in 2010 and 2011, respectively, and the corresponding nitrogen losses were 133% and 350% higher.

However, actions and studies encompassing empirical field tests of the assessment instruments are relatively few. This chapter reports the outcomes of an empirically applied resilience assessment framework, hereafter referred to as the Ghana Model, which was initiated as part of the Enhancing Resilience to Climate and Ecosystem Changes in Semi-Arid Africa: An Integrated Approach (CECAR-Africa) project, implemented in Ghana's semiarid ecosystem. The chapter provides a concise description of the Ghana Model as an integrated resilience assessment framework as underpinned by seven principles while highlighting the concrete actions and steps taken in operationalizing it. As a clinically valid approach for resilience assessment, the Ghana Model provides valuable evidence to aid decision and policymakers in Ghana in designing and implementing adaptation strategies for climate change in vulnerable communities and households. As a resilience assessment template, it can be applied in other ecosystems within other sub-Saharan African countries as well as other developing economies. The Ghana Model can enrich ongoing discourse on global sustainability as well as provide relevant output toward the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals.","[Saito, Osamu; Kikuko, Shoyama] United Nations Univ, Inst Adv Study Sustainabil, UNU IAS, Tokyo, Japan; [Boafo, Yaw Agyeman] Univ Tokyo, Integrated Res Syst Sustainabil Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Jasaw, Godfred Seidu] Univ Dev Studies, Fac Planning & Land Management, Wa, Ghana; [Antwi, Effah Kwabena; Takeuchi, Kazuhiko] UTIAS, Integrated Res Syst Sustainabil Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Kranjac-Berisavljevic, Gordana] Univ Dev Studies, Tamale, Ghana; [Yeboah, Richard Wilfred Nartey] Univ Dev Studies, Dept Agribusiness Management & Finance, Tamale, Ghana; [Obeng, Francis] Univ Dev Studies, Nyankpala Campus, Nyankpala, Ghana; [Gyasi, Edwin A.] Univ Ghana, Dept Geog & Resource Dev, Legon, Accra, Ghana; [Takeuchi, Kazuhiko] IGES, Kanagawa, Japan",United Nations University; University of Tokyo; University for Development Studies; University for Development Studies; University for Development Studies; University for Development Studies; University of Ghana,"Saito, O (通讯作者)，United Nations Univ, Inst Adv Study Sustainabil, UNU IAS, Tokyo, Japan.;Antwi, EK (通讯作者)，UTIAS, Integrated Res Syst Sustainabil Sci, Tokyo, Japan.",saito@unu.edu; yboafo@gmail.com; effah.can@gmail.com,"Saito, Osamu/AAH-6091-2020; Boafo, Yaw Agyeman/R-8277-2019; Saito, Osamu/AAU-1495-2021","Saito, Osamu/0000-0002-0697-9593; Boafo, Yaw Agyeman/0000-0003-1430-7655;",,,,,59,1,1,0,9,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG E, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN",2197-7348,,978-981-10-4796-1; 978-981-10-4794-7,SCI SUSTAIN SOC,,,2018,,,,,,,11,37,,10.1007/978-981-10-4796-1_2,0.0,,,27,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Ecology; Environmental Studies; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography,BK9QR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000444861300002,0

This study aimed to compare total healthcare cost between rivaroxaban and placebo, based on the EINSTEIN-EXT event rates. Methods: Total healthcare cost was calculated as the sum of treatment and clinical event costs from a US managed care perspective. Treatment duration and event rates were obtained from the EINSTEIN-EXT study. Adjustment on treatment duration was made by assuming a 10% non-adherence rate. Drug costs were based on wholesale acquisition costs. Cost estimates for clinical events (i.e. recurrent deep vein thrombosis [DVT], recurrent pulmonary embolism, major bleeding, clinically relevant non-major bleeding) were determined from the literature. Results were examined over a +/- 20% range of each cost component and over 95% confidence intervals {Cls) of event rate differences in deterministic (one-way) and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA). Results: Total healthcare cost was $1,454 lower for rivaroxaban-treated (vs placebo-treated) patients in the base-case, with a lower clinical event cost fully offsetting drug cost. The cost savings of recurrent DVT alone (-$3,102) was greater than drug cost ($2,723). Total healthcare cost remained lower for rivaroxaban in the majority (73%) of PSA {cost difference [95% CI] = -$1,454 [-$2,396, $1,231]). Limitations: This study was conducted over the 1-year observation period of the EINSTEIN-EXT trial, which limited real-world applicability and examination of long-term economic impact. Assumptions on drug and clinical event costs were US-based and, thus, not applicable to other healthcare systems. Conclusions: Total healthcare costs were estimated to be lower for patients continuing rivaroxaban therapy compared to those receiving placebo in VTE patients who had completed 6-12 months of VTE treatment.","[Wells, Philip S.] Univ Ottawa, Ottawa Hosp, Res Inst, Dept Med, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Lensing, Anthonie W.

The problem of estimating travel demand based on sensor data often results in an ill-posed inverse problem, where solution uniqueness cannot be ensured. To overcome this challenge, effective utilization of more information/data, preferably from reliable sources, becomes critical. Conventional demand estimation methods often sacrifice system structural information during the process of compressing sensor data into its statistics. Loss of structural information, which captures critical relation between observed and estimated parameters, inevitably causes more dependence on unrealistic assumptions and unreliable data. Our model is designed to preserve all structural information contained from different observation sets and allow it to directly contribute to the identification of population parameters of travel demand. The proposed hierarchical framework integrates two traditionally distinctive identification problems, mean demand estimation and trip table reconstruction. Through mathematical analyses and numerical experiments, we show that the proposed framework improves parameter identifiability and leads to better estimation quality compared to conventional methods. The proposed framework is also flexible to accommodate a wide variety of travel behavior assumptions and estimation principles. As an example among many possible alternatives, Wardrop equilibrium based traffic assignment and generalized least square are implemented and tested using a case study based on a moderately large network.

Unlike most of the previous literature, we characterize the equilibrium in terms of timing of arrivals in a continuous-time congestion model when firms simultaneously schedule services. Using the Henderson-Chu dynamic model of flow congestion in a multiple-firm setting, we find that a stable and unique Nash equilibrium in pure strategies always exists. Importantly, it also exists in cases where it fails to exist under bottleneck congestion (notably when the value of schedule late exceeds the value of travel delays). We find that symmetric firms schedule arrivals inefficiently, and strongly concentrated around the desired arrival time so that the peak is shorter and delays are higher than socially optimal. We show that when firms are asymmetric in terms of output, all firms schedule vehicles in the peak center, around the desired arrival time, with arrival windows increasing with firm size such that a smaller firm's window is always fully contained in a larger firm's window and only the largest firm operates in the early and late shoulders. Furthermore, for any pair of asymmetric firms, the larger firm has a higher instantaneous arrival rate at any moment where both firms schedule arrivals. Our results also show that even though self-internalization can be substantial, there is scope for decentralizing the first-best outcome through time-varying tolls. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The strong similarities in the spacetime trajectories and the bi-variate phase plots as well as the relative consistence of the estimated proportionality parameter across all three types of traffic, suggest that a unified behavioral mechanism is at play in human driven traffic. It is suggested that this mechanism is essentially a safety-driven behavior that vehicles, bicycles or pedestrians adopt a safe speed for a given spacing between them. This behavior is well described by a well-known model in vehicular traffic and it is shown in this paper that a scaled version of this model applies to all three types of traffic. A unified relaxation-driven social force traffic model is then proposed to incorporate this behavior mechanism. Simulations with the same setup as the real-life experiments were carried out for vehicle, bicycle, and pedestrian traffic using the unified traffic model and the simulated spacetime trajectories and fundamental diagrams show remarkable consistence with the experimental results.

Proposed parking assistance solutions combine sensors, either as part of fixed infrastructure or onboard vehicles, wireless networking technologies and mobile social applications running on smartphones to collect, share and present to drivers real-time information about parking demand and availability. One question that arises is how does (and should) the driver actually use such information to take parking decisions, e.g., whether to search for on-street parking space or drive to a parking lot and, in the latter case, which one. The paper is, hence, a performance analysis study that seeks to capture the highly behavioral and heuristic dimension of drivers' decisions and its impact on the efficiency of the parking search process. To this end, and in sharp contrast with the existing literature, we model drivers as agents of bounded rationality and assume that their choices are directed by lexicographic heuristics, an instance of the fast and frugal heuristics developed in behavioral sciences such as psychology and biology. We analyze the performance of the search process under these heuristics and compare it against the predictions of normative game-theoretic models that assume fully rational strategically acting agents. We derive conditions under which the game-theoretic norms turn out to be more pessimistic than the simpler heuristic choice rules and show that these are fulfilled for a broad range of scenarios concerning the fees charged for the parking resources and their distance from the destinations of the drivers' trips. The practical implications of these results for parking assistance solutions are identified and thoroughly discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the utility of PEVs, as well as reduction of emissions is highly dependent on daily vehicle kilometres travelled (VKT). Further, the daily VKT by individual passenger cars vary strongly between days. A common method to analyse individual daily VKT is to fit distribution functions and to further analyse these fits. However, several distributions for individual daily VKT have been discussed in the literature without conclusive decision on the best distribution. Here we analyse three two-parameter distribution functions for the variation in daily VKT with four sets of travel data covering a total of 190,000 driving days and 9.5 million VKT. Specifically, we look at overall performance of the distributions on the data using four goodness of fit measures, as well as the consequence of choosing one distribution over the others for two common PEV applications: the days requiring adaptation for battery electric vehicles and the utility factor for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. We find the Weibull distribution to fit most vehicles well but not all and at the same time yielding good predictions for PEV related attributes. Furthermore, the choice of distribution impacts PEV usage factors. Here, the Weibull distribution yields reliable estimates for electric vehicle applications whereas the log-normal distribution yields more conservative estimates for PEV usage factors. Our results help to guide the choice of distribution for a specific research question utilising driving data and provide a methodological advancement in the application of distribution functions to longitudinal driving data.

Extracting the driving experience of taxi drivers to learn about the best routes and to support dynamic route planning can greatly help both end users and governments to ease traffic problems. Travel frequency representing the popularity of different road segments plays an important role in experience-based path-finding models and route computation. However, global frequency used in previous studies does not take into account the dynamic space-time characteristics of origins and destinations and the detailed travel frequency in different directions on the same road segment. This paper presents the space-time trajectory cube as a framework for dividing and organizing the trajectory space in terms of three dimensions (origin, destination, and time). After that, space-time trajectory cube computation and origin-destination constrained experience extraction methods are proposed to extract the fine-grained experience of taxi drivers based on a dataset of real taxi trajectories. Finally, space-time constrained graph was generated by merging drivers' experience with the road network to compute optimal routes. The framework and methods were implemented using a taxi trajectory dataset from Shenzhen, China. The results show that the proposed methods effectively extracted the driving experience of the taxi drivers and the entailed trade-off between route length and travel time for routes with high trajectory coverage. They also indicate that road segment global frequency is not appropriate for representing driving experience in route planning models. These results are important for future research on route planning or path finding methods and their applications in navigation systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this study was to assess the pharmacoeconomic profile of ulipristal acetate compared to leuprolide for the pre-operative treatment of moderate-to-severe uterine fibroids in women of reproductive age in The Netherlands. The analysis was performed and applied within the framework of the ulipristal acetate submission for reimbursement in 2012. Methods: A decision model was developed to compare the total costs of ulipristal acetate compared to leuprolide, the standard care in The Netherlands. The target population of this study corresponded to the type of patients included in the PEARL II clinical trial; i.e. women of reproductive age requiring pre-operative treatment for uterine fibroids. Sensitivity analysis was implemented to assess uncertainties. Data regarding costs, effects, and other input parameters were obtained from relevant published literatures, the Dutch Healthcare Insurance Board, and expert opinion obtained by means of a panel of experts from several medical centers in The Netherlands. Results: In The Netherlands, the total costs of ulipristal acetate and leuprolide were estimated at Euro4,216,027 and Euro4,218,095, respectively. The annual savings of ulipristal acetate were, therefore, estimated at Euro2,068. The major driver of this cost difference was the cost of administration for leuprolide. Sensitivity analyses showed that ulipristal acetate mostly remained cost-saving over a range of assumptions. The budget impact analysis indicated that the introduction of ulipristal acetate was estimated to result in cost savings in the first 3 years following the introduction. The results of this study were used in the decision on reimbursement of ulipristal acetate according to the Dutch Reference Pricing system in 2012. Conclusion: Ulipristal acetate was cost saving compared to leuprolide and has the potential to provide substantial savings on the healthcare budget in The Netherlands.","[Zakiyah, N.; van Asselt, A.

The initial treatment approach for CLI may significantly impact the subsequent risk of major amputation or death. The objective of this study was to describe the initial treatment approaches of patients with CLI and the limb outcomes associated with each approach.Methods: Data from MarketScan Commercial and Medicare Supplemental Databases from January 2006-December 2014 was utilized. Cohorts of CLI patients were defined as follows: (1) peripheral vascular intervention (PVI); (2) peripheral vascular surgery (PVS); (3) minor amputation without concomitant PVI or PVS (MinAMP); and (4) Patients without PVI, PVS, or MinAMP (conservative therapy). The odds of major amputation or inpatient death were estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model. For those patients requiring a major amputation, the incremental expenditures per member per month (PMPM) were estimated using a gamma log-link model.Results: Conservative therapy was associated with significantly higher odds of major amputation or inpatient death compared to patients who underwent minor amputation (1.59-times), PVI (2.08-times), or PVS (2.12-times). Patients treated with an initial strategy of minor amputation also had higher odds of major amputation or inpatient death compared to PVS (1.31-times) or PVI (1.33-times). The estimated incremental expenditures PMPM for patients with a major amputation was $5,165.Conclusions: Revascularization reduces the risk of a major amputation or inpatient death for patients with CLI when compared to conservative therapy. Major amputation is also associated with significantly higher healthcare expenditures.","[Armstrong, Ehrin J.] Univ Colorado, Denver, CO 80202 USA; [Ryan, Michael P.; Baker, Erin R.; Gunnarsson, Candace] CTI Clin Trial & Consulting Serv Inc, 100 E RiverCtr Blvd, Covington, KY 41011 USA; [Martinsen, Brad J.; Kotlarz, Harry] Cardiovasc Syst Inc, St Paul, MN USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Denver,"Gunnarsson, C (通讯作者)，CTI Clin Trial & Consulting Serv Inc, 100 E RiverCtr Blvd, Covington, KY 41011 USA.",cgunnarsson@ctifacts.com,,,"Cardiovascular Systems, Inc.","Cardiovascular Systems, Inc.","This study was sponsored by Cardiovascular Systems, Inc.",,28,14,15,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Hypertension is a significant predictor of ADPKD progression, and a risk factor for development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the most common cause for mortality among ADPKD patients. Angiotensin-converting enzymes inhibitors (ACE-I) are widely used as first-line treatment in ADPKD for the management of hypertension. However, their cost-effectiveness relative to other hypertensive medications, such as angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), has never been assessed. Objective: To determine if ARB are more cost-effective than ACE-Is as first-line treatment in ADPKD. Methods: A Markov-state decision model was constructed for estimation of cost and outcome benefits in hypertensive ADPKD patients. Transition probabilities were extrapolated from a retrospective cohort study comparing chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage transitions in ADPKD patients. Annual pharmaceutical costs per average daily dose per CKD stage were extracted from a US healthcare claims database. Median total healthcare costs per CKD stage or transplant were extracted from the published literature. The time horizon was set to 30 years, with 1-year duration to cycle shift. A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of ACE-I vs ARB per additional year of prevented transplant and/or death. A one-way probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted, with 10% variation in probabilities and cost. Results: Total annual healthcare costs accrued after 30 years among ADPKD patients taking ACE-Is was estimated to be $3,505,028.41, compared to ARB at $3,644,327.65. Life expectancy was increased by 1.39 years among patients taking ACE-I. Approximate 10-year survival in patients taking ACE-Is was 47% compared to ARB at 34%. Conclusions: ACE-I dominated ARB and displayed greater cost-effectiveness due to lower cost and increased capacity to prolong years of life without transplant or death among hypertensive ADPKD patients. This model strengthens the value of ACE-I over ARB as first-line treatment for hypertension management in ADPKD patients.","[Clark, L. A.; Whitmire, S.; Patton, S.; Clark, C.; Blanchette, C.

The effect of DMTs on indirect costs has not been consistently explored in cost-effectiveness studies thus far. The value to patients of an emerging DMT, ocrelizumab, was quantified in comparison to subcutaneous interferon beta-1a (IFN beta SC) for the prevalent RRMS population with mild-to-moderate disability in the US, based on two Phase 3 trials, OPERA I and OPERA II, of ocrelizumab vs IFN beta SC in RRMS. Materials and methods: A Markov model was developed to compare disability progression as measured by Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and relapse outcomes over a 30-year horizon for ocrelizumab vs IFNbSC. Direct, indirect, and informal costs (2016 US dollars) and utilities for EDSS health states were obtained from the literature. Hazard ratios for disability progression and relapse rates were estimated from clinical trials. Value was assessed by calculating the net monetary benefit (NMB), defined as the monetary value of discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) minus total costs, where the value of a QALY was $150,000. One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: Ocrelizumab was associated with an incremental gain of 0.84 QALYs and cost savings of $ 287,713 relative to IFNbSC, resulting in an incremental NMB (INMB) of $ 413,611 per person over 30 years. The INMB increased by $151,763 for those initiating ocrelizumab at EDSS level 1 vs level 4. Influential parameters were QALY value, treatment costs, and disability progression; however, all sensitivity analyses indicated that the INMB for ocrelizumab relative to IFNbSC was >= $ 300,000 per person. Conclusions: Ocrelizumab provides greater value to RRMS patients compared with IFNbSC. Initiating ocrelizumab at lower EDSS levels leads to a greater cumulative value due to slower disability progression, which extends years with higher quality-of-life.","[Frasco, Melissa A.; Shih, Tiffany; Incerti, Devin; Espinosa, Oliver Diaz; Vania, Diana K.] Precis Hlth Econ, 11100 Santa Monica Blvd,Suite 500, Los Angeles, CA 90025 USA; [Thomas, Nina] Genentech Inc, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA",Roche Holding; Genentech,"Frasco, MA (通讯作者)，Precis Hlth Econ, 11100 Santa Monica Blvd,Suite 500, Los Angeles, CA 90025 USA.",melissa.frasco@precisionhealtheconomics.com,"Incerti, Devin/ABD-8096-2020","Nagarwalla, Diana/0000-0001-8716-5446","Genentech, Inc.","Genentech, Inc.(Roche HoldingGenentech)","This research was sponsored by Genentech, Inc., manufacturer of ocrelizumab (Ocrevus).

The aim of the present analysis was to assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of IDegLira vs liraglutide added to basal insulin, for patients with type 2 diabetes not achieving glycemic control on basal insulin in the US setting. Methods: Projections of lifetime costs and clinical outcomes were made using the IMS CORE Diabetes Model. Treatment effect data for patients receiving IDegLira and liraglutide added to basal insulin were modeled based on the outcomes of a published indirect comparison, as no head-to-head clinical trial data is currently available. Costs were accounted in 2015US dollars ($) from a healthcare payer perspective. Results: IDegLira was associated with small improvements in quality-adjusted life expectancy compared with liraglutide added to basal insulin (8.94 vs 8.91 discounted quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]). The key driver of improved clinical outcomes was the greater reduction in glycated hemoglobin associated with IDegLira. IDegLira was associated with mean costs savings of $17,687 over patient lifetimes vs liraglutide added to basal insulin, resulting from lower treatment costs and cost savings as a result of complications avoided. Conclusions: The present long-term modeling analysis found that IDegLira was dominant vs liraglutide added to basal insulin for patients with type 2 diabetes failing to achieve glycemic control on basal insulin in the US, improving clinical outcomes and reducing direct costs.","[Hunt, B.; Valentine, W.

The aim of this study was to explore predictors for the real-world AF-related in-hospital costs in patients that recently initiated anticoagulation with acenocoumarol or dabigatran.Methods: Predictors for claimed total hospital care costs and cardiology costs in AF patients were explored by using hospital financial claims data from propensity score matched patient groups in a large Dutch community hospital. This study analyzed the total dataset (n=766) and carried out a secondary analysis for all matched pairs of anticoagulation naive AF patients (n=590) by ordinal regression.Results: Dabigatran was a predictor for significantly lower cardiology and total hospital care costs (Odds Ratio [OR]=0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.33-0.57; and OR=0.60, 95% CI=0.46-0.79, respectively). Female gender was a predictor for lower total hospital care costs. Predictors for an increase in total hospital care costs were the occurrence of stroke or systemic embolism, major bleeding, and minor bleeding. The costs predictors were comparable when limiting the analysis to patients that were anticoagulation naive. Age and CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc were not predictors for either cardiology or total hospital care costs in both analyses.Conclusion: Dabigatran treatment was as a predictor for lower cardiology costs and lower total hospital care costs in AF patients that initiated oral anticoagulation.","[Jacobs, M.

Materials and methods: Patients (aged >= 21 years) who underwent LRY or LSG during a hospital admission (January 1, 2012-September 30, 2015) were identified from the Premier Perspective Hospital Database. Use of powered vs manual staplers was identified from hospital administrative billing records. Multivariable analyses were used to compare the following outcomes between the powered and manual stapler groups, adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics and hospital-level clustering: hospital length of stay (LOS), total hospital costs, medical/surgical supply costs, room and board costs, operating room costs, operating room time, discharge status, bleeding/transfusion during the hospital admission, and 30, 60, and 90-day all-cause readmissions. Results: The powered and manual stapler groups comprised 9,851 patients (mean age = 44.6 years; 79.3% female) and 21,558 patients (mean age = 45.0 years; 78.0% female), respectively. In the multivariable analyses, adjusted mean hospital LOS was 2.1 days for both the powered and manual stapler groups (p = .981). Adjusted mean total hospital costs ($ 12,415 vs $ 13,547, p = .003), adjusted mean supply costs ($ 4,629 vs $ 5,217, p = .011), and adjusted mean operating room costs ($ 4,126 vs $ 4,413, p = .009) were significantly lower in the powered vs manual stapler group. The adjusted rate of bleeding and/or transfusion during the hospital admission (2.46% vs 3.22%, p = .025) was significantly lower in the powered vs manual stapler group. The adjusted rates of 30, 60, and 90-day all-cause readmissions were similar between the groups (all p>. 05). Sub-analysis by manufacturer showed similar results. Limitations: This observational study cannot establish causal linkages. Conclusions: In this analysis of patients who underwent LRY or LSG, the use of powered staplers was associated with better economic outcomes, and a lower rate of bleeding/transfusion vs manual staplers in the real-world setting.","[Roy, Sanjoy] Ethicon, Somerville, NJ USA; [Yoo, Andrew; Yadalam, Sashi; Kalsekar, Iftekhar; Johnston, Stephen S.] Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ USA; [Fegelman, Elliott J.] Johnson & Johnson Med Devices, Global Med Affairs, Cincinnati, OH USA",Johnson & Johnson; Johnson & Johnson USA; Johnson & Johnson; Johnson & Johnson USA,"Johnston, SS (通讯作者)，Real World Data Analyt & Res Epidemiol Med Device, 410 George St, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",sjohn147@its.jnj.com,,"Roy, Dr. Sanjoy/0000-0002-9327-6350; yoo, andrew/0000-0001-7208-3587",Johnson Johnson,Johnson Johnson(Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson USA),"This study and development of this manuscript was supported by Johnson & Johnson (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ).",,34,20,21,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Methods: Electrophysiologists (EPs) from four geographical regions (Western Europe, Australia, Japan, and North America) were invited to participate. Survey questions focused on HRU in the management of three chronic pacemaker complications (i.e. pacemaker infections requiring extraction, lead fractures/insulation breaches requiring replacement, and upper extremity deep venous thrombosis [DVT]). Panelists completed a maximum of two web-based surveys (iterative rounds). Mean, median values, and interquartile ranges were calculated and used to establish consensus. Results: Overall, 32 and 29 panelists participated in the first and second rounds of the Delphi panel, respectively. Consensus was reached on treatment and HRU associated with a typical pacemaker implantation and complications. HRU was similar across regions, except for Japan, where panelists reported the longest duration of hospital stay in all scenarios. Infections were the most resource-intensive complications and were characterized by intravenous antibiotics days of 9.6-13.5 days and 21.3-29.2 days for pocket and lead infections respectively; laboratory and diagnostic tests, and system extraction and replacement procedures. DVT, on the other hand, was the least resource intensive complication. Limitations: The results of the panel represent the views of the respondents who participated and may not be generalizable outside of this panel. The surveys were limited in scope and, therefore, did not include questions on management of acute complications (e.g. hematoma, pneumothorax). Conclusions: The Delphi technique provided a reliable and efficient approach to estimating resource utilization associated with chronic pacemaker complications. Estimates from the Delphi panel can be used to generate costs of pacemaker complications in various regions.","[Waweru, Catherine] Medtron Plc, Mounds View, MN USA; [Steenrod, Anna; Wyrwich, Kathleen W.] Evidera, Bethesda, MD USA; [Wolff, Claudia; Eggington, Simon] Medtronic, Tolochenaz, Switzerland; [Wright, David Jay] Liverpool Heart & Chest Hosp, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",Evidera; Medtronic; Liverpool Heart & Chest Hospital,"Waweru, C (通讯作者)，Medtron Plc, Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure, 8200 Coral Sea St NE,MVS33, Mounds View, MN 55112 USA.",catherine.waweru@medtronic.com,,,Medtronic,Medtronic(Medtronic),This work was supported by Medtronic.,,25,3,3,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

It serves as the key factor of hospital cost and cost control. It has been a challenge to estimate the disease cost because of the complexity of the disease pathology, individual differences of treatment process, adverse drug reaction, and complications. Especially in some high risk and high noise diseases there is another challenge from small sample and poor data. Grey relational analysis is a kind of effective method to study small sample, and poor data. In this paper, an improved model based on grey relational analysis and case-based reasoning is proposed to estimate the disease cost. Firstly, the similarity on cost attributes is calculated through the grey relational analysis method. And then the optimal attribute weights is found with the cuckoo search algorithm and there are a few cases matching to the target case according to the similarity in the historical case database to estimate the cost of target case. At last the estimation accuracy using the improved model in experimental study of the cost estimation of simple appendicitis disease, cesarean section, and heart bypass surgery is compared with the three models respectively with Euclidean distance, Angle cosine, and Mahalanobis distance. The improved model is best on cost estimation precision, especially in small sample and disease with high risk and high noise.","[Zhang, Qishan; Liu, Hong] Fuzhou Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Fuzhou, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Huang, Xinhuan] Fujian Normal Univ, Sch Econ, Fuzhou, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Duan, Jinli] Fujian Univ Chinese Tradit Med, Sch Pharmacy, Fuzhou, Fujian, Peoples R China",Fuzhou University; Fujian Normal University; Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine,"Zhang, QS (通讯作者)，Fuzhou Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Fuzhou, Fujian, Peoples R China.",78308776@qq.com,"Huang, Xinhuan/AAV-2262-2020","Huang, Xinhuan/0000-0003-4549-2515",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71602035]; Soft Science Research Project of Fujian Province [2017R0048],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Soft Science Research Project of Fujian Province,"This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71602035), and Soft Science Research Project of Fujian Province (Grant No. 2017R0048).",,25,1,1,1,6,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-5090-6668-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,46,52,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Computer Science, Information Systems; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science,BJ7HW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427285800011,0

Methods: The observational study reviewed claims data of 799 people who registered with the digital tool (myStrength) and 715 matched control study participants. The control group was formed via coarsened exact match with blocking variables, including presence on the claims file, volume of health care utilization, participation in a medical health home, BH diagnosis and volume of psychotherapy claims. The primary study analysis of cost differences for the BH self-care tool group versus the control group were calculated by cost setting and the ROI of the BH self-care tool was estimated. Cost settings assessed include inpatient, emergency services, general and psychiatric outpatient, and outpatient psychotherapy. Results: An incremental annual difference in difference reduction of $382 per user was observed over the 11 month study period in the self-care tool group. Sensitivity analysis indicated an ROI of between 142% and 695%. Conclusions: Augmenting BH offerings to include digital BH self-care tools appears to generate positive ROI via reduced total cost of care.","[Abhulimen, Sese] Propensity4, Berwyn, PA USA; [Hirsch, Abigail] myStrength Inc, 1875 Lawrence St,Suite 550, Denver, CO 80202 USA",,"Hirsch, A (通讯作者)，myStrength Inc, 1875 Lawrence St,Suite 550, Denver, CO 80202 USA.",ahirsch@mystrength.com,,,myStrength Inc.; Missouri Health Foundation,myStrength Inc.; Missouri Health Foundation,This research was funded by myStrength Inc. and the Missouri Health Foundation.,,30,4,4,1,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

This study aims to quantify the value to payers of such technologies. Materials and methods: To calculate the value of rapid, cloud-enabled, onsite laboratory testing to diagnose RA relative to traditional, centralized laboratory testing, an Excel-based decision tree model was created that simulated potential cost-savings to payers who cover routine evaluations of RA patients in the US. First, a conceptual framework was created to identify the value components of rapid, cloud-enabled onsite testing. Second, value associated with patient time savings, savings on visit fees, change in treatment costs, and QALY improvements was measured, leveraging existing literature and information from an observational study. Lastly, these value components were combined to estimate the total incremental value accruing to payers per patient-year relative to centralized laboratory testing. Results: Rapid, cloud-enabled, onsite testing is estimated to save one office and 1.81 laboratory visits during the evaluation period for the average patient. Results from an observational study found that rapid, cloud-enabled testing increased the likelihood of completing diagnostic orders from 84.5% to 97%, resulting in an increased probability of early treatment (3.5 percentage points) with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs among patients eligible for treatment. The combined total value was $5,648 per evaluated patient-year. This value is primarily attributed to health benefits of early treatment ($5,048), fewer visit payments ($459), and patient time savings due to fewer office ($216) and laboratory visits ($255). Limitations and conclusions: Data on the impact of rapid, cloud-enabled, onsite testing on patient health, care delivery, and clinical decision-making is scarce. More robust real-world data would confirm the validity of our model. Rapid, cloud-enabled, onsite testing has the potential to generate significant value to payers.","[Bognar, Katalin; Shafrin, Jason; Brauer, Michelle; Zhao, Lauren] Precis Hlth Econ, 11100 Santa Mon Blvd Suite 500, Los Angeles, CA 90025 USA; [Hockett, Rick; O'Neil, Michael] Genalyte, San Diego, CA USA; [Jena, Anupam] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Hlth Care Policy, Boston, MA USA",Harvard University; Harvard Medical School,"Bognar, K (通讯作者)，Precis Hlth Econ, 11100 Santa Mon Blvd Suite 500, Los Angeles, CA 90025 USA.",kata.bognar@precisionhealtheconomics.com,"Shafrin, Jason/AAI-7041-2020","Shafrin, Jason/0000-0001-8444-5979; Bognar, Katalin/0000-0001-8357-8569","Genalyte, Inc.","Genalyte, Inc.","This study and manuscript development were sponsored by Genalyte, Inc.",,35,0,0,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

As real-world studies examining the interchangeability of tacrolimus from different manufacturers are limited, the purpose of this study was to examine the healthcare resource utilization (HRU) and economic impact of tacrolimus-switching in kidney transplantation. Materials and methods: This cross-sectional, retrospective study examined HRU and healthcare costs (HCCs) among patients with a kidney transplant who were prescribed tacrolimus from fixed-source (FS) vs variable-source (VS) manufacturers using claims data from the large US health plan Humana from October 1, 2012, to December 31, 2013. Results: Overall, 1,024 patients were identified (FS: n = 674, 66%; VS: n = 350, 34%). The number of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) events for the VS group was 13% greater than for the FS group after controlling for demographics, comorbidity score, and number of medications (incidence rate ratio = 1.13, p = .033). Adjusted total HCCs were 9% lower for VS (US$28,054 vs US$30,823, p = .045). In the unadjusted analysis, VS had greater emergency department (ED) utilization (45% vs 35%, p < .002). In the VS group, the mean (standard deviation [SD]) number of days from manufacturer switch to first outpatient visit was 23.8 (33.6), and the number of days (SD) to first TDM event was 43.6 (56.2). Limitations: Study limitations include the lack of availability of many transplant-specific variables within the Humana database, potential errors/omissions in claims coding, and restriction of cross-sectional data examination to a 1-year period. Conclusions: VS patients had greater TDM and lower total HCCs. Further research is warranted to understand the drivers of ED use among the VS group, and to determine factors associated with delayed TDM after regimen modification. Opportunities may exist to improve the quality of care for patients receiving immunosuppressant treatment with tacrolimus.","[Bunniran, Suvapun; Kamble, Pravin; Suehs, Brandon] Humana Inc, Comprehens Hlth Insights, Louisville, KY USA; [Lee, Edward; Schwartz, Jason; Thal, Gary; Spalding, James] Astellas Pharma Global Dev Inc, Med Affairs, Northbrook, IL USA; [Franks, Billy] Astellas Pharma Global Dev Inc, Real World Informat, Leiden, Netherlands",Humana Inc.; Astellas Pharmaceuticals; Astellas Pharmaceuticals,"Bunniran, S (通讯作者)，Comprehens Hlth Insights, Humana Bldg,515 West Market St, Louisville, KY 40202 USA.",sbunniran@humana.com,,,"Astellas Pharma Global Development, Inc.","Astellas Pharma Global Development, Inc.","This study was funded by Astellas Pharma Global Development, Inc.",,25,0,0,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The analysis reported here compared the overall costs to achieve live birth using the reference follitropin alfa (GONAL-f) or a biosimilar (Ovaleap) in Spain, Italy and Germany. Methods: Patient and treatment data was obtained from published sources; assisted-reproductive technology, gonadotropin, follow-up and adverse-event-related costs were calculated from tariffs and reimbursement frameworks for each country. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated from the difference in costs between reference and biosimilar in each country, divided by the difference in live-birth rates. Mean cost per live birth was calculated as total costs divided by the live-birth rate. Results: The published live birth rates were 32.2% (reference) and 26.8% (biosimilar). Drug costs per patient were higher for the reference recombinant human follicle-stimulating hormone in all three countries, with larger cost differences in Germany (euro157.38) and Italy (euro141.50) than in Spain (euro22.41). The ICER for the reference product compared with the biosimilar was euro2917.47 in Germany, euro415.43 in Spain and euro2623.09 in Italy. However, the overall cost per live birth was higher for the biosimilar in all three countries (Germany euro8135.04 vs. euro9185.34; Italy euro8545.22 vs. euro9733.37; Spain euro14,859.53 vs. euro17,767.19). Uncertainty in efficacy, mean gonadotropin dose and costs did not have a strong effect on the ICERs.

This analysis estimated HRU and costs among newly diagnosed AML patients in a US commercially insured population. Materials and methods: This was a retrospective observational study using the IMS Health PharMetrics Plus and Hospital Charge Detail Master databases. Patients included adults who were newly diagnosed with AML between January 2007 and June 2016 (study period). Patients with <12 months of continuous enrollment prior to the index date were excluded, as were those whose first diagnosis was AML in remission/relapse, those diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukemia, those on Medicare supplemental insurance, or those with a diagnosis of AML in remission/relapse without evidence of treatment during the study period. Patients were stratified by receipt of AML treatment (chemotherapy/hematopoietic cell transplantation [HCT]), and their follow-up was partitioned into initial, remission, and relapsed health states. Mean HRU and costs were tallied by treatment and, for treated patients, by health state and time since entry into health state (<= 6 vs >6 months). Results: A total of 9,455 patients met study criteria, including 6,415 (68%) treated and 3,040 (32%) untreated patients, with mean follow-up of 18.3 and 16.4 months, respectively. Mean age was 55 years in treated patients and 60 years in untreated patients. Mean total costs per patient were $386,077 in treated patients and $79,382 in untreated patients. For treated patients, 60% of total costs ($231,867 per patient) were incurred during the initial health state, representing time without remission/relapse. Mean monthly total healthcare costs were $21,055 and $4,854 among treated and untreated patients, respectively. Limitations and conclusions: HRU and costs of managing AML patients are substantial. In treated patients, the majority of costs were incurred during the initial treatment period, without claims indicating remission/relapse.","[Hagiwara, May; Sharma, Arati; Delea, Thomas E.] PAI, 4 Davis Court, Brookline, MA 02445 USA; [Chung, Karen C.] Jazz Pharmaceut Inc, Palo Alto, CA USA",Policy Analysis Inc; Jazz Pharmaceuticals,"Hagiwara, M (通讯作者)，PAI, 4 Davis Court, Brookline, MA 02445 USA.",mhagiwara@pai2.com,,"Sharma, Arati/0000-0002-2831-2941","Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","This study was sponsored by Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",,14,29,28,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The increasing development of economic globalization has led to a considerable increase in intercontinental exchanges, stimulating the use of ports and shipping companies with a cheap and quick way to reach most of Europe, Asia, Africa or North America. This study aims to assess the relevance of thirteen exogenous variables, including GDP per capita, water depth, management model, and European directional division, on the performance of the seaports using the nonparametric robust output-oriented order-alpha model. The study also integrates the Stochastic multicriteria acceptability analysis with the order-alpha model to handle with cases of imperfect knowledge. This problem is not unusual in nonparametric benchmarking exercises and can have very serious effects on performance outcomes. Our findings suggest that none of the thirteen explanatory variables (either external or performance indicator) has a meaningful association with seaports' technical efficiency. This means that the efficiency of resources usage to deliver port services does not depend on features like localization, management model, local richness, and some performance indicators.","[Ferreir, Diogo Cunha; Marques, Rui Cunha] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, CESUR, CERIS, Av Rovisco Pais, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal; [Pedro, Maria Isabel] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, CEG IST Ctr Management Studies, Av Rovisco Pais, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico; Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico,"Pedro, MI (通讯作者)，Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, CEG IST Ctr Management Studies, Av Rovisco Pais, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal.",diogo.cunha.ferreira@tecnico.ulisboa.pt; rui.marques@tecnico.ulisboa.pt; ipedro@tecnico.ulisboa.pt,"Pedro, Maria/AAT-7652-2020; Cunha Marques, Rui/F-6646-2010; Pedro, Maria/A-9389-2012; Ferreira, Diogo Cunha/F-2139-2018","Cunha Marques, Rui/0000-0003-0344-5200; Pedro, Maria/0000-0003-1204-2761; Ferreira, Diogo Cunha/0000-0001-5418-9337; Pedro, Maria Isabel/0000-0001-8309-365X",,,,,59,12,12,0,22,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1366-5545,,,TRANSPORT RES E-LOG,Transp.

Connectivity will provide information to drivers/autonomous vehicles to enhance decision-making reliability at the operational and tactical levels. Consequently, drivers are more likely to execute safe and efficient maneuvers and autonomous vehicles will have a more accurate perception of the traffic condition and an error-free execution of the driving maneuvers. At the operational level, ensuring string stability is a key consideration since unstable traffic flow results in shockwave propagation and possibly crashes. While several studies have examined the effects of information availability on string stability in a connected environment, most of the approaches are focused on automated driving (e.g., Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control systems) and do not consider a mixed environment with regular, connected, and autonomous vehicles. To ensure connectivity in such a mixed environment, the correlation between communication range and connected vehicles density should be considered. To capture the effects of this correlation, this study uses the Continuum Percolation theory to determine the effects of the vehicular density and communication range on the connectivity level in telecommunications network and consequently, on the string stability of traffic flow. Based on the Continuum Percolation theory, there is a critical density of connected vehicles above which the entire system is connected. This critical density also depends on the communication range. This study presents an analytical derivation of this critical density. Moreover, this study evaluates the string stability under different communication ranges and market penetration rates of connected and autonomous vehicles. Results revealed that as communication range increases, the system becomes more stable and at high communication ranges, the system performs similar to the system with full connectivity. Moreover, results indicated the existence of an optimal communication range to maximize stability and ensure information delivery. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on the proposed network, we provide formulations and algorithms for both neoclassical and income-targeting hypotheses to characterize the labor supply of ride-sourcing drivers, i.e., their choices of work hours. We then investigate the impact of surge pricing using a bi-level programming framework, with the lower-level problem capturing the equilibrium work hour choices while the upper-level one representing revenue-maximizing surge pricing. Compared to static pricing, the platform and drivers are found to generally enjoy higher revenue while customers may be made worse off during highly surged periods.

Profit-maximizing and social-surplus-maximizing frequency decisions are compared using a unified framework that includes results of previous studies as special cases. The prevalence of the Mohring Effect and the need for subsidization are investigated. Four types of regulatory policies are then considered: fare regulation, frequency regulation, goal or objective function regulation, and fiscal regulation whereby the operator receives a subsidy based on consumers' surplus or demand. A numerical example is used to assess the relative efficiency of the regulatory regimes, and illustrate how the solutions depend on the joint distribution of willingness to pay and value of time.

We study a cost sharing problem in a freight consolidation system with one consolidation center and a common destination. In particular, we design a mechanism that collects bids from a set of suppliers, and then decides whose demand to ship via the consolidation center and the corresponding cost shares. We use the Moulin mechanism framework to design a truthful mechanism for the cost-sharing problem, and study the mechanism's budget-balance guarantee and economic efficiency. We find that it is generally not possible to obtain a simultaneously truthful and budget-balanced Moulin mechanism under the transportation cost structure we study. For our proposed mechanism, there exists a trade-off between the budget-balance guarantee and the level of incentives that can be given to large suppliers. Additionally, the mechanism has better economic efficiency when there are more bidding suppliers or the destination is farther away. In our setting, either the consolidation center or the suppliers need to be subsidized. The parameters that determine the trade-off between the consolidation center's benefit and suppliers' cost savings should be set based on the specific goals of the consolidation center. Encouraging more suppliers to bid helps to increase the overall social welfare. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The evolution of the human drivers' route choices, as well as the agent's control measures, is described using a joint day-to-day (DTD) dynamical model based on probability route choice. Within this setting, we show that (1) the fixed point of the proposed dynamical system coincides with the unique mixed equilibrium, and (2) the system is asymptotically stable in continuous time, namely it always converges to the mixed equilibrium from a given initial state. We then examine how alternative control policies may affect the transition trajectory leading to the mixed equilibrium. Two alternative control schemes are proposed and analyzed. The first, referred to as the stability-first control, aims to stabilize a given disequilibrium as soon as possible. The second seeks to minimize the total system cost accumulated over the transition period, hence called the efficiency-first control. We propose a continuous time optimal control formulation for both schemes and discuss how the formulation can be discretized and solved to local optimality using existing algorithms. Numerical experiments conducted on two illustrative examples highlight the differences among the three control schemes and how the share of autonomous vehicles affects the tradeoff between the efficiency and stability of the mixed traffic system.

The lower level problem is ridesharing user equilibrium (RUE). To reduce the problem size and facilitate computation, we reformulate RUE in the link-node representation.

Shipping firms hold more cash than similar firms in other asset-heavy industries. Higher cash holdings in the shipping industry are not attributable to firm- or country-level characteristics, but rather to the higher marginal value of cash. Shipping firms value an additional dollar of cash higher than matched manufacturing firms, regardless of their financial constraints status, but depending on their cultural background and the cyclicality of their expansion opportunities. Less procyclical shipping firms have a higher marginal value of cash, and this valuation effect is most pronounced in bad times of the business cycle when external capital supply tends to become scarce.

This study evaluated the impact of the introduction of brodalumab on the pharmacy budget on US commercial health plans. Methods: An Excel-based health economic decision analytic model with a US health plan perspective was developed. The model incorporated published moderate-to-severe psoriasis prevalence data; market shares of common biologic drugs, including adalimumab, ustekinumab, secukinumab, ixekizumab, and etanercept, used for the treatment of moderate-severe psoriasis; 2017-year Wholesale Acquisition Costs for the biologic drugs; drug dispensing fee; patient co-pay; and drug contracting discount. Total annual health plan costs for the biologic drugs were estimated. Scenarios with different proportions of patients treated with brodalumab were compared to a control scenario when no brodalumab was used. Results: In a hypothetical commercial health plan covering two million members, 7,038 moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients were estimated to be eligible for treatment with brodalumab. Prior to brodalumab approval, the proportions of patients treated by other biologics were estimated at 50.8% for adalimumab, 13.5% for ustekinumab, 14.1% for secukinumab, 4.4% for ixekizumab, and 17.2% for etanercept. With a 20% drug price discount applied to all biologics, the annual health plan costs for brodalumab, adalimumab, ustekinumab, secukinumab, ixekizumab, and etanercept were estimated at $37,224, $49,166, $55,084, $56,061, $64,396, and $57,170, respectively. When no brodalumab is used, the total annual pharmacy budget for the biologics used among these patients was estimated at $414,362,647. Among scenarios where the proportions of brodalumab usage were 3%, 8%, 16%, and 30%, the total annual pharmacy cost was estimated to be reduced by $3,698,129, $9,861,677, $19,723,355, and $36,981,290, respectively. Conclusion: Based on the economic model, brodalumab has the potential to substantially reduce pharmacy expenditures for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in the US.","[Feldman, Steven R.] Wake Forest Sch Med, Winston Salem, NC 27104 USA; [Wu, Jashin J.] Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles Med Ctr, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Rastogi, Shipra] Ortho Dermatol, Bridgewater, NJ USA; [Menges, Brandy; Lingohr-Smith, Melissa; Lin, Jay] Novosys Hlth, Green Brook, NJ USA",Wake Forest University; Kaiser Permanente,"Feldman, SR (通讯作者)，Wake Forest Sch Med, Dept Dermatol, 4618 Country Club Rd, Winston Salem, NC 27104 USA.",sfeldman@wakehealth.edu,"Feldman, Steven R./AAH-6971-2021; Rastogi, Shipra/L-1209-2015","Feldman, Steven R./0000-0002-0090-6289; Wu, Jashin/0000-0002-1722-1892; Rastogi, Shipra/0000-0003-3296-4405",Ortho Dermatologics,Ortho Dermatologics,This research was supported by Ortho Dermatologics.,,21,2,2,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Methods: The authors performed a retrospective study utilizing data from a nationwide hospital operational records database from July 2014 through June 2015 to compare a group of inpatients experiencing a VTE event post-operatively to a propensity score matched group of inpatients who did not experience a VTE. Patients included in the analysis had a hospital admission for an elective inpatient surgical procedure with the use of general anesthesia. Procedures of the heart, brain, lungs, and obstetrical procedures were excluded, as these procedures often require a scheduled ICU stay postoperatively. Outcomes examined included VTE events during hospitalization, length of stay, unscheduled ICU transfers, number of days spent in the ICU if transferred, 3- and 30-day re-admissions, and total hospital charges incurred. Results: The study included 17,727 patients undergoing elective inpatient surgical procedures. Of these, 36 patients who experienced a VTE event were matched to 108 patients who did not. VTE events occurred in 0.2% of the study population, with most events occurring for patients undergoing total knee replacement. VTE patients had a mean total hospital charge of $60,814 vs $48,325 for non-VTE patients, resulting in a mean incremental charge of $11,979 (p < .05). Compared to non-VTE patients, VTE patients had longer length of stay (5.9 days vs 3.7 days, p < .001), experienced a higher rate of 3-day re-admissions (3 vs 0 patients) and 30-day re-admissions (7 vs 2 patients). Conclusions: Patients undergoing elective inpatient surgical procedures with general anesthesia who had a VTE event during their primary hospitalization had a significantly longer length of stay and significantly higher total hospital charges than comparable patients without a VTE event.","[Sepassi, Aryana] Univ Calif San Diego, Skaggs Sch Pharm & Pharmaceut Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Chingcuanco, Francine; Ben-Joseph, Rami] Millennium Hlth, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, San Diego, CA USA; [Gordon, Ronald; Meier, Angela] UC San Diego Hlth Syst, Dept Anesthesiol, San Diego, CA USA; [Divino, Victoria; DeKoven, Mitch] IQVIA, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Fairfax, VA USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; IQVIA,"Sepassi, A (通讯作者)，UCSD, Sch Pharm & Pharmaceut Sci, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",arsepassi@ucsd.edu,,"Divino, Victoria/0000-0001-5555-7912; Sepassi, Aryana/0000-0003-0149-7824",Millennium Health,Millennium Health,"This study and manuscript was supported by Millennium Health.

Type 2 diabetes accounts for 95% of all cases in the US, with annual costs estimated to be $246 billion per year. This study investigated the impact of a glucose-measuring intervention to the burden of type 2 diabetes. Objective: This analysis seeks to understand how professional continuous glucose monitoring (professional CGM) impacts clinical and economic outcomes when compared to patients who are not prescribed professional CGM. Methods: This study utilized a large healthcare claims and lab dataset from the US, and identified a cohort of patients who were prescribed professional CGM as identified by CPT codes 95250 and 95251. It calculated economic and clinical outcomes 1 year before and 1 year after the use of professional CGM, using a generalized linear model. Results: Patients who utilized professional CGM saw an improvement in hemoglobin A1C. The difference-in-difference calculation for A1C was shown to be -0.44%. There was no statistically significant difference in growth of total annual costs for people who used professional CGM compared to those who did not ($1,270, p=.08). Patients using professional CGM more than once per year had a -$3,376 difference in the growth of total costs (p=.05). Patients who used professional CGM while changing their diabetes treatment regimen also had a difference of -$3,327 in growth of total costs (p=.0023). Conclusion: Significant clinical benefits were observed for patients who used professional CGM. Economic benefits were observed for patients who utilized professional CGM more than once within a 1-year period or who used it during a change of diabetes therapy. This suggests that professional CGM may help decrease rising trends in healthcare costs for people with type 2 diabetes, while also improving clinical outcomes.","[Sierra, Joseph A.; Shah, Mona; Gill, Max S.; Flores, Zachery; Chawla, Hiten; Kaufman, Francine R.; Vigersky, Robert] Medtron Diabet Inc, Northridge, CA USA",,"Sierra, JA (通讯作者)，Medtron MiniMed Inc, 18000 Devonshire St, Northridge, CA 91325 USA.",joseph.a.sierra@medtronic.com,,,Medtronic Diabetes,Medtronic Diabetes,This study was sponsored by Medtronic Diabetes.,,13,21,23,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Methods: Adults newly-diagnosed with AML who received standard induction chemotherapy in an inpatient setting were identified from the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan (2006-2015) and SEER-Medicare (2007-2011) databases. Patients were observed from induction therapy start to the first of hematopoietic stem cell transplant, 180 days after induction discharge, health plan enrollment/data availability end, or death. Induction and consolidation chemotherapy were identified using Diagnosis-Related Group codes (chemotherapy with acute leukemia) or procedure codes for AML chemotherapy administration. AML treatment episode setting (inpatient or outpatient), duration, and costs (2015 USD, payers' perspective) were described for commercially insured patients and Medicare beneficiaries. Results: In total, 459 commercially insured patients and 563 Medicare beneficiaries (mean age = 54 and 66 years; 53% and 54% male; respectively) were identified. For induction therapy, mean costs were $145,189 for commercially insured patients and $85,734 for Medicare beneficiaries, and median inpatient duration was 31 days (both). Following induction, 64% of commercially insured patients and 53% of Medicare beneficiaries had >= 1 consolidation cycle; 75% and 65% of consolidation cycles were in an inpatient setting, respectively. For consolidation cycles, in the inpatient setting, mean costs were $28,137 for commercially insured patients and $28,843 for Medicare beneficiaries, median cycle duration was 6 days (both); in the outpatient setting, mean costs were $11,271 for commercially insured patients and $5,803 Medicare beneficiaries, median duration was 5 days (both). Limitations: Granular information on chemotherapy type administered was unavailable. Conclusions: This is the first exploratory study providing a complete picture of recent AML treatment patterns and management costs among commercially insured patients and Medicare beneficiaries.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this therapy in the context of the United Kingdom (UK) healthcare system. Methods: A Markov cohort model consisting of four health states (Stable after index stroke, Post-Minor Recurrent Stroke, Post-Moderate Recurrent Stroke, and Death) was developed to simulate the economic outcomes of device-based PFO closure compared to medical therapy. Recurrent stroke event rates were extracted from a randomized clinical trial (RESPECT) with a median of 5.9-year follow-up. Health utilities and costs were obtained from published sources. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were performed to assess robustness. The model was discounted at 3.5% and reported in 2016 Pounds Sterling. Results: Compared with medical therapy alone and using a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 20,000 pound, PFO closure reached cost-effectiveness at 4.2 years. Cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) at 4, 10, and 20 years were 20,951 pound, 6,887 pound, and 2,158 pound, respectively. PFO closure was cost-effective for 89% of PSA iterations at year 10. Sensitivity analyses showed that the model was robust. Conclusions: Considering the UK healthcare system perspective, percutaneous PFO closure in cryptogenic ischemic stroke patients is a cost-effective stroke prevention strategy compared to medical therapy alone. Its cost-effectiveness was driven by substantial reduction in recurrent strokes and patients' improved health-related quality-of-life.","[Tirschwell, David L.] Harborview Med Ctr, UW Med Stroke Ctr, 325 Ninth Ave,Box 359775, Seattle, WA 98104 USA; [Turner, Mark] Univ Hosp Bristol, Bristol Heart Inst, Bristol, Avon, England; [Thaler, David] Tufts Med Ctr, Boston, MA USA; [Choulerton, James] Royal United Hosp, Bath, Avon, England; [Marks, David] Med Coll Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA; [Carroll, John] Univ Colorado, Sch Med, Aurora, CO USA; [MacDonald, Lee] South Denver Cardiol Associates PC, Littleton, CO USA; [Smalling, Richard W.] UT Hlth McGovern Med Sch, Mem Hermann Heart & Vasc Inst, Houston, TX USA; [Koullick, Maria; Gu, Ning Yan] Abbott, Abbott Pk, IL USA; [Saver, Jeffrey L.] Reed Neurol Res Ctr, Los Angeles, CA USA",Harborview Medical Center; University of Bristol; Tufts Medical Center; Medical College of Wisconsin; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; Abbott Laboratories; Abbott Vascular,"Tirschwell, DL (通讯作者)，Harborview Med Ctr, UW Med Stroke Ctr, 325 Ninth Ave,Box 359775, Seattle, WA 98104 USA.",tirsch@uw.edu,"Roquer, Jaume/D-9483-2011; Turner, Mark S/L-3798-2013","Tirschwell, David/0000-0002-8059-2901",Abbott,Abbott(Abbott Laboratories),This manuscript was funded by Abbott.,,37,13,13,0,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

A bi-level mathematical program is formulated, in which the upper level optimizes the housing supply and railway development over time based on the perspective of a joint housing and railway developer, versus that of consumers and that of government. At the lower level, a nested logit framework is formulated to model the combined bid-rent process, residents' location and travel choices in each period. Under certain assumptions, this study derives analytically the lead-lag relationships between housing development and railway development, based on the initial housing and transport conditions, as well as the stakeholders' perspectives. The development strategies are generally different among the stakeholders, whilst possible win-win situations, in terms of developer profitability and consumer surplus, are identified under certain low housing density conditions, leading to a social optimum. This study also conducts sensitivity analyses to extend the results to multiple time periods and heterogeneous income classes, revealing that, for profitability, the joint developer may introduce housing development phasing that segregates residents of different income classes.

A basic question in network analysis concerns how important each node is. An important node might, for example, greatly contribute to short connections between many pairs of nodes, handle a large amount of the traffic, generate relevant information, represent a bridge between two areas, etc. In order to quantify the relative importance of nodes, one possible approach uses the concept of centrality. A limitation of classical centrality measures is the fact that they evaluate nodes based on their individual contributions to the functioning of the network. The present paper introduces a game theory approach, based on cooperative games with transferable utility. Given a transportation network, a game is defined taking into account the network topology, the weights associated with the arcs, and the demand based on an origin-destination matrix (weights associated with nodes). The network nodes represent the players in such a game. The Shapley value, which measures the relative importance of the players in transferable utility games, is used to identify the nodes that have a major role. For several network topologies, a comparison is made with well-known centrality measures. The results show that the suggested centrality measures outperform the classical ones, and provide an innovative approach for transportation network analysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Without extra information, the problem is generally ill-posed when a large portion of the link sensors are unhealthy. It is possible, however, to correct the corrupted link flows accurately with the proposed method under a recoverability condition if there are only a few bad sensors which are located at certain links. We analytically identify the links that are robust to miscounts and relate them to the geometric structure of the traffic network by introducing the recoverability concept and an algorithm for computing it. The recoverability condition for corrupted links is simply the associated recoverability being greater than 1. In a more realistic setting, besides the unhealthy link sensors, small measurement noises may be present at the other sensors. Under the same recoverability condition, our method guarantees to give an estimated traffic flow fairly close to the ground-truth data and leads to a bound for the correction error. Both synthetic and real-world examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the shortened range, extended recharging time and insufficient charging facilities hinder the wide adoption of BEV. Recently, a wireless power transfer technology, which can provide dynamic recharging when vehicles are moving on roadway, has the potential to solve these problems. The dynamic recharging facilities, if widely applied on road network, can allow travelers to drive in unlimited range without stopping to recharge. This paper aims to study the complex charging facilities location problem, assuming the wireless charging is technologically mature and a new type of wireless recharging BEV is available to be selected by consumers in the future other than the traditional BEV requiring fixed and static charging stations. The objective is to assist the government planners on optimally locating multiple types of BEV recharging facilities to satisfy the need of different BEV types within a given budget to minimize the public social cost. Road users' ownership choice among multiple types BEV and BEV drivers' routing choice behavior are both explicitly considered. A trilevel programming is then developed to model the presented problem. The formulated model is first treated as a black-box optimization, and then solved by an efficient surface response approximation model based solution algorithm. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Using an empirical description of the train energy consumption as a function of running times, the timetable design problem is modelled as a Mixed Integer Non-Linear optimization problem (MINLP) for a complete two-way line. In doing so, all the services in both directions along a certain planning horizon are considered while attending a known passengers' demand. The MINLP formulation, which depends on train loads, is fully linearised supposing train loads are fixed. A sequential Mixed Integer Linear solving procedure is then used to solve the timetabling optimization problem with unknown train loads. The proposed methodology emphasizes the need of considering all the services running during the planning horizon when designing energy-efficient timetables, as consequence of the relationship among train speeds, frequency and fleet size of each line. Moreover, the convenience of considering the energy consumption as part of a broad objective function that includes other relevant costs is pointed out. Otherwise, passengers and operators could face up to an increase in the whole cost and a decrease in the quality of service.

We formulate the problem as a set-covering problem and develop a branch-and-price algorithm for its solution. The algorithm can also be used for solving a more general variant in which a hybrid delivery strategy is considered that allows a delivery to either a customer's home or to the trunk of the customer's car. We evaluate the effectiveness of the many algorithmic features incorporated in the algorithm in an extensive computational study and analyze the benefits of these innovative delivery strategies. The computational results show that employing the hybrid delivery strategy results in average cost savings of nearly 20% for the instances in our test set. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of insulin degludec relative to insulin glargine in patients with: type 1 diabetes (T1D), type 2 diabetes receiving basal-only therapy (T2DBOT), and type 2 diabetes receiving basal-bolus therapy (T2DBB) in Denmark. Methods: A short-term (1 year) cost-utility model was developed to model insulin use, non-severe and severe hypoglycemia, and self-monitoring of blood glucose in patients using insulin degludec and insulin glargine from the perspective of a Danish healthcare payer. Where possible, data were derived from Danish patients with diabetes and meta-analyses of clinical trials comparing insulin degludec with insulin glargine. Using these characteristics, the model estimated costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained for the two insulin regimens in each of the three diabetes populations. Results: Insulin degludec dominated insulin glargine (i.e. reduced costs while improving quality-adjusted life expectancy) in patients with T1D and patients with type 2 diabetes using a basal-only insulin regimen. In the T2DBB cohort, insulin degludec was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of DKK 221,063 per QALY gained, which would be considered cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of EUR 30,000 (similar to DKK 224,000) per QALY gained. Sensitivity analysis showed that results were most affected by changes in hypoglycemia rate ratio assumptions, but were broadly insensitive to changes in individual input parameters. Conclusions: Insulin degludec reduces incidence of hypoglycemia and improves quality-of-life in patients with diabetes. Over a 1-year time horizon, insulin degludec resulted in cost savings relative to insulin glargine in T1D and T2DBOT cohorts, while being cost-effective in T2DBB.","[Pollock, R.

This study aims to study the healthcare resource utilization and costs among commercially-insured patients with hematologic malignancies who received autologous HCT (auto-HCT) and allogeneic HCT (allo-HCT) in the US.Materials and methods: Adult patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing auto- or allo-HCT between January 1, 2011 and June 30, 2014 were identified in the Truven Health MarketScan Research Databases. Patients with 12 months of continuous pharmacy and medical enrollment pre- and post-HCT were included. Patients with prior HCT were excluded. Controls were selected from patients without any claims for HCT and matched with HCT recipients in a 3:1 ratio based on age, gender, insurance type, and Deyo-Charlson Comorbidity Index categories. Total healthcare resource uses and costs were compared between auto- or allo-HCT recipients and controls.Results: In total, 10,527 patients (HCT, n=2,672 vs control, n=7,855) were included, with the majority of HCT recipients (63.6%) undergoing auto-HCT. During the 6-month pre-index and 12-month post-index period, auto-HCT recipients incurred $313,562 (p<.01) higher all-cause costs than controls, attributable to inpatient admission (54.1%), outpatient services (33.4%), and prescriptions (12.5%). The all-cause costs for allo-HCT recipients were $621,895 (p<.01) higher vs controls during the 18-month observation period, attributable to inpatient admissions (75.5%), outpatient services (22.1%), and prescriptions (2.4%).Conclusions: The use of HCT among patients with hematologic malignancies is associated with considerable economic burden in direct healthcare costs in a commercially insured population. Incremental costs for HCT recipients were mainly driven by costs related to hospitalization and other medical services.","[Bonafede, Machaon; Cai, Qian; McMorrow, Donna] Truven Hlth Analyt, 75 Binney St,4th Floor, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Richhariya, Akshara; Josephson, Neil C.] Seattle Genet Inc, Bothell, WA USA; [Garfin, Phillip M.; Perales, Miguel-Angel] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Med, Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Serv, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Garfin, Phillip M.; Perales, Miguel-Angel] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Med, New York, NY USA",Seattle Genetics; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; Cornell University; Weill Cornell Medicine,"Cai, Q (通讯作者)，Truven Hlth Analyt, 75 Binney St,4th Floor, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",qcai@us.ibm.com,,,"Seattle Genetics, Inc.","Seattle Genetics, Inc.","The current study was sponsored by Seattle Genetics, Inc.",,16,11,11,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

This study explores the economic burden of VKA therapy for Russian patients with NVAF. Method: Cardiologists provided clinical characteristics and healthcare resource use data relating to the patient's first year of treatment. Data were used to quantify direct medical costs (INR testing, consultations, drug costs). The same patients completed a questionnaire providing data on direct non-medical costs (travel/expenses for attendance at VKA appointments) and indirect costs (opportunity cost and reduced work productivity). Mean costs per patient per year are described (US dollars). Results: Cardiologists (n = 50) provided data on 400 patients (mean age = 63, 47% female), and 351 patients (88%) completed the patient questionnaire. Patients had a mean of nine INR tests. Estimated direct medical costs totaled $151.06, and 18.5% of direct medical costs were attributable to drug costs. Estimated annual direct non-medical costs were $22.89 per patient, and indirect costs were $275.59 per patient. Limitations: Included patients had been treated for 12-24 months, so are not fully representative of the broader treatment population. Conclusion: Although VKA drugs costs are relatively low, regular INR testing and consultations drive the economic burden for Russian NVAF patients treated with VKA.","[Briere, J.

Methods: A sequential, multi-cohort, health-state transition model was developed to assess the impact of different hepatitis C screening and treatment strategies on clinical and economic outcomes in the 1945-1965 birth cohorts. Patients newly-diagnosed with chronic HCV were projected each year from 2016 to 2036 under three screening scenarios (70% [low], 75% [intermediate], and 80% [high] HCV awareness in 2036). Healthcare costs and clinical outcomes (number of liver-related deaths, quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs], life-years [LYs] spent in sustained virologic response [SVR] or with decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, or liver transplant) were compared among five treatment strategies (no antiviral therapy; IFN+ribavirin+protease inhibitor for fibrosis stages F2-F4, IFN-based DAAs for stages F2-F4, IFN-free DAAs for stages F2-F4, and IFN-free DAAs for stages F0-F4). Results: Diagnosis of HCV genotype 1 was projected for 4,953, 6,600, and 8,368 individuals in the low, intermediate, and high screening scenarios, respectively. In the intermediate scenario, IFN-free DAAs for stages F0-F4 had a favorable cost-effectiveness profile vs IFN-based or IFN-free treatment strategies for F2-F4 and offered the greatest return on investment (0.899 LYs gained in SVR and 0.933 QALYs per (sic)10,000 invested). Conclusion: Comprehensive HCV screening and access to all-oral, IFN-free DAAs is a cost-effective strategy that could help diminish the upcoming burden of HCV in the French baby-boomer population.","[Ethgen, Olivier] SERFAN Innovat, Namur, Belgium; [Ethgen, Olivier] Univ Liege, Liege, Belgium; [Gonzalez, Yuri Sanchez; Jeanblanc, Gregoire; Duguet, Aurore; Misurski, Derek; Juday, Timothy] AbbVie Inc, N Chicago, IL USA",University of Liege; AbbVie,"Gonzalez, YS (通讯作者)，AbbVie Inc, Dept GMH1, 2nd Floor,2SE 108 01,26525 N Riverwoods Blvd, Mettawa, IL 60045 USA.",yuri.sanchezgonzalez@abbvie.com,,,AbbVie,AbbVie(AbbVie),The research reported in this manuscript was supported by AbbVie through consulting fees paid to SERFAN innovation.,,53,14,14,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Although the incremental clinical benefits are modest, both treatments represent significant advances in the treatment of a high-mortality cancer. In this independent economic evaluation for the US, the aim was to estimate the comparative cost-utility and cost-effectiveness of these three regimens from the payer perspective. Methods: In the absence of a direct treatment comparison in a single clinical trial, the Bucher indirect comparison method was used to estimate the comparative efficacy of each regimen. A Markov model evaluated life years (LY) and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained with NAB-P + GEM and FOLFIRINOX over GEM, expressed as incremental cost-effectiveness (ICER) and cost-utility ratios (ICUR). All costs and outcomes were discounted at 3%/ year. The impact of parameter uncertainty on the model was assessed by probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: NAB-P + GEM was associated with differentials of +0.180 LY and + 0.127 QALY gained over GEM at an incremental total cost of $ 25,965; yielding an ICER of $ 144,096/ LY and ICUR of $ 204,369/ QALY gained. FOLFIRINOX was associated with differentials of +0.368 LY and +0.249 QALY gained over GEM at an incremental total cost of $ 93,045; yielding an ICER of $ 253,162/ LY and ICUR of $ 372,813/ QALY gained. In indirect comparison, the overall survival hazard ratio (OS HR) for NABP+GEM vs FOLFIRINOX was 0.79 (95% CI = 0.59-1.05), indicating no superiority in OS of either regimen. FOLFIRINOX had an ICER of $ 358,067/ LY and an ICUR of $ 547,480/ QALY gained over NAB-P+GEM.

In contrast to the vast interest invested in modelling the momentary responses of evacuees to their immediate surroundings (i.e. the collision-avoidance models), their global navigation behaviour is poorly understood albeit believed to be a major determinant of the accuracy of the crowd simulation models. The primary challenge arises from the scarcity of reliable data suitable for modelling purposes causing the experimental knowledge in the field lagging substantially behind the corresponding model developments. Observations derived from fully natural emergency contexts (in the form of modelling material) are rare and collecting data in realistic experimental settings poses its own major challenges. Only few experimental modelling attempts have been reported thus far in relation with this problem primarily using the stated-choice (SC) methods. Modelling based on revealed choices (RC), however, has remained absent in this context leaving the findings of the SC experiments mostly unverified. It is still unclear whether we can reliably learn from the wayfinding choices made in virtually visualised environments without the decision-makers interacting with real individuals and the physical elements of the environment as they do in the real-world settings. Furthermore, the extent to which the findings of these experiments are specific to the particular characteristics of the environment visualised in the experiments is also unclear. Methods: To bridge this gap, here we report on discrete-choice estimates derived from observations of both types. Three datasets of stated exit choices (4958 observations) were collected through face-to-face interviews with pedestrians in three public places with the experiments referring to the particular geometry of the place in which the participants were interviewed. Also, 3015 disaggregate real (or more precisely, realistic) exit choices were extracted through individual-level video analysis of the footage of a series of novel evacuation trials that simulate pedestrians' emergency escape. The participants competed and interacted with real individuals in an actual crowd and made actual wayfinding decisions to make the quickest possible escape. Our particular interest was investigating the sample-to-sample variations and the context-dependence of the inferred estimates. Results: We observed fairly similar parameter estimate patterns emerged from all four datasets, and identified many behavioural aspects upon which all models consistently agreed regardless of their context of origin. Moreover, despite the significant differences between the parameter scales of the four models, the SC-generated models made predictions that were reasonably similar to those of the RC model as well as to those of the model derived from the combined data. Applications: Our findings provide promising evidence as to the potential applicability of the SC methods in particular as well as other forms of virtual-reality decision experiments in general as a practical, flexible and ethical approach for the continuation of research and advancing the state of knowledge in this field.

Car sharing services that allow users to move freely decrease the efficiency of sharing vehicle use due to the uneven distribution of vehicles and origin-destination (OD) demands. Thus, a tradable permit mechanism and a solution algorithm were proposed to solve this problem in this study. First, the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism for car sharing was proposed. This mechanism allowed the tradable permit system to achieve both strategy-proofness and efficient allocation. The difference between the case of single-minded bidders and that of multiple bidders was subsequently discussed. A single-minded bidder is defined as an agent that only bids on one item and a multiple bidder is defined as an agent that bids on more than one item. The results indicated that the permit price was decomposed into the usage fee for leaving the origin sharing station and the income for arriving at the destination sharing station. Additionally, the findings indicated that the negative price of using mobility sharing could occur when there was high asymmetric imbalanced OD demand. The negative price (that is benefit) could encourage the natural relocation of vehicles under the auction mechanism. The framework was then extended to treating a round trip case. Finally, a solution algorithm for these problems was proposed, and numerical examples were presented. The results demonstrated that the problem setting and the solution algorithm were feasible from the computational time viewpoint. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In the literature, the SBPP is usually decomposed into the routing and scheduling subproblems due to its complexity. Because of the nature of the decomposition, even if all the subproblems are solved to optimality, the final solution may not be as good as the solution from the integrated model. In this paper, we present a new approach that incorporates the scheduling information (namely the trip compatibility) into the routing stage such that the interrelationship between the subproblems is still considered even in the decomposed problems. A novel two-step heuristic adopting the trip compatibility idea is presented to solve the school bus routing problem under single load assumptions. The first step finds an initial solution using an iterative minimum cost matching-based insertion heuristic. Then, the initial trips are improved using a Simulated Annealing and Tabu Search hybrid method. Experiments were conducted on randomly generated problems and benchmark problems in the literature. The result shows that our two-step heuristic improves existing solutions of single-load problems by up to 25% on benchmark problems.

The DNL defines the so-called network delay operator, which maps a set of path departure rates to a set of path travel times (or costs). It is widely known that the delay operator is not available in closed form, and has undesirable properties that severely complicate DTA analysis and computation, such as discontinuity, non-differentiability, non-monotonicity, and computational inefficiency. This paper proposes a fresh take on this important and difficult issue, by providing a class of surrogate DNL models based on a statistical learning method known as Kriging. We present a metamodeling framework that systematically approximates DNL models and is flexible in the sense of allowing the modeler to make trade-offs among model granularity, complexity, and accuracy. It is shown that such surrogate DNL models yield highly accurate approximations (with errors below 8%) and superior computational efficiency (9 to 455 times faster than conventional DNL procedures such as those based on the link transmission model).

Such models enable us to simulate under which conditions perception errors and risk-taking lead to interactions that result in unsafe traffic conditions and ultimately accidents. In this paper, we present a generic multi-level microscopic traffic modelling and simulation framework that supports this important line of research. In this framework, the driving task is modeled in a multi-layered fashion. At the highest level, we have idealized (collision-free) models for car following and other driving tasks. These models typically contain HF parameters that exogenously govern the human factor, such as reaction time, sensitivities to stimuli, desired speed, etc. At the lowest level, we define HF variables (task demand and capacity, awareness) with which we maintain what the information processing costs are of performing driving tasks as well as non-driving related tasks such as distractions. We model these costs using so-called fundamental diagrams of task demand. In between, we define functions that govern the dynamics of the high-level HF parameters with these HF variables as inputs. When total task demand increases beyond task capacity, first awareness may deteriorate, where we use Endsley's three-level awareness construct to differentiate between effects on perception, comprehension, anticipation and reaction time. Secondly, drivers may adapt their response in line with Fullers risk allostasis theory to reduce risk to acceptable levels. This framework can be viewed as a meta model, that provides the analyst possibilities to combine and mix a wide variety of microscopic models for driving behavior at different levels of sophistication, depending on which HF are studied, and which phenomena need to be reproduced. We illustrate the framework with a distraction (rubbernecking) case. Our results show that the framework results in endogenous mechanisms for inter-and intra-driver differences in driving behavior and can generate multiple plausible HF mechanisms to explain the same observable traffic phenomena and congestion patterns that arise due to the distraction. We believe our framework can serve as a valuable tool in testing hypotheses related to the effects of HF on traffic efficiency and traffic safety in a systematic way for both the traffic flow and HF community.

In Cassidy (1998), a method was proposed to manually identify near-stationary states by visually inspecting transformed curves of cumulative total vehicle counts and occupancies. Such near-stationary states are important for calibrating fundamental diagrams, identifying active bottlenecks and incidents, and quantifying capacity drop magnitudes. To the best of our knowledge, however, there lacks an automatic method that can be applied to efficiently identify near-stationary states from a large amount of data. In this study, we attempt to fill this gap. We start with definitions of steady, stationary, and equilibrium states and discuss their relations. Then we present a novel four-step method for automatically identifying near-stationary states from raw loop-detector data: first, the raw data are pre-processed to obtain healthy datasets, fill in missing values, and normalize averaged vehicle counts and occupancies to the same scale; second, daily time series are partitioned into multiple candidate intervals based on the pruned exact linear time (PELT) changepoint detection method; third, the characteristics of the candidate intervals are calculated; and finally, near-stationary states are selected based on modified Cassidy's gap and duration criteria. We further close the loop by presenting an algorithm to automatically determine the penalty threshold in the second step and the gap threshold in fourth step to ensure the quantity as well as the quality of identified near-stationary states. In a case study, we apply the proposed method to identify near-stationary states from a large set of 30-s raw loop-detector data at a freeway mainline station. We verify the validity of identified near-stationary states both directly and indirectly. The results show that the identified near-stationary states are valid with high quality and the calibrated triangular fundamental diagram is well-fitted and physically meaningful. We finally conclude by discussing some future improvements and potential applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This assignment induces uncertainties to the ex-ante evaluation of a policy measure: the boundedly rational assignment is non-unique and the indifference band is an uncertain parameter. We consider two different ways to model the optimization problem that finds the best and worst-performing Boundedly Rational User Equilibrium with respect to the total travel time (Best/Worst-case BRUE). The first is the so-called branch approach, the second is a bilevel model. The latter approach is better suited to exploit techniques from parametric optimization and enables us, e.g., to prove the continuity of the optimal value function corresponding to the Best/Worst-case BRUE with respect to perturbations in the indifference band. We report on some numerical experiments. In addition, we extend our results to the Network Design Problem: we prove the existence of a second-best toll pricing scheme under bounded rationality.

This study was designed to evaluate the actual drug wastage and cost to the healthcare system using patient-level retrospective observational electronic medical record (EMR) data from a cohort of lung cancer patients in the US. Methods: Data from the Flatiron Health advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cohort was used for this study. Drug administered amount (in mg) was used to determine an optimal set of available vial sizes to minimize waste. Drug wastage was defined as the difference between the drug amount in the optimal set of vials and the administered amount. Wholesale acquisition costs were used to value the cost of drugs, with and without vial sharing assumptions. The amount and cost of waste were quantified over the 2-year study period (January 2015-December 2016). Results: There were 8,467 eligible patients included in this study, providing data from 103,826 unique drug administrations across multiple lines of therapy. Overall wastage was 437% of the total medication used to care for patients. While costs per administration were low, the total cost of wastage for the study population represented $16,630,112 across the 2-year study period. Assuming that vial sharing occurred at the site level slightly reduced waste to 3.74% (reducing costs to $15,953,212 over 2 years). Conclusions: Drug wastage is an important concern and has implications on healthcare costs in NSCLC. Evaluation of these real-world data suggest that pharmacists and physicians are able to reduce drug wastage by optimizing vial combinations and sharing vials among patients. Even small amounts of reduction in wastage could be useful in reducing healthcare costs in the US; however, caution is needed with drug rounding efforts to ensure patients do not receive a sub-optimal dose of medication.","[Hess, Lisa M.; Cui, Zhanglin Lin; Li, Xiaohong Ivy; Oton, Ana B.; Shortenhaus, Scott; Watson, Ian A.] Eli Lilly & Co, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA",Eli Lilly,"Hess, LM (通讯作者)，Eli Lilly & Co, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA.",hess_lisa_m@lilly.com,,,,,,,13,12,12,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Materials and methods: The NICE model, consisting of a decision tree with branches for discrete levels of pain relief and adverse event (AE) severities, was replicated using R, and used to compare a hypothetical neuropathic pain drug to pregabalin. Model parameters were sourced from NICE's clinical guidelines and associated with probability distributions to account for underlying uncertainty. A simulation-based scenario analysis was conducted to assess how uncertainty in efficacy and AEs affected the net monetary benefit (NMB) for the hypothetical treatment at a cost-effectiveness threshold of 20,000 pound per QALY. Results: Relative to pregabalin, an increase in efficacy was associated with greater NMB than an improvement in tolerability. A greater NMB was observed when efficacy was marginally higher than that of pregabalin, while maintaining the same level of AEs than when efficacy was equivalent to pregabalin, but with a more substantial reduction in AEs. In the latter scenario, the NMB was only positive at a low cost-effectiveness threshold. Limitations: The replicate model shares the limitations described in the NICE guidelines. There is a lack of support in scientific literature for the assumption that increased efficacy is associated with a greater reduction in tolerability. The replicate model also included a single comparator, unlike the NICE model. Conclusions: Pain relief is a stronger driver of NMB than tolerability, at a cost-effectiveness threshold of 20,000 pound per QALY. Health technology assessment decisions which are influenced by NICE's model may reward efficacy gains, even if they are associated with more severe AEs. This contrasts with recommendations from clinical guidelines for neuropathic pain, which place more equal weighting on improvements in efficacy and tolerability as value drivers.","[Hirst, Matthew; Dunlop, William C.

However, decision-makers need to determine whether its benefits are worth the additional costs, given the low-cost generic status of traditional standard of care. Aims: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of sacubitril/valsartan compared to enalapril in patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction, from the Singapore healthcare payer perspective. Methods: A Markov model was developed to project clinical and economic outcomes of sacubitril/valsartan vs enalapril for 66-year-old patients with HF over 10 years. Key health states included New York Heart Association classes I-IV and deaths; patients in each state incurred a monthly risk of hospitalization for HF and cardiovascular death. Sacubitril/valsartan benefits were modeled by applying the hazard ratios (HRs) in PARADIGM-HF trial to baseline probabilities. Primary model outcomes were total and incremental costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for sacubitril/valsartan relative to enalapril Results: Compared to enalapril, sacubitril/valsartan was associated with an ICER of SGD 74,592 (USD 55,198) per QALY gained. A major driver of cost-effectiveness was the cardiovascular mortality benefit of sacubitril/valsartan. The uncertainty of this treatment benefit in the Asian sub-group was tested in sensitivity analyses using a HR of 1 as an upper limit, where the ICERs ranged from SGD 41,019 (USD 30,354) to SGD 1,447,103 (USD 1,070,856) per QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed the probability of sacubitril/valsartan being cost-effective was below 1%, 12%, and 71% at SGD 20,000, SGD 50,000, and SGD 100,000 per QALY gained, respectively. Conclusions: At the current daily price sacubitril/valsartan may not represent good value for limited healthcare dollars compared to enalapril in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in HF in the Singapore healthcare setting. This study highlights the cost-benefit trade-off that healthcare professionals and patients face when considering therapy.","[Liang, Lin; Wu, David Bin-Chia; Aziz, Mohamed Ismail Abdul; Ng, Kwong] Agcy Care Effectiveness, Minist Hlth, Singapore, Singapore; [Wong, Raymond] Natl Univ Heart Ctr, Dept Cardiol, Singapore, Singapore; [Sim, David] Natl Heart Ctr, Dept Cardiol, Singapore, Singapore; [Leong, Kui Toh Gerard] Changi Gen Hosp, Dept Cardiol, Singapore, Singapore; [Wei, Yong Quek] Tan Tock Seng Hosp, Dept Cardiol, Singapore, Singapore; [Tan, Doreen] Khoo Teck Puat Hosp, Dept Pharm, Singapore, Singapore",Ministry of Health-Singapore; National University of Singapore; National Heart Centre Singapore; Changi General Hospital; Tan Tock Seng Hospital,"Ng, K (通讯作者)，Coll Med Bldg,16 Coll Rd, Singapore 169854, Singapore.",ng_kwong_hoe@moh.gov.sg,"Wu, David Bin-Chia/H-3267-2019","Wong, Raymond Ching Chiew/0000-0001-6224-4543",,,,,22,23,24,1,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The retailer's decision to carry strategic inventory is catastrophic from the perspective of supply chain coordination, but benign for the decentralized supply chain.","[Moon, Ilkyeong; Saha, Subrata] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Dey, Kartick] Univ Engn & Management, Dept Math, Kolkata 700160, India; [Moon, Ilkyeong] Inst Ind Syst Innovat, Seoul 08826, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Saha, S (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Seoul 08826, South Korea.",ikmoon@snu.ac.kr; kartickdey.appmath@gmail.com; subrata.scm@gmail.com,"Saha, Subrata/HMD-2525-2023; Dey, Kartik/AAR-8333-2020; MOON, ILKYEONG/C-2406-2013; 穆, 儒/HGC-6534-2022","saha, subrata/0000-0002-5118-1548; MOON, ILKYEONG/0000-0002-7072-1351","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning [2017R1A2B2007812]","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning","The authors are grateful to five anonymous reviewers and the Editor-in-cheif for their valuable and constructive comments to improve earlier version of the manuscript.

Methods: The ESSENCE was a retrospective, observational study, and included data on patients' clinical characteristics and SLE-related HR use (laboratory, biopsy, imaging tests, medications, visits to specialists, outpatient visits, hospitalizations) during 2010 from the 12 specialized rheumatologic centers. Results: A total of 436 SLE patients were included in the analyses, with 232 patients being enrolled in Russia, 110 in Kazakhstan, and 94 in Ukraine. The mean age was 36-42 years and median SLE duration was 3-6.8 years across the countries. Extrapolation to total country population showed that, in 2010, visits to specialists (who assign treatment for organs involved/damaged by SLE) were the most frequently used HR (from 13,439 visits in Kazakhstan to 23,510 in Russia), followed by hospitalizations (from 2,950 in Kazakhstan to 6,267 in Russia) and outpatient visits (from 1,654 visits in Russia to 8,064 in Kazakhstan). Compared to chronic active patients (SLE persistent during last year), patients with relapsing-remitting SLE (at least one flare alternated by one remission per year) had a higher rate of visits to specialists (100% vs 60.8%, p < .001) and hospitalizations (98.9% vs 60.8%, p < .001). Compared to patients without flares, patients experiencing flares had a higher rate of unplanned visits to specialists (86.2% vs 6.3%, p < .001), were more often hospitalized (both ICU and non-ICU) (100.0% vs 50.0%, p < .001), and had a longer duration of ICU hospitalization (25.9 days vs 17.5 days, p < .001). Conclusions: Specialist visits are the most frequently consumed SLE-related healthcare recourse in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries. A relapsing-remitting SLE profile and the occurrence of flares significantly raise healthcare resource consumption.","[Nasonov, E.; Soloviev, S.] Russian Acad Med Sci, Inst Rheumatol, Moscow, Russia; [Davidson, J.

Methods: A retrospective analysis of medical records of US community oncology practices was conducted. Eligible patients had advanced NSCLC (stage IIIB/IV) diagnosed between January 1, 2008 and January 1, 2015, initiated treatment with erlotinib or afatinib (first-line or second-line), and had disease progression. Monthly Medicare-paid costs were evaluated during the TKI therapy period and following progression. Results: The study included 364 patients. The total mean monthly cost during TKI therapy was $20,106 (95% confidence interval [CI]=$16,836-$23,376), of which 47.0% and 42.4% represented hospitalization costs and anti-cancer therapy costs, respectively. Following progression on TKI therapy (data available for 316 patients), total mean monthly cost was $19,274 (95% CI=$15,329-$23,218), and was higher in the 76.3% of patients who received anti-cancer therapy following progression than in the 23.7% of those who did not ($20,490 vs $15,364; p<.001). Among patients who received it, anti-cancer therapy ($11,198; 95% CI=$7,102-$15,295) represented 54.7% of total mean monthly cost. Among patients who did not receive anti-cancer therapy, hospitalization ($13,829; 95% CI=$4,922-$22,736) represented 90.0% of total mean monthly cost. Impaired performance status and brain metastases were significant predictors of increased cost during TKI therapy. Limitations: The study design may limit the generalizability of findings. Conclusions: Healthcare costs during TKI treatment and following progression appeared to be similar and were largely attributed to hospitalization and anti-cancer therapy. Notably, almost one-quarter of patients did not receive anti-cancer therapy following progression, potentially indicating an unmet need; hospitalization was the largest cost contributor for these patients. Additional effective targeted therapies are needed that could prolong progression-free survival, leading to fewer hospitalizations for EGFR mutation-positive patients.","[Skinner, Karen E.; Walker, Mark S.] Vector Oncol, 6555 Quince,Suite 400, Memphis, TN 38119 USA; [Fernandes, Ancilla W.; Pavilack, Melissa] AstraZeneca, Gaithersburg, MD USA; [VanderWalde, Ari] West Canc Ctr, Memphis, TN USA",AstraZeneca,"Skinner, KE (通讯作者)，Vector Oncol, 6555 Quince,Suite 400, Memphis, TN 38119 USA.",kskinner@vectoroncology.com,"VanderWalde, Ari/HLQ-7510-2023",,AstraZeneca,AstraZeneca(AstraZeneca),The study was funded by AstraZeneca.,,30,28,29,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The control policy minimizes the overall intersection delay by deciding the green intervals for signal phases dynamically as driven by real-time traffic but subject to a set of constraints such as minimax green time for each phase. This paper models intersection vehicle delay by assuming continuous vehicle arrival and departure, and presents the optimal condition for green signal switch. Prior to this work, there does not appear to have been a continuous model on optimal control applied to the general intersection. Two numerical algorithms are proposed: optimum based (DORAS) and queue-based heuristic (DORAS-Q) respectively. Numerical tests are conducted via discrete simulation using an actual intersection data covering peak, mid-day and midnight hours, respectively. Comparison is conducted between actuated, DORAS, DORAS-Q and OPAC III. The tests show that the latter three methods all perform significantly better than the actuated. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we study three kinematic wave models for both discontinuous and continuous lane-drop bottlenecks, where the number of lanes drops either suddenly or gradually. In the first two models, we apply the multilane LWR model (Lighthill and Whitham, 1955; Richards, 1956) for a discontinuous and continuous lane-drop bottleneck, respectively; in the third model, we assume that the standing wave is instantaneous inside a continuous lane-drop bottleneck. For the first model, we apply the kinematic wave theory developed in Jin et al. (2009) to solve the Riemann problem. In particular, we present an optimization formulation for the entropy condition, solve the stationary states and kinematic waves on both upstream and downstream links, and define instantaneous discontinuous standing waves connecting the upstream and downstream links' stationary states. For the second model, we define a generalized Riemann problem and show that the asymptotic stationary states and kinematic waves on both links are the same as those in the first model, but the asymptotic standing wave is continuous, comprising of stationary states inside the whole lane-drop zone. Assuming standing waves to be instantaneous as in the first model but continuous as in the second model, we present a new model of a continuous lane-drop bottleneck and a new theoretical framework to solve the generalized Riemann problem. Finally we develop three corresponding Cell Transmission Models and verify theoretical results, especially the presence and structure of continuous standing waves inside a continuous lane-drop zone, with numerical examples. We find that vehicles' acceleration rates across the standing waves can be infinite in the first model and unrealistically large in the other two and that there is no capacity drop in all of the models. The theoretical framework of the third model forms a basis for a follow-up study, (fin, 2017), in which we introduce bounded acceleration as an additional constraint on the instantaneous standing waves and present a behavioral model of capacity drop.

An analysis of the influence of different parameters on the overall performance and managerial insights are given. Results show that the developed exact approach is suitable for medium sized instances such as the ones obtained from the inner districts of Vienna.

In maritime transportation, the cost represents fuel cost or air pollutant emissions, so study of this problem has significant economic and environmental impacts. To accommodate different fuel and emission models, we allow the dependence of the cost on the speed to be a general continuously differentiable and strictly convex function, and different across the arcs. We develop an efficient algorithm that is able to solve instances of 1000 nodes in less than a second. The algorithm is 20 to 100 times faster than a general convex optimization solver on test instances and requires much less memory. The solutions found at intermediate steps of our algorithm also provide some insights to ship planners on how to balance the operating cost and service quality. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigate two possible air-rail partnerships between a rail operator and either a domestic airline or a foreign airline. When a partnership is formed, an investment to improve the air rail connecting service is allowed at a cost before the service is launched. We find that the cooperation level, the equilibrium partnership scenarios when air-rail cooperation is exclusive or non-exclusive, as well as the comparisons of social welfare under different partnership scenarios, all depend on the pre-investment quality of air-rail service compared with the quality of air-air service.

This paper investigates households' car ownership decision-making process from the perspective of household time allocation. Applying the game-theoretic approach to capturing household members' interactive decision-making mechanism, we propose a two-stage model that links household members' short-term time allocation decisions to long-term car ownership decisions. The first stage models the bargaining of household members (e.g., husband and wife) over the car ownership decision, taking into consideration of government policies for regulating car ownership; and the second stage is a generalized Nash equilibrium model for activity travel pattern analysis incorporating individuals' interactions concerning activity participation. The existence and uniqueness of the generalized Nash equilibrium solution is examined, and a heuristic procedure that combines backwards induction and method of exhaustion is adopted to solve the two-stage game. The proposed model is applied to an empirical case study in Beijing, which demonstrates the applicability of the model in predicting car ownership and examining interactions between car ownership and household time allocation. The empirical model is applied to assess the impacts of plate-number-based vehicle usage rationing policies on car ownership and time allocation to travel and daily activities. Results show that the model can be applied to evaluate the car ownership impacts of car usage rationing policies.

The demand-adaptive service connects passengers from their origin/destination to the fixed-route service in order to improve accessability. The proposed hybrid design is unique in that it operates the demand-adaptive service with a stable headway to cover all stops along a paired fixed-route line. Pairing demand-adaptive vehicles with a fixed-route line simplifies the complexity of on-demand routing, because the vehicles can follow a more predictable path and can be dispatched on intervals coordinated with the fixed-route line. The design of the two services are closely coupled to minimize the total system cost, which incudes both the transit agency's operating cost and the user cost. The optimal design model is formulated as a mixed integer program and solved using a commercially available metaheuristic. Numerical experiments are conducted to compare the demand adaptive paired-line hybrid transit (DAPL-HT) system with two related transit systems that may be considered its special cases: a fixed-route system and a flexible-route system. We show that the DAPL-HT system outperforms the other two systems under a wide range of demand levels and in various scenarios of input parameters. A discrete-event simulation model is also developed and applied to confirm the correctness of the analytical results. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We develop a macroscopic heterogeneous traffic flow model. This model considers interplay of multiple vehicle classes, each of which is assumed to possess homogeneous car-following behavior and vehicle attributes. We propose the concepts of road capacity split and perceived equivalent density for each class to model both lateral and longitudinal cross-class interactions across neighboring cells. Rather than leveraging hydrodynamic analogies, it establishes pragmatic cross-class interaction rules aspired by capacity allocation and approximate inter-cell fluxes. This model generalizes the classical Cell Transmission Model (CTM) to three types of traffic regimes in general, i.e. free flow, semi-congestion, and full congestion regimes. This model replicates prominent empirical characteristics exhibited by mixed vehicular flow, including formation and spatio-temporal propagation of shockwaves, vehicle overtaking, as well as oscillatory waves. Those features are validated against numerical experiments and the NGSIM 1-80 data. Realistic class-specific travel times can be computed from this model efficiently, which demonstrates the feasibility of applying this multi-class model to large-scale real-world networks.

Different from the most existing researches that treat these two problems separately, this paper proposes an integrated approach for the train scheduling problem on a bi-direction urban metro line in order to minimize the operational costs (i.e., energy consumption) and passenger waiting time. More specifically, we simultaneously consider (1) the train operational velocity choices that correspond to the energy consumption of trains on each travelling arc, and (2) the dynamic passenger demands at each station for the calculation of total passenger waiting time in the planning horizon. By employing a space-time network representation in the formulations, this complex train scheduling and control problem with dynamic passenger demands is rigorously formulated into two optimization models with linear forms. The first model is an integer programming model that jointly minimizes train traction energy consumption and passenger waiting time. The second model, which is formulated as a mixed-integer programming model, further considers the utilization of regenerative braking energy on the basis of the first model. Due to the computational complexity of these two models, especially for large-scale real-world instances, we develop a Lagrangian relaxation (LR)-based heuristic algorithm that decomposes the primal problem into two sets of subproblems and thus enables to find a good solution in short computational time.

Methods: The 2013 China Health Insurance Research Association (CHIRA) urban insurance claims database was used to identify patients with AS. The identified patients were stratified by AS treatments for the comparisons of well established AS-related complications and direct medical costs. Conventional regression analyses adjusted the collected patient baseline characteristics to confirm the impact of treatments on complications and direct medical costs. Results: Of the identified 1299 patients with AS, 18.0% received non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), 11.2% received immunosuppressant, 48.2% received NSAID plus immunosuppressant, 4.6% received biologic agents, and 17.9% received medications without indication for AS. Biologic group was associated with the lowest proportion of AS-related complications (8.3%) that was confirmed by multiple logistic regression analysis (odds ratio = 0.200, p=.017). The biologic group was also associated with highest direct medical costs (median: RMB=14,539) that were confirmed by the multiple generalized linear model (coefficient = 1.644, p<.001). Conclusions: Biologics were not commonly used for AS in Chinese patients likely due to their high cost. Future studies are needed to confirm the potential long-term clinical benefits associated biologic treatment for AS.","[Li, Jinghu; Zhang, Jie] China Hlth Insurance Res Assoc, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Qingjing; Gao, Shuangqing] Beijing North Med & Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yi; Chen, Wendong] Normin Hlth Changsha Representat Off, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yicheng] Xian Janssen, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Wendong] Normin Hlth, 723-2 Eva Rd, Toronto, ON M9C 0A9, Canada",,"Chen, WD (通讯作者)，Normin Hlth, 723-2 Eva Rd, Toronto, ON M9C 0A9, Canada.",wendong.chen@normin.ca,"li, yihua/JKJ-1325-2023",,Xian Janssen,Xian Janssen,This manuscript was funded by Xian Janssen.,,19,6,8,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

This is particularly important for congested networks prone to the occurrence of spillbacks. This paper formulates a probabilistic network model that proposes an aggregate description of the queue-length, and then approximates the joint aggregate queue-length distribution of subnetworks. The goal is to model between queue dependencies beyond first-order moments, yet to do so in a tractable manner such that these techniques can be used for optimization purposes. This paper models an urban road network as a finite space capacity Markovian queueing network. Exact evaluation of the stationary joint queue-length distribution of such a network with arbitrary size and topology can be obtained numerically. Nonetheless, the main challenge to such an approach remains the dimensionality of the network state space, which is exponential in the number of queues. This paper proposes to address the dimensionality issue by: 1) describing the state of the network aggregately, and 2) decomposing the network into overlapping subnetworks. We propose an analytical approximation of the stationary aggregate joint queue-length distribution of a subnetwork. The model consists of a system of nonlinear equations with a dimension that is linear, instead of exponential, in the number of queues and that is independent of the space capacity of the individual queues. The method is derived for tandem Markovian finite capacity queueing networks. The proposed model is computationally tractable and scalable, it can be efficiently used for the higher-order distributional analysis of large-scale networks. The model is validated versus simulation estimates and versus other decomposition methods. We then use it to address an urban traffic control problem. We show the added value of accounting for higher-order spatial between-queue dependency information in the control of congested urban networks. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Aim: This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of DCV+SOF vs SOF in combination with ribavirin (RBV) over a 20-year time horizon from the perspective of a United States (US) payer. Methods: A published Markov model was adapted to reflect US demographic characteristics, treatment patterns, costs of drug acquisition, monitoring, disease and adverse event management, and mortality risks. Clinical inputs came from the ALLY-3 and VALENCE trials. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-utility ratio. Life-years, incidence of complications, number of patients achieving sustained virological response (SVR), and the total cost per SVR were secondary outcomes. Costs (2014 USD) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were discounted at 3% per year. Deterministic, probabilistic, and scenario sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: DCV+SOF was associated with lower costs and better effectiveness than SOF+RBV in the base case and in almost all scenarios (i.e. treatment-experienced, non-cirrhotic, time horizons of 5, 10, and 80 years). DCV+SOF was less costly, but also slightly less effective than SOF+RBV in the cirrhotic and treatment-naive population scenarios. Results were sensitive to variations in the probability of achieving SVR for both treatment arms. DCV+SOF costs less than $50,000 per QALY gained in 79% of all probabilistic iterations compared with SOF+RBV. Conclusion: DCV+SOF is a dominant option compared with SOF+RBV in the US for the overall GT 3 HCV patient population.","[Thibault, Catherine Saint-Laurent] Evidera, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Moorjaney, Divya] QuickPivot, Boston, MA USA; [Ganz, Michael L.] Evidera, Waltham, MA USA; [Sill, Bruce] Bristol Myers Squibb, Hartford, CT USA; [Hede, Shalini; Yuan, Yong] Bristol Myers Squibb, Plainsboro, NJ USA; [Gorsh, Boris] GlaxoSmithKline, Upper Providence, PA USA",Evidera; Bristol-Myers Squibb; Bristol-Myers Squibb; GlaxoSmithKline,"Thibault, CSL (通讯作者)，Evidera, 7575 Trans Canada Highway,Suite 404, St Laurent, PQ H4T 1V6, Canada.",catherine.saint-laurentthibault@evidera.com,,"Ganz, Michael/0000-0002-9702-2999; Saint-Laurent Thibault, Catherine/0000-0002-5415-1045",Bristol-Myers Squibb,Bristol-Myers Squibb(Bristol-Myers Squibb),"Funding for this study was provided by Bristol-Myers Squibb.

In a generic liner shipping network with butterfly ports, each ship route is separated into a set of subloops on the basis of its structure and internal butterfly ports. Reversing the subloop directions has an impact on the network-wide cost including inventory cost, transshipment cost, and slot-purchasing cost. This paper proposes a new destination-based nonlinear model for the subloop-based reversal of port rotation directions with the objective of minimizing the overall network-wide cost. We prove that the addressed problem is NP hard. Next, the model is transformed to an equivalent mixed-integer linear programming model. Based on the structure of the reformulated model, we develop a Benders decomposition (BD) algorithm and a metaheuristic method to solve practical-size instances. Three acceleration strategies are incorporated into the BD algorithm, which are adding Pareto-optimal cuts, updating big-M coefficients and generating combinatorial Benders cuts. Case studies based on three small examples and an Asia-Europe-Oceania liner shipping network with a total of 46 ports are conducted. Results show that the problem could be efficiently solved by the accelerated BD algorithm and the optimization of subloop directions is conducive to decreasing the network-wide cost especially the inventory cost.

Unlike the conventional methods, which generally are the statistical models with the observed crash counts as the dependent variables and the factors affecting the likelihood of a traffic crash as the independent variables, a dynamic state-space model with deep learning is proposed to analyze the traffic crashes. The proposed model includes three modules, an unsupervised feature learning module to identify functional network between the explanatory variables and the feature representations, a supervised fine tuning module to perform crash occurrence likelihood estimations, and a dynamic state-space module to perform crash count predictions. A multivariate To bit model is incorporated in the supervised fine tuning module as the regression layer to account for the heterogeneity issues in correlated crash data. The results of deep learning are fed to the dynamic state-space model that contains a dynamic equation governing the state dynamics to improve the performances of estimation and prediction. The proposed model was applied to the dataset that was obtained from Knox County in Tennessee to validate the model effectiveness and efficiency. The results show that the proposed model has superior performances in terms of estimation and prediction power compared to the SVM and Random Forest (RF) models. The overall performances of the proposed model for all crashes show an 50.559% RMSD improvement over the SVM models and an 57.867% RMSD improvement over the RF models. The findings indicate that the feature learning module identifies relational information between the explanatory variables and feature representations, which reduces the dimensionality of the input and preserves the original information. The proposed model that includes a multivariate Tobit regression layer in the supervised fine tuning module can better account for differential distribution patterns in traffic crashes across injury severities and provides superior crash occurrence likelihood estimation results. The findings suggest that the proposed model can better address the heterogeneity issues in correlated crash data and is a superior alternative for traffic crash estimations and predictions.

The overall problem is decomposed into a linked facility location problem (FLP) and a mode choice problem (MCP). The MCP is cast as a three-level nested probability model for determining modal and IMT demands. It was shown that for terminals with sufficiently large handling capacities, the objective function of the overall problem reduces to that of the MCP, the result is a single level mathematical program, which locates facilities to maximise shippers' expected utility or consumer surplus. The model is suitable for urban or regional planning, but may also be used by terminal operators to estimate shipper demand for given locations.

Nowadays, vehicles circulating on our roads either undermine safety regulations or lack operational efficiency when these regulations are taken into account and cargo is extensively rearranged after each delivery. This issue has been completely ignored both in the vehicle routing literature and in the container loading literature. The aim of this work is to provide tools capable of ensuring that a cargo arrangement is load balanced along the complete distribution trip. It proposes a multi-drop load balance recovery algorithm (MDLBRA), which seeks to ensure that, when both a complete route and the respective cargo arrangement are provided, the boxes to be removed from the cargo arrangement at the depot and the boxes to be rearranged at each customer are identified, allowing the cargo to remain balanced after every delivery. It is important to notice that a MDLBRA is not a container loading algorithm: a MDLBRA modifies solutions generated by any container loading algorithm so that load balance is guaranteed when the truck leaves the depot and during the entire distribution route. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is proposed to balance the cargo at each customer stop. The MILP model incorporates load distribution diagram constraints in order to determine the feasible domain for the location of the centre of gravity of the cargo arrangement, taking into account the regulatory requirements and the technical characteristics of the vehicle. Extensive computational experiments show that a MDLBRA can be used in practical contexts, as the MILP model was able to find a solution in less than ten minutes in 93% of the unbalanced test instances.

Based on a comprehensive battery aging model we introduce a continuous quadratic programming model to derive battery life optimal charging (OPT). The strategy indicates when and how much to charge to maximize the potential range throughout the battery life. We find that OPT has the potential to more than double the expected battery life compared to simple and often abundant recharging activities as observable today. The degree of battery life prolongation strongly depends on the operating temperature. Since optimal charging would require deterministic knowledge of future trips and corresponding charging levels we investigate a more convenient charging heuristic derived from As-Late-As-Possible (ALAP) charging. ALAP charging considers range buffers between 5% and 60% over the range required until the next re-charging opportunity. We analyze the trade-off between (long-term) battery life and (short-term) range flexibility. We find that for decreasing temperatures the trade-off between battery life and flexibility is solved with increasing range buffers. From our results battery degradation aware charging heuristics can be easily derived and applied in real-world settings. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, a behavioral model is presented that describes the joint choice of a hinterland transport chain, accounting for each of the above parties' objectives: sea/dry ports seek to maximize throughput; intermodal carriers seek to maximize profits; and shippers seek to minimize logistics cost.

These contracts involve incentive conflicts between private sector concerning profit and government concerning social welfare. To coordinate the incentive conflicts, the government usually subsidizes the private sector in practice. In this paper, we propose a stylized model to illustrate how to design an optimal BOT contract with government subsidy. We first derive optimal subsidy levels for the government to obtain optimal social welfare, given concession periods. We further observe that there exist both a substitution effect and a complementary effect between the concession period and the subsidy level. For the former (latter), the subsidy is decreasing (increasing) in the concession period, and the substitution effect can be strengthened if the government has subsidy budget constraint. Interestingly, we find that the private sector does not always prefer the longest concession period. A concession period less than the lifetime of the infrastructure may be more beneficial for the private sector. In contrast, the government's preferred concession period can be either zero or the longest concession period, depending on the unit construction cost and the government's inefficiency cost. We further find that, the incentives of the government and the private sector over the concession period can be aligned when the unit construction cost is low and the government's inefficiency cost is high. We also find that their incentives over the infrastructure's capacity utilization are always aligned throughout the BOT periods. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

SP data is often treated with suspicion because consumers may respond differently in a hypothetical survey context than they do in the marketplace. However, models built on RP data can suffer from endogeneity bias when attributes that drive consumer choices are unobserved by the modeler and correlated with observed variables. Using a synthetic data experiment, we test the performance of pooled RP-SP models in recovering the preference parameters that generated the market data under conditions that choice modelers are likely to face, including (1) when there is potential for endogeneity problems in the RP' data, such as omitted variable bias, and (2) when consumer willingness to pay for attributes may differ from the survey context to the market context. We identify situations where pooling RP and SP data does and does not mitigate each data source's respective weaknesses. We also show that the likelihood ratio test, which has been widely used to determine whether pooling is statistically justifiable, (1) can fail to identify the case where SP context preference differences and RP endogeneity bias shift the parameter estimates of both models in the same direction and magnitude and (2) is unreliable when the product attributes are fixed within a small number of choice sets, which is typical of automotive RP data. Our findings offer new insights into when pooling data sources may or may not be advisable for accurately estimating market preference parameters, including consideration of the conditions and context under which the data were generated as well as the relative balance of information between data sources.

Specifically, three types of CF models are considered: basic, time-delayed, and multi-anticipative/cooperative CF models. For each type, notable methods in the literature for analysing its local stability and string stability have been reviewed in detail, including the characteristic equation based method (e.g., root extracting, the root locus method, the Routh-Hurwitz criterion, the Nyquist criterion and the Hopf bifurcation method), Lyapunov criterion, the direct transfer function based method, and the Laplace transform based method. In addition, consistency and applicability of stability criteria obtained using some of these methods are objectively compared with the simulation result from a series of numerical experiments. Finally, issues, challenges, and research needs of CF models' stability analysis in the era of connected and autonomous vehicles are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

An innovative mixed-integer programming (MIP) model is formulated and a parallel branch-and-price-and-cut (BPC) algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. The key idea of the model formulation and the solution algorithm is to represent a bus timetable with a route and a dispatch pattern. An aggregation and greedy algorithm is developed to efficiently solve the pricing subproblem. The cuts of disaggregate coupling inequalities are dynamically added to strengthen the lower bound. A computational study is conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology. The comparison with alternative solution approaches indicates that the parallel BPC algorithm is superior to solving the MIP formulations with the off-the-shelf MIP solver. Different values of model parameters are also tested, and various statistics of operators and passengers are reported for the cases. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Materials and methods: The study was conducted in two parts: development of a conceptual framework identifying direct, indirect and intangible costs of platelet transfusion, followed by the estimation of the total cost of platelet transfusion in patients with CLD-associated thrombocytopenia before an elective procedure in the United States using the conceptual framework and cost data obtained from a literature search. The cost of the entire care required to raise a patient's platelet count before the procedure was considered. Results: The final conceptual framework included the costs of generating the supply of platelets, the platelet transfusion itself, adverse events associated with platelet transfusion and refractoriness to platelet transfusion. When costs were accounted for in all the framework cost categories, the total direct cost of a platelet transfusion in a patient with CLD and associated thrombocytopenia was estimated to be in the range of $5258 to $13,117 (2017US dollars) in the United States. The largest portion of costs was incurred by the transfusion event itself ($3723 to $4436) and the cost of refractoriness ($874 to $7578), which included the opportunity cost of a delayed procedure and subsequent platelet transfusions with human leukocyte antigen-matched platelets. Limitations and conclusions: Although we were unable to include all cost components identified in the conceptual framework in our total cost estimate, thus likely underestimating the true total cost, and despite the data gaps and challenges limiting our estimate of the full cost of a platelet transfusion in patients with CLD-associated thrombocytopenia undergoing an elective procedure in the United States, this study outlines a comprehensive conceptual framework for estimating the cost elements of a platelet transfusion in these patients.","[Barnett, Christine L.; Mladsi, Deirdre] RTI Hlth Solut, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Vredenburg, Michael; Aggarwal, Kavita] Dova Pharmaceut, Durham, NC USA",Research Triangle Institute,"Barnett, CL (通讯作者)，200 Pk Off Dr, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",cbarnett@rti.org,"Barnett, Christine/HHN-6079-2022","Barnett, Christine/0000-0002-1465-7623; Mladsi, Deirdre/0000-0001-8113-1149","Dova Pharmaceuticals (Durham, NC, USA); RTI Health Solutions (Research Triangle Park, NC, USA)","Dova Pharmaceuticals (Durham, NC, USA); RTI Health Solutions (Research Triangle Park, NC, USA)","RTI Health Solutions (Research Triangle Park, NC, USA) received funding under a research contract with Dova Pharmaceuticals (Durham, NC, USA) to conduct this study.

Methods: A decision analytic semi-Markov model evaluated the cost-effectiveness of secukinumab 150mg and 300mg compared to subcutaneous biologics adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, and ustekinumab, and intravenous biologics infliximab and infliximab biosimilar in biologic-naive and biologic-experienced patients over a lifetime horizon. The response to treatments was evaluated after 12 weeks by PsA Response Criteria (PsARC) response rates. Non-responders or patients discontinuing initial-line of biologic treatment were allowed to switch to subsequent-line biologics. Model input parameters (Psoriasis Area Severity Index [PASI], Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ], withdrawal rates, costs, and resource use) were collected from clinical trials, published literature, and other Canadian sources. Benefits were expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). An annual discount rate of 5% was applied to costs and benefits. The robustness of the study findings were evaluated via sensitivity analyses. Results: Biologic-naive patients treated with secukinumab achieved the highest number of QALYs (8.54) at the lowest cost (CAD 925,387) over a lifetime horizon vs all comparators. Secukinumab dominated all treatments, except for infliximab and its biosimilar, which achieved minimally more QALYs (8.58). However, infliximab and its biosimilar incurred more costs than secukinumab (infliximab: CAD 1,015,437; infliximab biosimilar: CAD 941,004), resulting in higher cost-effectiveness estimates relative to secukinumab. In the biologic-experienced population, secukinumab dominated all treatments as it generated more QALYs (8.89) at lower costs (CAD 954,692). Deterministic sensitivity analyses indicated the results were most sensitive to variation in PsARC response rates, change in HAQ, and utility values in both populations. Conclusions: Secukinumab is either dominant or cost-effective vs all licensed biologics for the treatment of active PsA in biologic-naive and biologic-experienced populations in Canada.","[Goeree, Ron] Goeree Consulting Ltd, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada; [Goeree, Ron] McMaster Univ, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada; [Chiva-Razavi, Sima] Novartis Pharmaceut Canada Inc, Dorval, PQ, Canada; [Gunda, Praveen] Novartis Healthcare Private Ltd, Novartis Prod Life Cycle Serv NBS, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Graham, Christopher N.; Miles, LaStella] RTI Hlth Solut, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Nikoglou, Efthalia] Novartis Global Serv Ctr, Novartis Prod Lifecycle Serv NBS, Dublin, Ireland; [Jugl, Steffen M.] Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland; [Gladman, Dafna D.] Univ Toronto, Toronto Western Hosp, Toronto, ON, Canada",McMaster University; Novartis; Novartis; Research Triangle Institute; Novartis; University of Toronto; University Health Network Toronto,"Goeree, R (通讯作者)，Goeree Consulting Ltd, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada.;Goeree, R (通讯作者)，McMaster Univ, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada.",goereer@sympatico.ca,,"Nikoglou, Efthalia/0009-0007-7406-9528; Graham, Christopher/0000-0001-8165-7095; Miles, LaStella/0000-0002-1394-070X","Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland","Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland","This study was funded by Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland.",,59,15,15,0,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The TYRX Antibacterial Envelope is a polypropylene mesh that stabilizes the CIED and elutes minocycline and rifampin to reduce the risk of post-operative infection. Methods: A decision tree was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of TYRX vs standard of care (SOC) following implantation of four CIED device types. The model was parameterized for a UK National Health Service perspective. Probabilities were derived from the literature. Resource use included drug acquisition and administration, hospitalization, adverse events, device extraction, and replacement. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated from costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Results: Over a 12-month time horizon, TYRX was less costly and more effective than SOC when utilized in patients with an ICD or CRT-D. TYRX was associated with ICERs of 46,548 and 21,768 pound per QALY gained in patients with an IPG or CRT-P, respectively. TYRX was cost-effective at a 30,000 pound threshold at baseline probabilities of infection exceeding 1.65% (CRT-D), 1.95% (CRT-P), 1.87% (IPG), and 1.38% (ICD). Limitations and conclusions: Device-specific infection rates for high-risk patients were not available in the literature and not used in this analysis, potentially under-estimating the impact of TYRX in certain devices. Nevertheless, TYRX is associated with a reduction in post-operative infection risk relative to SOC, resulting in reduced healthcare resource utilization at an initial cost. The ICERs are below the accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds used by UK decision-makers. TYRX, therefore, represents a cost-effective prevention option for CIED patients at high-risk of post-operative infection.","[Kay, Gemma; Kumar, Gayathri; Fenwick, Elisabeth] ICON Hlth Econ & Epidemiol, Abingdon, Oxon, England; [Eby, Elizabeth L.] Medtron Plc, Mounds View, MN USA; [Brown, Benedict; Eggington, Simon] Medtron Int Trading Sarl, Tolochenaz, Switzerland; [Lyon, Julie] Medtron Ltd, Watford, England; [Sohail, M.

The aim was to give healthcare decision-makers insight into the differences in cost accumulation over time between alemtuzumab-with a unique, non-continuous treatment schedule- and fingolimod and natalizumab for second-line treatment of active RRMS patients in the Netherlands. Methods: In line with ZiN's assessment, a cost-minimization analysis was performed from a Dutch healthcare perspective over a 5-year time horizon. Resource use was derived from hospital protocols and summaries of product characteristics, and validated by two MS specialists. Unit costs were based on national tariffs and guidelines. Robustness of the base case results was verified with multiple sensitivity and scenario analyses. Results: Alemtuzumab results in cost savings compared to fingolimod and natalizumab from, respectively, 3.3 and 2.8 years since treatment initiation onwards. At 5 years, total discounted costs per patient of alemtuzumab were (sic)79,717, followed by fingolimod with (sic)110,044 and natalizumab with (sic)122,238, resulting in cost savings of (sic)30,327 and (sic)42,522 for alemtuzumab compared to fingolimod and natalizumab, respectively. Key drivers of the model are drug acquisition costs and the proportions of patients that do not require further alemtuzumab treatment after either two, three, or four courses. Limitations: No treatment discontinuation and associated switching between treatments were incorporated. Consequences of JC virus seropositivity while continuing natalizumab treatment (e.g. additional monitoring) were omitted from the base case. Conclusion: The current cost-minimization analysis demonstrates that, from the Dutch healthcare perspective, treating active RRMS patients with alemtuzumab results in cost savings compared to second-line alternatives fingolimod and natalizumab from similar to 3 years since treatment initiation onwards. After 5 years, alemtuzumab's cost savings are estimated at (sic)30k compared to fingolimod and (sic)43k compared to natalizumab.","[Piena, M.

Lower resource use in the F group was characterized by shorter hospital length of stay and surgical time as well as fewer blood transfusions and less hemostat agent used per surgery. Objective: To evaluate the cost-consequence of using F compared to F + G/T in minor, major and severe spinal surgery from the US hospital perspective. Methods: A cost-consequence model was developed using the US hospital perspective. Model inputs include clinical inputs from the literature, cost inputs (hemostatic matrices, blood product transfusion, hospital stay and operating room time) from the literature, and an analysis of annual spine surgery volume (minor, major and severe) using the 2012 National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database. Costs are reported in 2017 US dollars. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses address sources of variability in the results. Results: A medium-volume hospital (130 spine surgeries per year) using F versus F +G/T for spine surgeries is expected to require 85 less hours of surgical time, 58 fewer hospital days and 7 fewer blood transfusions in addition to hemostat volume savings (F: 1 mL, thrombin: 1994 mL). The cost savings associated with the hospital resources for a medium-volume hospital are expected to be $317,959 (surgical hours = $154,746, hospital days = $125,237, blood transfusions = $19,023, hemostatic agents = $18,953) or $2445 per spine surgery. Conclusions: The use of F versus F +G/T could lead to annual cost savings for US hospitals performing a low to high volume of spinal surgeries per year.","[Ramirez, Manuel G.; Yang, Dongyan] Baxter Healthcare Corp, One Baxter Pkwy, Deerfield, IL 60015 USA; [Niu, Xiaoli; Epstein, Josh] Stratevi, Santa Monica, CA USA",Baxter International Inc,"Ramirez, MG (通讯作者)，Baxter Healthcare Corp, One Baxter Pkwy, Deerfield, IL 60015 USA.",manuel_ramirez@baxter.com,"Yang, Dongyan/S-4258-2016",,Baxter Healthcare Corporation,Baxter Healthcare Corporation,The study was funded by Baxter Healthcare Corporation.,,21,3,3,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Meanwhile, individual parking driver makes his/her parking payment decision based on knowledge of the patrol visit frequencies. Game-theoretic models are proposed to capture the interactions among the parking enforcement agency and parking drivers. We first develop a discrete formulation of the problem in the form of a mixed-integer program and propose a Lagrangian relaxation based solution approach. For large-scale instances, we also develop a continuum approximation model that can be reduced to a simpler non-linear optimization problem. A series of numerical experiments are conducted to show that, for small problem instances, both modeling approaches can yield reasonable solutions, although the continuum approximation approach is able to produce a solution within a much shorter time. For large-scale instances, the discrete model incurs prohibitive computational burdens, while the continuum approximation approach still provides a near optimum solution effectively. We also discuss impacts of various system parameters, as well as the performance of different policy options (e.g., whether to allow multiple parking tickets to be issued to a vehicle with a long time of parking violation).

Recently, many mainline carriers (MCs) have strategically entered upstream regional carrying service market to offer one-stop-delivery service and hence, competed with incumbent regional carriers (RCs). Note that promised delivery time (PDT) competition is essential and common in this industry. We study a MC's entry decision using a joint demand and PDT competition model. We investigate the entry mode issue (fully-controlled or joint-venture), which influences the equilibrium profits and channel structure, and characterize the value of upstream competition and vertical cooperation between the MC and incumbent RC. Interestingly, we find that the MC's upstream entry can result in a win-win situation, or a lose-lose situation for the MC and the incumbent RC. Comparing parties' profits with and without PDT competition, we find that multi-dimensional competition may weaken the negative effect of upstream entry on the incumbent RC, resulting in a price advantage and PDT disadvantage for the MC. We also find that a fully-controlled entry mode is always a dominant strategy with or without PDT competition. Moreover, by assuming power distribution of the PDT, we find that the increase in service rate can result in a lower price and shorter PDT quotation for the MC. A(n) decrease (increase) of service rate strengthens (weakens) the PDT disadvantage, and this effect is strengthened with fully-controlled entry mode. We also examine Bertrand models and characterize the entry effects and the MC's entry decisions under joint price and PDT competition. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The goal is to identify rules for determining the optimal port charge and capacity to allow port emissions to be regulated in an environment with incomplete information. We evaluate the effect of introducing a risk-averse environmental monitor as a supervisor to provide the government with additional information (a signal) on the port operator's emission reduction cost. To prevent the environmental monitor from colluding with the port operator, we develop a collusion-proof regulation scheme based on the principal-agent theory. The scheme is modeled as a bi-level problem faced by the government and the monitor. We find that, compared to the case with complete information, collusion-proof regulation do not distort optimal port charges only when the port operator is efficient and has low emission reduction costs. When distortion does occur, it depends on the monitor's degree of risk aversion and the accuracy of the signal about emission reduction cost. Besides, information asymmetry leads to less cargo throughput, a lower emission level, and reduced port capacity. Such regulation-induced downward distortion can be either alleviated or aggravated by the collusion-proof regulation, depending on the quality of the information received by the environmental monitor. Our theoretical models are tested using a case study based on container terminals in the Port of Shanghai. The numerical results suggest that a risk-averse environmental monitor can improve port user's social welfare in the presence of imperfect information. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

A pressing issue that needs to be addressed in bike sharing systems is the accrued imbalance of bicycles between commuter demands and inventory levels at stations. To overcome this issue, a commonly employed strategy is to reposition bicycles during off-peak periods (typically at night) when no new user arrivals are expected. However, when such an imbalance occurs during day-time peak hours, such a passive strategy would result in lower resource utilization rates. To overcome this drawback, in this study, we propose a dynamic bicycle repositioning methodology that considers inventory level forecasting, user arrivals forecasting, bicycle repositioning, and vehicle routing in a unified manner. A multi-commodity time-space network flow model is presented, which results in an underlying complex nonlinear optimization problem. This problem is then reformulated into an equivalent mixed-integer problem using a model transformation approach and a novel heuristic algorithm is proposed to efficiently solve this model. Specifically, the first stage involves solving the linear relaxation of the MIP model, and a set covering problem is subsequently solved in the second stage to assign routes to the repositioning vehicles. The proposed methodology is evaluated using standard test-bed instances from the literature, and our numerical results reveal that the heuristic algorithm can achieve a significant reduction in rejected user requests when compared to existing methods, while yet expending only minimal computational effort.

The proposed approach treats the dense network as a continuum in the first level, in which private car and occupied taxi drivers are free to choose their paths in a two-dimensional continuous space. The proposed approach also divides the modeling region into many identical squares to form a cell-based network in the second level, in which the cells are classified into two categories: target cell with an acceptable expected rate of return (EROR) to vacant taxi drivers and non -target cell with an unacceptable EROR. The EROR associated with a cell is the ratio of the cumulative expected profit of a taxi driver who successfully picks up a customer during the customer search that starts from that cell to the sum of expected search time for this customer and expected occupied travel time to serve this customer. Based on the cell -based network, we develop a cell -based intervening opportunity model to capture the fact that vacant taxi drivers can meet a customer on the way to their destination zones and estimate the EROR Each vacant taxi driver has a mixed strategy to determine his/her customer -search direction according to the EROR: Each vacant taxi driver in a target cell selects its neighbor cells with maximum EROR, and each vacant taxi driver in a non-target cell selects the travel time -based shortest path to his/her target cell. Meanwhile, each private car driver chooses the path that minimizes his/her own generalized travel cost, and each occupied taxi driver chooses the path that minimizes his/her customer's generalized in-vehicle travel cost. In our model, traffic density in the system is governed by the conservation law (CL), and the flow directions of different vehicles are determined by the path-choice strategies of their drivers, which are captured by Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations. Both the proposed CL and HJ equations can be solved by the Lax-Friedrichs scheme, which forms the backbone of the developed solution algorithm.

However, there is an incipient development of an issue of great importance: the role and influence of external agents on individual time allocation and the recognition of unpaid/domestic work as a distinctive area of research. In this paper we introduce domestic production and the potential domestic work substitution by external providers in a time use model, improving its formulation and the interpretation of the values of time. We take into account the marginal utility of domestic activities, their cost - either if self-produced or hired - and the relation between the domestic output and domestic work hours considering the difference in skills between providers and household members. A stochastic system of equations is proposed and estimated using three Dutch time use and expenses data sets, from which the values of leisure and work are computed and analyzed. Comparative results show that a model with no consideration of hired domestic providers overestimates the values of leisure. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there are only a limited number of studies that investigate such interactions between freight rates and the freight futures, and no studies that also consider potential linkages with freight options. This study fills this gap by investigating the economic spillovers between time-charter rates, freight futures and freight options prices in the dry-bulk sector of the international shipping industry. Empirical results indicate the existence of significant information transmission in both returns and volatilities between the three related markets, which we attribute to varying trading activity and market liquidity. The results also point out that, consistent with theory, the freight futures market informationally leads the freight rate market, though surprisingly, freight options lag behind both futures and physical freight rates. The documented three-way economic interactions between the related markets can be used to enhance budget planning and risk management strategies, potentially attract more investors, and thus, improve the liquidity of the freight derivatives market.

We utilize a database collected from the website of an online travel agent in Brazil. We test whether incumbents reshape their airfare temporal profiles in an attempt to attract the price-sensitive passengers who constitute the target market of the newcomer. Our results suggest that LCC entry partially spoils the existing market segmentation schemes of incumbents, forcing them to revise their distribution management strategy, simplify their fare structure and migrate from a non-monotonic to a weakly monotonic price curve.

The benefits associated with apixaban could extend to improving hospital efficiencies, potentially influencing hospital resource use, and bed days. The objective of this study is to estimate the impact of 6-month treatment with apixaban vs low molecular weight heparin/vitamin k antagonist (LMWH/VKA) on hospital resource use among patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE). Methods: A model was developed to assess the impact of apixaban vs LMWH/VKA for treatment of VTE and prevention of recurrences on hospital resource use and costs. Resource use items included total hospitalizations, length of stay (LOS), and emergency department (ED) visits, estimated for all incident VTE patients in the UK over a 5-year time horizon. Rates of hospitalizations, ED visits, and LOS associated with recurrent VTE, major, and clinically relevant non-major bleeding were obtained from the AMPLIFY trial; costs were obtained from UK published sources. Results: Over a 5-year time horizon, the model predicted that, compared to 6 months of LMWH/VKA, 6 months of apixaban led to 3,954 fewer hospitalizations (consisting of 2,341 fewer new admissions and 1,613 fewer re-admissions) and 32,214 fewer bed days, among 332,607 incident VTE patients. ED visits were reduced by 1,582. The reduction in hospital resource use led to a cost saving of similar to 4.5 pound million in a market of patients treated with apixaban as compared to a market treated with LMWH/VKA. Sensitivity analysis indicated these findings were robust over a wide range of inputs. Conclusions: 6-month treatment with apixaban for treatment of VTE and prevention of recurrences on hospital resource use led to a reduction in hospitalizations and LOS in comparison to LMWH/VKA. These findings can help the efforts in reducing the growing burden of preventable re-admissions to hospitals.","[Browne, C.; Lanitis, T.; Kongnakorn, T.] Evidera, Metro Bldg 6th Floor,1 Butterwick, London W6 8DL, England; [Hamilton, M.; Li, X.] Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Princeton, NJ USA; [Horbyluk, R.; Mardekian, J.] Pfizer, New York, NY USA; [Cohen, A.] Guys & St Thomas Hosp, London, England",Evidera; Bristol-Myers Squibb; Pfizer; Guy's & St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust,,chantelle.browne@evidera.com,,,Bristol-Myers Squibb; Pfizer,Bristol-Myers Squibb(Bristol-Myers Squibb); Pfizer(Pfizer),This analysis was funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer.,,32,1,2,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Claims data were used for the analyses of direct and indirect costs reduction. A discrete choice experiment based on a web-based survey estimated the monetary value of the intangible costs for one injection. Another web-based survey of prostate cancer patients, who had received treatment with leuprorelin acetate injections, was carried out to calibrate the results of the discrete choice experiment.Results: Reductions in medical costs and loss of productivity for having one less injection in prostate cancer patients receiving leuprorelin acetate were JPY 5,670 and JPY 1,723, respectively. Intangible costs saved by using a 6-month depot formulation instead of a 3-month depot formulation for the injection of leuprorelin acetate were estimated to be JPY 19,872, including the values for a reduction in pain (JPY 3,131), injection site reactions (JPY 11,545), waiting time (JPY 9,479), and subtracting the value of medical consultation (JPY 4,283). The total cost reduction for having one less injection was JPY 27,265.Limitations: The respondents from the internet panel provided by a survey company are not necessarily a representative population of Japanese society.Conclusions: Leuprorelin acetate 6-month depot has an advantage in monetary value in the reduction in medical costs, loss of productivity, and intangible costs for having one less injection in prostate cancer patients compared with leuprorelin acetate 3-month depot. In the costs for treating with leuprorelin acetate, the percentage of intangible costs might not be negligible. The intangible costs will probably be actively evaluated to proceed to patient-centered healthcare in society.","[Goto, Rei] Keio Univ, Grad Sch Business Adm, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Uda, Akihito; Hiroi, Shinzo] Takeda Pharmaceut Co Ltd, Japan Med Affairs, Tokyo, Japan; [Iwasaki, Kosuke; Takashima, Kenta] Milliman, Tokyo, Japan; [Oya, Mototsugu] Keio Univ, Sch Med, Dept Urol, Tokyo, Japan",Keio University; Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd; Keio University,"Goto, R (通讯作者)，Keio Univ, Grad Sch Business Adm, Kohoku Ku, 4-1-1 Hiyoshi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2238526, Japan.",reigoto@kbs.keio.ac.jp,,,Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K03508] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited(Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This study was funded by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.,,25,5,5,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

To describe this interaction, a stream-based pedestrian fundamental diagram is used that relates density and walking speed in multidirectional flow. The proposed model is applied to two different case studies. The explicit modeling of anisotropy in walking speed is shown to significantly improve the ability of the model to reproduce empirically observed walking time distributions.

Materials and methods: This was a trial-based economic evaluation in 12 Lebanese hospital-based units. In total, 545 prevalent patients were cluster randomized to DD, trained hospital dietitian (THD), and existing practice (EP) groups. During Phase I (6 months), DD (n=116) received intensive education by DD trained on renal nutrition, THD (n=299) received care from trained hospital dietitians, and EP (n=130) received usual care from untrained hospital dietitians. Patients were followed-up during Phase II (6 months). Results: At baseline, EP had the lowest weekly hemodialysis time, and DD had the highest serum phosphorus and malnutrition-inflammation score. The additional costs of the intervention were low compared with the societal costs (DD: $76.7, $21,007.7; EP: $4.6, $18,675.4; THD: $17.4, $20,078.6, respectively). Between Phases I and II, DD showed the greatest decline in services use and societal costs (DD: -$2,364.0; EP: -$1,727.7; THD: -$1,105.7). At endline, DD experienced the highest decrease in adjusted serum phosphorus (DD: -0.32; EP: +0.16; THD: +0.04mg/dL), no difference in quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), and the highest societal costs. DD had a cost-effectiveness ratio of $7,853.6 per 1mg decrease in phosphorus, compared with EP; and was dominated by THD. Regarding QALY, DD was dominated by EP and THD. The results were sensitive to changes in key parameters. Limitations: The analysis depended on numerous assumptions. Interpreting the results is limited by the significant baseline differences in key parameters, suggestive of higher baseline societal costs in DD. Conclusions: DD yielded the greatest effectiveness and decrease in societal costs, but did not affect QALY. Regarding serum phosphorus, DD was likely to be cost-effective compared with EP, but had a low cost-effectiveness probability compared with THD. Regarding QALY, DD was not likely to be cost-effective. Assessing the long-term cost-effectiveness of DD, on similar groups, is recommended.","[Rizk, Rana; Hiligsmann, Mickael; Evers, Silvia M. A.

The majority of symptomatic patients eligible for frontline treatment are unfit for fludarabine based chemoimmunotherapy. Historical treatment includes chlorambucil (Chl), bendamustine/rituximab (BR), and chlorambucil/rituximab/ChlR combination. Clinical guidelines now recommend the use of novel agents, such as ibrutinib (Ibr), in both frontline and relapse settings and other novel agents, such as idelalisib (with rituximab), in relapse settings. Despite compelling clinical results for novel agents, follow-up in clinical trials is relatively short and, thus, the comparative long-term benefits are still unknown. Materials and methods: The authors developed a simulation model to generate treatment specific lifetime estimates of Overall Survival (OS) and Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) for treatment with BR, Chl, ChlR, and Ibr. Two potential clinical scenarios were modelled: with and without novel agents for treating CLL. The model was based on health states relating to first- and second-line progression-free survival (PFS), post-progression survival, and death. Results: Where novel agents were assumed unavailable, mean OS ranged from 5.4-8.5 years and QALYs from 3.5-6.1. Where novel agents were available, the mean OS increased to 10.0 years, with a corresponding increase in QALYs to 7.6. Frontline Ibr use followed by Physician's Choice, including novel agents at relapse, resulted in projected increase in OS of between 18% (1.5 years) and 85% (4.6 years), corresponding to a 25-117% increase in QALYs, compared with currently available traditional therapies. Limitations: The limitations of this analysis include immature OS data and the assumption of equivalent efficacy across all novel agents in terms of their impact on PFS and OS. Conclusions: The use of novel agents is predicted to yield substantive gains in predicted lifetime OS and QALY improvements compared to traditional therapies in CLL patients who are ineligible for fludarabine-based chemoimmunotherapy.","[Singh, Moushmi] ICON Hlth Econ, London, England; [Mealing, Stuart] ICON Hlth Econ, Abingdon, Oxon, England; [Baculea, Simona; Cote, Sarah] Janssen Cilag, 50-100 Holmers Farm Way, High Wycombe HP12 4DP, Bucks, England; [Whelan, Jo] Textpharm Ltd, Oxford, England",ICON plc; ICON plc; Johnson & Johnson,"Baculea, S (通讯作者)，Janssen Cilag, 50-100 Holmers Farm Way, High Wycombe HP12 4DP, Bucks, England.",sbaculea@ITS.JNJ.com,,"Mealing, Stuart/0000-0002-2564-1440",Janssen Pharmaceuticals,Janssen Pharmaceuticals(Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson USAJanssen Biotech Inc),The study was funded by Janssen Pharmaceuticals.,,40,4,4,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Methods: A time series study was conducted using the Premier Hospital Perspective (R) Database (Premier database) for elective IVHR identified by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth revision, Clinical Modification codes. IVHR procedure volumes and costs were determined for inpatient, outpatient, minimally invasive surgery (MIS), and open procedures from January 2008-June 2015. Initial visit costs were inflation-adjusted to 2015 US dollars. Median costs were used to analyze variation by site of care and payer. Quantile regression on median costs was conducted in covariate-adjusted models. Cost impact of potential outpatient migration was estimated from a Medicare perspective. Results: During the study period, the trend for outpatient procedures in obese and non-obese populations increased. Inpatient and outpatient MIS procedures experienced a steady growth in adoption over their open counterparts. Overall median costs increased over time, and inpatient costs were often double outpatient costs. An economic model demonstrated that a 5% shift of inpatient procedures to outpatient MIS procedures can have a cost surplus of similar to US $1.8 million for provider or a cost-saving impact of US $1.7 million from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services perspective. Limitations: The study was limited by information in the Premier database. No data were available for IVHR cases performed in free-standing ambulatory surgery centers or federal healthcare facilities. Conclusion: Volumes and costs of outpatient IVHRs and MIS procedures increased from January 2008-June 2015. Median costs were significantly higher for inpatients than outpatients, and the difference was particularly evident for obese patients. A substantial cost difference between inpatient and outpatient MIS cases indicated a financial benefit for shifting from inpatient to outpatient MIS.","[Song, Chao; Liu, Emelline; Tackett, Scott] Intuit Surg Inc, 1020 Kifer Rd, Sunnyvale, CA 94086 USA; [Shi, Lizheng] Tulane Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth Management & Policy, New Orleans, LA USA; [Marcus, Daniel] Providence St Johns Hlth Ctr, Marina Del Rey, CA USA","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.; Tulane University; John Wayne Cancer Institute","Song, C (通讯作者)，Intuit Surg Inc, 1020 Kifer Rd, Sunnyvale, CA 94086 USA.",chao.song@intusurg.com,"shi, li/HSF-9608-2023",,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

It is shown for a large class of scheduling preferences that if users have continuously distributed characteristics, the network accumulation at equilibrium is a continuous function of time. With alpha - beta - gamma preferences and under certain conditions, a partial First - In, First-Out (FIFO) pattern emerges at equilibrium among early and late users. This FIFO pattern is strict only within families of users having heterogeneous trip lengths and identical preferences, or vice versa.

The considered problem is an integration of three interconnected sub-problems from different planning levels: the strategic fleet sizing and mix problem, the tactical voyage planning problem, and the operational stochastic backhaul cargo canvassing problem. To obtain the optimal solution of the problem, this paper provides a two-step algorithmic scheme. In the first step, the stochastic backhaul cargo canvassing problem is solved by a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm, leading to optimal canvassing strategies for all feasible voyages of all ships. In the second step, a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model that jointly solves the fleet sizing and mix problem and the voyage planning problem is formulated using the results from the first step. To efficiently solve the proposed MIP model, this paper develops a tailored Benders decomposition method. Finally, extensive numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed models and solution methods for practical instances. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Three innovative integrated optimization approaches for real-time traffic management that inherently include train control are developed to deliver both a train dispatching solution (including train routes, orders, departure and arrival times at passing stations) and a train control solution (i.e., train speed trajectories). Train speed is considered variable, and the blocking time of a train on a block section dynamically depends on its real speed. To formulate the integrated problem, we first propose an MINLP problem (PNLP), which is solved by a two-level approach. This MINLP problem is then reformulated by approximating the nonlinear terms with piecewise affine functions, resulting in an MILP problem (PewA). Moreover, we consider a preprocessing method to generate the possible speed profile options for each train on each block section, one of which is further selected by a proposed MILP problem (PTspo) with respect to safety, capacity, and speed consistency constraints. This problem is solved by means of a custom-designed two-step approach, in order to speed up the solving procedure. Numerical experiments are conducted using data from the Dutch railway network to comparatively evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the three proposed approaches with heterogeneous traffic. According to the experimental results, the MILP approach (PTspo) yields the best overall performance within the required computation time. The experimental results demonstrate the benefits of the integration, i.e., train delays can be reduced by managing train speed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The manufacturer's incentive provision exhibits a threshold policy.

Notwithstanding, the current prevalence of ICE creates a lock-in state that averts the adoption of alternative and environmental friendly technologies, bringing forth a social dilemma. Here we investigate the feasibility of escaping the present lock-in state by studying possible incentive mechanisms involving, simultaneously, governments (public), companies (private) and consumers (civil). Resorting to evolutionary game theory (EGT), we develop a theoretical model grounded on the strategic interactions between players from the different sectors, whose co-evolving choices influence (and are influenced by) different policies and social incentives. Our findings suggest that i) public regulation is necessary but not sufficient for guaranteeing full EV adoption; ii) public-civil synergies are essential; iii) demand for EVs preceding supply is most efficient, providing companies with the needed incentives to counterweigh infrastructure investments; and iv) full adoption of EVs requires coordination between the three sectors to emerge, particularly when changes are initiated by the public sector.

The total demand dissatisfaction of a bike-sharing system in this study is defined as the sum of the difference between the bike deficiency and unloading quantity of each station in the system. Two service times are considered: the total service time and the maximum route duration of the fleet. To reduce the computation time to solve the loading and unloading sub-problem of the BRP, this study examines a novel set of loading and unloading strategies and further proves them to be optimal for a given route. This set of strategies is then embedded into an enhanced artificial bee colony algorithm to solve the BRP. The numerical results demonstrate that a larger fleet size may not lead to a lower total service time but can effectively lead to a lower maximum route duration at optimality. The results also illustrate the trade-offs between the two service times, between total demand dissatisfaction and total service time, and between the number of operating vehicles provided and the TDD. Moreover, the results demonstrate that the optimal values of the two service times can increase with the TDD and introducing an upper bound on one service time can reduce the optimal value of the other service time.

The MDVTRSP consists of finding a new schedule given that a severe disruption occurred in previously scheduled trips very quickly, simultaneously minimizing the transportation costs and the deviations from the original plan. Although several mathematical formulations and solution methods have been developed for the robust MDVTRSP, the real time MDVTRSP is still unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a formulation of the problem and develop a heuristic solution method, employing time-space network, truncated column generation, and preprocessing procedures. The solution method has been implemented in several algorithm variants, combining different developed preprocessing methods. Computational experiments on randomly generated instances were performed to evaluate the performance of the developed algorithms. The best solutions concerning efficiency and efficacy were obtained by the variants considering state space reductions to accelerate the convergence process of the column generation. Solutions were obtained very quickly (in less than 150 seconds for large instances, considering up to 2500 trips, eight depots, and one breakdown. The developed heuristics also presented a good behavior for several simultaneous disruptions, solving the problem with a little increase (less than 8.5%, on average) in the required CPU time. A case study using data from a real-life small instance in Brazil also demonstrated the efficiency and efficacy of the approach when compared with manual planning strategies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In Kenya, most patients currently pay out of pocket for treatment, and those who are insured are generally not covered for the full costs of treatment. This places a considerable burden on households if family members develop cancer. However, the actual cost of cancer treatment in Kenya is unknown. Such an analysis is essential to better allocate resources as Kenya strives towards universal healthcare. Objectives: To evaluate the economic burden of treating cancer patients. Method: Descriptive cross-sectional cost of illness study in the leading teaching and referral hospital in Kenya, with data collected from the hospital files of sampled adult patients for treatment during 2016. Results: In total, 412 patient files were reviewed, of which 63.4% (n=261) were female and 36.6% (n=151) male. The cost of cancer care is highly dependent on the modality. Most reviewed patients had surgery, chemotherapy and palliative care. The cost of cancer therapy varied with the type of cancer. Patients on chemotherapy alone cost an average of KES 138,207 (USD 1364.3); while those treated with surgery cost an average of KES 128,207 (1265.6), and those on radiotherapy KES 119,036 (1175.1). Some patients had a combination of all three, costing, on average, KES 333,462 (3291.8) per patient during the year. Conclusion: The cost of cancer treatment in Kenya depends on the type of cancer, the modality, cost of medicines and the type of inpatient admission. The greatest contributors are currently the cost of medicines and inpatient admissions. This pilot study can inform future initiatives among the government as well as private and public insurance companies to increase available resources, and better allocate available resources, to more effectively treat patients with cancer in Kenya. The authors will be monitoring developments and conducting further research.","[Atieno, Omondi Michelle; Opanga, Sylvia] Univ Nairobi, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut & Pharm Practice, Nairobi, Kenya; [Martin, Antony; Godman, Brian] Univ Liverpool, Hlth Econ Ctr, Management Sch, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Martin, Antony] Innovat Ctr, HCD Econ, Daresbury, England; [Kurdi, Amanj; Godman, Brian] Univ Strathclyde, Strathclyde Inst Pharm & Biomed Sci, 161 Cathedral St, Glasgow G4 0RE, Lanark, Scotland; [Kurdi, Amanj] Hawler Med Univ, Dept Pharmacol, Coll Pharm, Erbil, Iraq; [Godman, Brian] Karolinska Inst, Div Clin Pharmacol, Karolinska, Stockholm, Sweden; [Godman, Brian] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, George Town, Malaysia",University of Nairobi; University of Liverpool; University of Strathclyde; Hawler Medical University; Karolinska Institutet; Universiti Sains Malaysia,"Godman, B (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Strathclyde Inst Pharm & Biomed Sci, 161 Cathedral St, Glasgow G4 0RE, Lanark, Scotland.",brian.godman@strath.ac.uk,"Godman, Brian/R-8897-2019; Kurdi, Amanj/P-1217-2017","Kurdi, Amanj/0000-0001-5036-1988; Martin, Antony/0000-0003-4383-6038",,,,,43,33,33,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The experiment evaluated the effects of tillage practices and nitrogen fertilizer regimes on the yield of short-season maize Dorke SR variety for two landscape positions (upslope and footslope). A stripe-split plot design with four replicates at each of the three sites was used. Tillage practices (contour and along-slope ridges) were applied in the main plots, whereas nitrogen treatments (no nitrogen, 0 kg N ha(-1); moderate nitrogen, 60 kg N ha(-1); and high nitrogen, 120 kg N ha(-1)) were applied in the subplots of each landscape position. Both potassium and phosphorus fertilizers were applied at optimum rates. Grain yield and growth parameters showed diverse responses to the treatments across sites. The effects of slope position and nitrogen fertilizer regime on grain yield were significant (p < 0.05) across sites; the grain yield at the footslope position was 25% higher than that at the upslope, and the high nitrogen treatment resulted in a 140% increase in grain yield compared to no nitrogen condition. An insignificant (p < 0.05) increase in grain yield was observed for sites with contour tillage compared to sites with along-slope ridges. Leaf area index was not significantly (p < 0.05) affected by the treatments during tasseling across sites, and the values were consistent with increasing nitrogen levels. These results suggest that to optimize maize yield under subhumid conditions, farmers should concentrate maize cultivation in low-lying areas and follow the recommended fertilizer application regimes given current climate variability.","[Danso, Isaac] CSIR, Oil Palm Res Inst, POB 74, Kusi, Ghana; [Danso, Isaac; Gaiser, Thomas; Webber, Heidi; Ewert, Frank] Univ Bonn, Crop Sci Grp, Inst Crop Sci & Resource Conservat, Katzenburgweg 5, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Naab, Jesse] WASCAL, 06 BP 9507 06, Ouaga 06, Burkina Faso",University of Bonn,"Danso, I (通讯作者)，CSIR, Oil Palm Res Inst, POB 74, Kusi, Ghana.;Danso, I (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Crop Sci Grp, Inst Crop Sci & Resource Conservat, Katzenburgweg 5, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",danso60@yahoo.com,"Gaiser, Thomas/AAD-6326-2021","Gaiser, Thomas/0000-0002-5820-2364",Federal Ministry of Education and Research through the West African Science Service Center on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL),Federal Ministry of Education and Research through the West African Science Service Center on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL),"The research described in this chapter was funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research through the West African Science Service Center on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL).

Extending Newell's car following model to describe the transition from free-flow to congested regimes, two elements of breakdown, trigger and propagation, are derived in terms of vehicle headway. Combining these elements, a general breakdown probability is derived in terms of various parameters related to driver behavior and traffic conditions - other than flow - that can be treated as constants or stochastic with probability distributions. The proposed model is validated with real data. It was found that the theoretical breakdown probability distribution accords well with the empirical counterpart within reasonable ranges of parameter values. Our model suggests that the breakdown probability (i) increases with flow (both mainline and merging) as expected, and the merging spacing, (ii) decreases with the merging speed and aggressive driver characteristics, and interestingly, (iii) increases with the deviation in headway. A proactive traffic control method to achieve uniform headway is developed considering low penetration rates of connected automated vehicle technologies.

The Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases recommends revaccination for older adults who received primary vaccination >= 5 years earlier. The cost-effectiveness of adding revaccination and/or continuing catch-up vaccination in the NIP was evaluated from the public payer perspective in Japan. Methods: The Markov model included five health states: no pneumococcal disease, invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD), non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia (NBPP), post-meningitis sequelae, and death. Cohorts of adults aged 65-95 were followed until age 100 or death: 2014 cohort (aged 65-95, vaccinated: 2014); 2019 cohort (aged 65: 2019); and 2019 catch-up cohort (aged 70-100: 2019, unvaccinated: 2014). Strategies included: (1) vaccinate 2014 and 2019 cohorts; (2) vaccinate 2014 and 2019 cohorts and revaccinate both; (3) strategy 1 and vaccinate 2019 catch-up cohort; (4) strategy 2 and vaccinate 2019 catch-up cohort; and (5) strategy 4 and revaccinate 2019 catch-up cohort. Parameters were retrieved from global and Japanese sources, costs and QALYs discounted at 2%, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) estimated. Results: Strategy 1 had the highest number of IPD and NBPP cases, and strategy 5 the lowest. Strategies 3-5 dominated strategy 1 and strategy 2 was cost-effective compared to strategy 1 (ICER: (sic)1,622,153 per QALY gained). At a willingness-to-pay threshold of V5 million per QALY gained, strategy 2 was cost-effective and strategies 3-5 were cost-saving compared to strategy 1. Conclusions: Strategies including revaccination, catch-up, or both were cost-effective or cost-saving in comparison to no revaccination and no catch-up. Results can inform future vaccine policies and programs in Japan.","[Jiang, Yiling] Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd, Hoddesdon, Herts, England; [Yang, Xiaoqin; Petigara, Tanaz] Merck & Co Inc, 126 E Lincoln Ave, Kenilworth, NJ USA; [Taniguchi, Kazuko; Abe, Machiko] MSD KK, Tokyo, Japan",Merck & Company; Merck & Company; Merck & Company,"Yang, XQ (通讯作者)，Merck & Co Inc, 126 E Lincoln Ave,Mailstop RY32-211, Rahway, NJ 07065 USA.",xiaoqin.yang@merck.com,,"Taniguchi, Kazuko/0000-0001-7706-0157","Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ","Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ(Merck & Company)","This research was funded by Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ.",,52,8,10,1,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The high prevalence of obesity generates a justified need to identify cost-effective weight loss approaches from a payer's perspective. Within the variety of weight management techniques, OPTIFAST is a clinically recognized and scientifically proven total meal replacement Low Calorie Diet that provides meaningful results in terms of weight loss and reduction in comorbidities. The objective of this study is assess potential cost-savings of the OPTIFAST program in the US, as compared to no intervention and pharmacotherapy. Methods: An event-driven decision analytic model was used to estimate payer's cost-savings from reimbursement of the 1-year OPTIFAST program over 3 years in the US. The analysis was performed for the broad population of obese persons (BMI >30 kg/m(2)) undergoing the OPTIFAST program vs liraglutide 3 mg, naltrexone/bupropion and vs no intervention. The model included the risk of complications related to increased BMI. Data sources included published literature, clinical trials, official US price/tariff lists, and national population statistics. The primary perspective was that of a US payer; costs were provided in 2016 US dollars. Results: OPTIFAST leads over a period of 3 years to cost-savings of USD 9,285 per class I and II obese patient (BMI 30-39.9 kg/m(2)) as compared to liraglutide and USD 685 as compared to naltrexone/bupropion. In the same time perspective, the OPTIFAST program leads to a reduction of cost of obesity complications of USD 1,951 as compared to no intervention, with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of USD 6,475 per QALY. Scenario analyses also show substantial cost-savings in patients with class III obesity (BMI >= 40.0 kg/m(2)) and patients with obesity (BMI = 30-39.9 kg/m(2)) and type 2 diabetes vs all three previous comparators and bariatric surgery. Conclusions: Reimbursing OPTIFAST leads to meaningful cost-savings for US payers as compared with no intervention and liraglutide and naltrexone/bupropion in obese patients. Similar results can be expected in matching healthcare settings of other countries. Moreover, OPTIFAST has additional clinical and economic advantages through very low complication and adverse events rates.","[Nuijten, Mark] A2M, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Marczewska, Agnieszka; Torres, Krysmaru Araujo; Rasouli, Bahareh; Perugini, Moreno] Nestle Hlth Sci, Vevey, Switzerland; [Rasouli, Bahareh] Karolinska Inst, Inst Environm Med, Stockholm, Sweden",Nestle SA; Karolinska Institutet,"Nuijten, M (通讯作者)，Dorpsstr 75, NL-1546 LG Amsterdam, Netherlands.",mark@a2m.nl,"Nuijten, Mark/AAN-6924-2021",,Nestle Health Science,Nestle Health Science(Nestle SA),The study was funded by Nestle Health Science.,,54,9,9,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

CECAR-Africa aimed to contribute to filling gaps in resilience assessment whilst proposing tested, practical and sustainable resilience enhancement strategies for use in socio-ecological regions with a special focus on flood and drought-prone rural communities and households in semiarid Northern Ghana.","[Saito, Osamu] United Nations Univ, Inst Adv Study Sustainabil, UNU IAS, Tokyo, Japan; [Boafo, Yaw Agyeman] Univ Tokyo, Integrated Res Syst Sustainabil Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Jasaw, Godfred Seidu] Univ Dev Studies, Fac Planning & Land Management, Wa, Ghana",United Nations University; University of Tokyo; University for Development Studies,"Saito, O (通讯作者)，United Nations Univ, Inst Adv Study Sustainabil, UNU IAS, Tokyo, Japan.",saito@unu.edu; yboafo@gmail.com,"Saito, Osamu/AAU-1495-2021; Saito, Osamu/AAH-6091-2020; Boafo, Yaw Agyeman/R-8277-2019","Saito, Osamu/0000-0002-0697-9593; Boafo, Yaw Agyeman/0000-0003-1430-7655",,,,,15,1,1,1,5,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG E, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN",2197-7348,,978-981-10-4796-1; 978-981-10-4794-7,SCI SUSTAIN SOC,,,2018,,,,,,,3,9,,10.1007/978-981-10-4796-1_1,0.0,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Ecology; Environmental Studies; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography,BK9QR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000444861300001,0

Though there are a plethora of early warning information channels, the challenge often lies in identifying effective communication tool that would spur the vulnerable community into action and its mediating mechanisms. This is against the backdrop that prior studies indicate that information does not automatically lead to action without individual's personal interpretation. Trust is thus seen as a key mediator between the sources of information and individual's disaster response rate. Based on our field studies from Northern Ghana, we empirically explore the relationship between trust, risk perception, and the acceptance of preventive actions by comparing two models of trust: the causal chain and the associationist view. We examine whether the relationship between trust in information sources and the disaster-preventive action is mediated by the risk perception (i.e., the causal chain model) or whether the risk perception and trust in information sources are expressions of a more general attitude toward disaster preparedness (i.e., the associationist view model). Our findings challenge the conventional causal chain model and suggest that trust does not necessarily influence the acceptance of a disaster-preventing actions (e.g., evacuation). Rather, trust is more of a reflection of the individual's general attitude toward disaster preparedness, which is shaped by his/her cultural norms.","[Samaddar, Subhajyoti; Yokomatsu, Muneta; Ishikawa, Hirohiko] Kyoto Univ, Disaster Prevent Res Inst, Kyoto, Japan; [Dayour, Frederick] Univ Surrey, Dept Hospitality & Tourism Management, Guildford, Surrey, England; [Oteng-Ababio, Martin] Univ Ghana, Dept Geog & Resource Dev, Accra, Ghana; [Dzivenu, Togbiga] Ctr Disaster Res & Educ, Wa, Ghana",Kyoto University; University of Surrey; University of Ghana,"Samaddar, S (通讯作者)，Kyoto Univ, Disaster Prevent Res Inst, Kyoto, Japan.",samaddar@imdr.dpri.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Ishikawa, Hirohiko/AAF-2725-2020",,,,,,40,4,6,0,8,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG E, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN",2197-7348,,978-981-10-4796-1; 978-981-10-4794-7,SCI SUSTAIN SOC,,,2018,,,,,,,247,264,,10.1007/978-981-10-4796-1_14,0.0,,,18,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Ecology; Environmental Studies; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography,BK9QR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000444861300014,0

The support of the distribution is specified as a high-dimensional grid over the coefficient space, with equal or unequal intervals between successive points along the same dimension; the location of each point on the grid and the probability mass at that point are model parameters that need to be estimated. The framework does not require the analyst to specify the shape of the distribution prior to model estimation, but can approximate any multivariate probability distribution function to any arbitrary degree of accuracy. The grid with unequal intervals, in particular, offers greater flexibility than existing multivariate nonparametric specifications, while requiring the estimation of a small number of additional parameters. An expectation maximization algorithm is developed for the estimation of these models. Multiple synthetic datasets and a case study on travel mode choice behavior are used to demonstrate the value of the model framework and estimation algorithm. Compared to extant models that incorporate random taste heterogeneity through continuous mixture distributions, the proposed model provides better out of-sample predictive ability. Findings reveal significant differences in willingness to pay measures between the proposed model and extant specifications. The case study further demonstrates the ability of the proposed model to endogenously recover patterns of attribute non-attendance and choice set formation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This distributional assumption offers a closed-form likelihood expression when the utility maximization principle is applied to model choice behaviors. As a result, model coefficients can be easily estimated using the standard maximum likelihood estimation method. However, maximum likelihood estimators are consistent and efficient only if distributional assumptions on the random error terms are valid. It is therefore critical to test the validity of underlying distributional assumptions on the error terms that form the basis of parameter estimation and policy evaluation. In this paper, a practical yet statistically rigorous method is proposed to test the validity of the distributional assumption on the random components of utility functions in both the multinomial logit (MNL) model and multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) model. Based on a semi-nonparametric approach, a closed-form likelihood function that nests the MNL or MDCEV model being tested is derived. The proposed method allows traditional likelihood ratio tests to be used to test violations of the standard Gumbel distribution assumption. Simulation experiments are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed test yields acceptable Type-I and Type-II error probabilities at commonly available sample sizes. The test is then applied to three real-world discrete and discrete-continuous choice models. For all three models, the proposed test rejects the validity of the standard Gumbel distribution in most utility functions, calling for the development of robust choice models that overcome adverse effects of violations of distributional assumptions on the error terms in random utility functions.

We discuss the problem of finding optimal hyperpaths under such conditions assuming a cost vector with a limited number of marginal decreasing costs depending on the number of links already traversed. We illustrate that these non-additive costs lead to violation of Bellman's optimality principle which in turn means that standard procedures to obtain optimal destination specific hyperpath trees are not feasible. To overcome the problem we introduce the concepts of a travel history vector and critical vs fixed nodes. The former records the expected number of traversed links until a node, and the latter distinguishes nodes for which the fare cost can be determined deterministically. With this we develop a 2-stage solution approach. In the first stage we test whether the optimal hyperpath can be obtained by backward search. If this is not the case, we propose a selective hyperpath generation to a (small) number of critical nodes and combine this with standard hyperpath search. We illustrate our approach by applying it to the Sioux Falls network showing that even for link cost functions (fare stages) with large step changes we are able to obtain all optimal hyperpaths in a reasonable computational time.

It aims to assign flights to gates according to their arrival and departure times. To tackle flight delays in airports, we propose a robust airport gate assignment (RAGA) to minimize the (1 - alpha)-quantile of the total real-time overlap between consecutive flights at the same gate, namely, the total gate blockage time, so that the realized total gate blockage time is worse than its quantile with a probability, at most a. Given any constant, we develop an asymptotically tight upper bound for the violation probability that total gate blockage time is worse than the constant. Based on the upper bound, a solution-dependent uncertainty budget is introduced to develop a robust counterpart (RCP) for the RAGA. We further develop a solution technique for the RCP by transforming the problem into a finite number of tractable binary programmings. An empirical study of the Shuangliu International Airport (CTU) indicates that our proposed robust approach for AGA outperforms existing methods. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Overall, the purpose of the study is to actualize a multi-resolution strategy for a group-based adaptive signal-control method and establish a microscopic simulation platform to implement the proposed methodology and test its effectiveness. To actualize the global proactive-optimization scheme, in this paper, a rolling-horizon approach to the temporal and spatial variables, signal structures for four-arm intersections, and discrete directional search methods is applied using the developed mathematical framework. The formulation of the group-based max-pressure policy is realized using the logical form of the local reactive-control policy at a typical directional three-lane, four-arm approach to an isolated intersection. The integrated group based adaptive traffic-signal control is actualized using VISSIM, Fortran, and VBA based on the developed tactical and local levels of signal timing optimization. The results of the computer simulations and the case study presented in this paper show that the integrated group-based adaptive traffic-signal-control logic outperforms the other methods over a wide range of traffic conditions, from free-flowing traffic to extreme congestion. Moreover, the proposed models perform much better than the existing fixed-signal plan and the actuated signal-control in asymmetric traffic conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Using probabilistic knowledge about future freights, the LSP's objective is to minimize costs over a multi-period horizon. We propose a look ahead planning method using Approximate Dynamic Programming. Experiments show that our approach reduces costs up to 25.5% compared to a single-period optimization approach.

Toward this goal, we propose what we call the P2P ride exchange mechanism to increase matching rate and customer retention in a ridesharing system. This mechanism gives riders the opportunity to purchase other riders' itineraries while it provides suitable alternative rides to the sellers, thus increasing the service rate in a ridesharing system. The proposed mechanism aims to maximize expected user surplus, is robust towards selfish user manipulation, and has very low information requirements. Using numerical experiments, we demonstrate what type of ridesharing systems can benefit the most from P2P ride exchange. Furthermore, we study the impact of customer flexibility on the rate of exchange. If implemented properly, P2P ride exchange can effectively increase the number of served riders and enhance customer loyalty by engaging customers in the ride-matching process. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This exploratory analysis assessed healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) in patients treated with idarucizumab, a specific reversal agent for dabigatran etexilate. Materials and methods: RE-VERSE AD((TM)) (NCT02104947), a prospective, multi-center open-label study, is evaluating idarucizumab for dabigatran reversal in patients with serious bleeding (Group A) or undergoing emergency surgery/procedures (Group B). HCRU outcome measures evaluated in the first 90 patients enrolled were use of blood products and pro-hemostatic agents, length of stay (LOS) in hospital, and LOS in intensive care unit (ICU). Results: Blood products or pro-hemostatic agents were given to 63% (32/51) of patients in Group A and 23% (9/39) of patients in Group B on the day of/day after surgery. An overnight hospital stay was reported for 82% (42/51) of patients in Group A with median LOS=7 (range=1-71) bed-days. For Group B, 92% (36/39) had an overnight hospital stay with a median LOS=9 (range=1-92) bed-days. In Group A, 17 patients were admitted to the ICU for at least 1 day with median LOS=4 (range=1-44) days; in Group B the number was 15 with median LOS=2 (range=1-92) days. Limitations: The lack of a control group and the small patient numbers limit the strength of the conclusions. Conclusions: The use of idarucizumab may simplify emergency management of dabigatran-treated patients with life-threatening bleeds and reduce perioperative complications in patients undergoing emergency surgery.","[Pollack, Charles V., Jr.] Thomas Jefferson Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA; [Bernstein, Richard] Northwestern Univ, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Dubiel, Robert; Reilly, Paul] Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceut Inc, 90 E Ridge POB 368, Ridgefield, CT 06877 USA; [Gruenenfelder, Fredrik] Boehringer Ingelheim Corp, Ingelheim, Germany; [Huisman, Menno V.] Leiden Univ, Med Ctr, Leiden, Netherlands; [Kam, Chak-Wah] Tuen Mun Hosp, Tuen Mun, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Kleine, Eva] Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co KG, Ingelheim, Germany; [Levy, Jerrold H.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Durham, NC USA; [Sellke, Frank W.] Rhode Isl Hosp, Brown Med Sch, Providence, RI USA; [Steiner, Thorsten] Klinikum Frankfurt Hochst, Klin Neurol, Frankfurt, Germany; [Steiner, Thorsten] Univ Klinikum, Heidelberg, Germany; [Ustyugova, Anastasia] Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH & Co KG, Ingelheim, Germany; [Weitz, Jeffrey I.] McMaster Univ, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Weitz, Jeffrey I.] Atherosclerosis Res Inst, Hamilton, ON, Canada",Jefferson University; Northwestern University; Boehringer Ingelheim; Boehringer Ingelheim; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University; Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC); Tuen Mun Hospital; Boehringer Ingelheim; Duke University; Lifespan Health Rhode Island; Rhode Island Hospital; Brown University; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Boehringer Ingelheim; McMaster University,"Pollack, CV (通讯作者)，Thomas Jefferson Univ, Dept Emergency Med, 1020 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA.",cvpollack@gmail.com,"Dr. Steiner, Thorsten/L-2868-2018; Weitz, Jeffrey/AAD-1929-2019","Dr. Steiner, Thorsten/0000-0002-5080-8222; Weitz, Jeffrey/0000-0002-1092-7550; Kam, CW/0000-0002-4463-4115",Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH Co.

Aims: To compare the cost-effectiveness of current DMTs for patients with RRMS in the US. Materials and methods: A Markov model predicting RRMS course following initiation of a DMT was created comparing outcomes (e.g. relapses, disease progression) and costs of natalizumab (NTZ), dimethyl fumarate (DMF), and peginterferon beta-1a (PEG) with fingolimod (FIN), glatiramer acetate (GA, 20mg daily), and subcutaneous interferon beta-1a (IFN, 44mcg), respectively, over 10 years. RRMS and secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) EDSS state transitions were predicted in 3-month cycles in which patients were at risk of death, relapse, or discontinuation. Upon DMT discontinuation, natural history progression and relapse rates were applied. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated for the cost per relapse avoided, relapse-free years gained, progression avoided, and progression-free years gained. The impact of model parameters on outcomes was evaluated via one-way sensitivity analyses. Results: Costs ranged from $561,177 (NTZ) to $616,251 (GA). NTZ, DMF, and PEG were dominant (less costly and more effective) compared to FIN, GA, and IFN, respectively, for all ICERs. Variability in drug costs and parameters that affected drug cost accrual (e.g. discontinuation rates and the decision to drop out after SPMS conversion) had a considerable impact on ICERs. Limitations: Several simplifying assumptions were made that may represent potential limitations of this analysis (e.g. a constant treatment effect over time was assumed). Conclusions: The results from this analysis suggest that the NTZ, DMF, and PEG are cost-effective DMT choices compared to FIN, GA, and IFN, respectively. The actual impact on a particular plan will vary based on drug pricing and other factors affecting drug cost accrual.","[Bozkaya, Duygu; Migliaccio-Walle, Kristen] Xcenda, 4114 Woodlands Pkwy,Suite 500, Palm Harbor, FL 34685 USA; [Livingston, Terrie; Odom, Tanner] Biogen, Weston, MA USA","AmerisourceBergen Corporation; Xcenda, LLC; Biogen","Bozkaya, D (通讯作者)，Xcenda, 4114 Woodlands Pkwy,Suite 500, Palm Harbor, FL 34685 USA.",duygu.bozkaya@xcenda.com,,,Biogen,Biogen(Biogen),This study was funded in full by Biogen.,,30,23,28,0,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Moderate-to-severe disease is often treated with biologics requiring infusion therapy, adding incremental costs beyond drug costs. This study evaluates US hospital-based infusion services costs for treatment of UC or CD patients receiving infliximab or vedolizumab therapy. Materials and methods: A model was developed, estimating annual costs of providing monitored infusions using an activity-based costing framework approach. Multiple sources (published literature, treatment product inserts) informed base-case model input estimates. Results: The total modeled per patient infusion therapy costs in Year 1 with infliximab and vedolizumab was $38,782 and $41,320, respectively, and Year 2+, $49,897 and $36,197, respectively. Drug acquisition cost was the largest total costs driver (90-93%), followed by costs associated with hospitalbased infusion provision: labor (53-56%, non-drug costs), allocated overhead (23%, non-drug costs), non-labor (23%, non-drug costs), and laboratory (7-10%, non-drug costs). Limitations: Limitations included reliance on published estimates, base-case cost estimates infusion drug, and supplies, not accounting for volume pricing, assumption of a small hospital infusion center, and that, given the model adopts the hospital perspective, costs to the patient were not included in infusion administration cost base-case estimates. Conclusions: This model is an early step towards a framework to fully analyze infusion therapies' associated costs. Given the lack of published data, it would be beneficial for hospital administrators to assess total costs and trade-offs with alternative means of providing biologic therapies. This analysis highlights the value to hospital administrators of assessing cost associated with infusion patient mix to make more informed resource allocation decisions. As the landscape for reimbursement changes, tools for evaluating the costs of infusion therapy may help hospital administrators make informed choices and weigh trade-offs associated with providing infusion services for IBD patients.","[Afzali, Anita] Univ Washington, Harborview Med Ctr, 325 Ninth Ave Box 359773, Seattle, WA 98104 USA; [Ogden, Kristine; Friedman, Michael L.] ICON Plc, Hlth Econ, San Francisco, CA USA; [Chao, Jingdong; Wang, Anthony] AbbVie, N Chicago, IL USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Harborview Medical Center; ICON plc; AbbVie,"Afzali, A (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Harborview Med Ctr, 325 Ninth Ave Box 359773, Seattle, WA 98104 USA.",anitaa@medicine.washington.edu,"Wang, Anthony/GSD-5456-2022; wang, ao/HJG-5888-2022",,"AbbVie, Inc.","AbbVie, Inc.(Abbott LaboratoriesAbbVie)","Full funding for this research was provided by AbbVie, Inc.

Materials and methods: A lifetime Markov model was developed to compare the effects of denosumab and zoledronic acid on costs (including drug costs and administration, patient management, SREs, and adverse events), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios from a national payer perspective. Different discount rates, time horizons, SRE rates, distributions, and nature (asymptomatic vs all SREs), and the inclusion of treatment discontinuation were considered in scenario analyses. The robustness of the model was tested using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: Across tumor types, denosumab was associated with fewer SREs, improved QALYs, and higher total costs over a lifetime. The incremental cost per QALY gained for denosumab vs zoledronic acid was 382,673 CZK for prostate cancer, 408,450 CZK for breast cancer, and 608,133 CZK for OST. Incremental costs per SRE avoided for the same tumor type were 54,007 CZK, 51,765 CZK, and 94,426 CZK, respectively. In scenario analyses, the results remained similar to baseline, when different discount rates and time horizons were considered. At a non-official willingness-to-pay threshold of 1.2 million CZK, the probabilities of denosumab being cost-effective vs zoledronic acid were 0.64, 0.67, and 0.49 for prostate cancer, breast cancer, and OST, respectively. Limitations: The SRE rates used were obtained from clinical trials; studies suggest rates may be higher in clinical practice. Additional evidence on real-world SRE rates could further improve the accuracy of the modeling. Conclusions: Compared with zoledronic acid, denosumab provides a cost-effective treatment option for the prevention of SREs in patients with prostate cancer, breast cancer, and OST in the Czech Republic.","[Cristino, Joaquim; Giannopoulou, Christina; Lothgren, Mickael] Amgen Europe GmbH, Dammstr 23, CH-6301 Zug, Switzerland; [Finek, Jindrich] Pilsen Fac Hosp, Clin Oncol & Radiotherapy FN Plzni, Plzen, Czech Republic; [Jandova, Petra; Brezina, Tomas] Amgen Sro, Prague, Czech Republic; [Kolek, Martin; Pasztor, Balint] Oaks Consulting, Prague, Czech Republic; [Qian, Yi] Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320 USA",Amgen; AMGEN Europe; Amgen,"Lothgren, M (通讯作者)，Amgen Europe GmbH, Dammstr 23, CH-6301 Zug, Switzerland.",mickaell@amgen.com,"qian, yi/HZH-4175-2023","Finek, Jindrich/0000-0002-7750-9345",Amgen (Europe) GmbH,Amgen (Europe) GmbH(Amgen),This research was funded by Amgen (Europe) GmbH.,,51,10,11,0,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Per-patient per-month (PPPM) and cumulative costs from 3 months pre-diagnosis to various post-diagnosis follow-up time points were calculated. Multivariable analyses were used to estimate adjusted mean cost and identify contributors of cost.Results: The study included 2,921 subjects (median age=56 years; 60% male). After diagnosis, the median (interquartile range, IQR) number of inpatient, emergency department, and outpatient visits were 2 (1-4), 1 (1-3), and 19 (13-27); median (IQR) length of stay per hospitalization was 5 (3-9) days. Mean total cumulative costs per patient from 3 months pre-diagnosis to 12 months and to 5 years post-diagnosis were $201,749 (197,490-206,024) and $268,031 (262,877-274,416). Mean (SD) PPPM costs were $818 (1,128) and $7,394 (8,676) pre- and post-GBM diagnosis, respectively. The variables most predictive of cumulative costs included radiation therapy (+$81,732), 2 weeks of hospitalization (+$49,629), and 7 MRI scans (+$40,105).Conclusions: The direct medical costs of newly-diagnosed, TMZ-treated GBM in commercially insured patients are substantial, with estimated total cumulative costs of $268,031.","[Jiang, Shan; Patel, Dipen; Botteman, Marc; Aly, Abdalla] Pharmerit Int, Bethesda, MD USA; [Hill, Kala; Waldeck, A.

Methods: Cost-effectiveness of OST vs no OST was evaluated by first replicating and then expanding an existing UK health technology assessment model. The expanded model included the impact of OST on infection rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Results: Versus no OST, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for BMT and MMT were 13,923 pound and 14,206 pound per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), respectively, from a NHS/PSS perspective. When total costs (NHS/PSS and societal) are considered, there are substantial savings associated with adopting OST; these savings are in excess of 14,032 pound for BMT vs no OST and 17,174 pound for MMT vs no OST over 1 year. This is primarily driven by a reduction in victim costs. OST treatment also impacted other aspects of criminality and healthcare resource use. Limitations: The model's 1-year timeframe means long-term costs and benefits, and the influence of changes over time are not captured. Conclusions: OST can be considered cost-effective vs no OST from the UK NHS/PSS perspective, with a cost per QALY well below the UK's willingness-to-pay threshold. There were only small differences between BMT and MMT. The availability of two or more cost-effective options is beneficial to retaining patients in OST programs. From a societal perspective, OST is estimated to save over 14,032 pound and 17,174 pound per year for BMT and MMT vs no OST, respectively, due to savings in victim costs. Further work is required to fully quantify the clinical and health economic impacts of different OST formulations and their societal impact over the long-term.","[Kenworthy, James; Dunlop, William C.

In order to maximize benefits from these technologies on highway traffic management, vehicle trajectories need to be not only controlled at the individual level but also coordinated collectively for a stream of traffic. As one of the pioneering attempts to highway traffic trajectory control, Part I of this study (Zhou et al., 2016) proposed a parsimonious shooting heuristic (SH) algorithm for constructing feasible trajectories for a stream of vehicles considering realistic constraints including vehicle kinematic limits, traffic arrival patterns, car-following safety, and signal operations. Based on the algorithmic and theoretical developments in the preceding paper, this paper proposes a holistic optimization framework for identifying a stream of vehicle trajectories that yield the optimum traffic performance measures on mobility, environment and safety. The computational complexity and mobility optimality of SH is theoretically analyzed, and verifies superior computational performance and high solution quality of SH. A numerical sub-gradient-based algorithm with SH as a subroutine (NG-SH) is proposed to simultaneously optimize travel time, a surrogate safety measure, and fuel consumption for a stream of vehicles on a signalized highway section. Numerical examples are conducted to illustrate computational and theoretical findings. They show that vehicle trajectories generated from NG-SH significantly outperform the benchmark case with all human drivers at all measures for all experimental scenarios. This study reveals a great potential of trans formative trajectory optimization approaches in transportation engineering applications. It lays a solid foundation for developing holistic cooperative control strategies on a general transportation network with emerging technologies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: A Microsoft Excel-based partitioned survival model comprising three health states (progression-free survival [PFS], post-progression survival, and death) was developed. Relevant comparators were chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy (C/R) and C/R with intent to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). Data were obtained from the pivotal phase II single-arm trial in 102 patients (SG035-0003; NCT00848926), a systematic literature review and clinical expert opinions (where empirical evidence was unavailable). PFS and overall survival for brentuximab vedotin were estimated using 5-year follow-up data from SG035-0003, and extrapolated using event rates observed for comparator treatments from published survival data. Resource use included drug acquisition and administration; alloSCT; treatment of adverse events; and long-term follow-up. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the impact of uncertainty. Results: In the base case, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for brentuximab vedotin was 38,769 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) vs C/R, whereas C/R with intent to alloSCT was dominated by brentuximab vedotin. ICERs for brentuximab vedotin generated by the deterministic sensitivity analysis ranged between 32,000-54,000 pound per QALY. Including productivity benefits reduced the ICER to 28,881 pound per QALY. Limitations: Limitations include lack of comparative data from this single arm study and the heterogeneous population. Inconsistent baseline characteristic reporting across studies prevented complete assessment of heterogeneity and the extent of potential bias in clinical and cost-effectiveness estimates. Conclusions: Although the base case ICER is above the threshold usually applied in Scotland, it is relatively low compared with other orphan drugs, and lower than the ICER generated using a previous data cut of SG035-0003 that informed a positive recommendation from the Scottish Medicines Consortium, under its decision-making framework for assessment of ultra-orphan medicines.","[Parker, Christopher; Eaton, James; Briggs, Andrew] ICON Hlth Econ & Epidemiol, 100 Pk Dr,Milton Pk, Abingdon OX14 4RY, Oxon, England; [Woods, Beth] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Ma, Esprit] Tufts Med Ctr, Inst Clin Res & Hlth Policy Studies, Ctr Evaluat Value & Risk Hlth, Boston, MA USA; [Selby, Ross; Benson, Eugene] Takeda UK Ltd, High Wycombe, Bucks, England; [Engstrom, Andreas] Takeda Pharma AB, Stockholm, Sweden; [Sajosi, Peter; Bonthapally, Vijayveer] Millennium Pharmaceut Inc, Cambridge, MA USA; [Briggs, Andrew] Univ Glasgow, Inst Hlth & Wellbeing, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",ICON plc; University of York - UK; Tufts Medical Center; Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd; Millennium Pharmaceuticals; University of Glasgow,,christopher.parker@iconplc.com,"Engström, Andreas/ABA-9006-2021; Briggs, Andrew/ABA-9009-2020","Engström, Andreas/0000-0002-9740-5949; Briggs, Andrew/0000-0002-0777-1997; Woods, Bethan Sarah/0000-0002-7669-9415",Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc.,Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc.(Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd),"The analysis was funded by Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.",,48,5,5,0,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

A challenge in empiric treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI) is identifying initial appropriate antibiotic therapy, which is associated with reduced length of stay and mortality compared with inappropriate therapy. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of ceftolozane/tazobactam+metronidazole compared with piperacillin/tazobactam (commonly used in this indication) in the treatment of patients with cIAI in UK hospitals. Methods: A decision-analytic Monte Carlo simulation model was used to compare costs (antibiotic and hospitalization costs) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of patients infected with gram-negative cIAI and treated empirically with either ceftolozane/tazobactam+metronidazole or piperacillin/tazobactam. Bacterial isolates were randomly drawn from the Program to Assess Ceftolozane/Tazobactam Susceptibility (PACTS) database, a surveillance database of non-duplicate bacterial isolates collected from patients in the UK infected with gram-negative pathogens. Susceptibility to initial empiric therapy was based on the measured susceptibilities reported in the PACTS database. Results: Ceftolozane/tazobactam+metronidazole was cost-effective when compared with piperacillin/tazobactam, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 4,350/QALY and 0.36 hospitalization days/patient saved. Costs in the ceftolozane/tazobactam+metronidazole arm were 2,576 pound/patient, compared with 2,168 pound/patient in the piperacillin/tazobactam arm. The ceftolozane/tazobactam+metronidazole arm experienced a greater number of QALYs than the piperacillin/tazobactam arm (14.31/patient vs 14.21/patient, respectively). Ceftolozane/tazobactam+metronidazole remained cost-effective in one-way sensitivity and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Economic models can help to identify the appropriate choice of empiric therapy for the treatment of cIAI. Results indicated that empiric use of ceftolozane/tazobactam+metronidazole is cost-effective vs piperacillin/tazobactam in UK patients with cIAI at risk of resistant infection. This will be valuable to commissioners and clinicians to aid decision-making on the targeting of resources for appropriate antibiotic therapy under the premise of antimicrobial stewardship.","[Prabhu, Vimalanand; Sarpong, Eric; Merchant, Sanjay] Merck & Co Inc, Kenilworth, NJ USA; [Foo, Jason] Mapi Grp, Houten, Netherlands; [Ahir, Harblas] Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd, Hoddesdon, England",Merck & Company; Merck & Company,"Merchant, S (通讯作者)，Merck & Co Inc, Ctr Observat & Real World Evidence CORE, 2000 Galloping Hill Rd, Kenilworth, NJ 07033 USA.",sanjay.merchant@merck.com,,,"Merck Co., Inc.","Merck Co., Inc.(Merck & Company)","Financial support for this study was provided by Merck & Co., Inc.

It used the US payer perspective and applied the cost-effectiveness framework. Because etelcalcetide is an intravenous therapy that can be titrated for individual patients, and because its utilization is yet to be assessed in real world settings, a range of plausible doses were estimated for etelcalcetide to define a range of prices. These were either in relation to the existing oral calcimimetic cinacalcet or compared to no calcimimetic treatment. Materials and methods: The value-based price of etelcalcetide was determined via a Markov model. This model combined data from the etelcalcetide trials and previously published cost-effectiveness models in SHPT, and allowed extrapolation of treatment effects on mortality, cardiovascular events, fracture, and parathyroidectomy. Several dosing scenarios were explored covering the dose ranges of 30.0-64.18mg per day for cinacalcet and 1.07-3.11mg per day for etelcalcetide. These included the mean dose from the etelcalcetide trials, the preliminary defined daily dose, and the expected most common dose in real world. An acceptable price range for etelcalcetide was assessed by comparing the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios obtained with the willingness-to-pay threshold range of $100,000-$300,000/quality-adjusted life-years. Results: Cost-effectiveness analysis supported value-based prices for etelcalcetide ranging from $21.15-$49.97/mg vs cinacalcet, and $13.79-$119.45/mg vs no calcimimetics. Limitations: There is uncertainty around what the real-world dosing will be for etelcalcetide. Another important nuance is that no studies have examined etelcalcetide effects on hard outcomes and, therefore, this modeling exercise relied on an extrapolation approach. Conclusions: This cost-effectiveness analysis, including scenarios to address uncertainties, allowed estimation of a value-based price range to aid reimbursement decisions in the US.","[Stollenwerk, Bjoern] Amgen Europe GmbH, Dammstr 23,POB 1557, CH-6301 Zug, Switzerland; [Iannazzo, Sergio] SIHS Hlth Econ Consulting, Turin, Italy; [Cooper, Kerry; Belozeroff, Vasily] Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320 USA",Amgen; AMGEN Europe; Amgen,"Stollenwerk, B (通讯作者)，Amgen Europe GmbH, Dammstr 23,POB 1557, CH-6301 Zug, Switzerland.",bjoerns@amgen.com,"Stollenwerk, Björn/G-5408-2013","Stollenwerk, Bjorn/0000-0002-3189-409X",Amgen,Amgen(Amgen),"Financial support for this study was provided by Amgen.

This study developed a model to quantify the potential health and economic value associated with sustained potassium management and optimal RAASi therapy in heart failure patients. Materials and methods: A patient-level, fixed-time increment stochastic simulation model was designed to characterize the progression of heart failure through New York Heart Association functional classes, and predict associations between serum potassium levels, RAASi use, and consequent long-term outcomes. Following internal and external validation exercises, model analyses sought to quantify the health and economic benefits of optimizing both serum potassium levels and RAASi therapy in heart failure patients. Analyses were conducted using a UK payer perspective, independent of costs and utilities related to pharmacological potassium management. Results: Validation against multiple datasets demonstrated the predictive capability of the model. Compared to those who discontinued RAASi to manage serum potassium, patients with normokalemia and ongoing RAASi therapy benefited from longer life expectancy (+1.38 years), per-patient quality-adjusted life year gains (+0.53 QALYs), cost savings (110) pound, and associated net monetary benefit (10,679 pound at 20,000 pound per QALY gained) over a lifetime horizon. The predicted value of sustained potassium management and ongoing RAASi treatment was largely driven by reduced mortality and hospitalization risks associated with optimal RAASi therapy. Limitations: Several modeling assumptions were made to account for a current paucity of published literature; however, ongoing refinement and validation of the model will ensure its continued accuracy as the clinical landscape of hyperkalemia evolves. Conclusions: Predictions generated by this novel modeling approach highlight the value of sustained potassium management to avoid hyperkalemia, enable RAASi therapy, and improve long-term health economic outcomes in patients with heart failure.","[Bakhai, Ameet] Royal Free Hosp, Dept Cardiol, London, England; [Palaka, Eirini] AstraZeneca, Global Hlth Econ, Cambridge, England; [Linde, Cecilia] Karolinska Univ Hosp, Heart & Vasc Theme, Stockholm, Sweden; [Linde, Cecilia] Karolinska Inst, Stockholm, Sweden; [Bennett, Hayley; McEwan, Phil] Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res Ltd, Oak Tree Court,Mulberry Dr, Cardiff CF23 8RS, S Glam, Wales; [Furuland, Hans] Uppsala Univ Hosp, Dept Nephrol, Uppsala, Sweden; [Qin, Lei] AstraZeneca, Global Hlth Econ, Gaithersburg, MD USA; [McEwan, Phil] Swansea Univ, Sch Human & Hlth Sci, Swansea, W Glam, Wales; [Evans, Marc] Llandough Hosp, Diabet Resource Ctr, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales",University of London; University College London; Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust; UCL Medical School; AstraZeneca; Karolinska Institutet; Karolinska University Hospital; Karolinska Institutet; Health Economics & Outcomes Research Ltd; Uppsala University; Uppsala University Hospital; AstraZeneca; Swansea University,"Bennett, H (通讯作者)，Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res Ltd, Oak Tree Court,Mulberry Dr, Cardiff CF23 8RS, S Glam, Wales.",hayley.bennettwilton@heor.co.uk,,"LInde, Cecilia/0000-0002-9039-6023",AstraZeneca,AstraZeneca(AstraZeneca),"Model development and medical writing support for this study were funded by AstraZeneca.

This study quantified caregiver priorities for potential treatment endpoints to identify unmet needs in PWS. Methods: The authors partnered with the International Consortium to Advance Clinical Trials for PWS (PWS-CTC) and a diverse stakeholder advisory board to develop a best-worst scaling instrument. Seven relevant endpoints were assessed using a balanced incomplete block design. Caregivers were asked to determine the most and least important of a sub-set of four endpoints in each task. Caregivers were recruited nationally though patient registries, email lists, and social media. Best-worst score was calculated to determine caregiver priorities; ranging from 0 (least important) to 10 (most important). A novel kernel-smoothing approach was used to analyze caregiver endpoint priority variations with relation to age of the PWS individual. Results: In total, 457 caregivers participated in the study. Respondents were mostly parents (97%), females (83%), and Caucasian (87%) who cared for a PWS individual ranging from 4-54 years. Caregivers value treatments addressing hyperphagia (score = 7.08, SE = 0.17) and anxiety (score = 6.35, SE = 0.16) as most important. Key variations in priorities were observed across age, including treatments targeting anxiety, temper outbursts, and intellectual functions. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that caregivers prioritize hyperphagia and, using a novel method, demonstrates that this is independent of the age of the person with PWS. This is even the case for parents of young children who have yet to experience hyperphagia, indicating that these results are not subject to a hypothetical bias.","[Tsai, Jui-Hua] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Hlth Policy & Management Dept, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Scheimann, Ann O.] Johns Hopkins Univ Hosp, Div Pediat Gastroenterol & Nutr, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA; [McCandless, Shawn E.] Univ Colorado, Denver Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Aurora, CO USA; [McCandless, Shawn E.] Childrens Hosp Colorado, Aurora, CO USA; [Strong, Theresa, V] FPWR, Walnut, CA USA; [Bridges, John F.

The assignment of trips to a vehicle also provides a schedule for a vehicle. The objective is to minimise the total cost due to waiting and travelling empty while covering all the trips. In this paper, we propose a new formulation for the MDVSP (termed as the inventory formulation) that uses assignment arcs in a multi-commodity time-space network flow formulation. A general way to solve this multi-commodity network flow problem is to decompose the problem for each commodity (in this case, for each depot). However, we apply Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition to the inventory formulation by decomposing it for each trip. Column generation is used to solve the linear relaxation of the trip-based decomposition. Column generation requires less time to solve the new trip-based decomposition than the existing depot-based decompositions. To obtain a good-quality integer solution to the MDVSP, we propose a solution framework that solves the linear relaxation of the MDVSP iteratively. At each iteration, schedules for certain vehicles in the fleet are finalised. The iterations continue until all the trips receive an allocation. Three different heuristics are proposed based on the solution framework. The computational experiments suggest that the new heuristics provide better quality solutions than the existing heuristics. For instances with a large number of trips, the new heuristics provide solutions in less time than that required by the existing heuristics. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This study was aimed at comparing administration times and associated costs of infliximab and vedolizumab infusions for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Materials and methods: This study used claims data from the Symphony Health Integrated Dataverse to identify IBD patients using infliximab or vedolizumab between 20 May 2014 and 29 February 2016. Use of Current Procedural Terminology administration codes was evaluated and costs calculated using the 2016 Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Physician Fee Schedule. Assessments included infusion times, associated costs, productivity loss using average wage estimates from the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, and home infusion adoption. Results: A total of 10,051 infliximab and 3114 vedolizumab patients with first-hour claims were identified; 52.0% were female and 64.5% had Crohn's disease. There were 48,377 infliximab first-hour claims (mean 4.8 infusions per patient); 46,462 (96.0%) had a second-hour claim. In comparison, there were 14,717 vedolizumab claims (mean 4.7 infusions per patient), with only 411 (2.8%) second-hour claims, resulting in vedolizumab cost savings of approximately $1.27 million. The difference in second-hour infusions resulted in 46,051 additional hours of productivity loss with infliximab, and lost wages averaging $1.18 million (range $0.68-$1.77 million). Limitations: Administration costs were inferred as charge costs and not directly assessed. Productivity loss assessed time spent on infusion only, and included a small proportion of patients beyond working age. Conclusions: Second-hour infusion billing was significantly lower with vedolizumab than with infliximab, corresponding to cost savings and reduced productivity loss.","[Null, Kyle; Kumar, Varun; Lissoos, Trevor; Luo, Michelle] Takeda Pharmaceut USA Inc, One Takeda Pkwy, Deerfield, IL 60015 USA; [Kumar, Varun] Inst Clin & Econ Review, Boston, MA USA",Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd; Takeda Pharmaceuticals USA Inc.

The objective of this study is to determine the capacity requirements of an envisaged automated on-demand rail-bound transit system which offers a direct non-stop service. An optimization model is formulated for determining the optimal track and station platform capacities for an on-demand rail transit system so that passenger, infrastructure and operational costs are minimized. The macroscopic model allows for studying the underlying relations between technological, operational and demand parameters, optimal capacity settings and the obtained cost components. The model is applied to a series of numerical experiments followed by its application to part of the Dutch railway network. The performance is benchmarked against the existing service, suggesting that in-vehicle times can be reduced by 10% in the case study network while the optimal link and station capacity allocation is comparable to those currently available in the case study network. While network geometry and demand distribution are always the underlying determinants of both service frequencies and in-vehicle times, line configuration is only a determinant in the conventional system, whereas the automated on-demand rail service better caters for the prevailing demand relations, resulting in greater variations in service provision. A series of sensitivity analyses are performed to test the consequences of a range of network structures, technological capabilities, operational settings, cost functions and demand scenarios for future automated on-demand rail-bound systems.

In a corridor network with multiple discrete bottlenecks, we study a model of system optimal assignment that integrates the short-term problem (departure time choice with tolling) and the long-term problem (job and residential location choice). For the short-term departure-time choice equilibrium, under mild assumptions on schedule delay function, we derive analytical solutions under a first-best TDM scheme. Investigating properties of long-term equilibria, we found that the overall equilibrium pattern exhibits remarkable spatio-temporal sorting properties. It is further shown that a lack of integration of the short- and the longterm policy results in excessive investments for long-term road construction. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Possible mechanisms include traffic flow instabilities, indifference regions or finite human perception thresholds (action points), and external acceleration noise. However, the relative importance of these factors in a given situation remains unclear. We bring light into this question by adding external noise and action points to the Intelligent Driver Model and other car-following models thereby obtaining a minimal model containing all three oscillation mechanisms. We show analytically that even in the subcritical regime of linearly stable flow (order parameter epsilon <0), external white noise leads to spatiotemporal speed correlations anticipating the waves of the linearly unstable regime. Sufficiently far away from the threshold, the amplitude scales with (-epsilon)(-0.5). By means of simulations and comparisons with experimental car platoons and bicycle traffic, we show that external noise and indifference regions with action points have essentially equivalent effects. Furthermore, flow instabilities dominate the oscillations on freeways while external noise or action points prevail at low desired speeds such as vehicular city or bicycle traffic. For bicycle traffic, noise can lead to fully developed waves even for single-file traffic in the subcritical regime. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Interestingly, when the liner company reaches a port investment agreement with one port, the other port also benefits.

We also consider problems wherein these flexibilities are not present. We propose an exact solution approach for solving problems from this family that is based upon branch and price, wherein columns are generated via a tailored labeling algorithm.

When the demand states are observed in the operation period, the government may request renegotiation to adapt the initial contract to the realized demand state. By considering the loss aversion behavior of the private firm, this paper shows that renegotiation takes place only if the private firm's extent of loss aversion is sufficiently small. However, in what direction the government adjusts toll price and concession period depends on the combined effects of initial price, demand level, and demand uncertainty in each demand state. This paper has further investigated the optimal initial contract. We find that if one demand state realizes with a sufficiently large probability, then the optimal initial contract is renegotiation-proof in this demand state while inducing renegotiation in other demand states; if all demand states realize with almost equal probabilities, whether the optimal initial contract prevents or induces renegotiations in all demand states depends on the private firm's extent of loss aversion. This paper makes two major contributions to the literature. First, we apply loss aversion to the context of renegotiation in BOT road projects and show that renegotiation is costly. Second, we consider the optimal_initial contract in anticipation of ex post renegotiation and show that the government should trade off between ex ante social welfare and ex post psychological loss. To obtain more insights and to strengthen our model results, we have reexamined the optimal renegotiation and initial contracts under some relaxed assumptions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In this research, we develop an integer programming model with a set of novel constraints to guarantee such consistency, which is new to the literature. The input to our model includes the historical speed on a given road as well as the location and starting time of a known incident. The model then outputs the spatiotemporal region impacted by this incident. We prove that our model produces results that are consistent with the propagation of shockwaves. We then show that our model is computationally more efficient than the current state-of-the-art model because ours requires substantially fewer constraints.

Based on the MFD framework, extensive research has been dedicated to devising perimeter control strategies to protect the network from gridlock. Recent research has revealed that the stochasticity and time-varying nature of travel demand can introduce significant scattering in the MFD, thus reducing the definition of the MFD dynamics. However, this type of demand effect on the behavior of the MFD dynamics has not been well studied. In this article, we investigate such effect and propose some appropriate boundary conditions to ensure that the MFD dynamics are well-defined. These boundary conditions can be regarded as travel demand adjustment in traffic rationing. For perimeter control design, a set of sufficient conditions that guarantee the controllability, an important but yet untouched issue, are derived for general multi-region MFD systems. The stability of the network equilibrium and convergence of the network dynamics are then analyzed in the sense of Lyapunov. Both theoretical and numerical results indicate that the network traffic converges to the desired uncongested equilibrium under proper boundary conditions in conjunction with proper control measures. The results are consistent with some existing studies and offer a control systems perspective regarding the demand-oriented behavior analysis of MFD-based network traffic dynamics. A surprising finding is that if the control purpose is to regulate the traffic to a desired level of service, the perimeter control gain can be simply chosen as its desired steady state, that is, the control gain is a constant and can be implemented as proportional control. This property sheds light on the road pricing design based on the MFD framework by minimizing the gap between the actual traffic state and the desired traffic state. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent technological developments connecting a platoon via digital data transmission even allow that the driver of the front truck controls all (unmanned) follower vehicles. Existing research mainly focuses on the technological and safety aspects of controlling the trucks and their distances. However, the efficiency of platooning is not only dependent on the aerodynamic drag, which considerably reduces with decreasing inter-vehicle distance; it is also influenced by the platoon formation process. To explore the impact of this and other neglected aspects on the efficiency of platooning (i.e., the diffusion of platooning technology, maximum platoon lengths, and the trucks' willingness-to-wait for partners) a basic scheduling problem for the platoon building process along a single path is investigated. By differentiating problem characteristics, e.g., the objective function, we derive different problem settings for which a detailed analysis of computational complexity is provided. Efficient algorithms are derived and applied to explore the impact of the diffusion of platooning technology, the maximum platoon length, and the tightness of time windows. Our results show that these factors can considerably reduce the positive effects of truck platooning, and, thus, the benefit may diminish. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The Bellman's optimality principle is not applicable to this problem because of its non-linear objective function making it difficult to solve. In this light, we propose a pruning-based algorithm that progressively determines subpaths from the source and eliminates those that are non-optimal. The algorithm uses a novel bi-level, bounds-based pruning criterion to determine whether subpath can belong to the optimal path. We show that the pruning criterion is valid and that the algorithm terminates with an exact solution. Computational experiments demonstrate that the algorithm can successfully solve the problem even on large real-world networks and that its practical computational complexity is polynomial. Finally, we show that the pruning algorithm outperforms the existing non-dominance based procedure by a factor proportional to the network size on medium-sized networks and more so on large-sized networks. This work has the potential to aid in a wider application of stochastic time-dependent networks for modeling and analysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Prakash, A.

An integer programming optimization model is defined to solve the block-to-train assignment problem. The model aims to maximize the total cost savings of the whole railroad network compared to the single-block train service plan, where each block is allocated to a direct train service. The objective function includes the service design cost savings, the train operation cost savings, the car-hour consumption savings in the accumulation process, the car-hour consumption savings in the attachment and detachment operations and the waiting car hour consumption savings. Furthermore, the model is improved to a path-based formulation, which has far fewer decision variables and is easier to solve for real-world problems. A heuristic approach based on the genetic algorithm and tabu search is developed to solve the path-based formulation. The model and approach are tested first in a small network to compare with the optimal solution obtained through the enumeration method and the solution obtained from commercial optimization software. Then the model and approach are applied to a real larger railroad sub-network in China. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This study investigated the broader fiscal costs and benefits of curative interventions for chronic Hepatitis C (CHC) that allow individuals to avoid long-term HCV attributed health conditions. Methods: A prospective cohort model, assessing the long-term fiscal consequences of policy decisions, was developed for HCV infected individuals, following the generational accounting analytic framework that combines age-specific lifetime gross taxes paid and governmental transfers received (i.e. healthcare and social support costs). The analysis assessed the burden of a theoretical cohort of untreated HCV infected patients with the alternative of treating these patients with a highly efficacious curative intervention (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir [LDV/SOF]). It also compared treating patients at all fibrosis stages (Stages F0-F4) compared to late treatment (Stage F4). Results: Based on projected lifetime work activity and taxes paid, the treated cohort paid an additional 5,900 pound per patient compared to the untreated cohort. Lifetime government disability costs of 97,555 pound and 125,359 pound per patient for treated cohort vs no treatment cohort were estimated, respectively. Lifetime direct healthcare costs in the treated cohort were 32,235 pound, compared to non-treated cohort of 26,424 pound, with an incremental healthcare costs increase of 5,901 pound per patient. The benefit cost ratio (BCR) of total government benefits and savings relative to government treatment costs (including LDV/SOF) ranged from 1.8-5.6. Treating patients early resulted in 77% less disability costs, 43% lower healthcare costs, and 33% higher tax revenue. Conclusion: The ability to cure Hepatitis C offers considerable fiscal benefits beyond direct medical costs and savings attributed to reduced disability costs, public allowances, and improved tax revenue. Changes in parameters, such as productivity, wage growth, and tax rates, can influence the conclusions described here.","[Connolly, Mark P.; Kotsopoulos, Nikos] Global Market Access Solut, St Prex, Switzerland; [Connolly, Mark P.] Univ Groningen, Dept Pharm, Unit Pharmacoepidemiol & Pharmacoecon, Antonius Deusinglaan 1, NL-9713 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Ustianowski, Andrew] North Manchester Gen Hosp, Reg Infect Dis Unit, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Groningen,"Connolly, MP (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Dept Pharm, Unit Pharmacoepidemiol & Pharmacoecon, Antonius Deusinglaan 1, NL-9713 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",m.connolly@rug.nl,,"Ustianowski, Andrew/0000-0002-6134-7855; KOTSOPOULOS, NIKOLAOS/0000-0002-8248-7697",Gilead Sciences,Gilead Sciences(Gilead Sciences),A research grant was provided by Gilead Sciences for conducting the work described here.,,32,9,9,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Nationally representative procedural and contrast media prevalence rates, along with MARCE (major adverse renal cardiovascular event) incidence and episode-related cost data were derived from Premier Hospital Data (October 2014 to September 2015). A previously estimated relative risk reduction in MARCE associated with IOCM usage (9.3%) was applied. The higher cost of IOCM was included when calculating the net impact estimates at the aggregate, hospital type, and per hospital levels. One-way (25%) and probabilistic sensitivity analyses identified the model's most important inputs.Results: Based on weighted analysis, 513,882US inpatient angioplasties and 35,610 MARCE cases were estimated annually. Switching to an IOCM only strategy from a LOCM only strategy increases contrast media cost, but prevents 2,900 MARCE events. The annual budget impact was an estimated saving of $30.71 million, aggregated across all US hospitals, $6,316 per hospital, or $60 per procedure. Net savings were maintained across all univariate sensitivity analyses. While MARCE/event-free cost differential was the most important factor driving total net savings for hospitals in the Northeast and West, procedural volume was important in the Midwest and rural locations.Conclusions: Switching to an IOCM only strategy from a LOCM only approach yields substantial net global savings to hospitals, both at the national level and within hospital sub-groups. Hospital administrators should maintain awareness of the factors that are likely to be more influential for their hospital and recognize that purchasing on the basis of lower contrast media cost may result in higher overall costs for patients undergoing inpatient angioplasty.","[Keuffel, Eric; Palli, Swetha R.; Ryan, Michael P.; Gunnarsson, Candace] CTI Clin Trial & Consulting Serv Inc, 100 E RiverCtr Blvd, Covington, KY 41011 USA; [McCullough, Peter A.] Baylor Univ, Med Ctr, Baylor Jack & Jane Hamilton Heart & Vasc Hosp, Dallas, TX USA; [McCullough, Peter A.] Baylor Heart & Vasc Inst, Dallas, TX USA; [McCullough, Peter A.] Texas A&M Hlth Sci Ctr, Coll Med, Dallas, TX USA; [Todoran, Thomas M.] Med Univ South Carolina, Charleston, SC USA; [Brilakis, Emmanouil S.] Abbott NW Hosp, Minneapolis Heart Inst, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Keuffel, Eric] Hlth Finance & Access Initiat, Bryn Mawr, PA USA",Baylor University Medical Center; Baylor University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M Health Science Center; Medical University of South Carolina; Minneapolis Heart Institute Foundation,"Keuffel, E (通讯作者)，CTI Clin Trial & Consulting Serv Inc, 100 E RiverCtr Blvd, Covington, KY 41011 USA.",ekeuffel@ctifacts.com,"Brilakis, Emmanouil/ABE-6947-2020","Brilakis, Emmanouil/0000-0001-9416-9701",,,,,36,7,9,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Materials and methods: Truven's Health Analytics MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters database from January 1, 2007 to June 30, 2014 was queried for US adults diagnosed with hypothyroidism who initiated Synthroid and adhered to such therapy for at least 6 months. Propensity score matching matched continuous users of Synthroid to patients who switched from Synthroid to alternative levothyroxine agents. Kruskal-Wallis tests assessed differences between the matched cohorts in several categories of costs, including disease-related drug costs, non-drug medical costs, and total direct medical costs. Results: There were 10,159 individuals included in the study, with 7,991 continuous users of Synthroid and 2,168 switchers. After matching (n = 2,052 for each cohort), continuous use of Synthroid was associated with significantly lower hypothyroidism-related non-drug medical costs ($595 vs $1,023; p = .003) and reduced hypothyroidism-related total medical costs ($757 vs $1,132; p = .010), despite being associated with significantly higher drug costs ($161 vs $109; p < .001). Hypothyroidism-related total medical costs rose as the number of switches of hypothyroidism treatment increased, with continuous users having significantly lower hypothyroidism-related total medical costs ($757) compared with patients who switched twice ($1,179; p = .001) or three or more times ($1,268; p = .004). Limitations: The analyses focused on continuously insured patients who were adherent to Synthroid for at least 6 months and results may not be generalizable. The reliance on claims data does not allow for clinical examination of hypothyroidism or inclusion of some factors that may be associated with outcomes. The analyses assume that all prescriptions filled are taken as prescribed. Conclusions: Results indicate that there are significant direct economic healthcare costs associated with switching from Synthroid to alternative levothyroxine therapies, and that these costs increase as patients switch therapies more frequently.","[Khandelwal, Nikhil; Johns, Beverly; Hepp, Zsolt; Castelli-Haley, Jane] AbbVie Inc, N Chicago, IL 60064 USA",AbbVie,"Hepp, Z (通讯作者)，AbbVie Inc, Global Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res Analyt, 1 N Waukegan Rd, N Chicago, IL 60064 USA.",zsolt.hepp@abbvie.com,,,"AbbVie, Inc.; AbbVie","AbbVie, Inc.(AbbVie); AbbVie(AbbVie)","Support for this study was provided by AbbVie, Inc.

In this scheme, which we term a decomposition approach to the static traffic assignment problem (DSTAP), the network is divided into smaller networks, and the algorithm alternates between equilibrating these networks as subproblems, and master iterations using a simplified version of the full network. The simplified network used for the master iterations is based on linearizations to the equilibrium solution for each subnetwork obtained using sensitivity analysis techniques. We prove that the DSTAP method converges to the equilibrium solution on the full network, and demonstrate computational savings of 35-70% on the Austin network. Natural applications of this method are statewide or national assignment problems, or cities with rivers or other geographic features where subnetworks can be easily defined. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We introduce the concepts of delta-balance degree and lambda-tolerance level to reflect the subjective measures of the railway administrator for capacity evaluation. A train balance scheduling problem with initial departure time choice of trains is embedded into the measure of railway capacity. The combined scheduling and capacity evaluation method is formulated as a 0-1 mixed integer programming model, and solved using a simple dichotomization-based heuristic method. A highly efficient heuristic procedure based on the concept of compaction pattern is developed to solve the train balance scheduling problem, and the numerical results demonstrate that the method yields high-quality solutions close to the optimal ones using the CPLEX solver. The two-way traffic loading capacity of a single-track railway corridor is analyzed in detail under different tolerance levels and balance degrees. The transition regions of traffic loading capacity are identified, and provide a useful decision support tool for the railway administrators in dealing with train rescheduling requests under disturbance or disruption scenarios.

Microscopic evaluation of trajectories inside seven selected oscillations is performed to obtain a comprehensive picture of these puzzling phenomena. A new method based on driver's task difficulty (TD) profile is proposed to capture changes in driver behavior in response to the disturbance caused by traffic oscillations. A close connection between the TD profile and evolution (such as formation and growth) of the stop-and-go traffic oscillations is found. Furthermore, driver behaviors inside the oscillations are identified based on driver's TD profile, and their connection with hysteresis magnitudes is established. Finally, a generalized linear model suggests that variables related to traffic flow and driver characteristics are significant predictors of hysteresis magnitude. One noteworthy finding is that, the bigger the difference between the average TD levels between deceleration and acceleration phases of a vehicle trajectory, the larger the hysteresis magnitude becomes.

Optimal positioning of active sensors can help to identify path flows. Due to the stochastic nature of transportation systems, we propose a scenario based two stage stochastic programming framework which considers the uncertainty of the link-path matrix. The first stage model aims to minimize the total traffic sensor installation cost and the expected penalty for uncovered and undifferentiated paths. The second stage model attempts to minimize uncovered and undifferentiated paths for a given sensor location pattern and a specific scenario. In addition, a mean risk measure is also incorporated into the two stage stochastic programming framework, and consequently a mean risk two stage stochastic programming model is proposed. Both models have the same structure, where the first stage and second stage decision variables are binary. The second stage decision variable can be relaxed to a continuous variable without changing the nature of the model. To solve the two stochastic programming models, a branch and bound based integer L-shaped algorithm is presented. Finite steps convergence is guaranteed for the algorithm. To handle the problem with a large number of scenarios, a sampling technique is introduced, and the confidence bound is analyzed with respect to the scenario size. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed models and algorithm. The most important numerical results are as follows: (i) the stochastic programming framework is capable of capturing the reality more efficiently and accurately, (ii) the path differentiation factor is more critical than the path coverage factor in determining the sensor placement pattern, and (iii) in the partial parameter setting case, the mean risk based stochastic programming model results in a significantly different sensor placement pattern compared to the normal stochastic programming model. The study contributes to practical sensor placement design. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Applications can be found in mode choice (public transit versus road transport), premium (i.e., express bus) versus ordinary public transit, and fast (e.g., high-occupancy toll, or HOT) versus regular lanes on expressways. We are motivated in particular by the choice between public transport and use of the road network as a privilege to be discouraged. In a future where GPS-based time-distance-place road charging exists, such next-generation transport management strategies become realizable as the choice to drive or not can be linked to a fixed fee toll, or indeed to a tradable credits scheme. When public transport payment uses the same smart card as the road usage fee (via tolls or tradable credits) usage of the two may be linked. In this setting, a public transport vs. road-use tradable credit scheme becomes feasible. In this case, individuals wishing to choose the faster option must obtain credits from other commuters via credit trading, rather than pay a direct toll or fee. Such a scheme creates a kind of equity, in the sense that lower-income commuters have an economic incentive to resort to the slower or less comfortable choice. We study the underlying market and its effects on individuals' utilities; we use an atomic game framework so as to model explicitly the exchange process across users. The market we define determines the quantities of users choosing each option, as opposed to the prices themselves. Using the properties of potential games, we show that under mild assumptions, efficient Nash equilibria exist and can be reached using simple learning algorithms. We show that these equilibria can satisfy the transport authority's requirements, and thus drive the transport system to a state where a desired proportion of individuals resort to each of the two options, when the scheme's parameters are well tuned.

The CRP is an NP-hard problem such that the large-scale instances cannot be solved to optimality by exact solution methods within a reasonable computational time. This article proposes a beam search (BS) algorithm embedded with heuristics to evaluate the problems. The proposed beam search is tested on benchmark instances and compared with other leading heuristics from the literature.

In light of low profitability and frequent alliance changes, the optimal choice of investment approach is addressed. This is achieved by comparing the performance of three investment approaches: real options analysis, and individual and collective discounted cash flow. It turns out that the real options trigger performs best, especially under conditions of high competitive intensity and freight rate volatility. A sensitivity analysis concludes that competitive intensity, alliance complexity cost, and freight rate volatility lead to alliance instability and that shorter lead times increase industry concentration.

Given an objective function, a set of candidate decision variables and a black-box transport simulation that is solved by iteratively attaining a (deterministic or stochastic) equilibrium, the proposed method approximates the best decision variable out of the candidate set without having to run the transport simulation to convergence for every single candidate decision variable. This method can be inserted into a broad class of optimization algorithms or search heuristics that implement the following logic: (i) Create variations of a given, currently best decision variable, (ii) identify one out of these variations as the new currently best decision variable, and (iii) iterate steps (i) and (ii) until no further improvement can be attained. A probabilistic and an asymptotic performance bound are established and exploited in the formulation of an efficient heuristic that is tailored towards tight computational budgets. The efficiency of the method is substantiated through a comprehensive simulation study with a non-trivial road pricing problem. The method is compatible with a broad range of simulators and requires minimal parametrization. (C) 2016 The Author.

Based on some properties proved in this study, a dynamic programming algorithm is then designed to obtain some important threshold values, which are used in the optimal control policy for ship refueling decision. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method can obtain the optimal decision within a reasonable time (about 170 s) for various scales of problem instances (up to 30 ports) as well as various settings of probability distributions. In addition, some comparative experiments also show that the proposed optimal decision policy can save at least 8% fuel consumption cost by comparing with some relatively simple rules and save about 1% cost on average by comparing with some brilliantly-designed rules.

For a multilevel inverter, attempt is to obtain an output voltage which is near sinusoidal in shape. The switching angles and the voltage levels are decided in such a way so as to maximize the fundamental component with minimum THD. In this paper, it is shown how a simple method like Grey Analysis method can be used to decide the switching angles and voltage levels of a multilevel inverter so as to get an output with maximum fundamental component and reduced total harmonic distortion (THD). For a seven level inverter, six output waveforms are assumed and then the best suitable one from amongst these six waveforms is found out using this method. It is the magnitude of fundamental component and presence of harmonics, especially the lower order harmonics, which affects the output of any inverter. Thus a Multivariable Grey Relational Function is generated by quantifying the effects of multiple factors, i.e. magnitude of fundamental component and also the weighted (WTHD) effect of its harmonics, into a single index.

The aim of this study was to explore MS patients' preference for the different attributes of DMTs in the UK. Materials and methods: Attributes (treatment characteristics) for inclusion in the discrete choice experiment (DCE) were determined through published literature and interviews with 12 people with MS. Seven attributes were selected. Participants were presented with three hypothetical treatment options sampled from included attributes and asked for their most/least preferred options. The influence of patient characteristics and demographics on patient preference was also investigated. Results: The DCE was completed by 350 people with MS (81% female, mean age=39). Results showed that method of taking medication was the strongest determinant of preference (27%; relative importance out of 100%), followed by relapse free rate (21%) and symptom progression (14%). Risk of fatigue (8%) and type of monitoring (6%) were the weakest determinants of preference. Once-daily oral treatment was preferred over all other methods of administration. Participant characteristics did not influence data on strength of preference. Limitations: This study assumed adequate participant understanding of the discrete choice experiment task, and recruitment targeted those with access to the internet. Conclusions: These results, derived from people with MS in the UK, should be used to inform individual discussions with patients about DMT choices.","[Bottomley, Catherine] pH Associates Ltd, Marlow, Bucks, England; [Lloyd, Andrew] Bladon Associates, Oxford, England; [Bennett, Gary] Stats People, Sevenoaks, Kent, England; [Adlard, Nicholas] Novartis, Frimley Business Pk, Frimley GU16 7SR, Surrey, England",Novartis,"Adlard, N (通讯作者)，Novartis, Frimley Business Pk, Frimley GU16 7SR, Surrey, England.",nickadlard@gmail.com,,"Bottomley, Catherine/0000-0002-6339-0961; Adlard, Nicholas/0000-0001-6912-1685; Lloyd, Andrew/0000-0002-7597-6556",Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK.

This study estimates the savings in direct (medical care) costs and indirect (job absenteeism) costs in the US from reductions in heart disease associated with substituting monounsaturated fats (MUFA) for saturated fats. Materials and methods: A four-part model of the medical care cost savings from avoided heart disease was estimated using data on 247,700 adults from the 2000-2010 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). The savings from reduced job absenteeism due to avoided heart disease was estimated using a zero-inflated negative binomial model of the number of annual work loss days applied to data on 164,577 adults from the MEPS. Results: Estimated annual savings in medical care expenditures resulting from a switch from a diet high in saturated fat to a high-MUFA diet totaled similar to $25.7 billion (95% CI = $6.0-$45.4 billion) in 2010, with private insurance plans saving $7.9 billion (95% CI = $1.8-$14.0 billion), Medicare saving $9.4 billion (95% CI = $2.1-$16.7 billion), Medicaid saving $1.4 billion (95% CI = $0.2-$2.5 billion), and patients saving $2.2 billion (95% CI = $0.5-$3.8 billion). The annual savings in terms of reduced job absenteeism ranges from a lower bound of $600 million (95% CI = $100 million to $1.0 billion) to an upper bound of $1.2 billion (95% CI = $0.2-$2.1 billion) for 2010. Limitations: The data cover only the non-institutionalized population. Decreased costs due to any decreases in the severity of heart disease are not included. Cost savings do not include any reduction in informal care at home. Conclusions: Diets high in saturated fat impose substantial medical care costs and job absenteeism costs, and substantial savings could be achieved by substituting MUFA for saturated fat.","[Cawley, John] Cornell Univ, Dept Policy Anal & Management, Ithaca, NY USA; [Cawley, John] Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Meyerhoefer, Chad] Lehigh Univ, Dept Econ, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [Gillingham, Leah G.] Nutr Fundamentals Hlth Inc, Vaudreuil Dorion, PQ, Canada; [Kris-Etherton, Penny] Penn State Univ, Dept Nutr Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Jones, Peter J.

This study aimed to evaluate the real-life daily cost of VKA treatment in 2013, in French patients suffering from NVAF. Methods: This longitudinal observational study was performed using the EGB (Echantillon Generaliste des Beneficiaires) database, a random sample of the French national insurance (NHI) database, which covers 80% of the population. All adult patients whose first NVAF anticoagulant treatment in 2013 was a VKA were analyzed. Costs were calculated for the duration of follow-up and then divided by the number of days of therapy. The analysis was performed both from the French NHI perspective (amount reimbursed by the NHI) and from a collective perspective. Results: In this study, 3,254 NVAF patients treated with VKA in 2013 were included, and this sample comprised 52.6% males. The mean daily cost of VKA treatment was (sic)1.13 (+/- 1.18) according to the collective perspective (+/- 89.4% of this cost was associated to INR measurement) and (sic) 1.05 (+/- 1.16) according to the NHI perspective. Limitations: As diagnoses associated with procedures are not available in the EGB database, proxies were used, and an algorithm was created to define the AF population. Conclusions: This analysis is the first to consider an exhaustive spectrum of the costs of VKA treatment in France using EGB data. VKA medication requires exhaustive follow-up, and, thus, associated costs are important.

Risk of bleeding and the requirement for regular anticoagulation monitoring are, however, limiting their use. Rivaroxaban is a novel oral anticoagulant associated with a significantly lower risk of major bleeds (hazard ratio=0.54, 95% confidence interval=0.37-0.79) compared to LMWH/VKA therapy, and does not require regular anticoagulation monitoring. Aims: To evaluate the health economic consequences of treating acute VTE patients with rivaroxaban compared to treatment with LMWH/VKA, viewed from the Dutch societal perspective. Methods: A life-time Markov model was populated with the findings of the EINSTEIN phase III clinical trial to analyze cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban therapy in treatment and prevention of VTE from a Dutch societal perspective. Primary model outcomes were total and incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), as well as life expectancy and costs. Results: Over a patient's lifetime, rivaroxaban was shown to be dominant, with health gains of 0.047 QALYs and cost savings of Euro304 compared to LMWH/VKA therapy. Dominance was robustly present in all sensitivity analyses. Major drivers of the differences between the two treatment arms were related to anticoagulation monitoring (medical costs, travel costs, and loss of productivity) and the occurrence of major bleeds. Conclusion: Rivaroxaban treatment of patients with venous thromboembolism results in health gains and cost savings compared to LMWH/VKA therapy. This conclusion holds for the Dutch setting, both for the societal perspective, as well as the healthcare perspective.","[Heisen, Marieke; Treur, Maarten J.] Pharmerit Int, Marten Meesweg 107, NL-3068 AV Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Heemstra, Harald E.] Bayer BV, Mijdrecht, Netherlands; [Giesen, Eric B.

Acthar Gel) treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).Methods: Patients aged 18 years with 2 diagnoses for either RA or SLE between July 1, 2006 and April 30, 2015 were identified in the HealthCore Integrated Research Database. Index RCI date was the earliest date of a medical or pharmacy claim for RCI after diagnosis. Baseline characteristics, pre- and post-initiation HRU and costs were assessed using descriptive statistics.Results: This study identified 180 RA patients (mean age=60 years, 56% female) and 29 SLE patients (mean age=45 years, 90% female) who initiated RCI. First RCI use averaged 7.1 and 22.6 months after the initial RA and SLE diagnosis, respectively. After RCI initiation, RA patients incurred significantly lower per-patient-per-month (PPPM) all-cause medical costs ($1,881 vs $682, p<.01) vs the pre-initiation period, driven by lower PPPM hospitalizations costs ($1,579 vs $503, p<.01). Overall PPPM healthcare costs were higher ($2,751 vs $5,487, p<.01) due to higher PPPM prescription costs ($869 vs $4,805, p<.01). Similarly, SLE patients had decreased PPPM hospitalization costs ($3,192 vs $799, p=.04) and increased PPPM prescription costs ($905 vs $7,443, p<.01) after initiating RCI; the difference in overall PPPM healthcare costs was not statistically significant likely, due to small sample size.Conclusion: This study, across a heterogeneous population of variable disease duration, described clinical and healthcare utilization and costs of RA and SLE patients initiating RCI in a real-world setting. We observed that patients receiving RCI had lower utilization and costs for medical services in both disease populations, which partially offset the increased prescription costs by 30% and 37%. Future research is needed to explore factors associated with RCI initiation and its impact on long-term outcomes.","[Wu, Bingcao; Deshpande, Gaurav; Gu, Tao] HealthCore Inc, 123 Justison St,Suite 200, Wilmington, DE 19801 USA; [Popelar, Breanna] Xcenda LLC, Palm Harbor, FL USA; [Philbin, Michael; Wan, George J.] Mallinckrodt Pharmaceut, Hampton, NJ USA","HealthCore, Inc; AmerisourceBergen Corporation; Xcenda, LLC","Deshpande, G (通讯作者)，HealthCore Inc, 123 Justison St,Suite 200, Wilmington, DE 19801 USA.",gdeshpande@healthcore.com,"Deshpande, Gaurav/J-1352-2019",,Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals,Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals,This study was sponsored by Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals.,,25,6,6,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

This problem is very complex because each vehicle trajectory is essentially an infinite-dimensional object and neighboring trajectories have complex interactions (e.g., car-following behavior). A parsimonious shooting heuristic algorithm is proposed to construct vehicle trajectories on a signalized highway segment that comply with boundary conditions for vehicle arrivals, vehicle mechanical limits, traffic lights and vehicle following safety. This algorithm breaks each vehicle trajectory into a few sections that are analytically solvable. This decomposes the originally hard trajectory design problem to a simple constructive heuristic. Then we slightly adapt this shooting heuristic algorithm to efficiently solve a leading vehicle problem on an uninterrupted freeway. To study theoretical properties of the proposed algorithms, the time geography theory is generalized by considering finite accelerations. With this generalized theory, it is found that under mild conditions, these algorithms can always obtain a feasible solution to the original complex trajectory design problem. Further, we discover that the shooting heuristic solution is a generalization of the solution to the classic kinematic wave theory by incorporating finite accelerations. We identify the theoretical bounds to the difference between the shooting heuristic solution and the kinematic wave solution. Numerical experiments are conducted to verify the theoretical results and to draw additional managerial insights into the potential of trajectory design in improving traffic performance. In summary, this paper provides a methodological and theoraical foundation for advanced traffic control by optimizing the trajectories of connected and automated vehicles. Building upon this foundation, an optimization framework will be presented in a following paper as Part II of this study. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In logistics service innovation, external relationships are important sources of resources and knowledge. Drawing on social capital theory and the strategy-structure-performance paradigm, this study proposes that guanxi (Chinese system of social networks and relationships that facilitates business and other dealings), expedites logistics service innovation by 3PL providers in China. This study also proposes that the effect of guanxi on logistics service innovation is contingent on the alignment between the type of guanxi and the provider's organizational structure. We tested our proposed model using survey data from 165 3PL providers in China. Our findings suggest that both political and business guanxi have a positive effect on logistics service innovation; however, those types of guanxi should be used in consideration of the firm's organizational structure. The results suggest that with respect to logistics service innovation, political guanxi is more effective for 3PL providers whose organizational structure is highly centralized or has low formalization. The converse applies to business guanxi.","[Chu, Zhaofang; Feng, Bo; Lai, Fujun] Soochow Univ, Dongwu Business Sch, Res Ctr Smarter Supply Chain, Suzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Lai, Fujun] Univ Southern Mississippi, Coll Business, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA",Soochow University - China; University of Southern Mississippi,"Feng, B (通讯作者)，Soochow Univ, Dongwu Business Sch, Res Ctr Smarter Supply Chain, Suzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",chuzf@suda.edu.cn; neu_fengbo@163.com; Fujun.lai@usm.edu,"Chu, Zhaofang/L-6863-2019; Molina, Nicholle/AAA-7370-2022","Chu, Zhaofang/0000-0002-6193-6983;","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71522002, 71371076, 71772132, 71402174, 71471125]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Bo Feng would like to acknowledge the support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project Nos. 71522002 and 71371076).

The low probability-high consequence nature of such events mandate that a risk averse plan be implemented for routing hazmat shipments. We propose a conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) methodology for routing rail hazmat shipments, using the best train configuration, over a given railroad network using the pre-defined train services such that the transport risk as measured by CVaR is minimized. Freight train derailment records were analyzed to model the behavior of railroad accidents, and to estimate conditional probabilities. The proposed methodology was used to study several problem instances generated using the realistic network of a railroad operator, and to demonstrate that the proposed methodology is superior to other measures for risk-averse routing of hazmat shipments and versatile enough to yield routes based on risk preferences of the decision makers.

Compared to regular car-parks that have only two rows of vehicles in each island, future car-parks (for autonomous vehicles) can have multiple rows of vehicles stacked behind each other. Although this multi-row layout reduces parking space, it can cause blockage if a certain vehicle is barricaded by other vehicles and cannot leave the facility. To release barricaded vehicles, the car-park operator has to relocate some of the vehicles to create a clear pathway for the blocked vehicle to exit. The extent of vehicle relocation depends on the layout design of the car-park. To find the optimal car-park layout with minimum relocations, we present a mixed-integer non-linear program that treats each island in the car-park as a queuing system. We solve the problem using Benders decomposition for an exact answer and we present a heuristic algorithm to find a reasonable upper-bound of the mathematical model. We show that autonomous vehicle car-parks can decrease the need for parking space by an average of 62% and a maximum of 87%. This revitalization of space that was previously used for parking can be socially beneficial if car-parks are converted into commercial and residential land-uses. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: A decision tree model was developed to evaluate the 4-year BI associated with introducing LA + DBM putty to replace currently available grafting methods, including iliac crest bone graft (ICBG), LA alone, and LA combined with beta-tricalcium phosphate (LA + ceramics), with 30%, 40%, and 30% market shares, respectively. The analysis was conducted for a hypothetical cohort of 100 patients with LDDD receiving LSF, assuming LA + DBM would replace 100% of the standard of care mix. The fusion rates extracted from the literature were validated by an expert panel. Costs ((sic)2017) were obtained from different Spanish sources. Budget impact and incremental cost per successful fusion were calculated from the perspective of the Spanish National Health System (NHS). Results: Over 4 years, replacing currently available options with LA + DBM for 100 patients resulted in an additional cost of (sic)12,330 ((sic)123/patient), and an additional 14 successful fusions, implying a cost of (sic)881 per additional successful fusion. When costs of productivity loss were included, the introduction of LA + DBM resulted in cost savings of (sic)70,294 ((sic)703/patient). Limitations: The lack of high-quality, homogeneous, head-to-head research studying the efficacy of grafting procedures available to patients undergoing LSF, in addition to a lack of long-term follow-up in existing studies. Therefore, the number of fusions occurring within the model's time horizon may be underestimated. Conclusions: Acquisition costs of DBM were partially offset by costs of failed fusions, adverse events and reoperation when switching 100 hypothetical LDDD patients undergoing LSF procedures from standard of care grafting methods to LA + DBM from the perspective of the Spanish NHS. DBM cost was entirely offset when costs of lost productivity were considered.","[Geale, Kirk] Umea Univ, Dept Publ Hlth & Clin Med, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Geale, Kirk; Polyzoi, Maria] PAREXEL Int, Stockholm, Sweden; [Alvarez, Maria; Pineda, Cristina] Medtron Iberica, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Madrid, Spain; [Malaga, Xavier] Hosp Quiron Barcelona, Inst Clavel Columna, Barcelona, Spain; [Hernandez, Cesar] Hosp Cieza, Murcia, Spain",Umea University; Parexel International,"Geale, K (通讯作者)，Umea Univ, Dept Publ Hlth & Clin Med, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.",kirk.geale@umu.se,"Geale, Kirk Colgate/V-6701-2019","Geale, Kirk Colgate/0000-0001-7241-8471",Medtronic International Trading SARL,Medtronic International Trading SARL,"The study was funded by Medtronic International Trading SARL.; At the time of writing, KG and MP served as paid consultants to Medtronic as employees of PAREXEL International.

Aims: To examine treatment patterns and evaluate healthcare resource utilization (HRU) and costs among young adults (18-35 years) with schizophrenia who were early in the disease. Materials and methods: Patients aged 18-64 years with >= 2 schizophrenia diagnoses in the identification period (January 1, 2012-September 30, 2015) and continuous enrollment for >= 12 months pre- and post-index date were identified from the OptumInsight Clinformatics DataMart. Demographics, clinical characteristics, HRU, costs, and treatment patterns were compared between schizophrenia and non-schizophrenia controls cohorts and between young (18-35 years) and older adults (36-64 years) with schizophrenia. Results: Among 9,889 schizophrenia patients, 23.70% were young adults (aged 18-35), had higher all-cause per-patient-per-year (PPPY) costs ($22,338 vs $7,332; p < .0001), higher inpatient costs ($8,857 vs $1,289; p < .0001), and longer inpatient length-of-stay (LOS) (5.0 vs 0.4 days, p < .0001; adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] = 12.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 11.5-14.3) than controls. Among young adults with schizophrenia, there were more mental-health-related and fewer non-mental-health-related diagnoses compared to older adults with schizophrenia; 63.40% were male. Young adults with schizophrenia incurred higher inpatient costs ($15,692 vs $10,274; p < .0001) and longer inpatient LOS (9.6 vs 5.9 days, p < .0001; aIRR =1.6; 95% CI =1.4-1.8) compared to older adults with schizophrenia. A substantial proportion of patients were treated with oral antipsychotics vs long-acting injectables in both cohorts (young adults: 98.72% vs 9.71%; older adults: 98.10% vs 13.31%). Limitations: Claims data are collected for payment and not research. The presence of a prescription claim does not indicate medication was consumed or taken as prescribed. Conclusions: The economic burden for schizophrenia patients is substantial, especially among young adults.

This study was performed to determine whether PROGEL use improves hospital length of stay (LOS) and hospitalization costs compared with other synthetic/fibrin sealants in patients undergoing lung surgery. Methods: The US Premier hospital database was used to identify lung surgery discharges from January 1, 2010 to June 30, 2015. Eligible discharges were categorized as PROGEL Sealant or other sealants using hospital billing data. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to control for hospital and patient differences between study groups. Primary outcomes were hospital LOS and all-cause hospitalization costs. Clinical outcomes, hospital re-admissions, and sealant product use were also described. Results: After PSM, a total of 2,670 discharges were included in each study group; baseline characteristics were balanced between groups. The hospital LOS (mean days +/- standard deviation, median) was significantly shorter for the PROGEL group (9.9 +/- 9.6, 7.0) compared with the other sealants group (11.3 +/- 12.8, 8.0; p < .001). Patients receiving PROGEL incurred significantly lower all-cause hospitalization costs ($31,954 +/-$29,696, $23,904) compared with patients receiving other sealants ($36,147 +/-$42,888, $24,702; p < .001). Limitations: It is not possible to say that sealant type alone was responsible for the findings of this study, and analysis was restricted to the data available in the Premier database. Conclusions: Among hospital discharges for lung surgery, PROGEL use was associated with significantly shorter hospital LOS and lower hospitalization costs compared with other synthetic/fibrin sealants, without compromising clinical outcomes.","[Mortman, Keith D.] George Washington Univ Hosp, Div Thorac Surg, Washington, DC 20037 USA; [Corral, Mitra; Zhang, Xiaohong; Berhane, Indrias] Becton Dickinson, Murray Hill, NJ USA; [Soleas, Ireena M.; Ferko, Nicole C.] Cornerstone Res Grp Inc, Burlington, ON, Canada",George Washington University; Becton Dickinson; Cornerstone Research Group,"Mortman, KD (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ Hosp, 2150 Penn Ave NW,Suite 6-305, Washington, DC 20037 USA.",kmortman@mfa.gwu.edu,"Zhang, Xiaohong/A-3060-2015",,Davol Inc.,Davol Inc.,"Funding was provided by Davol Inc., a subsidiary of C.

Schemes with different ridesharing payments and shared parking prices are investigated. Besides the scheme with constant parking charges and ridesharing payments, dynamic parking charges and ridesharing payments are derived to achieve congestion-free traffic in the corridor. With the dynamic ridesharing ratios, it is found that genuinely nonlinear departure rates and travel time functions can be generated in certain ridesharing cases, which was not observed in the traditional ADL model (Arnott et al., 1990) for the morning commute problems without ridesharing or with constant ridesharing ratios. Moreover, comparing different configurations of ridesharing arrangements and parking charges, the results show that constant parking charges with constant ridesharing payments may not significantly improve system performance over the traditional morning commute with solo-drivers, while dynamic parking charges with properly selected constant ridesharing payments can achieve better system performance in terms of vehicle-miles-traveled, vehicle-hours-traveled and total travel costs, by encouraging ridesharing and spreading vehicular demand over time to eliminate queuing delays.

To date, however, no approach has been proposed that incorporates the joint modelling of in-travel activity type, activity duration and productivity behaviour. To address this critical gap, we draw on a recently developed PPS framework (Pawlak et al., 2015) to develop a new joint model of activity type choice, duration and productivity. In our framework, we use copulas to provide a flexible link between a discrete choice model of activity type choice, a hazard-based model for activity duration, and a log-linear model of productivity. Our model is readily amenable to estimation, which we demonstrate using data from the 2008 UK Study of Productive Use of Rail Travel-time. We hence show how journey-, respondent-, attitude-, and ICT-related factors are related to expected in travel time allocation to work and non-work activities, and the associated productivity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework that both captures the effects of different factors on activity choice, duration and productivity, and models links between these aspects of behaviour. Furthermore, the convenient interpretation of the parameters in the form of semi-elasticities enables the comparison of effects associated with the presence of on-board facilities (e.g., workspace, connectivity) or equipment use, facilitating use of the model outputs in applied contexts.

As is well known, due to the asymmetric nature of the travel cost functions, multiple equilibria exist. In this case, without external force, the traffic system cannot converge to the traffic equilibrium state as desired by traffic management through a day-to-day adjustment process if the initial traffic state does not fall into its attraction domain (Bie and Lo, 2010). Therefore, it is imperative for traffic management to propose a traffic control measure to ensure the desired traffic state can be achieved regardless of the initial traffic state. Previous studies on the day-to-day dynamic congestion pricing, either worked on continues-time day-to-day pricing scheme, or took the form of discrete-time day-to-day pricing scheme but did not guarantee the convergence to the desired objective traffic state for the cases when multiple traffic equilibria exist. Both are undesirable. This study aims to develop a discrete-time day-to-day pricing scheme so as to direct the traffic evolution to reach the desired equilibrium from any initial traffic state when multiple traffic equilibria exist. Based on the very general formulation of day-today traffic dynamics model, we present a general formulation of such day-to-day pricing schemes and propose a method to obtain one specific road pricing scheme. Moreover, we present rigorous proofs and numerical tests to verify the proposed pricing scheme. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Han, Linghui; Wang, David Z.

A method is first developed to uncover more than three hundred valid paired alternative segments (PAS), on which the proportionality condition is tested by performing linear regression analysis and chi-square tests. The results show that the majority of the PASs tested (up to 85%) satisfy the proportionality condition at a reasonable level of statistical significance. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed Passenger-to-Train Assignment Model (PTAM) is probabilistic and links each fare transaction to a set of feasible train itineraries. The method estimates the probability of the passenger boarding each feasible train, and the probability distribution of the number of trains a passenger is unable to board due to capacity constraints. The access/egress time distributions are important inputs to the model. The paper also suggests a maximum likelihood approach to estimate these distributions from AFC and AVL data. The methodology is applied in a case study with data from a major, congested, subway system during peak hours. Based on actual AFC and train tracking data, synthetic data was generated to validate the model. The results, both in terms of the trains passengers are assigned to and train loads, are similar to the true observations from the synthetic data. The probability of a passenger being left behind (due to capacity constraints) in the actual system is also estimated by time of day and compared with survey data collected by the agency at the same station. The left behind probabilities can be accurately estimated from the assignment results. Furthermore, it is shown that the PTAM output can also be used to estimate crowding metrics at transfer stations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Taking the Chinese railway system (CRS) as an example, the proposed framework has been applied and the results show that the solution of the proposed framework is more responsive to the earthquake impact on railway system compared to topology-based methods.

However, the pervasive influence of goals in decision processes is generally not explicitly recognized at the level of demand model formulation and specification. In applied economics generally, and transportation specifically, demand models relate product/service attributes directly to behavior, using utility (or value) as a shorthand representation for the impact of goals. In this paper we argue that this is a limiting view that restricts our thinking about decision making and, hence, our representation and inference-making about that behavior. We support this argument by reinterpreting and/or extending various applications of hybrid models in transportation to a goal-based framework and formulating goal-based choice models which recognize that goals (1) are drivers of choice, (2) explain the choice of strategy, (3) are part of the constraint set and (4) contribute to explaining impacts of the decision context on the allocation of cognitive resources by the decision maker.

A spatial equilibrium model is embedded in a political economy framework in which special interest groups (urban and suburban retailers, local residents) lobby the city government. We have the following results. If downtown and suburban stores sell a homogeneous good, the local government underprices downtown parking if suburban stores operate with low enough markups. If goods are heterogeneous and some consumers engage in multiple-stop shopping (i.e., shop both downtown and in the suburbs), suburban stores will not lobby at all; lobbying by downtown retailers leads to parking fees below the social optimum. Furthermore, local residents do not necessarily lobby for high parking fees on downtown shoppers. If a decline in urban stores leads to negative externalities (urban blight) they may join forces with downtown retailers and lobby against high parking fees on shoppers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The bottleneck model of road congestion is amended by considering stochastic travel times. We thereby take into account the influence of travel time variability on the congestion profile. The cost of travel time variability is the same with exogenous or endogenous congestion for two classes of preferences: linear marginal utility of time (MUT) at work and constant-exponential MUT. Therefore, cost-benefit analyses of travel time reliability improvements yield consistent results even if departure time adjustments are not accounted for. For alpha - beta - gamma preferences, departure time adjustments decrease congestion, which strongly mitigates the cost of travel time variability. Cost-benefit analyses need in this case to explicitly consider the departure time choice, to avoid being biased for the rush hour period (when congestion is strong). A method is proposed to correct this bias when necessary. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: Patients (>= 18 years) with >= 1 inpatient or >= 2 outpatient CML diagnoses were identified from the MarketScan Commercial and Medicare databases (January 1, 2007-June 30, 2015). CML patients were grouped into two study cohorts, those with evidence of disease progression to the blast phase and those without. Patients were required to have continuous medical and prescription coverage during a 12-month baseline period, in which demographics and clinical characteristics were evaluated. All-cause healthcare resource utilization and costs were evaluated during the baseline period, and a variable follow-up period, lasting >= 1 day and up to 1 year. Generalized linear models (GLM) were used to compare the incremental costs of CML patients with vs without progression. Results: Of the overall study population, 587 (7%) experienced disease progression and 7,504 (93%) did not. On the index date, of patients with progression, similar to 31% were treated with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant and 69% with chemotherapy. During the baseline period, mean total healthcare costs, including costs for hospitalizations and outpatient costs, were significantly greater for CML patients with progression as compared to those without progression ($143,778 vs $53,143, p < .001). During the follow-up, mean total healthcare costs, costs for hospitalizations, and outpatient medical service costs were substantially greater for patients with progression as compared to those without progression; however, costs for outpatient prescriptions were less for patients who progressed. When patient characteristics were controlled for, mean incremental 1-year cost for CML patients with vs without progression was $270,925 (confidence interval = $235,290-$311,958, p < .001). Conclusions: The healthcare burden, in terms of healthcare resource utilization and costs, of patients with CML progression is substantial. Healthcare providers and payers should consider various strategies to minimize the rate of CML progression.","[Jabbour, Elias J.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Lin, Jay; Lingohr-Smith, Melissa; Menges, Brandy] Novosys Hlth, Green Brook, NJ USA; [Siegartel, Lisa R.; Makenbaeva, Dinara] Bristol Myers Squibb, Lawrenceville, NJ USA",University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center; Bristol-Myers Squibb,"Jabbour, EJ (通讯作者)，Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Leukemia, Box 428,1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",ejabbour@mdanderson.org,"Jabbour, Elias/IWM-6804-2023",,Bristol-Myers Squibb,Bristol-Myers Squibb(Bristol-Myers Squibb),This study was funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb.,,9,12,12,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

A secondary aim was to compare the predictive validity of existing mappings from EORTC-QLQ-C30 to EQ-5D-3L conducted in other cancers. Methods and materials: Questionnaires (completed within 529 patients) were used in a linear mixed regression to model EQ-5D-3L utility values (scored using the UK tariff) as a function of the five function scores, nine symptom scores, and the global score from the EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire. A Tobit regression was also performed. The mean EQ-5D-3L values for the SIRFLOX trial were calculated and compared with predicted EQ-5D-3L values derived using published mapping algorithms. Results: The linear mixed regression model provided a satisfactory mapping between the EORTC-QLQ-C30 and the EQ-5D-3L, whilst the Tobit model did not perform as well. When utilities from the SIRFLOX data were calculated with previously published mapping studies, three out of five studies performed well (< 10% mean difference). Limitations: The main limitation of the study was the lack of meaningful observations post-progression (67 paired observations). For this reason, this study was unable to test whether the mapping holds by disease stage. Additionally, although the study adds to the literature of mappings to the EQ-5D-3L, it is not known how results would differ using the EQ-5D-5L. Conclusion: This study is the first of its kind in liver-only or liver-dominant mCRC, and mCRC in general. The mapping constructed showed a good fit to the data and provides practitioners with an additional mapping between EORTC-QLQ-C30 to EQ-5D-3L using a large dataset (529 patients, 707 paired observations). The study also confirmed the generalizability of mappings published by Proskorovsky, Kontodimopoulos, and Longworth to liver-only or liver-dominant mCRC.","[Marriott, Emily-Ruth; Hatswell, Anthony J.] BresMed, North Church House,84 Queen St, Sheffield S1 2DW, S Yorkshire, England; [van Hazel, Guy] Univ Western Australia, Sch Med & Pharmacol, Perth, WA, Australia; [Gibbs, Peter] Western Hosp, Dept Med Oncol, Footscray, Vic, Australia; [Hatswell, Anthony J.] UCL, London, England",University of Western Australia; Western Hospital; University of London; University College London,"Hatswell, AJ (通讯作者)，BresMed, North Church House,84 Queen St, Sheffield S1 2DW, S Yorkshire, England.",ahatswell@bresmed.com,,"Hatswell, Anthony/0000-0003-1129-326X",Sirtex Europe,Sirtex Europe,This manuscript was funded by Sirtex Europe.,,22,17,19,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The objective of this cross-sectional study was to assess if more frequent vs infrequent use of relief medication in maintenance-treated COPD patients, split by the severity dyspnea, was associated with an increase in the overall disease burden. Methods: A population-based cross-sectional survey (Adelphi DSP) was conducted among patients with COPD in five European countries. Information was collected on demographic and clinical characteristics, reliever inhaler use, dyspnea (mMRC), health status (CAT, EQ-5D), sleep quality (JSEQ) and healthcare resource use including moderate-severe COPD exacerbations, physician visits, COPD medications and other COPD related resources. The humanistic and economic burden was compared between patients with infrequent reliever use (<1 occasion/week) and more frequent use (1 occasion/week). The association between increased reliever use and economic burden was also examined after matching patients based on propensity-scores balancing demographic and disease burden characteristics. Results: Among the 1373 COPD patients prescribed a reliever inhaler, 29% reported using reliever medication 1 occasion/week. In the unmatched cohort, more frequent reliever use (n=377) compared to infrequent use (n=996) was linked to poorer health status (CAT: 25.7 vs 20.0; p<.0001; EQ-5D-3L: 0.63 vs 0.82; p<.0001) and poorer sleep quality (JSEQ: 8.6 vs 4.6 units; p<.0001). More frequent reliever use was also associated with higher annual rates of moderate/severe exacerbations (1.6 vs 1.0 events/year; p<.0001) and respiratory specialist visits (2.8 vs 2.2 events/year; p=.0001). In the propensity-score matched population, more frequent reliever use was also associated with significantly higher annual costs for COPD management (Euro5,034 vs Euro3,705, p=.0327) compared to patients with infrequent reliever use. Conclusion: In moderate-to-severe COPD, more frequent reliever use is associated with increased exacerbation risk and increased management costs.","[Punekar, Yogesh Suresh] GlaxoSmithKline R&D, Value Evidence & Outcomes, Brentford, England; [Naya, Ian] GlaxoSmithKline, Resp Med, Brentford, England; [Small, Mark; Holbrook, Tim; Wood, Robert] Adelphi Real World, Macclesfield, Cheshire, England; [Mullerova, Hana] GlaxoSmithKline R&D, Worldwide Epidemiol, Uxbridge, Middx, England; [Valle, Manuel] Hosp Univ Puerta Hierro, Pneumol Dept, Madrid, Spain",GlaxoSmithKline; GlaxoSmithKline; Adelphi Group Ltd; GlaxoSmithKline; Hospital Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda,"Punekar, YS (通讯作者)，GlaxoSmithKline, Value Evidence & Outcomes, Great West Rd, Brentford TW8 9GS, England.",yogesh.q.punekar@gsk.com,,"Valle, Manuel/0000-0002-0900-146X; Punekar, Yogesh/0000-0002-7531-1319; Mullerova, Hana/0000-0002-0949-0101",GlaxoSmithKline,GlaxoSmithKline(GlaxoSmithKline),Funding for this study and article processing charges were provided by GlaxoSmithKline.,,50,6,7,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The Bike sharing Rebalancing Problem with Stochastic Demands is a variant of the one-commodity many-to-many pickup and delivery vehicle routing problem where demands at each station are represented by random variables, with associated probability distributions, that depend on stochastic scenarios. We develop stochastic programming models that are solved using different approaches, in particular, the L-Shaped and branch-and-cut. Moreover, we also propose heuristic algorithms based on an innovative use of positive and negative correlations among stations' stochastic demands, as well as an efficient strategy for checking feasibility.

However, travel time uncertainty has not been considered in existing ride-sharing models, leading to an inaccurate estimation of the benefit from ride-sharing and irrational ride-sharing matches. To fill in the gap, this paper proposes a stochastic ride-sharing model, in which travel time is assumed to be stochastic and follow a time-independent general distribution that has a positive lower bound. Due to travel time uncertainty, travelers may not arrive at their destinations on time. Different from the traditional models taking time windows as hard constraints, the proposed ride-sharing system only requires each participant announcing a role and the desired arrival time window. In the model, the generalized trip cost consists of the cost of driving a vehicle, the cost of travel time, and the cost of schedule delay early and late. This study investigates the effect of the unit variable cost of driving, travelers' values of time (VOTs), and travel time uncertainty on the cost saving of ride-sharing trips compared to driving-alone trips. A bi-objective ride sharing matching model is proposed to maximize both the total generalized trip cost saving and the number of matches. The proposed ride-sharing model is further extended to consider time-dependent travel time uncertainty, and the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) method is developed to evaluate the mean generalized trip cost. Finally, numerical examples are provided to illustrate the properties of the two proposed models. The results show that the unit variable cost of driving, travelers' VOTs, travel time uncertainty, and the selection of the weight in the objective function have significant impacts on the performance of the proposed ride-sharing system with travel time uncertainty. The results also show that a feasible ride-sharing match based on deterministic travel time can become infeasible in a stochastic ride-sharing system. It is therefore important to consider travel time uncertainty when determining the matches. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent needs for forecasting travel behaviors in the era of autonomous vehicles and more prevalent sharing economy are examples. However, it is well known that the framing effect in surveys could be significant when asking the same question with different modes, instruments, and wordings. Moreover, systematic deviation is observed when stated preference and revealed preference are compared, per a growing body of studies, due to the framing effect, the change of decision context, and the altered mental states of participants. These situations resemble two prevalent quantum phenomena - measurement influences the state of a system, and different observation sequences on a system render different results. This paper proposes a quantum cognition model consistent with quantum logic and demonstrates its usefulness in the quantitative study of stated and revealed preference. Examples show how to calibrate the model and forecast revealed preference when only stated preference is available. Although the proposed model is not limited to the number of questions, the examples focus on single-question scenarios. This paper takes a utilitarian perspective on quantum mechanics and demonstrates how it could improve survey designs and prediction on revealed preference. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Different facility sizes can be chosen for each candidate location and for each size there is an associated annual facility costs that can capture economies of scale in facility size. Because of the strategic nature of facility location, the opened facilities should be able to handle the current maintenance demand, but also the demand for any of the scenarios that can occur in the future. These scenarios capture changes such as changes to the line plan and the introduction of new rolling stock types. We allow recovery in the form of opening additional facilities, closing facilities, and increasing the facility size for each scenario. We provide a two-stage robust programming formulation. In the first-stage, we decide where to open what size of facility. In the second-stage, we solve a NP-hard maintenance location routing problem. We reformulate the problem as a mixed integer program that can be used to make an efficient column-and-constraint generation algorithm. To show that our algorithm works on practical sized instances, and to gain managerial insights, we perform a case study with instances from the Netherlands Railways. A counter intuitive insight is that economies of scale only play a limited role and that it is more important to reduce the transportation cost by building many small facilities, rather than a few large ones to profit from economies of scale.

To correct for this problem, the researcher needs to gather exogenous instrumental variables, which should be independent of the error term of the model. This critical assumption can be tested using overidentification tests that rely on having more instruments than endogenous variables. For discrete choice models, instruments' exogeneity can be assessed using the Amemiya-Lee-Newey test, which relies in the estimation of an auxiliary GMM model build from reduced-form estimates. This paper proposes two alternative tests that are constructed as adaptations of the Refutability test and the Hausman test, into the discrete choice framework. The Refutability test consists in including instruments as additional variables in an auxiliary model that was corrected for endogeneity using all instruments available. The Hausman test is built from the comparison of the estimates attained using different subsets of instruments. Using a binary choice Monte Carlo experiment, the three tests are assessed in terms of size, power, and robustness to De Blander's condition for which all overidentification tests of this kind are blind. Results show that what is termed the modified Refutability test, which includes all instruments simultaneously, has smaller size distortion, larger power, and more robustness, compared to the state of the art Amemiya-Lee-Newey test and to the proposed Hausman test. Besides, the Amemiya-Lee-Newey and both versions of the Refutability test allow being agnostic about which instrument might be exogenous. The paper finishes highlighting the methodological and practical implications and limitations of these findings and suggesting future lines of research in this area. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the proposed formulations that model risk-averse users lack (i) a consistent representation of the various stochastic quantities involved and (ii) a general solution approach. In this context, this study formulates a consistent, reliability-based user-equilibrium problem with risk-averse travelers. In the proposed formulation, various stochastic quantities are consistent with each other: the stochastic origin-destination demands result in stochastic path-flows and in turn stochastic link-flows, which result in stochastic link travel times, and travelers make decisions based on the stochasticity of travel times. The formulation also incorporates (i) endogenous link-flow variances and covariances and (ii) flow-dependent and endogenous link travel time correlations. At equilibrium-which is defined over the distributions of travel times and flows-no user can improve her travel time reliability by unilaterally changing route. The conditions for existence of a solution to the formulated problem are presented. A gradient projection based algorithm is proposed to solve the formulated problem, which is demonstrated to be correct and efficient through computational experiments. We also show that ignoring consistency in the formulation can lead to potentially erroneous conclusions. Experiments also demonstrate that the solution can be sensitive to the demand levels, stochasticity in demand, and users' degree of risk-aversion. This work has the potential to make existing reliability-based user-equilibrium formulations more general and operational. It also has important applications in reliability-based traffic planning and management. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Prakash, A.

Absent opportunities for capacity expansion, this may require the use of demand management measures to restore the balance between scheduled traffic and available capacity. The main demand management mechanism in use today is the administrative schedule coordination process operated by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which is in place at the great majority of busy airports outside the United States. This paper proposes a novel multi-objective Priority based Slot Allocation Model (PSAM) that optimizes slot allocation, while complying with the complex set of priorities and requirements specified by the IATA guidelines, as well as with the declared capacity constraints at the airports. It presents an efficient computational approach that provides optimal slot allocation solutions at airports significantly larger than has been possible to date. The model is applied to two Portuguese airports, a small one (Madeira) and a mid-size one (Porto) using highly detailed data on airline slot requests and airport capacity constraints. Results suggest that PSAM can improve the efficiency of current practice by providing slot allocations that match better the slot requests of airlines. Equally important, PSAM can also quantify the sensitivity of slot allocation decisions to the various priorities and requirements specified in the IATA guidelines. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, these timetables only maximize the probability of a passenger to take the train, but provide no insight on the actual choices of the passengers. Therefore, in this manuscript we replace the deterministic passenger satisfaction function with a probabilistic demand forecasting model inside of the passenger centric train timetable design. The actual forecasts lead to a realistic train occupation. Knowing the train occupation, we can estimate the revenue and to use pricing as a mobility management to further improve the level-of-service. We use a logit model that we calibrate to reflect the known demand elasticities. We further include a competing operator as an opt-out option for the passengers. Subsequently, we integrate the passenger centric train timetabling problem with a ticket pricing problem. We solve the elastic passenger centric train timetabling problem for various types of timetables using a simulated annealing heuristic on a case study of Israeli Railways. The results of our case study show that the generated revenues can be increased by up to 15% when taking into account the passengers' behavior along with a specific pricing scheme. This study further confirms the advantages of hybrid cyclicity. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

A hybrid approach is used to study the problem: analytical approach to capture the behavior of merging and diverging LCs and numerical simulations to quantify capacity-drop considering various geometric configurations of extended bottlenecks. This study focuses on the impact of LC vehicles' bounded acceleration on void (wasted space) creation in traffic streams when they insert/desert at a lower speed, and interactions among multiple voids. We found that (1) LCs closer to the downstream end of bottlenecks are more likely to create persisting voids and contribute to capacity-drop. (2) For weave bottlenecks, capacity-drop is governed by two counteracting effects of LCs: persisting voids and utilization of vacancies created by diverging vehicles: (3) the more balanced the merging and diverging flows, the lower the capacity-drop; and (4) capacity-drop is minimum if merging LCs occur downstream of diverging LCs, and maximum in the opposite alignment.

(3) To identify patient, physician, and hospital predictors of conversion. Materials and methods: A US-based database study was conducted utilizing the 2012-2014 Premier Healthcare Data, including rectal cancer patients 18 with rectal resection. ICD-9-CM diagnosis and procedural codes were utilized to identify surgical approaches, conversions to OS, and surgical complications. Propensity score matching on patient, surgeon, and hospital level characteristics was used to create comparable groups of RA\LS patients (n = 533 per group). Predictors of conversion from LS and RA to OS were identified with stepwise logistic regression in the unmatched sample. Results: Post-match results suggested comparable perioperative complication rates (RA 29% vs LS 29%; p = .7784); whereas conversion rates to OS were 12% for RA vs 29% for LS (p<.0001). Colorectal surgeons (RA 9% vs LS 23%), general surgeons (RA 13% vs LS 35%), and smaller bed-size hospitals (RA 14% vs LS 33%) have reduced conversion rates for RA vs LS (p<.0001). Statistically significant predictors of conversion included LS, non-colorectal surgeon, and smaller bed-size hospitals. Limitations: Retrospective observational study limitations apply. Analysis of the hospital administrative database was subject to the data captured in the database and the accuracy of coding. Propensity score matching limitations apply. RA and LS groups were balanced with respect to measured patient, surgeon, and hospital characteristics. Conclusions: Compared to LS, RA offers a higher probability of completing a successful minimally invasive surgery for rectal cancer patients undergoing rectal resection without exacerbating complications. Male, obese, or moderately-to-severely ill patients had higher conversion rates. While colorectal surgeons had lower conversion rates from RA than LS, the reduction was magnified for general surgeons and smaller bed-size hospitals.","[Ackerman, Stacey J.] Covance Market Access Serv Inc, 10300 Campus Point Dr,Suite 225, San Diego, CA 92121 USA; [Daniel, Shoshana; Baik, Rebecca] Covance Market Access Serv, Gaithersburg, MD USA; [Liu, Emelline; Tackett, Scott] Intuit Surg, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Sunnyvale, CA USA; [Mehendale, Shilpa] Intuit Surg, Clin Affairs, Sunnyvale, CA USA; [Hellan, Minia] Wright State Univ, Surg Oncol, Centerville, OH USA","Covance; Covance; Intuitive Surgical, Inc.; Intuitive Surgical, Inc.; University System of Ohio; Wright State University Dayton","Ackerman, SJ (通讯作者)，Covance Market Access Serv Inc, 10300 Campus Point Dr,Suite 225, San Diego, CA 92121 USA.",stacey.ackerman@covance.com,,,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc (Sunnyvale, CA)","Intuitive Surgical, Inc (Sunnyvale, CA)","This study was sponsored by Intuitive Surgical, Inc (Sunnyvale, CA).",,37,24,25,1,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Yet, it remains largely under-utilized, in spite of its proven efficacy. The referrals for epilepsy surgery are often delayed until it is too late to prevent the detrimental psychosocial effects of refractory seizures. The reluctance towards epilepsy surgery is influenced by the perceived risks of the procedure by practitioners and patients. This review discusses how, in general decision-making processes, one faces a natural tendency towards emphasizing the risks of the most immediate and operational decision (surgery), at times without contrasting these risks with the alternative (uncontrolled epilepsy). Methods: In the field of economics, this bias is well recognized and can be overcome through marginal analysis, formally defined as focusing on incremental changes as opposed to absolute levels. Results: Regarding epilepsy surgery, the risks and benefits of surgery are considered separately from the risks of uncontrolled epilepsy. For instance, even though surgery carries an similar to 0.1-0.5% risk of perioperative mortality, the chance of sudden unexpected death with refractory epilepsy can be as high as 0.6-0.9% per year. It is suggested that the inadequate way of phrasing clinical questions can be a crucial contributing factor for the under-utilization of epilepsy surgery. Significance: It is proposed that examining decision-making for epilepsy surgery in the context of marginal analysis may enable providers and patients to make more accurate informed decisions.","[Edwards, Jonathan C.; Bonilha, Leonardo] Med Univ South Carolina, Dept Neurol, Charleston, SC 29425 USA; [Sobel, Russell S.] The Citadel, Sch Business, Charleston, SC USA",Medical University of South Carolina,"Edwards, JC; Bonilha, L (通讯作者)，Med Univ South Carolina, Comprehens Epilepsy Ctr, 96 Jonathan Lucas St, Charleston, SC 29466 USA.",edwardjc@musc.edu; bonilha@musc.edu,,"Sobel, Russell/0000-0001-6820-5414",Comprehensive Epilepsy Center at the Medical University of South Carolina,Comprehensive Epilepsy Center at the Medical University of South Carolina,We would like to thank the Comprehensive Epilepsy Center at the Medical University of South Carolina for supporting this research.

Methods: Adult patients (18-64 years of age) enrolled in the Marketscan Commercial and Medicare Databases with >= 2 non-diagnostic outpatient (>= 30 days apart between the two outpatient claims) or >= 1 inpatient diagnoses of cluster headache (ICD-9-CM code 339.00, 339.01, or 339.02) between January 1, 2009 and June 30, 2014, were included in the analyses. Patients had >= 6 months of continuous enrollment with medical and pharmacy coverage before and after the index date (first cluster headache diagnosis). Three outcomes were evaluated: (1) healthcare resource utilization, (2) direct healthcare costs, and (3) indirect costs associated with work days lost due to absenteeism and short-term disability. Direct costs included costs of all-cause and cluster headache-related outpatient, inpatient hospitalization, surgery, and pharmacy claims. Indirect costs were based on an average daily wage, which was estimated from the 2014 US Bureau of Labor Statistics and inflated to 2015 dollars. Results: There were 9,328 patients with cluster headache claims included in the analysis. Cluster headache-related total direct costs (mean [standard deviation]) were $3,132 [$13,396] per patient per year (PPPY), accounting for 17.8% of the all-cause total direct cost. Cluster headache-related inpatient hospitalizations ($1,604) and pharmacy ($809) together ($2,413) contributed over 75% of the cluster headache- related direct healthcare cost. There were three sub-groups of patients with claims associated with indirect costs that included absenteeism, short-term disability, and absenteeism + short-term disability. Indirect costs PPPY were $4,928 [$4,860] for absenteeism, $803 [$2,621] for short-term disability, and $ 3,374 [$ 3,198] for absenteeism + disability. Conclusion: Patients with cluster headache have high healthcare costs that are associated with inpatient admissions and pharmacy fulfillments, and high indirect costs associated with absenteeism and short-term disability.","[Ford, Janet H.; Ahl, Jonna; Martinez, James M.] Eli Lilly & Co, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA; [Nero, Damion; Kim, Gilwan; Chu, Bong Chul; Fowler, Robert] Truven Hlth Analyt, Ann Arbor, MI USA",Eli Lilly,"Ford, JH (通讯作者)，Eli Lilly & Co, Real World Evidence Biomed, Lilly Corp Ctr, Drop Code 1730, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA.",ford_janet@lilly.com,,,"Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN","Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN(Eli Lilly)","The study sponsor (Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN) funded the study and was involved in the study design, data interpretation, and writing of the article.

This study aimed to characterize health utilities in ACS patients to aid development of future economic models estimating the cost per quality-adjusted life-year impact of ACS events and potential treatments. Methods: Multi-center, non-interventional, longitudinal evaluation of health utility in patients experiencing ACS or stroke events. EuroQol-5 dimension 3 level (EQ-5D-3L) surveys were sent to patients (>= 18 years) from three UK centers, 1 month after hospital discharge for myocardial infarction (MD, unstable angina (UA), or stroke. Patient demographics, lifestyle, and baseline utility score were collected in the first survey. Follow-up surveys were sent at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months to prospectively capture utility and subsequent health events. Two methods of patient identification were adopted-prospective, where the patient's qualifying events occurred after the study index date, and retrospective, where the patient's qualifying event occurred prior to the study index date. General healthy population utility values were assumed for pre-event HRQoL. Results: Between January 2011 and March 2014, 2,103 prospectively (n=1,350)/retrospectively (n = 753) identified patients (mean age = 68.3 years; 67.9% male) responded: MI = 55.9% (n = 1 ,17 6), UA = 42.7% (n = 898), stroke =1.4% (n = 29); 24% had type 2 diabetes. Post-event utility values were lower than general healthy population values, although significant differences in utility between subsequent 6 (n = 1,031, change = -0.002), 12 (n = 1,096, change = -0.008), 18 (n =1,246, change = -0.007), and 24 (n = 1,277, change = -0.004) month timepoints were not detected. Through multivariate regression analyses, wheelchair use, current smoking, and secondary mental and joint health events were associated with the greatest statistically significant utility decrements. Conclusions: This study indicates that health utility decreases following a cardiovascular event and, although some improvement occurs over the subsequent 24 months, general healthy population utility is not necessarily attained.","[Pockett, Rhys D.] Swansea Univ, Swansea, W Glam, Wales; [McEwan, Phil] Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res Ltd, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Ray, Joshua; Shutler, Simon] F Hoffmann La Roche, Basel, Switzerland; [Tran, Irwin] Roche Prod Ltd, Welwyn Garden City, Herts, England; [Martin, Steven] Peterborough & Stamford Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Peterborough, Cambs, England; [Yousef, Zaheer] Univ Hosp Wales, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Bakhai, Ameet] Royal Free London NHS Fdn Trust, Barnet, England",Swansea University; Health Economics & Outcomes Research Ltd; Roche Holding; Roche Holding; Cardiff University; University of London; University College London; Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust,"Pockett, RD (通讯作者)，Swansea Univ, Coll Human & Hlth Sci, Swansea Ctr Hlth Econ, Singleton Pk, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales.",r.d.pockett@swansea.ac.uk,"Pockett, Rhys/F-1703-2018","Pockett, Rhys/0000-0003-4135-7383",Roche Products Ltd.,Roche Products Ltd.,This study was sponsored by Roche Products Ltd.

Materials and methods: Patients with a diagnosis of selected autoimmune and inflammatory diseases between 1 January 2006 and 30 September 2015 (study period) were selected from a de-identified, privately-insured claims database. Patients were stratified into four treatment cohorts based on the dosing and duration of continuous corticosteroid use following disease diagnosis: intermittent use with < 60 days of corticosteroid use and >= 60 days of corticosteroid use with low (<= 7.5 mg/day), medium (>7.5-<= 15mg/day), or high (>15mg/day) dosage. Patients were followed from the date of their highest dose episode of corticosteroid use (treatment index date) until the earliest of the end of continuous corticosteroid use +30 days, disenrollment from health plan, or the end of the study period (follow-up period). HCRU and costs in the follow-up period were compared across treatment cohorts. Results: Of 78,704 patients who were identified for study inclusion, 29% had extended corticosteroid use lasting >= 60 days, and 71% had intermittent use. On average, patients in the high-dose cohort incurred twice the cost of intermittent users ($68,408 vs $32,690 in annualized total all-cause healthcare costs, USD). Adverse event-related medical costs accounted for similar to 40% of medical costs, and were higher than disease-related medical costs for all cohorts with extended corticosteroid exposure. Comparing the high-dose and low-dose cohorts, the smaller savings in disease-related prescriptions ($1,680) occurred along with a much larger cost in adverse event-related spend ($13,464). Limitations: The impact of corticosteroids may be under-estimated because of conservative follow-up duration, and administrative data may contain inaccuracies in coding. Conclusions: Steroid use, especially at higher doses, is associated with higher HCRU and costs.","[Rice, J.

The multiple manifestations of TSC and impacts to numerous organ systems represent significant disease, healthcare, and treatment burden. The economic and employment burden of the disease on individuals and their families is poorly understood. This study assessed the cost of illness and work and school productivity burden associated with TSC in a cross-sectional web-survey sample. Materials and methods: Eligible TSC individuals and caregivers were invited through the Tuberous Sclerosis Alliance advocacy group to complete a web-based survey about illness characteristics, treatment, disease burden, direct and indirect healthcare costs, work and school impairment. Results: Data from 609 TSC adults or caregiver respondents with no cognitive impairments were analyzed. TSC adults (>18 years of age) had significantly higher direct out-of-pocket costs for ER visits, expenses for medical tests and procedures, alternative treatments, medications and lifetime cost of surgeries compared to TSC pediatric individuals. Both TSC adults and TSC caregivers reported work and school absenteeism and presenteeism; however, adults reported significantly higher absenteeism and presenteeism and overall activity impairment due to TSC, as might be expected, compared to TSC caregivers. TSC adults had significantly higher absenteeism and presenteeism rates compared to adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and muscular sclerosis. Conclusions: TSC results in considerable direct out-of-pocket medical costs and impairment to work productivity, especially for adults. Future studies should include the comparator group and examine direct cost burden in the US using electronic medical records and insurance databases.","[Skalicky, Anne M.; Rentz, Anne M.] Evidera, 1417 Fourth Ave,Suite 510, Seattle, WA 98101 USA; [Liu, Zhimei; Said, Qayyim] Novartis Oncol, E Hanover, NJ USA; [Nakagawa, Jo Anne] Tuberous Sclerosis Alliance, Silver Spring, MD USA; [Frost, Michael D.] Minnesota Epilepsy Grp, St Paul, MN USA; [Wheless, James W.] Le Bonheur Childrens Hosp, Memphis, TN USA; [Wheless, James W.] Univ Tennessee, Ctr Hlth Sci, Memphis, TN 38163 USA; [Dunn, David W.] Riley Hosp Children, Indianapolis, IN USA",Evidera; Novartis; Minnesota Epilepsy Group; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Health Science Center; James Whitcomb Riley Hospital Children,"Skalicky, AM (通讯作者)，Evidera, 1417 Fourth Ave,Suite 510, Seattle, WA 98101 USA.",anne.skalicky@evidera.com,"frost, michael/AAG-4031-2021",,"Novartis Oncology; Evidera; Eli Lilly; Shainberg Foundation; Mallinckrodt; LivaNova; Upsher-Smith; GW Pharma; INSYS, Inc; Neuralis; Zogenix; NeuroPace; Tuberous Sclerosis Alliance","Novartis Oncology; Evidera; Eli Lilly(Eli Lilly); Shainberg Foundation; Mallinckrodt; LivaNova; Upsher-Smith; GW Pharma; INSYS, Inc; Neuralis; Zogenix; NeuroPace; Tuberous Sclerosis Alliance","Funding for this study was provided by Novartis Oncology.; AMR and AMS are employed by Evidera, which provides consulting and other research services to pharmaceutical, device, government, and nongovernment organizations.

This paper identifies patient sub-groups where an investment may result in larger positive economic and health outcomes. Methods: The baseline population with obesity was derived from a public survey database and divided into sub-populations defined by demographics and disease status. In 2016, a validated model was used to simulate the incidence of diabetes, absenteeism, and direct medical cost in five care settings. Research findings were derived from the difference in population outcomes with and without weight loss over 15 years. Modeled weight loss scenarios included initial 5% or 12% reduction in body mass index followed by a gradual weight regain. Additional simulations were conducted to show alternative outcomes from different time courses and maintenance scenarios. Results: Univariate analyses showed that age 45-64, pre-diabetes, female, or obesity class III are independently predictive of larger savings. After considering the correlation between these factors, multivariate analyses projected young females with obesity class I as the optimal sub-group to control obesity-related medical expenditures. In contrast, the population aged 20-35 with obesity class III will yield the best health outcomes. Also, the sub-group aged 45-54 with obesity class I will produce the biggest productivity improvement. Each additional year of weight loss maintained showed increased financial benefits. Conclusions: This paper studied the heterogeneity between many sub-populations affected by obesity and recommended different priorities for decision-makers in economic, productivity, and health realms.","[Su, Wenqing; Chen, Fang; Dall, Timothy M.] IHS Markit, 1300 Connecticut Ave NW,8th Floor, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Zvenyach, Tracy] Novo Nordisk Inc, Washington, DC USA; [Kyle, Theodore K.] ConscienHealth, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Perreault, Leigh] Univ Colorado, Denver, CO 80202 USA",Novo Nordisk; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Denver,"Su, WQ (通讯作者)，IHS Markit, 1300 Connecticut Ave NW,8th Floor, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",wayne.su@ihsmarkit.com,"Kyle, Theodore/AAE-6625-2020",,"Novo Nordisk, Inc.","Novo Nordisk, Inc.(Novo Nordisk)","Funding for this study came from Novo Nordisk, Inc.",,39,2,3,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Nanjing-one of the first provincial capital cities to implement the reformis studied to evaluate the effects of the comprehensive reform on drug prices in public hospitals, and to explore differential compensation plans.Methods: Sixteen hospitals were selected, and financial data were collected over the 48-month period before the reform and for 12 months after the reform. An analysis was carried out using a simple linear interrupted time series model.Results: The average difference ratio of drug surplus fell 13.39% after the reform, and the drug markups were basically eliminated. Revenue from medical services showed a net growth of 28.25%. The overall compensation received from government financial budget and medical service revenue growth was 103.69% for the loss from policy-permitted 15% markup sales, and 116.48% for the net loss. However, there were large differences in compensation levels at different hospitals, ranging from -21.92% to 413.74% by medical services revenue growth, causing the combined rate of both financial and service compensation to vary from 28.87-413.74%, There was a significant positive correlation between the services compensation rate and the proportion of medical service revenue (p<.001), and the compensation rate increased by 8% for every 1% increase in the proportion of services revenue.Discussion: Nanjing's pricing and compensation reform has basically achieved the policy targets of eliminating the drug markups, promoting the growth of medical services revenue, and adjusting the structure of medical revenue. However, the growth rate of service revenue of hospitals varied significantly from one another.Conclusions: Nanjing's reform represents successful pricing and compensation reform in Chinese urban public hospitals. It is recommended that a differentiated and dynamic compensation plan should be established in accordance with the revenue structure of different hospitals.","[Tang, Wenxi; Xie, Jing; Lu, Yijuan; Ma, Aixia] China Pharmaceut Univ, Sch Int Pharmaceut Business, 639 Longmian St, Nanjing 211198, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Liu, Qizhi] Nanjing Hlth & Family Planning Commiss, Publ Hosp Management Comm, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Malone, Daniel] Univ Arizona, Coll Pharm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",China Pharmaceutical University; University of Arizona,"Ma, AX (通讯作者)，China Pharmaceut Univ, Sch Int Pharmaceut Business, 639 Longmian St, Nanjing 211198, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",ma86128@sina.com,,,Chinese National Natural Science Foundation/Youth Program [71603278]; Jiangsu Philosophy and Social Science Foundation [2016SJD630007],Chinese National Natural Science Foundation/Youth Program; Jiangsu Philosophy and Social Science Foundation,This project is funded by the Chinese National Natural Science Foundation/Youth Program (Grant NO: 71603278) and Jiangsu Philosophy and Social Science Foundation (Grant NO: 2016SJD630007).,,48,16,16,0,57,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Computational study is conducted on 30 test cases constructed from real-world data to validate efficiency of the proposed solution approach. Results show that this simple but practical solution approach can optimally solve the daily berthing planning problem instances with up to 80 vessels, 40 berths, and 120 quay cranes within one hour, which is reasonable and acceptable for the real-world applications. The proposed decision model and the solution approach could be potentially useful for some tidal ports with (or without) navigation channels. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The implied expected cruising-for-parking times are significantly lower than those that have been obtained through observation and simulation. Through computer simulation of cars cruising for parking around a circle in stochastic steady state, this paper shows that the approximation leads to underestimation of expected cruising-for parking time and, at high occupancy rates, considerable underestimation. The paper also identifies several effects that contribute to the approximation being an increasingly poor one as the occupancy rate increases.

It obtains the optimal traffic diversion ratio to each route that can be achieved in real time through cutting-edge sensing and vehicle-infrastructure communication technologies. We minimize the expected total travel time of all travelers in the network by providing and updating routing advice (or incentives) to travelers in real time. The system-optimum traffic routing problem is modeled using the stochastic control approach where demand uncertainty and travelers' heterogeneity are explicitly considered over time. The approach is generic in the sense that the optimal routing strategies can be achieved through various technologies, such as connected vehicle technologies, navigation systems, variable message signs, dynamic pricing, etc. For a two-route representative network, we use dynamic programming to derive and approximate the analytical solution of the optimal routing policy for each time interval. The optimal diversion ratio can be updated solely upon the traffic counts measured along the preferred route in real time. The general rule is, with a high probability, to minimize the congestion and keep the maximum flow performance on the preferred route from the beginning of the peak hours. Towards the end of the peak hours, the optimal policy would allow more intensive use of the preferred route resulting over-saturation, whereas keeping the minimal use of the alternative route. The analytical solution is validated and examined in a synthesized network and a real-world network in California. It is found that it consistently outperforms the deterministic solution, and its resultant system performance is also reasonably close to the benchmark system optimum where true demand could be precisely known one day ahead.

The article presents two main methodological contributions. First, it proposes a tractable network model for finite space capacity Markovian queueing networks. This methodology decomposes a general topology queueing network into a set of overlapping subnetworks and approximates the transient joint queue-length distribution of each subnetwork. The subnetwork overlap allows to approximate stochastic dependencies across multiple subnetworks with a complexity that is linear in the number of subnetworks. Additionally, the network model maintains mutually consistent overlapping subnetwork distributions. Second, a stochastic network link transmission model (SLTM) is formulated that builds on the proposed queueing network decomposition and on the stochastic single-link model of Osorio and Flotterod (2015). The SLTM represents each direction of a road and each road intersection as one queueing subnetwork. Three experiments are presented. First, the analytical approximations of the queueing-theoretical model are validated against simulation-based estimates. An experiment with intricate traffic dynamics and multi-modal joint distributions is studied. The analytical model captures most dependency structure and approximates well the simulated network dynamics and joint distributions. Even for the considered simple network, which consists of only eight links, the proposed subnetwork decomposition yields significant gains in computational efficiency: It uses less than 0.0025% of the memory that is required by the use of a full network model. Second and third, the proposed SLTM is illustrated with a linear test network adopted from the literature and a more general topology network containing a diverge node and a merge node. Time-dependent probabilistic performance measures (occupancy uncertainty bands, spillback probabilities) are presented and discussed. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Blood donation is a voluntary activity and blood donors are important in the blood supply chain. It is suitable to attempt to increase blood donors' utility in order to reduce shortages and harmful damages. Parameters including distance of blood donors from blood facilities, experience factor of donors in blood facilities and advertising budget in blood facilities are considered social aspects and applied to form utility function used in this paper. The aim was to increase utility and motivate blood donors to donate blood. First, a deterministic location-allocation model is proposed applying a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) optimization. Due to the stochastic nature of demand and cost parameters, the aforementioned model is developed to incorporate uncertainty using a robust optimization approach that can overcome the limitations of scenario-based solution methods, i.e., without excessive changes in complexity of the underlying base deterministic model. The application of the proposed model is evaluated by a case study in Tehran. Numerical results obtained and sensitivity analysis helps administrators in the decision making process for investment projects. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In transshipment yards, a yard template is often used to stack containers in dedicated areas (sub-blocks) pre-reserved for their own destination vessels. At short-term planning level, the yard template is given, but the containers going to a specific vessel still have high flexibility to be allocated among many pre-reserved sub-blocks. The amount of containers allocated to each sub-block, i.e. container allocation, not only affects the traffic congestion, but more importantly determines the number of yard cranes (YCs) required in each block. The limited YCs have to switch blocks to fit the needs of container allocation in different periods, i.e. YC deployment. This study integrated these two closely related problems and formulated a MIP model. Since the model has a nice block-diagonal structure, column generation under Dentzig Wolfe decomposition was proposed to get lower bounds. A novel branch-and-price (B&P) method was proposed to find near-optimal solutions. To reduce the searching tree size, our MP method branched on YC paths during the planning horizon, instead of branching on decision variables directly. Numerical experiments under both small and large scale problems showed that our B&P method could efficiently solve the integrated planning problem. The results also showed that YC movements could be reduced effectively without sacrificing operational efficiency or using more yard cranes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: Administrative claims data from April 2013 through June 2014 MarketScan((R)) databases were extracted. Adults with 1 claim for canagliflozin, T2DM diagnosis, and 90 days enrollment before and after canagliflozin initiation were propensity score matched to controls with T2DM initiated on other anti-hyperglycemic agents (AHAs). UTI and GMI healthcare costs were evaluated 90-days post-index and reported as cohort means. Results: Rates of UTI claims 90 days post-index were similar in patients receiving canagliflozin for T2DM (n=31,257) and matched controls (2.7% vs 2.8%, p=.677). More canagliflozin than control patients had GMI claims (1.2% vs 0.6%, p<.001) and antifungal utilization (5.3% vs 2.6%, p<.001). Mean post-index costs to treat UTIs were lower but not significantly different for canagliflozin patients vs matched controls ($27.61 vs $37.33, p=.150). GMI treatment costs were higher for the canagliflozin cohort ($3.68 vs $2.44, p=.041). Combined costs to treat either UTI and/or GMI averaged $31.29 per patient for the canagliflozin cohort v $39.77 for controls (p=.211). Rates and costs of UTIs and GMIs were higher for females than males, but the canagliflozin vs control trends observed for the overall sample were similar for both sexes. There were no significant cost differences between the canagliflozin and control cohorts among patients aged 18-64. Among patients aged 65 and above, GMI treatment costs were not significantly different, but costs to treat UTIs and either UTI and/or GMI were significantly lower for canagliflozin patients vs controls. Conclusions: In a real-world setting, the costs to payers of treating UTIs and GMIs are generally similar for patients with T2DM initiated on canagliflozin vs other AHAs.","[Amos, Tony B.; Bolge, Susan C.] Janssen Sci Affairs LLC, 1125 Trenton Harbourton Rd, Titusville, NJ 08560 USA; [Montejano, Leslie; Juneau, Paul] Truven Hlth Analyt, Ann Arbor, MI USA",Johnson & Johnson; Janssen Pharmaceuticals,"Amos, TB (通讯作者)，Janssen Sci Affairs LLC, 1125 Trenton Harbourton Rd, Titusville, NJ 08560 USA.",tamos1@its.jnj.com,,"Montejano, Leslie/0000-0002-4542-7257","Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC","Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC","This study was funded by Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC, and conducted by Truven Health Analytics, an IBM Company.",,46,9,10,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

This research aims to systematically integrate problems of macroscopic train timetabling and microscopic train trajectory calculations. We develop a unified modeling framework using three-dimensional space-time-speed grid networks to characterize both second-by-second train trajectory and segment-based timetables at different space and time resolutions. The discretized time lattices can approximately track the train position, speed, and acceleration solution through properly defined spacing and. modeling time intervals. Within a Lagrangian relaxation-based solution framework, we propose a dynamic programming solution algorithm to find the speed/acceleration profile solutions with dualized train headway and power supply constraints. The proposed numerically tractable approach can better handle the non-linearity in solving the differential equations of motion, and systematically describe the complex connections between two problems that have been traditionally handled in a sequential way. We further use a real-world case study in the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed rail corridor to demonstrate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of our proposed methods and algorithms.

Methods: This study compares InSight with existing sepsis screening tools and computes the differential life and cost savings associated with its use in the inpatient setting. To do so, mortality reduction is obtained from an increase in the number of sepsis cases correctly identified by InSight. Early sepsis detection by InSight is also associated with a reduction in length-of-stay, from which cost savings are directly computed. Results:InSight identifies more true positive cases of severe sepsis, with fewer false alarms, than comparable methods. For an individual ICU with 50 beds, for example, it is determined that InSight annually saves 75 additional lives and reduces sepsis-related costs by $560,000. Limitations:InSight performance results are derived from analysis of a single-center cohort. Mortality reduction results rely on a simplified use case, which fixes prediction times at 0, 1, and 2 h before sepsis onset, likely leading to under-estimates of lives saved. The corresponding cost reduction numbers are based on national averages for daily patient length-of-stay cost. Conclusions:InSight has the potential to reduce sepsis-related deaths and to lead to substantial cost savings for healthcare facilities.","[Calvert, Jacob; Hoffman, Jana; Jay, Melissa; Das, Ritankar] Dascena Inc, 1135 Martin Luther King Dr, Hayward, CA 94541 USA; [Barton, Christopher; Chettipally, Uli] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Emergency Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Shimabukuro, David] Univ Calif San Francisco, Div Crit Care Med, Dept Anesthesia & Perioperat Care, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Ries, Michael] Advocate Hlth, Adult Crit Care, Oak Brook, IL USA; [Chettipally, Uli] Kaiser Permanente South San Francisco Med Ctr, Dept Emergency Med, San Francisco, CA USA; [Kerem, Yaniv] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Clin Informat, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kerem, Yaniv] Kaiser Permanente Redwood City Med Ctr, Dept Emergency Med, Redwood City, CA USA; [Mataraso, Samson] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Bioengn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California San Francisco; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; Kaiser Permanente; Stanford University; Kaiser Permanente; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Hoffman, J (通讯作者)，Dascena Inc, 1135 Martin Luther King Dr, Hayward, CA 94541 USA.",jana@dascena.com,"Calvert, Jacob/ABB-4298-2021","Mataraso, Samson/0000-0003-3146-2243; Smith, Melissa/0000-0002-8740-4803",National Science Foundation [1549867]; Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Industrial Innovation & Partnersh [1549867] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Industrial Innovation & Partnersh(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG)),"This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1549867.

In the pivotal clinical trial, BSI was associated with a higher proportion of completely-abstinent patients (85.7% vs 71.9%; p = .03) vs sublingual buprenorphine (SL-BPN). Elsewhere, relapse to illicit drug use is associated with diminished treatment outcomes and increased costs. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of BSI vs SL-BPN from a US societal perspective. Methods: A Markov model simulated BSI and SL-BPN cohorts (clinically-stable adults) transiting through four mutually-exclusive health states for 12 months. Cohorts accumulated direct medical costs from drug acquisition/administration; treatment-diversion/abuse; newly-acquired hepatitis-C; emergency room, hospital, and rehabilitation services; and pediatric poisonings. Non-medical costs of criminality, lost wages/work-productivity, and out-of-pocket expenses were also included. Transition probabilities to a relapsed state were derived from the aforementioned trial. Other transition probabilities, costs, and health-state utilities were derived from observational studies and adjusted for trial characteristics. Outcomes included incremental cost per quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) gained and incremental net-monetary-benefit (INMB). Uncertainty was assessed by univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). Results: BSI was associated with lower total costs (-$4,386), more QALYs (+0.031), and favorable INMB at all willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds considered. Higher drug acquisition costs for BSI (+$6,492) were outpaced, primarily by reductions in emergency room/hospital utilization (-$8,040) and criminality (-$1,212). BSI was cost-effective in 89% of PSA model replicates, and had a significantly higher NMB at $50,000/QALY ($20,783 vs $15,007; p<.05). Conclusions: BSI was preferred over SL-BPN from a health-economic perspective for treatment of OUD in clinically-stable adults. These findings should be interpreted carefully, due to some relationships having been modeled from inputs derived from multiple sources, and would benefit from comparison with outcomes from studies that employ administrative claims data or a naturalistic comparative design.","[Carter, John A.] EPI Q Inc, 1315 West 22nd St,Suite 410, Oak Brook, IL USA; [Dammerman, Ryan] Braeburn Pharmaceut, Princeton, NJ USA; [Frost, Michael] Eagleville Hosp, Eagleville, PA USA",EPI-Q Inc,"Carter, JA (通讯作者)，EPI Q Inc, 1315 West 22nd St,Suite 410, Oak Brook, IL USA.",john.carter@epi-q.com,"frost, michael/AAG-4031-2021","Carter, John/0000-0001-8539-5352","Braeburn Pharmaceuticals, holder of the US rights to Probuphine","Braeburn Pharmaceuticals, holder of the US rights to Probuphine","This work was funded by Braeburn Pharmaceuticals, holder of the US rights to Probuphine.",,55,11,12,0,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The purpose of this study was to develop a dynamic procedure for scheduling patients within an outpatient clinic where patients are expected to have multiple appointments, such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, primary care, and dentistry. Methods: This retrospective study involved the year 2014 de-identified patient records from an outpatient clinic affiliated with a large university hospital. A number of patient characteristics, appointment data, and historical attendance records were examined to determine whether they significantly impacted patients who missed scheduled appointments (no-shows). Patient attendance behaviors over multiple appointments were examined to determine whether their no-show and cancellation patterns differed from one appointment to the next. Decision tree analysis was applied to those predictors that significantly correlated with patient attendance behavior to assess the likelihood of a patient no-show. A sample dynamic appointment scheduling procedure that utilized different overbooking strategies for different appointment numbers was then developed. Computer simulation was used to assess the effectiveness of the dynamic procedure versus two other methods consisting of randomly assigned and uniformly assigned appointments. Results: The dynamic scheduling procedure resulted in increased scheduling efficiency through overbooking but with less than 5% risk of appointment conflicts (i.e. two patients showing at the same time), equating to approximately 0.16 conflicts per clinician per day. It also increased clinic utilization by about 6.7%. It consistently outperformed the other two methods with respect to the percentage of appointment conflicts. Limitations: The study is limited with respect to potential clinician cost increase resulting from possible appointment conflicts. A second limitation is that patients experiencing appointment conflicts might not wait for treatment, resulting in potential loss of revenue. A third limitation is that the model does not take into account patient satisfaction, nor the ethics of overbooking patients. Conclusions: A dynamic appointment scheduling procedure was developed using actual patient characteristics. The procedure resulted in creation of more efficient appointment schedules thereby increasing the clinic utilization.","[Creps, James] Univ Michigan Flint, Dept Phys Therapy, Flint, MI USA; [Lotfi, Vahid] Univ Michigan Flint, Off Grad Programs, 303 E Kearsley St, Flint, MI 48502 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan Flint; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan Flint,"Lotfi, V (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan Flint, Off Grad Programs, 303 E Kearsley St, Flint, MI 48502 USA.",vahid@umflint.edu,,"Lotfi, Vahid/0000-0002-7201-8002",,,,,36,16,17,0,23,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Since a new round of healthcare system reforms in 2009, the Chinese government has been paying attention to this prospective payment. However, it is unclear whether GB has influenced cost control and how it works in rural China. Methods: YC county was chosen as the intervention group, with 33,175 inpatients before and 36,883 inpatients after the reform (2012 and 2014, respectively). ZJ county acted as the control group, with 23,668 and 29,555 inpatients, respectively. The inpatients' information was collected from a local insurance agency. The difference-in-difference method (controlling for age, gender, living status, severity of the disease, whether the patient had surgery, the level of medical institutions, and the secular trends of the two groups) was applied to estimate the effects on total spending (TS), reimbursement expense (RE), out-of-pocket payment (OOP), readmission rate, and seven kinds of medical service items. Results: At per practice level, the GB was associated with a (sic)263.35 (p<. 001) and (sic)447.46 (p<. 001) decrease in growth of TS and RE, respectively, while OOP increased by (sic)188.06 (p<. 001). At per capital level, the decrease in growth of TS and RE was (sci)64.39 (p = .301) and (sic)467.45 (p<. 001), respectively, whereas the increase of OOP was more significant at (sic)408.19 (p<. 001). Savings were concentrated in unclassified items ((sic)197.68, p<. 001), drug prescription ((sic)69.03, p<. 001), surgery ((sic)40.18, p<. 001), cure ((sic)4.95, p = .565), and diagnosis ((sic)3.61, p = .064). Meanwhile, the readmission rate increased by 11.4% (p<. 001). Conclusions: The GB has a prominent impact on curbing the growth of insurance fund expenditures, as well as drug and medical consumable costs. However, the patients' out-of-pocket payment has risen. Doctors decomposed hospitalization to deal with supervision, which was harmful to patients. Any medical insurance payment reform should be undertaken prudently, and its likely outcomes should be weighed comprehensively.","[He, Ruibo; Miao, Yudong; Ye, Ting; Zhang, Yan; Li, Zhong; Zhang, Liang] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Med & Hlth Management, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Tang, Wenxi] China Pharmaceut Univ, Sch Int Pharmaceut Business, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology; China Pharmaceutical University,"Zhang, L (通讯作者)，Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Med & Hlth Management, Tongji Med Coll, 13 Hangkong Rd, Wuhan 430030, Hubei, Peoples R China.",zhangliang@mails.tjmu.edu.cn,"yang, qing/JBR-8440-2023; ye, ting/HGC-5924-2022; Li, Zhong/AAA-9911-2020","Li, Zhong/0000-0002-4434-8733",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71673099],National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC, 71673099) sponsored this study.",,54,28,28,3,46,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Hence, therapies requiring less-frequent injections are needed. In the absence of head-to-head comparisons, this study compared the first extended-half-life-recombinant factor IX (rFIX) product-recombinant factor IX Fc fusion protein (rFIXFc)-with conventional rFIX products based on annualized bleed rates (ABRs) and factor consumption reported in studies of continuous prophylaxis. Methods: This study compared ABRs and weekly factor consumption rates in clinical studies of continuous prophylaxis treatment with rFIXFc and conventional rFIX products (identified by systematic literature review) in previously-treated adolescents and adults with moderate-to-severe hemophilia B. Meta-analysis was used to pool ABRs reported for conventional rFIX products for comparison. Comparisons of weekly factor consumption were based on the mean, reported or estimated from the mean dose per injection. Results: Five conventional rFIX studies (injections 1 to > 3 times/week) met the criteria for comparison with once-weekly rFIXFc reported by the B-LONG study. The pooled mean ABR for conventional rFIX was slightly higher than but comparable to rFIXFc (difference = 0.71; p = 0.210). Weekly factor consumption was significantly lower with rFIXFc than in conventional rFIX studies (difference in means = 42.8-74.5 IU/kg/week [93-161%], p< 0.001). Conclusion: Comparisons of clinical study results suggest weekly injections with rFIXFc result in similar bleeding rates and significantly lower weekly factor consumption compared with more-frequentlyinjected conventional rFIX products. The real-world effectiveness of rFIXFc may be higher based on results from a model of the impact of simulated differences in adherence.","[Iorio, Alfonso] McMaster Univ, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Krishnan, Sangeeta] Biogen, Cambridge, MA USA; [Myren, Karl-Johan; Lethagen, Stefan] Sobi, SE-11276 Stockholm, Sweden; [Lethagen, Stefan] Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark; [McCormick, Nora; Yermakov, Sander; Karner, Paul] Anal Grp, Boston, MA USA",McMaster University; Biogen; Swedish Orphan Biovitrum; University of Copenhagen; Analysis Group Inc.,"Myrén, KJ (通讯作者)，Sobi, SE-11276 Stockholm, Sweden.",,"Iorio, Alfonso/B-9478-2013","Iorio, Alfonso/0000-0002-3331-8766",Biogen; Sobi,Biogen(Biogen); Sobi,Financial support for this study was provided by Biogen and by Sobi.,,30,10,11,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Methods: NVAF patients who initiated apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, or warfarin were identified from the IMS Pharmetrics Plus database (January 1, 2013-September 30, 2015). Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to balance differences in patient characteristics between study cohorts: patients treated with apixaban vs rivaroxaban, apixaban vs dabigatran, and apixaban vs warfarin. Risk of hospitalization and healthcare costs (all-cause and MB-related) were compared between matched cohorts during the follow-up. Results: During the follow-up, risks for all-cause (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2-1.7) and MB-related (HR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.0-2.4) hospitalizations were significantly greater for patients treated with rivaroxaban vs apixaban. Adjusted total all-cause healthcare costs were significantly lower for patients treated with apixaban vs rivaroxaban ($3,950 vs $4,333 per patient per month [PPPM], p = .002) and MB-related medical costs were not statistically significantly different ($100 vs $233 PPPM, p = .096). Risk for all-cause hospitalization (HR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.6-2.4) was significantly greater for patients treated with dabigatran vs apixaban, although total all-cause healthcare costs were not statistically different. Risks for all-cause (HR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.9-2.5) and MB-related (HR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.4-3.0) hospitalizations were significantly greater for patients treated with warfarin vs apixaban. Total all-cause healthcare costs ($3,919 vs $4,177 PPPM, p = .025) and MB-related medical costs ($96 vs $212 PPPM, p = .026) were significantly lower for patients treated with apixaban vs warfarin. Limitations: This retrospective database analysis does not establish causation. Conclusions: In the real-world setting, compared with rivaroxaban and warfarin, apixaban is associated with reduced risk of hospitalization and lower healthcare costs. Compared with dabigatran, apixaban is associated with lower risk of hospitalizations.","[Lin, Jay; Lingohr-Smith, Melissa; Menges, Brandy] Novosys Hlth, 288 Route 22 West,Suite G-H Mail 7, Green Brook, NJ 08812 USA; [Trocio, Jeffrey; Mardekian, Jack] Pfizer Inc, New York, NY USA; [Gupta, Kiran; You, Min; Nadkarni, Anagha] Bristol Myers Squibb, Lawrenceville, NJ USA",Pfizer; Bristol-Myers Squibb,"Lin, J (通讯作者)，Novosys Hlth, 288 Route 22 West,Suite G-H Mail 7, Green Brook, NJ 08812 USA.",jay.lin@novosyshealth.com,"Singh, Sanjay Kumar/M-3276-2019","Singh, Sanjay Kumar/0000-0002-5760-1865",Pfizer; Bristol-Myers Squibb,Pfizer(Pfizer); Bristol-Myers Squibb(Bristol-Myers Squibb),This study was sponsored by Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb.,,16,25,26,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

This study aimed to evaluate long-term cost-effectiveness of insulin detemir (IDet) compared with insulin glargine (IGlar) in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) from the Thai payer's perspective. Methods: Long-term costs and outcomes were projected using a validated IMS CORE Diabetes Model, version 8.5. Cohort characteristics, baseline risk factors, and costs of diabetes complications were derived from Thai data sources. Relative risk was derived from a systematic review and meta-analysis study. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% per annum. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was presented in 2015 US Dollars (USD). A series of one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: IDet yielded slightly greater quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (8.921 vs 8.908), but incurred higher costs than IGlar (90,417.63 USD vs 66,674.03 USD), resulting in an ICER of similar to 1.7 million USD per QALY. The findings were very sensitive to the cost of IDet. With a 34% reduction in the IDet cost, treatment with IDet would become cost-effective according to the Thai threshold of 4,434.59 USD per QALY. Conclusions: Treatment with IDet in patients with T2DM who had uncontrolled blood glucose with oral anti-diabetic agents was not a cost-effective strategy compared with IGlar treatment in the Thai context. These findings could be generalized to other countries with a similar socioeconomics level and healthcare systems.","[Permsuwan, Unchalee] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Pharm, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand; [Thavorn, Kednapa] Ottawa Hosp, Ottawa Hosp Res Inst, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Thavorn, Kednapa] Univ Ottawa, Sch Epidemiol Publ Hlth & Prevent Med, Fac Med, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Thavorn, Kednapa] Inst Clin & Evaluat Sci ICES UOttawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Dilokthornsakul, Piyameth; Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn] Naresuan Univ, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, CPOR, Phitsanulok, Thailand; [Saokaew, Surasak] Univ Phayao, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Ctr Hlth Outcomes Res & Therapeut Safety COHORTS, Phayao, Thailand; [Saokaew, Surasak; Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn] Monash Univ Malaysia, Sch Pharm, Subang Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia; [Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn] Univ Queensland, Sch Populat Hlth, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn] Monash Univ, Asian Ctr Evidence Synth Populat Implementat & Cl, Hlth & Well Being Cluster, Global Asia 21st Century Platform GA21, Bandar Sunway, Selangor, Malaysia",Chiang Mai University; University of Ottawa; Ottawa Hospital Research Institute; University of Ottawa; Naresuan University; University of Phayao; Monash University; Monash University Sunway; University of Queensland; Monash University; Monash University Sunway,"Permsuwan, U (通讯作者)，Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Pharm, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.",unchalee.permsuwan@gmail.com,"Dilokthornsakul, Piyameth/AFR-0151-2022; Saokaew, Surasak/AAI-9804-2021","Dilokthornsakul, Piyameth/0000-0002-6981-1771; Saokaew, Surasak/0000-0002-1382-0660; Thavorn, Kednapa/0000-0003-4738-8447; Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn/0000-0003-4572-8794","CMU Mid-Career Research Fellow Program, Chiang Mai University, Thailand","CMU Mid-Career Research Fellow Program, Chiang Mai University, Thailand","This study was supported by the CMU Mid-Career Research Fellow Program, Chiang Mai University, Thailand.",,49,7,7,0,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Materials and methods: Data were from three placebo-controlled phase 3 ixekizumab studies (UNCOVER-1, UNCOVER-2, and UNCOVER-3) with patients who had baseline Dermatology Life Quality Index scores >10 (DLQI >10). Psoriasis severity (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index [PASI]), general health utility (EQ-5D), and psoriasis-specific utility (EQ-PSO, UNCOVER-3 only) were assessed. EQ-5D-5L utility scores were generated using the England EQ-5D-5L value set, a crosswalk applied to the EQ-5D-3L United States (US) and United Kingdom (UK) value sets, and a regression-based exploratory scoring function for the EQ-PSO (UK). Analysis of variance was used to estimate change in EQ-5D-5L from baseline to Week 12 per PASI improvement level: PASI <50, PASI 50 to <75, PASI 75 to <90, PASI 90 to <100, and PASI 100. Missing data were imputed using the last observation carried forward method. Value sets for the UK, England, and the US were applied. Results: In total, 2085 patients across UNCOVER-1, UNCOVER-2, and UNCOVER-3 had baseline DLQI >10 and available utility scores. At Week 12, mean EQ-5D utility scores increased with increasing PASI improvement levels (p<0.001, all analyses). Mean health utilities for PASI 90 to <100 and PASI 100 were similar when based on the generic classifier, whereas a clear differentiation between PASI 90 to <100 and PASI 100 was observed for EQ-PSO mean scores (UNCOVER-3 only, n=645; PASI 90 to <100: 0.141, PASI 100: 0.200; adjusted p=0.043). Limitations: EQ-5D-5L index-based scores have limited ability to differentiate among psoriasis patients at the highest PASI improvement levels. ConclusionsL Adding psoriasis-specific EQ-PSO dimensions to the EQ-5D may enhance responsiveness to improvement in skin clarity at the highest PASI levels, and, therefore, generate utility scores that better reflect treatment benefit in cost-utility models.","[Pickard, A.

Materials and methods: This study was based on experts' views on the practice patterns in management of CMPA manifesting with either proctocolitis or eczema symptoms and, thereby, aimed to estimate economic burden of CMPA. Practice patterns were determined via patient flow charts developed by experts using the modified Delphi method for CMPA presented with proctocolitis and eczema. Per patient total 2-year direct medical costs were calculated, including cost items of physician visits, laboratory tests, and treatment. Results: According to the consensus opinion of experts, 2-year total direct medical cost from a payer perspective and societal perspective was calculated to be $ US2,116.05 and $ US2,435.84, respectively, in an infant with CMPA presenting with proctocolitis symptoms, and $ US4,001.65 and $ US4,828.90, respectively, in an infant with CMPA presenting with eczema symptoms. Clinical nutrition was the primary cost driver that accounted for 89-92% of 2-year total direct medical costs, while the highest total direct medical cost estimated from a payer perspective and societal perspective was noted for the management of an exclusively formula-fed infant presenting either with proctocolitis ($ US3,743.85 and $ US4,025.63, respectively) or eczema ($ US6,854.10 and $ US7,917.30, respectively). The first line use of amino acid based formula (AAF) was associated with total direct cost increment $ US1,848.08 and $ US3,444.52 in the case of proctocolitis and eczema, respectively. Limitations: Certain limitations to this study should be considered. First, being focused only on direct costs, the lack of data on indirect costs or intangible costs of illness seems to be a major limitation of the present study, which likely results in a downward bias in the estimates of the economic cost of CMPA. Second, given the limited number of studies concerning epidemiology and practice patterns in CMPA in Turkey, use of expert clinical opinion of the panel members rather than real-life data on practice patterns that were used to identify direct medical costs might raise a concern with the validity and reliability of the data. Also, while this was a three-step study with six experts included in the first stage (developing local guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of infants with CMPA in Turkey) and 410 pediatricians included in the second stage (a cross-sectional questionnaire-survey to determine pediatricians' awareness and practice of CMPA in infants and children), only four members were included in the present Delphi panel, which allows a limited discussion. Third, lack of sensitivity analyses and exclusion of indirect costs and costs related to alterations in quality of life, behavior of infants, and general well-being of infants and their parents from the cost-analysis seems to be another limitation that may have caused under-estimation of relative cost-effectiveness of the formulae. Fourth, calculation of costs per local guidelines rather than real-life practice patterns is another limitation that, otherwise, would extend the knowledge achieved in the current study. Notwithstanding these limitations, the present expert panel provided practice patterns in the management of CMPA and an estimate of the associated costs, depending on the symptom profile at initial admission for the first time in Turkey. Conclusions: In conclusion, in providing the first health economic data on CMPA in Turkey, the findings revealed that CMPA imposes a substantial burden on the Turkish healthcare system from both a payer perspective and societal perspective, and indicated clinical nutrition as a primary cost driver. Management of infants presenting with eczema, exclusively formula-fed infants, and first line use of AAF were associated with higher estimates for 2-year direct medical costs.","[Sekerel, Bulent Enis] Hacettepe Univ, Dept Pediat Allergy & Asthma, Fac Med, Ankara, Turkey; [Seyhun, Oznur] ISPOR Nutr Econ Special Working Grp NESWG, Ankara, Turkey; [Seyhun, Oznur] Abbott Labs, Istanbul, Turkey",Hacettepe University,"Sekerel, BE (通讯作者)，Hacettepe Univ, Fac Med, Dept Pediat Allergy & Asthma, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey.",b_sekerel@yahoo.com,,,Abbott Nutrition Turkey,Abbott Nutrition Turkey,"This study was supported by Abbott Nutrition Turkey.

It was licensed in France in 2012, but, due to higher acquisition costs compared with existing treatments, healthcare providers require information on its cost/benefit profile. Objective: To compare healthcare costs and health outcomes of fidaxomicin and vancomycin, as reference treatment for CDI. Methods: A Markov model was used to simulate the treatment pathway, over 1 year, of adult patients with CDI receiving fidaxomicin or vancomycin. Several patient sub-groups (severe CDI; recurrent CDI; concomitant antibiotics; cancer; renal failure; elderly) were evaluated. Cost-effectiveness was analyzed based on cure and recurrence rates derived from published randomized clinical trials comparing fidaxomicin and vancomycin, and costs calculated from the payer perspective using French hospitalization data and drug cost databases. Model outputs included costs in euros (reference year 2014) and health outcomes (recurrence; sustained cure rates). Alternative scenario and sensitivity analyses were performed using data from other clinical trials in CDI, including one conducted in real-life clinical practice in France. Results: Drug acquisition costs were (sic)1,692 higher in fidaxomicin-treated patients, but this was offset by the lower hospitalization costs with fidaxomicin, which were reduced by (sic)1,722. The reduction in the cost of hospitalization was driven by the significantly lower number of recurrences in fidaxomicin-treated patients, offsetting the acquisition cost of fidaxomicin in all sub-groups except recurrent CDI and concomitant antibiotics. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that, despite higher acquisition costs, the lower recurrence rate with fidaxomicin resulted in cost savings or low incremental costs compared with vancomycin.","[Watt, Maureen] Astellas Pharma EMEA, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Chertsey, England; [Dinh, Aur Elien] Hop Raymond Poincare, Dept Med Aigue Specialisee, Garches, France; [Le Monnier, Alban] Grp Hosp Paris St Joseph, Microbiol Clin, Paris, France; [Tilleul, Patrick] Grp Hosp Pitie Salpetriere, AP HP, Pharm Usage Interieur, Paris, France",Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Raymond-Poincare - APHP; Universite Paris Cite; Hopital Paris Saint-Joseph; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Pitie-Salpetriere - APHP; Sorbonne Universite,"Watt, M (通讯作者)，Astellas Pharma Europe Ltd, 2000 Hillswood Dr, Chertsey KT16 0RS, England.",maureen.watt@astellas.com,"Dinh, Aurélien/AAI-5355-2021","LE MONNIER, Alban/0000-0001-6181-281X","Astellas Pharma, Inc.","Astellas Pharma, Inc.(Astellas Pharmaceuticals)","This study was initiated and funded by Astellas Pharma, Inc.",,46,19,19,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The calculations are based on the regional social accounting matrix for 2015 augmented with data on gas processing technologies and consumption of their products. According to the calculation results, if the output of new industries reaches 38 billion m3 of gas and 2 million tons of polyethylene, the region's GRP will increase by 13.9% compared to 2015. In terms of the concept of sequential interindustry modeling, the authors estimate the temporal distributions of the obtained integral effects. The researchers conclude that without lags in production and consumption, the integral increase in GRP will be obtained after 40 cycles, with lags - after 50 cycles. The maximum discrepancies between the two trajectories of the macro indicator (without and with lags) will be observed in the period up to 25th cycle.","[Dzhurka, N.

It also substantiates the determinants that restrict the development of local agricultural-land markets, explains the effects of market signals and informal institutes on the redistribution of agricultural land between land users. With evidence from a single Russian region, Volgograd Oblast, we find out that such re-distribution of land between the market actors depends on the form of ownership as well as on institutional restrictions. It is shown that the high level of transaction costs is due to the actions of the Federal Government and cannot be significantly reduced at the actor or municipality level, which necessitates the need for developing such a targeted program to institutionalize the agricultural-land market that would facilitate strengthening the land-control institute, minimizing the transaction costs of specifying the land-ownership rights and the costs of information support for the market, which in its turn will motivate the market actors to use land more efficiently.","[Oganesyan, L.

The study of statistical data, expert opinions and indicators of official forms of tax reporting of the Federal tax service has proven that high insurance premiums and the mechanism of illegal compensation and a refund of tax amounts on value added from the Federal budget become primary conditions that have a direct impact on exiting of economic entities into the shadow.

The reason for data preprocessing is twofold; it is necessary to select (or create) from available data characteristics relevant for given data mining task, and to represent these characteristics in a form suitable for selected data mining algorithm. Among the typical data operations performed in this step discretization of numeric attributes plays an important role as algorithms for creating either association or decision rules cannot handle numeric attributes directly. Different approaches to discretization can be used. Equidistant or equifrequent discretization are typical examples of so-called class-blind methods since they deal only with the discretized attribute. Another group of discretization are class-sensitive methods; the fact that the examples (objects) belong to different classes is taken into account here. The discretization procedures typically generate sharp boundaries (thresholds) between intervals. The paper describes a class-sensitive discretization method where the boundary between intervals is defined using fuzzy membership function. The paper shows an experimental evaluation of the proposed method on some benchmark data and also compares the proposed method with more standard (i.e. crisp) discretization. A naive Bayesian classifier as well as a tree learning algorithm are used in the experiments.","[Berka, Petr] Univ Econ, Dept Informat & Knowledge Engn, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Berka, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Dept Informat & Knowledge Engn, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",berka@vse.cz,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-678-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,54,59,,,,,,6,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ7ED,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427151400010,0

This issue bears an increased attention under conditions of economic influence of network industries in the national economies since the second half of the twenties of the last century. This tendency is especially visible particularly in the context of economic globalization and increased significance of the supranational entities. The existence of pure monopoly in network industries increases the role of regulation mechanisms in connection with objectification and increase in their social effectiveness. The objective of regulation mechanisms is to find an appropriate proportion between price and product supply of network industry. The conditions for equilibrium of network industries and methods of their regulations will be examined in the paper. The stress will be laid on the regulation on the performance basis - Performance based Regulation, regulation on the base of returns - Rate of Return Regulation and also on the price regulation on the basis Averch-Johnson model.

For the most resilient scales of solutions, we demonstrate for the UK the net energy production (bio-gas and electricity) from AD (and so the avoided emissions from grid energy), the mass of bio-waste processed (and avoided land-fill), and the quantum of digestate produced (as a proxy for avoided irrigation and fertilizer production).

Applying the portfolio optimization methods to the Italian ethical funds/indexes, we are able to answer several questions that arise with SRI opportunities. Initial empirical results from Italian market are in contrast with the corporate social responsibility (CSR) theory conclusion, which confirms that SRI are performing much better than their conventional counterparts.

Network DEA (NDEA) allows one to capture the inner structure as a series of interacting processes, making for a more precise model of complex systems. In an effort to further increase the accuracy of real world representation in models, several directions of research into NDEA have been developed. One of them replaces crisp data with fuzzy values to better capture the imprecise nature of most complex systems. Elsewhere, models that use a number of Multi-criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methods allow managers to put restrictions on allowable input/output weights, to rank efficient units, or to solve other scenarios for which traditional models are ill-equipped. This paper aims to first provide an overview of existing models utilizing both aforementioned approaches. Subsequently, further ways in which both approaches could be combined to yield brand new methods are examined.

We provide graphical summaries of the performance of these distance measures in LA as well as the frequencies of choosing specific linguistic labels considered to be the values of an extended linguistic scale.

And investors would not believe social media disclosures and not invest. When reputation model of KMRW is introduced in this stage, the model becomes repeated game with incomplete information. If the game is repeated enough times, the cooperative equilibrium can be achieved. But investors always act in the short run and the model of KMRW does not work.

In this regard it becomes necessary to reconsider the approach to the organization of logistic activity which has to focus on dynamic relations between enterprise structures which demonstrate logistic activities, innovation, and communication transparency and to promote efforts concentration on key competences.

Econometric estimation based on Bayesian techniques is performed and empirical performance of the model is evaluated. The estimated model is able to replicate key features of the data with the exception of autocorrelation functions of the observed variables. Matching autocorrelation coefficients of higher order is especially problematic and the model underestimates these coefficients. The unemployment rate in Spain is very persistent and can be far away from a steady state for a very long time. Underestimation of higher-order autocorrelation coefficients suggests that the basic search and matching model has difficulties in capturing this aspect of unemployment rate in Spain. Forecasting performance of the model was also analyzed by computing ex post dynamic one-year-ahead forecasts of unemployment rate. The important result is that forecasting performance of the model during the crisis periods was even better than for the periods before the current economic crisis.,"[Cizek, Ondrej] Univ Econ Prague, Dept Econometr, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Cizek, O (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Dept Econometr, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",cizeko@vse.cz,,,"Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, University of Economics, Prague [IP 400040]; [VSE IGA IG403036]","Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, University of Economics, Prague;","Financial support of VSE IGA IG403036 is gratefully acknowledged by the author.

Using a linear optimization objective function in determining the least-cost pathway, data from various sources were compiled to perform simulations on two scenarios; a business as usual (BAU) case and an 80% greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction. Even in the base case, the emission level reaches 21% of 1990 levels; a reduction of 39% over the simulation period. This indicates that even without the imposition of GHG constraints on the food sector, it is economically more beneficial for the industry to migrate from fossil fuels. This migration takes place by replacing energy from LPG, LFO, Kerosene, HFO, Coal and Natural gas with biomass, biogas and CHIP electricity. Economic benefits arise from the fact that biogas and biomass are produced from wastes which are generated onsite within food factories, hence the avoidance of purchasing energy feedstock from the market. The change in energy consumption between the two scenarios is similar due to the prevalence of least-cost solutions and similar energy and food demand requirements. However, the reduction in emissions are greater in the 80%-GHG case than the BAU case; 52% compared to 39% for the BAU case, for 2050 relative to 2010. This is largely owing to decarbonization of grid electricity. This study fmds that the food-industrial sector has the potential to exceed this 80% reduction target to a value of 92%, due to the availability of onsite feedstocks to generate biogas. In this simulation, of all waste produced, 92% of waste feedstock is consumed in Ali) and CHPs, whilst the remaining 8% is dried and processed to be burned in biomass boilers. (C) 2017 The Authors.

The refrigeration system of the case study includes plugged-in display cabinets to serve both medium temperature (MT) and low temperature (LT) refrigeration loads. Centralised systems are compared with the remote plugged-in refrigeration cabinets. The different refrigeration systems studied are, a) two parallel centralised systems for MT and LT loads, b) two parallel cascade systems (R134a/CO2) for MT and LT loads and c) a transcritical CO2 booster. The study is performed for DSY London weather file to capture the risk of warmer than a typical year consequences in centralised refrigeration systems operation.

First, based on credibility theory, three credibilistic criteria are introduced to define the behavior preferences of players in different game situations. Then, three solution concepts of credibilistic equilibria and their existence theorems are proposed. Finally, three sufficient and necessary conditions are presented for finding the credibilistic equilibrium strategies to illustrate the usefulness of the theory developed in this paper.","[Tan, Chunqiao; Feng, Zhongwei] Cent S Univ, Sch Business, Changsha 410083, Hunan, Peoples R China",Central South University,"Tan, CQ (通讯作者)，Cent S Univ, Sch Business, Changsha 410083, Hunan, Peoples R China.",chunqiaot@sina.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71671188, 71271217]; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China [2016JJ1024]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China(Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province)","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71671188 and 71271217,), and Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China (No. 2016JJ1024).",,46,1,1,1,6,SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",1865-0929,1865-0937,978-981-10-6753-2; 978-981-10-6752-5,COMM COM INF SC,,,2017,758.0,,,,,,134,147,,10.1007/978-981-10-6753-2_10,0.0,,,14,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BL5GE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000451446900010,0

When dealing with engineering students, who often lack motivation in foreign language acquisition, and a somewhat limited amount of time for training, justified by the curriculum, it is crucial to base the English language course on professional and communicative challenges that a future specialist would encounter. According to this underlying principle, we have been designing a series of additional exercises - so-called quests - to further involvement of students in language acquisition as well as develop their intercultural and communicative competencies, academic and professional skills. The strain that such diversified syllabus creates is decreased with the help of social networking means and chat bots to automate the scoring and communication processes.","[Chernova, N., I; Mandzhiev, A.

First of all, the Russian economic science faces the tasks of theoretical substantiation and practical solution of the problem of lagging behind in investment and innovative development. The article found that domestic producers could not quickly adapt to a significant increase in the cost of imports of intermediate and investment goods. In connection with this foreign investment in Primorsky region should be seen as drivers of economic growth. Some theoretical aspects of the theory of capital flows are presented. In particular, there was noted a positive correlation between the inflow of foreign investment and the efficiency of domestic producers, that was introduced in the works of the majority of authors. The low position of Russia and Primorsky region in various investment ratings is noted. Despite this, the study showed that Primorsky region has created basic conditions for the formation of a favorable investment climate, economic and investment stability. It was identified that the main mechanisms for increasing the investment attractiveness of Primorsky region are the formation of the institutional environment, the formation of a new regulatory framework, the promotion of the region in the world arena, the introduction of special tax, customs, and administrative regimes.

Against the background of interpenetration of professional and educational social institutions, changes in the structure of the motives of choice of future labor activity sphere are clarified. Special attention is given to the significance of human capital for development of the region, investments in it. The thesis that educational services market does not correspond to the re-quirements of the economy and the society in whole, it is out of touch with labor market functioning, preventing formation of optimal variant of population employment pattern, is substantiated. The problem situation is investigated, re-lated to increase of the number of graduates of higher institutions and unsatisfied demand of labor market for qualified workers. Main results of empirical study are presented, using quantitative and qualit-ative sociological methods of data collection revealing the trend of educational strategies of modern students, their preferences in professional sphere in associ-ation with migration attitude. The performed study has shown that active en-gagement in migration flows and migration motivation is wide spread in student community. Besides, the obtained results demonstrate relationship of educational and migration trajectories of students. Motives of choice of a specific direction of training by students, their expectations and intentions as to the future professional activities have been analyzed. The characteristic of existing potential possibilities of self-realization and career building, formed under the influence of migration orientations, understanding of the culture of consumption of educational services and disbalance of demand and supply of labor force in modern labor market was given.","[Kostina, E.; Orlova, N.; Vinokurova, A.] Far Easter Fed Univ, Ajax 10,Campus FEFU, Russian Isl, Primorsky Kray, Russia",,"Kostina, E (通讯作者)，Far Easter Fed Univ, Ajax 10,Campus FEFU, Russian Isl, Primorsky Kray, Russia.",kostina.eyu@dvfu.ru,"Elena, Kostina/F-3407-2018; Надежда, Орлова/X-7998-2018",,,,,,18,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-656-3,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,47.0,,,,,,573,576,,,,,,4,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Operations Research & Management Science,BR9NX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000679066800129,0

Generally, the complexity and criticalness would be based on project weak spots and need to be evaluated by different factors. Very often, the synergy occurs between these factors. In this paper, we suggest some approaches how to model the synergy effect. Synergy is the creation of a whole that is greater than the simple sum of its parts. Hence, the simple principle of weighted sum is not appropriate model. Contrary the multiplicative model does not give reasonable results in the case of zero evaluation of at least one factor. Therefore, four possible normalization of criticalness factors are suggested and simple additive weighted model and multiplicative model are compared.","[Brozova, Helena; Rydval, Jan] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Syst Engn, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Brozová, H (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Syst Engn, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",brozova@pef.czu.cz; rydval@pef.czu.cz,"Rydval, Jan/C-7491-2017; Brozova, Helena/K-2834-2017","Rydval, Jan/0000-0002-3463-5042; Brozova, Helena/0000-0002-0322-251X",,,,,14,2,2,0,4,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-678-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,84,89,,,,,,6,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ7ED,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427151400015,0

In this context, data-based model learning can be viewed as a transformation process; a process transforming the information contained in data into the information represented by a model. The overfitting of a model often occurs when one considers an unnecessarily complex model, which usually means that the considered model contains more information than the original data. Thus, using one of the basic laws of information theory saying that any transformation cannot increase the amount of information, we get the basic restriction laid on models constructed from data: A model is acceptable if it does not contain more information than the input data file. This idea is also in agreement with the minimum description length principle that, roughly speaking, advices to prefer models described with a small number of parameters to more complex models.","[Jirousek, Radim] Acad Sci, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Prague, Czech Republic; [Jirousek, Radim; Krejcova, Iva] Univ Econ, Fac Management, Jindrichuv Hradec, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Theory & Automation of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Jirousek, R (通讯作者)，Acad Sci, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Prague, Czech Republic.;Jirousek, R (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Management, Jindrichuv Hradec, Czech Republic.",radim@utia.cas.cz; iva.krejcova@gmail.com,,,GACR [15-00215S],GACR(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"The authors want to express their gratitude to Nielsen Admosphere, a.s. for providing the research data free of charge.

Under the optimal operating condition to recover 200 kWh from exhaust gases, the average required heat load of absorber and condenser are 190 kWh and 175 kWh, respectively. When the generator temperature is eat at 60 degrees C, the cooling production from the absorption chiller is 172 W. The economic analysis suggests the average payback period to use the absorption system for UK industry application is about 2.5 years and the highest annual electricity cost saving can be as high as 105 per kw thermal heat input.

Apart from this, the question of whether it is efficient to make use of the cross-dock or the direct routes to customers is discussed. This is dependent on the trade and technical conditions of a particular logistic company. The space for optimization arises thanks to the two options of the transport (direct or via cross-dock) and a possibility that a parcel can be kept not sent off over a certain period of time.

Finding optimal form of the model is a complicated process, because it is necessary to test not only statistical significance of the parameters, but also the significance of the whole model and to respect the results of the diagnostics tests. While applying of this modelling on data of age-and-sex specific mortality rates, there is a problem in the number of those models. There are about 2 x 101 or more models in advanced populations, as each gender is necessary to model separately and the age range is usually surveyed by statistical offices in the intervals 0-100+ completed years of life. The aim of the paper is to assemble 2 x 101 optimal ARIMA models on the data of logarithms of age-and-sex specific mortality rates in the Czech Republic. Those models are diagnosed and consequently used for predictions. Other 2 x 101 ARIMA models are created on the same data, but using automatic process in software RStudio. It is applied a compromise form of the model on all time series. Both approaches - user and automatic are compared based on the results of the projection, that is recalculated on the probability of death of x-year old person.

The analysis showed that the successful implementation of the innovative project by more than 60% depends on the work carried out by the members of the initiative group before the organization of the enterprise and participation in the tender for receiving a grant from the Investor. At the Start Up stage, the Investor will only co-finance the work necessary to implement the innovative project. An analysis was conducted of 9 small enterprises, the data of which were available. The results were based on data on the two most successful enterprises. The first enterprise (LLC Video3) de facto became the head of an informal holding. Heads of the holding, without payment of consultations, communicating with colleagues from other enterprises give each other information: on the possibility of manufacturing separate units; on the cost of individual works and on the quality of implementation of co-executors; about the requirements of the inspectors. As a result, managers of enterprises always find the best option for fulfilling orders, and with minimal damage all possible checks are made.

Firstly, it provides an overview of the poverty assessment. The authors suggest that the methodology used for estimating the poverty level needs to be improved to develop an integrated approach taking into account both the expenditure structure and the household income level. It also analyzes the social and economic aspects of the negative trend that has been significantly high for years. According to the recent data from the Russian national statistical service over forty percent of all Russians with full-time employment still do not earn enough to live with dignity. This is causes the social tension along with purely economic problems such as the reduced consumption, the deficit of household savings, the complicated system of social assistance, the growth of shadow economy, the shortage of GDP and the rejection of skilled labour. Finally, it discusses the possibilities to limit the problem. The authors' study leads to the conclusion that the labour remuneration in market economy empowers employees to escape poverty. It is suggested that the human potential and the working force should be valued and wages should correspond to the labour performance. In particular, the increase in the minimum wage to the level of three subsistence minimums is required ensuring decent standards of living.","[Sabetova, T., V; Shevtsova, N.

However, symmetrisation of capital matrix is very rare and has not been done in the Czech Republic. It is a very complex task as it is in fact double symmetrisation as original matrix of stocks of fixed assets is in the dimension type of asset (AN) by industry (NACE). Several data sources were applied the most important are supply and use tables, estimated transformation matrices. The results enable sophisticated input-output analysis focused on the capital and the demand for capital that is caused by economic impulse or shock.

Therefore, studying the methods for capital raising to invest the country's higher education institutions (HEI) seems to be the task of highest priority. It is also important that any specific HEI realizes which funding sources are the most preferable for it, how efficiently the sources are utilized, and in what way its personal activity should be developed in the coming future. To select the best model for funding a newly emerged regional flagship HEI is particularly essential. The model of regional flagship technical HEI development should provide variants and mechanisms for developing regional systems in the following context: - limited federal and regional resources; - low demand for innovation; - problems with human resources, differently vectored interests of the subjects involved in the process.

Moreover, university students more frequently fail to finish their studies, or extend their study period, which is particularly noticeable in the blended learning form. Since the numbers of students represent a basis of an important part of university funding, this paper aims to analyze the most important factors influencing study results of university students. The study data is mostly categorical; thus we search for important factors affecting the results of study and analyze dependency structure of students' achievements during their studies using the apparatus of compositional models.

Our procedure is based on the lexicographical ordering of the coverage probabilities. Backtesting has a great meaning due to the fact that differentiating risk models which improperly estimate market risk constitute one of the crucial challenges in quantitative risk management. It is assumed, that a given model should provide a good accuracy of VaRs for any coverage probabilities or a combination of them. Conventionally, VaR is backtested for one coverage probability which may result in choosing a model that is not accurate in a multivariate case.

In this paper, an innovative heat recovery system was designed, manufactured and tested. The Flat Heat Pipe (FHP) is designed to recover the heat by radiation from hot steel rods during the manufacturing cooling process. The FHP system is composed of stainless steel heat pipes linked by a collector at the bottom and a shell and tube top header. The thermal performance of the FHP was investigated by testing the system at two positions from the barrier of the wires conveyor. The amount of the energy recovered and the working temperature of the FHP is also reported. The experimental results show that the heat transfer capability of the FHP is strongly influenced by the hot source temperature. It was observed from the results that the FHP is an innovative technology for waste heat recovery from industrial applications with high efficiency. (C) 2017 The Authors.

The fixed cost difference is considered in the evaluation since the decision to implement the plan for the inspection by variables and attributes may bring higher fixed cost in some cases in practice in comparison with performing just the attribute inspection due to presumably more difficult preparation of the inspection procedure.

The influence of a factor of inequality is considered for the countries which have big territories and are multinational on the example of regions of the Russian Federation. Human development is considered from a stability position as a factor of distributive justice, both in generations, and between them. Inequality between the poor and the rich not only reduces social stability of society, but also slows down development of economy. And questions of gender inequality, today, concern not only experts, but also a half of female population of the world that in turn also affects on the development of these countries. If to speak about development, then it is obvious that society is healthier, stronger, more educated when all its members are socially integrated into all processes irrespective of the level of income, sex, skin color and many other factors.","[Alekseeva, O.] North Caucasus Fed Univ, Management, Stavropol, Russia; [Zelinskaya, E.; Strashko, E.; Shunevych, O.] CFU, Sevastopol Inst Econ & Humanities Branch, Sevastopol, Russia; [Ryabtsev, A.] Minist Def RF, Chair Humanitarian Disciplines, Dr Hist Black Sea Higher Naval Order Red Star Sch, Sevastopol, Russia; [Strashko, E.; Shunevych, O.] CFU, Management, Sevastopol, Russia",North Caucasus Federal University,"Alekseeva, O (通讯作者)，North Caucasus Fed Univ, Management, Stavropol, Russia.",ok_aleks_science_ncfu@mail.ru; zelvovna@gmail.com; ryabtsevaee@yandex.ru; katyastrashko@mail.ru; shob2008@mail.ru,"Oksana, Alekseeva/ABB-3692-2021",,,,,,30,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-656-3,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,47.0,,,,,,826,831,,,,,,6,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Operations Research & Management Science,BR9NX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000679066800186,0

The authors consider patriotism in the context of realities of Soviet and modern Russian society, what allows them to demonstrate the possibilities and limitations of using the Soviet experience in the current conditions. Particular attention is paid to a comparative analysis of the two models of patriotism: as devotion to the state and as a love for one's country and nation. One of the main provisions of the article is the idea of the need not only to renew state efforts in the sphere of patriotic education of youth, but also to transform its goals, the basic values, the channels of translation and principles of heroization of patriotic behavior patterns. A secondary analysis of the results of sociological research has made it possible to indicate a stable and stereotyped dominance of the elements of the state patriotism model and the absence of everyday practices of patriotic behavior. The author's research was conducted by the method of focus-group discussion among specialists in youth policy in 2017. The results of the expert survey conducted by the authors noted the fuzziness of the content of the category patriotism, which does not allow it to become an effective instrument of the social policy of the Russian state. At the same time, it is revealed that the formation of patriotism in the second sense is actualized as the feeling of love for the Motherland. This feeling is based on personal responsibility and critical perception of the history and culture of your own country. The perspective of this approach should be the formation of a harmonious personality of a citizen capable of embodying patriotism at the level of a microsociety, macro environment and intercultural interaction.","[Cherkasova, V] Ural Inst Management, Branch RANEPA, Ekaterinburg, Russia; [Kopalova, O.] Russian State Profess Pedag Univ, Ekaterinburg, Russia; [Abramova, S.] Ural Fed Univ, Ekaterinburg, Russia",Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy & Public Administration; Russian State Vocational Pedagogical University; Ural Federal University,"Cherkasova, V (通讯作者)，Ural Inst Management, Branch RANEPA, Ekaterinburg, Russia.",vio-lett.cherckasowa@yandex.ru; kopalovaos@bk.ru; sofia_abramova@mail.ru,"Kopalova, Olga/AAY-9981-2021","Kopalova, Olga/0000-0002-1109-1839",,,,,17,0,0,1,4,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-656-3,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,47.0,,,,,,431,434,,,,,,4,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Operations Research & Management Science,BR9NX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000679066800096,0

In order to improve the current situation and pass from decay to the growth stage, it is necessary to initiate the activities for innovative development of Russian enterprises. The authors assume that the given problems can be resolved in two ways. First, oil and gas enterprises should widely introduce a wide range of innovative technologies since, on the one hand, this industry is one of the most important sectors of the Russian economy and is supported by the government, and on the other hand, enterprises of the given sector display a sufficiently high potential for internal reserves. Implementation of innovative technologies by empowerment of the energy resources allows for significant economic benefits and upgrading the efficiency of an enterprise within a short term. To resolve the given problem, the authors propose an innovative technology for raw hydrocarbons processing focused on enhancing efficient utilization of internal reserves. Another aspect of the problem is related with supporting innovation technologies interconnected with managerial technologies or managerial innovations being the changes aimed at providing a favorable environment for the outcome of innovative technologies. The practice shows that one of effective tools in innovation management is the project-based approach in implementation of innovative projects.","[Kiseleva, O.

Negative synergetic effects from the processes of digital transformation occur because of the presence of systemic dysfunction. The work considers such areas of systemic dysfunction as the labor sphere, the sphere of culture and education, as well as in the system of national security.

Economic security of a household is defined as the ability to achieve income necessary for covering household needs at its suitable level and to create financial reserves to be at disposal in case of unfavorable accidence. The research uses an exploratory analysis based on structural equation modeling. The questionnaire survey carried out in Poland in 2013 is a source of data for observed variables in an empirical model of economic security. The findings confirm that common educational and professional experiences, controlling for economy conditions, influence economic resourcefulness of household's members and, as a consequence, their economic security.

This paper investigates the properties of the European banking system, focusing on the community structure of the network to identify the potential channels for the propagation of financial distress. The network structure is estimated from the sparse partial correlation of CDS spreads using tlasso, a robust technique that induces sparsity in the network. The optimal community structure is then estimated by a procedure that maximises modularity. The analysis shows that, despite the high level of internationalization of the financial system, it exist a clear community structure that mirrors the geographical location of the banks. Finally, a decomposition of strength centrality based on the estimated community structure is provided. Such decomposition represents a useful and easy-to-implement tool to monitor the exposure to financial contagion, integrating the traditional risk management tools.","[Torri, Gabriele] Univ Bergamo, Via Caniana 2, I-24127 Bergamo, Italy",University of Bergamo,"Torri, G (通讯作者)，Univ Bergamo, Via Caniana 2, I-24127 Bergamo, Italy.",gabriele.torri@unibg.it,"Torri, Gabriele/AAK-3453-2021",,,,,,16,0,0,0,0,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-678-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,807,812,,,,,,6,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ7ED,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427151400138,0

This is insisted on by both economists and government officials. The traditional approach is based on the fact that the raising the retirement age will result in savings in the social insurance system, as people will retire later. In addition, they will continue to work, and employers will pay contributions, which will lead to an improvement in the financial situation in social insurance. In a large context, it is considered that the employment of older people in conditions of a reduction of the economically active population will also contribute to the development of the economy. This approach is one-party. Older people often get sick, so the raising the retirement age will lead to increase health care costs and sickness benefits. It is also necessary to take into account the tradition of retirement in Russia and the desire of most of older people not to work too long, but to devote themselves to the family. The scientific novelty of the study is the conclusion that retirement is often associated with a subjective assessment of social risk - a person evaluates himself as old, and wants to quit his job. On the basis of this, it is proposed to maintain the retirement age and, at the same time, to increase the incentives for later retirement.","[Istomina, Y.

However, most aspects of this stage are still slowly researched. As a result, a computational power of a modern computer doubles every year since the 1970s while the maintenance cost declines at about the same rate. On the other hand, every component of the human activity today is accompanied by a digital recording. Thus, various users of information have collected more data over the past two years than in the last third of the twentieth century. The number of the interactive devices is also growing rapidly. In 2016 four billion smartphones were purchased and activated in the world in addition to the two billion in use. And all these smartphones as well as laptops, tablets, sensors and cameras create data streams of large volume - 2.5 exabytes each day. The sharp change of the data amount and the increase in the digital tools number transform all aspects of social and economic life, affecting more and more areas of entrepreneurship, trade, production and services. This in turn forms the conditions in which organization management systems and consequently the mechanisms of value creation of organizations are experiencing their own digital revolution, which has a significant impact on functioning processes and effectiveness of risk management. It is important to note that according to our estimates, which are given further in the article, now 70% of Russian organizations have only an approximate understanding of the nature and the content of the digital risks that may accompany their activity in the future, in turn, only 10% Russian organizations have formed mechanisms for digital risks management within their management systems.

The purpose of the research is to determine the factors and assess the level of demographic differentiation of Chinese regions. The main hypothesis of the research is the thesis that the intensification of unevenness of demographic development in different regions (provinces and cities) is caused by two interrelated factors: accelerated growth of China's national economy and consequences of the One family - one child policy, which took place until 2015.

The analysis of the contradictions in the level of demand for vocational education services, the offering of these services and the interaction of supply and demand were carried out to understand the extent to which the system is ready to respond to these challenges. Key problems of transition to the model of continuous vocational education based on the results of the analysis, are formulated. The criteria for selecting measures aimed at resolving contradictions were proposed, the main one is the optimal ratio of flexibility and social security. Methods of logical and statistical analysis, systemic and institutional approaches were used in the process of work. The most significant sources of information were studied.","[Rusakova, T.

The necessity of combining the opposing criteria leads to the challenge complexity. The quality of logistic services results in company competitive advantage. It requires higher density of logistic objects and number of routes. However, efficiency of supply chain is qualification if not decisive criterion for customers. It has to be incorporated in it.

The effects on economy (especially on output, deficit and debt) are examined using impulse response functions of shocks in the stochastic components of the implicit tax rate.

Currently, gas boilers are mostly applied in the domestic water heating which contribute significantly to excessive CO2 emissions and consumption of primary energy resources. The issues can be solved by popularizing heat pump systems that are attributable to higher performance efficiency than those of traditional gas boilers. Even so, the heat pump system performance can be further enhanced and improved if the dissolved gases in its hot water circuit can be efficiently discharged. To achieve this target, the bubble behaviors in the heat pump water heating system need to be extensively investigated. Based on a purposely built test rig of an air-water heat pump system, the effects of various heat pump hot water side parameters on gas microbubble diameters were measured and analyzed through different experimental conditions. The operational parameters include water flow rate, water flow pressure, system heating load and water flow dissolved gas saturation ratio. It is found from the measurements that the hot water flow rate is the dominate parameter which affects the average bubble diameter and bubble number distribution at different bubble sizes. The research outcomes can significantly contribute to the understanding of gas bubble behaviors at domestic heat pump water heating systems and thus the efficient way for the discharging of the associated dissolved gases.

The Jarque-Bera test is the most widely adopted omnibus test of normality in econometrics, finance and related fields. Finally, the Lilliefors test is a representative test based on the comparison of theoretical and empirical distribution function. As outliers in the data sets in the field of economics and finance are frequently present, the Jarque-Bera test is not sufficiently robust, since it is based on the classical characteristics of skewness and kurtosis and has a zero breakdown point. Consequently, the aim of this paper is to derive robust tests of normality that belong to the RT class tests using pseudomedian in the construction of test statistics, and to highlight the benefits of its use in testing normality in the datasets where outliers are present.","[Strelec, Lubos] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Stat & Operat Anal, Zemedelska 1, Brno, Czech Republic; [Grochova, Ladislava Issever] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Zemedelska 1, Brno, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Mendel University in Brno,"Strelec, L (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Stat & Operat Anal, Zemedelska 1, Brno, Czech Republic.",lubos.strelec@mendelu.cz; ladislava.grochova@mendelu.cz,"Issever Grochova, Ladislava/E-6841-2013; Strelec, Lubos/F-5537-2012; Grochová, Ladislava Issever/AAE-9065-2021","Strelec, Lubos/0000-0003-1556-0687; Grochová, Ladislava Issever/0000-0002-9983-4077",Czech Science Foundation [GA16-07089S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),Supported by the grant No. GA16- 07089S of the Czech Science Foundation.,,16,0,0,0,2,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-678-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,738,743,,,,,,6,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ7ED,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427151400126,0

Its basic form is devoted to optimisation of transportation plans how to supply customers from storehouses with homogeneous types of consignments. Optimisation criterions which are most often used are the total transportation costs or the total covered distance. In practice, we can find many possible applications of the transportation problem. For example, in rail transport the transportation problem can be applied in optimisation of capacity smoothing, in road transport in optimisation of transportation of empty containers between combined transport terminals and their customers and so on. To fulfil each transportation plan, we need some vehicles, the vehicles are assigned to a depot (or depots) where they are parked. The transportation plan usually consists of three types of trips. The first type trips are represented by the trips when the vehicles are loaded (the productive trips). The trips of the second and third type are non-productive (deadheading). The second type trips correspond to the trips of the empty vehicles going from the places of their unloading to the places where the vehicles are loaded again. The third type trips are the trips between the vehicle depots and the first loading places or the last places of unloading and the depots. However, the basic model of the transportation problem does not consider these second and third type trips. An isolated solution for the individual types of the trips of such transportation problem is not suitable because decomposition does not assure optimality of such solution.

This ensures the comparability with gross domestic product and other aggregates that are the subjects of researchers studies. This clear advantage is compensated by often and regular updates of national accounts figures due to the changes in statistical data sources or national accounts standards.

It is especially useful for market segmentation, in which objects are divided into homogenous segments (clusters) which are further analyzed to obtain segment-specific insights. This contribution presents an application of cluster analysis on multivariate data provided by a company from a field of tourism. The dataset contains information about 5,755 travels of its customers, such as the number of passengers traveling together, age, nationality, route details, price, number of destinations booked, etc. The goal of the analysis is to divide the customers into several distinct segments according to their profiles, while demonstrating the importance of distance measure selection and linkage method selection. The results of the analysis will help to develop a targeted marketing program for the company. Since the dataset contains categorical or categorized variables, hierarchical cluster analysis for categorical data is applied to perform the market segmentation. Due to the fact, that clustering process is always strongly dependent on a similarity measure used and also on a linkage method, the optimal cluster assignment is being chosen among five similarity measures for categorical data and three linkage methods. Clustering solutions corresponding to a specific similarity measure and a specific linkage method are compared and evaluated by internal evaluation indices, which allow finding the optimal number of segments, evaluate their internal consistency and determine the best clustering solution possible.","[Cibulkova, Jana; Sulc, Zdenek] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Stat & Probabil, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Cibulková, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Stat & Probabil, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague, Czech Republic.",jana.cibulkova@vse.cz; zdenek.sulc@vse.cz,"Sulc, Zdenek/A-2681-2019",,"University of Economics, Prague [IGA F4/44/2018]","University of Economics, Prague","This work was supported by the University of Economics, Prague under Grant IGA F4/44/2018.",,16,0,0,0,1,OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE,PRAGUE 3,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",2453-9902,,978-80-245-2277-7,APPLI MATH STAT ECON,Applications of Mathematics and Statistics in Economics Conference Proceedings,,2018,,,,,,,50,60,,,,,,11,"Economics; Mathematics, Applied; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BO8KL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000527695100005,0

Using a faster method for the estimation of the liability value allows the actuaries to study more investment strategies and provide a more complex analysis or sensitivities to understand market risk or manage proper investment strategies by asset liability management. In this paper, we focus on the application of the dynamic asset liability management in life insurance business and the faster liability model based on cluster analysis.

The modelling of freezers has been conducted mainly around food processing, to observe the cooling rate during the chilling process. Typically, cryogenic freezers operate with a mix of air and nitrogen as the working fluid, with the effects on the heat transfer coefficient being thoroughly noted, in a range of applications. The effect of the heat transfer coefficient has not been investigated in a liquid nitrogen application, with a cryogenic applicability. This paper will focus on the CFD visualisation of the circulation of air around a lab scale cryogenic batch freezer. The effect of the heat transfer coefficient will be investigated in a number of scenarios, such as shelf loading conditions, product configuration and thermal profiles. The cryogenic batch freezer will be simulated in a range of room temperatures starting from-70 C, using a thermal profile which was obtained experimentally. (C) 2017 The Authors.

In this, the attention of customers is focused on instalment cards. Nevertheless, for most people are not still used to that product. In this regard, there is a challenge before banks to influence the consumer behaviour in choosing an appropriate product which involves a detailed portrayal of the target audience. The description of a buying decision makes it possible to classify styles of consumer behaviour: constructive (taking into account consumers' needs and income) and adaptive (based on emotions, namely, fear of losing social standing or being taken for a failure by the others). While describing styles of consumer behaviour we were bearing in mind the impact of such factors as gender, age and level of material gains on them. The results obtained showed that the factors mentioned above should be applied as a whole, as in isolation from one another they don't indicate propensity to a particular style of consumer behaviour. Consumer style of men and women varies at different age periods. For example, among women, adaptive behaviour is typical for the youthful stage )the age of 17-23) and after the age of 24 they are apt to deciding on constructive style; men prefer constructive style in the period of middle adulthood (the age period of 24-45), but after that period this tendency is declining. As for the level of material well-being, women with lower-middle and middle income as well as men with middle income target constructive style. The higher the income, the greater is the likelihood of purchasing products just to demonstrate one's status rather than meeting real needs both of men and women. Thus, being aware of the effects of gender, age and level of income on the style of consuming loan products experts will be able to develop promotion strategies for each target group which will increase the effectiveness of the implemented marketing events.","[Golub, O., V; Timofeeva, T.

All relevant criteria should be taken into account in the process of the building savings selection in order to make a responsible and judicious decision. To choose the most suitable building savings, I propose to apply the quantitative approach of multicriteria evaluation of alternatives. For this purpose, enhancing modifications and combinations of ELECTRE I and ELECTRE III methods are introduced.

The players 'score' in a game is an unobservable latent variable and the only way to measure it is indirectly through a result of a match played between two players. In these matches a definite winner can be determined, thus we do not consider games which could end up with a tie. We have also developed a model to measure tournament transitivity and player consistency. Since the player ranking is a one dimensional value, their ordering has to be transitive, but the results of the tournament in general may not conform to this notion. This would result in estimations with very high variance. Our measures take both the transitivity and player estimation variance into account. We have also applied those models to several real world tournaments and their results to test our approach on real data.","[Dvorak, Marek; Fiala, Petr] Univ Econ, Dept Econometr, W Churchill Sq 1938-4, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Dvorák, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Dept Econometr, W Churchill Sq 1938-4, Prague, Czech Republic.",marek.dvorak@vse.cz; pfiala@vse.cz,"Fiala, Petr/K-6823-2015",,"Internal Grant Agency, Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, University of Economics, Prague [IGA F4/57/2017]","Internal Grant Agency, Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, University of Economics, Prague","Supported by the grant No. IGA F4/57/2017 of the Internal Grant Agency, Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, University of Economics, Prague.",,5,1,1,0,0,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-678-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,143,148,,,,,,6,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ7ED,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427151400025,0

Around 30% of global primary energy consumption is attributed to the industrial sector and a significant portion of this is rejected as heat. The majority of this wasted energy is available at temperatures below 100 degrees C and as such conventional waste heat to power conversion systems cannot economically recover the energy, producing simple pay backs that are unacceptable to industry. The Trilateral Flash Cycle (TFC) is however a promising technology with the ability to harness the rejected heat found in these low grade waste streams. The current research work presents a techno-economic assessment of the installation potential for a low grade heat to power conversion system using a TFC system. In particular, thermodynamic modelling is utilised to estimate the expected energy recovery and, in turn, the potential savings achievable through the TFC solution. The survey investigated three diverse and challenging heat sources at steel production plants. Annual energy recovery from the chosen heat source is expected to be 782 MWh. Prior to the upscaling of the system to the 2MW waste thermal power, a pilot test rig was designed and built. Preliminary tests showed a net electrical power output up to 6.2 kW and an overall efficiency of 4.3%. (C) 2017 The Authors.

The second stage of the research was devoted to cointegration analysis. For this purpose, stationarity of the conditional correlations was verified with application of Phillips-Perron test. Next, based on the Johansen procedure a long-term relationship structure was established. In the end, a common global factor determining the changes in interdependence was identified with application of confirmatory factor analysis. The common global factor projections reflect the leading direction of changes in the interdependence among the markets.

Part 2 of this paper then uses life cycle assessment and energy use data is coupled with the representative recipe of roast beef and Yorkshire pudding, to calculate the embodied energy of the meal. Seven interventions are modelled to illustrate how sustainable cookery can play a role as part of a sustainable food system. Interventions show that sustainable cookery has the potential to reduce cookery related energy use by 18%, and integrating sustainable cookery within a sustainable food system has the potential to reduce the total energy use by 55%. Finally, the paper discusses the issue of how the adoption of the sustainable cookery agenda may help or hinder attempts to shift consumers towards sustainable diets. (C) 2017 The Authors.

For this reason, authors believe that there is the necessity to find a model of measurement that takes in greater consideration life style of their inhabitants, namely: the cost of products and the monthly salary. This method of measurement revolutionizes the traditional one because it does not take into account some factors such as national borders (the level of wealth varies from city to city) even if it presents some technical problems that are the basket of assets to be taken into account and volatility of prices and salaries. In any case, the new measurement method wants to visualize the level of economic well-being based on the real standard of living that people, according to their salary, can afford.","[Barhatov, V; Bents, D.; Campa, A.; Ospanova, K.] Chelyabinsk State Univ, Inst Econ Ind Business & Adm, Chelyabinsk, Russia",Chelyabinsk State University,"Barhatov, V (通讯作者)，Chelyabinsk State Univ, Inst Econ Ind Business & Adm, Chelyabinsk, Russia.",,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-656-3,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,47.0,,,,,,1000,1003,,,,,,4,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Operations Research & Management Science,BR9NX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000679066800226,0

Today in the Russian Far East. priority social and economic development areas have been established; the Innovative Territorial Cluster of Aircraft Engineering and Shipbuilding (TCAES) operates in Khabarovsk Krai. The research of cooperation chains of the innovation cluster's anchor resident in the territory of advanced development made it possible to conclude that regional organizations play a small part in the value chain of hi-tech products. Their contribution, for the most part, is about the provision of labour resources, general infrastructure and the provision of services, primarily in construction, installation, and maintenance. At the same time, small innovative businesses under a state university situated in the territory of advanced development participate in the territorial innovative cluster. The research of the university's engagement with cluster participants made it possible to formulate a hypothesis on the higher education institution's cluster initiatives in the region. It has been proved that the establishment of small innovative businesses under a university helps to launch cluster initiatives in the production industry of a region. New demand emerges when there is engagement in the value chain; in order to meet that demand the participants of that engagement (the institution, first of all) conduct R&D and come up with innovative ideas that are later introduced into the production industry. The described processes help to understand the new role of higher education institutions in the management of regional development. The university is considered the centre of regional development that introduces education, research, and development activities into the curriculum. The creation of innovative infrastructure in territories of advanced development and business promotion can encourage the commercialization of scientific and technological ideas within a university. The goal of this research is to test the hypothesis on a higher education institution's cluster initiatives in an advanced development area. The authors examined the models of an institution's engagement with the cluster's production companies in the advanced development area using the example of Komsomolsk-on-Amur.

The latter lead to degradation and even destruction of the biosphere and biospheric life in the next two or three centuries, and to global and controversial transformation of the human. In this paper we will focus attention mainly on some global economic trends that are determined primarily by economic-technocratic development of modern capitalism, and the socio-political and spiritual subjugation of planet's population to such development. Industrial development of society, harassed by selfishness not only of the technocrats but also of wider population, is towards the creation of the technosphere with its contradictory nature. Among global economic trends that have firmly established themselves and are now establishing on earth, the most important of these are noted by authors: destruction of the biosphere-biotic nutrient cycle and formation of socio-technological, or anthropo-technogenic cycle; the growth of the collective human mind (noos), directed by technocrats to meet their needs and interests etc.","[Dergacheva, E.

In practice, however, not all businesses use these options effectively and the level of quality on business websites varies wildly. Consequently, a flexible and easy applicable methodology providing companies with a possibility to evaluate their own presence would be beneficial. There are many mathematical, statistical and decision-making methods which could form its core. In our contribution, we create such a methodology for scoring of corporate websites based on partial least squares path modeling.

Comprehensive assessment of efficient management of sanitary and epidemiological safety of population is offered, that is understood as a comparison of economic benefits from environmental improving with value of population wellness upgrading. Estimation results of the main characteristics of sanitary and epidemiological safety of single-industry town residents in Russia such as the quality of atmospheric air, soil and water, different emissions and occupational illnesses are introduced. Data basis of the research characteristic values was taken from the statistics of Chelyabinsk region Department of Federal agency of supervision in consumer rights protection and human welfare in Magnitogorsk. The methods of economic analysis were used as the research tools. The research relevance is determined by the concern of physical condition and wellness of the population which is constantly being influenced with negative impact of the environment, large enterprises' activity, low -quality nutrition and natural resources, labour safety troubles. The research findings of the emissions in industry-based cities allow us to conclude that there is a real decrease in the amount of the pollutants from stationary resources in the industrial cities by 2,272 tons due to the taken environmental measures. According to the research, the major pollutant of the atmospheric air is benzapyrene, as well as suspended substances and ferrous oxide, but the leading sources of benzapyrene pollution are PSC -MMK, JSC -MRK and motor vehicles.

The forecasting of tap water quality improvement and water hardness reduction as well after water purification system setting within the research is based on the retrospective results of similar water purification systems implementation in municipalities of constituent territories of the Federation and probabilistic forecasting system. The carried out calculations have shown 7,039% as an average amount of tap-water quality increase. The research findings have practical relevance as they can be used to enhance the available programs in federal and regional levels in order to improve ecological environment.","[Zinovyeva, E.

However, modelling distributions of returns is of less importance around median than it is in the tails, where extreme events appear. Studies of tail thickness confirmed, that they are embraced between Gaussian and alpha-stable models. Our research also concentrates on the tails. We tried to approximate them with several distributions, covering the whole range of possibilities, from thin to fat. Addi-tional value comes from applied goodness of fit tests. When data is truncated, which is our case, testing goodness of fit using standard statistical tests is inappropriate. Instead, we suggest employing modified standard tests like Anderson-Darling, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Kuiper, Cramer-von Mises ones and tests designed specifically to measure the fit in tails. We conducted research based on 19 assets like indexes, currencies, stocks and future contracts, putting special emphasis on the Polish stock market.","[Echaust, Krzysztof; Lach, Agnieszka] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Dept Operat Res, Al Niepodleglosci 10, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Echaust, K (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Dept Operat Res, Al Niepodleglosci 10, Poznan, Poland.",k.echaust@ue.poznan.pl; agalach@interia.pl,"Echaust, Krzysztof/AAH-7371-2020",,,,,,22,0,0,0,1,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-678-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,149,154,,,,,,6,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ7ED,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427151400026,0

Consequently, the trend towards such technologies has been greatly intensifying, leading these solutions to take root in European commercial refrigeration sector. In this theoretical study, the performance of the present state-of-the-art pure CO2 refrigeration plants was extensively investigated for an average size food retail located in various European climate contexts. The results revealed that, compared to a R404A direct expansion unit, the energy efficiency limit commonly experienced by transcritical R744 refrigerating systems with rise in outdoor temperature disappears with the aid of the multi-ejector concept. Furthermore, depending on the selected solution, the current advanced commercial CO2 only configurations feature energy savings ranging from 3% to 37.1% across Europe over a R404A unit. At last, this investigation demonstrates that transcritical R744 ejector supported parallel systems are the most highly efficient and climate friendly technologies for European food retail industry. Moreover, noteworthy energy conservations can also be related to the solution combining parallel (or auxiliary) compression and medium temperature (MT) overfed evaporators. (C) 2017 The Authors.

The aim of this paper is to describe a class of optimal control problems that can be solved without using Pontryagin's maximum principle and without using a system of ordinary differential equations. At first a class of optimal control problems that can be formulated as a line integral is introduced. Then general results for finite time horizon problems that are based on Green's theorem are presented.

The system of education, as one of such basic institutions, became the object of reforms, which have not been completed so far. A logical question about the goal of such reforms arises naturally, but it is hardly possible to get a response to it from governmental officials. To proceed not from declarations, but from real contents of these reforms, it becomes clear that they gear at adapting the tasks of education to the needs of the country returned to the fold of the world civilization. The last notion was understood as part of Russia's integration into the system of global labor division as a primary resource supplier for economically developed countries of the capitalist core. The Soviet system of education, oriented to providing the USSR with an independent place in the world as a superpower, became redundant under the new conditions. It was aimed at developing students' ability of comprehensive operational thinking. For a country whose claims are limited to the level of a regional power, it is enough to have just a few competent specialists to support its economy and defense capability at a level sufficient for the comfortable existence of local oligarchic elite. However, as it is shown by historical experience, the global elite views Russia as a country that suffered a crushing defeat in the Cold War, therefore, it is demanded a full and unconditional surrender. The Russian Federation has no choice but to rely on its own strengths in such situation. That means that reforms of the national educational system that have been going on for almost three decades in a row are in flagrant contradiction with this new reality. Russia faces a historic challenge and is able give an appropriate answer to it only one way - by restoring the Soviet educational system, its fundamental principles at the least. Only then the reform of education in the country will be finally over.","[Livschits, R.] Amur State Univ Humanities & Pedag, Dept Philosophy Social & Polit Disciplines, Komsomolsk On Amur, Russia",,"Livschits, R (通讯作者)，Amur State Univ Humanities & Pedag, Dept Philosophy Social & Polit Disciplines, Komsomolsk On Amur, Russia.",rudliv@yandex.ru,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-656-3,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,47.0,,,,,,638,640,,,,,,3,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Operations Research & Management Science,BR9NX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000679066800142,0

The first option allows the use of only account 43 Finished products and the evaluation of finished products at actual cost. As a result, a true valuation of ac-counting indicators: finished goods in a warehouse, work in progress, cost, gross profit and sales profit. The second variant of accounting assumes the use, in addition to account 43, of an additional account 40 Release of products, (works, services) and the formation of the regulatory cost price. This variant of accounting is preferred, as a rule, by production enterprises of a serial and mass type. They choose a standard method of accounting of expenses and calculation of product cost.

Thus More efficient project management is needed in order to maintain schedules and reduce cost. Although there are several stages in business system development projects. There are many stages of planning, development, system examination, and upgrade. And there are some factors that cause over cost or schedule delay of projects. Especially in early stage there are risks of projects. In business system development projects, there are stages of planning, development, system examination, and upgrade. Additionally In most business system development, costs and completion dates are difficult to predict. More efficient project management is needed in order to maintain schedules and reduce cost. Narrowing down requirements to applicable specifications is effective means to shorten schedules and reduce costs. Also evaluating risk properly avoids schedule delay and over cost. This paper aims to evaluate risk of business system development project using requirement analysis with cost share rates and probabilistic risk evaluation. Cost share rate is defined as the percentage of total cost assigned to each requirement. Cost share rate could indicates essentiality of requirements. Requirements need large cost share rate must have large risk, should be under strict control. At the conclusion, this paper shows the potential to evaluate risk of business system development using cost share rate and probabilistic risk evaluation. In the future, this method would be able to help evaluate risk properly in business system development projects in order to shorten schedule and reduce costs.","[Mochida, Shinji] Univ Mkt & Distribut Sci, Fac Commerce, Nishi Ku, 3-1 Gakuen Nishimachi, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan",,"Mochida, S (通讯作者)，Univ Mkt & Distribut Sci, Fac Commerce, Nishi Ku, 3-1 Gakuen Nishimachi, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan.",mochida@red.umds.ac.jp,,,JSPS KAKENHI [17K00354]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17K00354] Funding Source: KAKEN,"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 17K00354.

In Poland the system performance decreased by 1 percentage point. The quality of healthcare systems in G4 countries is higher than in Portugal and Spain and comparable to the system quality in the United Kingdom and Germany when we treat each dimension equally. When the quality of the system is measured from patients' point of view (performance and patients' satisfaction weigh more), G4 countries offer a significantly lower quality of healthcare systems.","[Biernacki, Marek] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Management Comp Sci & Finance, Dept Math & Cybernet, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Biernacki, M (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Management Comp Sci & Finance, Dept Math & Cybernet, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",marek.biernacki@ue.wroc.pl,,"Biernacki, Marek/0000-0002-7738-2065",,,,,13,0,0,0,0,OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE,PRAGUE 3,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",2453-9902,,978-80-245-2277-7,APPLI MATH STAT ECON,Applications of Mathematics and Statistics in Economics Conference Proceedings,,2018,,,,,,,18,26,,,,,,9,"Economics; Mathematics, Applied; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BO8KL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000527695100002,0

The research done presents the analysis of the Far-Eastern state transport university revenue (Khabarovsk, Russia) and investigates the major difficulty for the university which lies in the following: the organization's underfunding brings forth an issue for its overall management. One of the main points revealed through the analysis is chronic underfunding of capital expenditure in the university. Capital expenditure used to be effected on account of capital appropriation of extra-budgetary sources of the institution. Nowadays, it is out of the question since the extra-budgetary fund is used to cover payroll payments of the academic teaching staff in accordance with President Putin's decrees. The authors of the article consider budgetary financing of payroll payments to be a solution to the problem in the university. Moreover, the released capital source can be used for capital expenditure of the university to upgrade its equipment and infrastructure.","[Derbas, N.; Bryleva, L.; Basina, N.] Far Eastern State Transport Univ, Inst Econ, Khabarovsk, Russia",Economic Research Institute of Far Eastern Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences,"Derbas, N (通讯作者)，Far Eastern State Transport Univ, Inst Econ, Khabarovsk, Russia.",Derbas@mail.ru; LGBryleva@mail.ru; Bna8a@mail.ru,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-656-3,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,47.0,,,,,,799,802,,,,,,4,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Operations Research & Management Science,BR9NX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000679066800179,0

One of the requirements for working with AR(p) is the ability to estimate parameters of the model correctly. However, we currently often deal with big data, which can lead, among others, to a higher probability of outlier presence. As it is known, standard methods for parameter estimation are often not able to work correctly with outliers, and, consequently, standard estimates are usually biased. Therefore, working with sufficiently robust methods has increased in importance. In this paper, we present several robust moment methods for parameter estimation in AR(p) and we compare them using a simulation study. Outliers in the simulations are modelled using two most frequently used outlier models: additive outlier (AO) and innovative outlier (IO). For the simulation study, we use the R statistical software.","[Flimmel, Samuel; Fojtik, Jan; Mala, Ivana; Prochazka, Jiri] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Stat & Probabil, W Churchill Sq 1938-4, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Flimmel, S (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Stat & Probabil, W Churchill Sq 1938-4, Prague, Czech Republic.",samuel.flimmel@vse.cz; xfojj00@vse.cz; malai@vse.cz; xproj16@vse.cz,,,Internal Grant Agency of the University of Economics in Prague [F4/17/2017],Internal Grant Agency of the University of Economics in Prague,"This study was supported by the grant F4/17/2017 (Robustnost v umyselnom useknuti casoveho radu), which has been provided by the Internal Grant Agency of the University of Economics in Prague.",,13,0,0,0,1,OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE,PRAGUE 3,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",2453-9902,,978-80-245-2277-7,APPLI MATH STAT ECON,Applications of Mathematics and Statistics in Economics Conference Proceedings,,2018,,,,,,,85,95,,,,,,11,"Economics; Mathematics, Applied; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BO8KL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000527695100008,0

The research subject is the network of socioeconomic relations concerning food security between the entities of fisheries management and the society. The authors examine in detail the Russia's fisheries management influence on national food security within a systemic, multicomponent approach, based on indicators of the fisheries management products availability (production volumes, bioresource potential, anthropogenic threats), fish products affordability and fish products consumption (quality and safety). The research information base includes the official conceptual documents and regulatory legal acts of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Federal Agency for Fisheries of the Russian Federation; the Federal State Statistics Service materials; expert assessments and Russian and foreign scientists calculations published in the scientific literature. Traditional methods of scientific analysis, economic and mathematical statistics, technical, economic and logical analysis, graphic modeling, etc. were used as a methodological background. The authors show a high degree of the country's self-sufficiency in fish products and independence of food supply from import deliveries. There are three aspects of threats to food security: quantitative (the export orientation of Russian fish producers, the production decline of some fish products, anthropogenic threats to the resource base, low level of fish farming), socio-economic (deterioration in the food affordability conditions for the population due to rising prices and falling real incomes of the population with the simultaneous new consumer habits formation in our society) and qualitative-certification (fish products of questionable quality and counterfeit products penetration to the Russian market).

The analysis was done for Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary at regional level (NUTS 1) with application of Eurostat data for the years 2011 and 2015. In TOPSIS method a choice of metric used for calculation the distance of objects from positive and negative ideas solutions is a key problem. Generalized distance measure GDM is a metric, which can be applied for variables measured on the ratio scale, interval scale, the ordinal scale or the nominal scale.

The aim of this contribution is to examine possibly dissimilar impacts of exogenous shocks to an economy where workers exhibit different levels of qualification. In this sense, I firstly introduce the model with labour market segmentation that splits the aggregate labour market between the following two sectors: one populated by workers with high level of qualification and the other with less qualified workers. This model is then calibrated to fit the characteristics of the US economy, and its dynamic properties are compared with the Lubik's original model.","[Chalmoviansky, Jakub] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Chalmoviansky, J (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, Brno, Czech Republic.",chalmovian-sky@mail.muni.cz,"Chalmoviansky, Jakub/ABH-4317-2020","Chalmoviansky, Jakub/0000-0001-9889-2112","Faculty of Economics and Administration, Masaryk University [MUNI/A/0987/2016]","Faculty of Economics and Administration, Masaryk University","This work was supported by funding of specific research at Faculty of Economics and Administration, Masaryk University, project MUNI/A/0987/2016.

Basic requirement for solution is that service vehicle capacity holds for all requirements, which are placed at vertices of graph (it could be a collection or distribution). However, it is a common practice that capacity of service vehicle is less than all requirements, which must be satisfied. One of basic ways for troubleshooting is a decomposition of the input set of vertices into several subsets so that the sum of capacity requirements in individual subsets does not exceed the capacity of service vehicle. In these subsets, the optimal route can be found by some of the accessible ways: an exact solution in case of small-scale tasks, heuristics in case of large-scale tasks. The core of the present paper deals with the use of the concept of the Sweep Algorithm for decomposing input set of vertices and subsequent determining optimal vehicle routes using an exact algorithm.

The relevance is caused, first of all, by change of an economic paradigm in general and also inevitable transformations of social processes. Within traditional economy the purpose of the economic transaction is transfer of property on a product. The economy of sharing consumption has changed standard idea of the transaction purpose. This new type of economy is the economy based on possible access, but not on possession of physical and human assets, such as time, space and skills. (Botsman & Rogers 2010). In other words, people lend and borrow assets, but don't buy and own them. Economy of joint consumption (sharing economy) - the economic model based on collective use of goods and services, exchange and rent instead of possession. Now society passes from overconsumption to model of joint consumption. Moreover, joint consumption becomes a basis of the business ideas. The article's purpose - to study features and tendencies of development of sharing economy in Russia, to analyze the main spheres in which the similar model of the relations develops, to establish the reasons which are slowing down development of sharing economy. The main approaches to measurement of economy of joint consumption are analyzed in the presented work. Much attention is paid to a problem of trust. Many researchers call trust the social capital which is the basement of the economic relations. It is possible to allocate several forms of trust. Now most people trust familiar people. The economy of joint consumption gives the chance of the communication based on trust. Also this type of economy allows to save resources and, as a result, keep the ecological balance. The main advantages and industries, technologies of sharing economy are studied in the article.","[Barkhatov, V; Silova, E.; Lymar, E.] Chelyabinsk State Univ, Inst Econ Ind Business & Adm, Chelyabinsk, Russia",Chelyabinsk State University,"Barkhatov, V (通讯作者)，Chelyabinsk State Univ, Inst Econ Ind Business & Adm, Chelyabinsk, Russia.",ecoba@csu.ru; lymar@csu.ru,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,3,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-656-3,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,47.0,,,,,,1004,1008,,,,,,5,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Operations Research & Management Science,BR9NX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000679066800227,0

For this purpose, it is necessary to solve the task of maximizing the reliability parameters when limiting the value of no-failure operation probability and the total cost of MNT and SPTA. Such adaptive approach to MNT suggests that the technical condition of the product is continuously analyzed on the real time basis by using an integrated control on all admitting nodes. Similarly, an optimal set of SPTA is calculated depending on the current and forecasted values of the technical condition of the system. Within the framework of the proposed adaptive MNT the integrated control should be used on all the nodes where it is possible, and the data on the technical condition are transferred to the server where the optimization task is performed, including forecasting by machine learning methods.","[Boev, S.; Kiryanov, D.] RTI Grp, 10,8 Marta St,Bld 1, Moscow 127083, Russia; [Matveeva, S.] JSC Mintz Radio Engn Inst, 10,8 Marta St,Bld 1, Moscow 127083, Russia",,"Boev, S (通讯作者)，RTI Grp, 10,8 Marta St,Bld 1, Moscow 127083, Russia.",kirianov2002@mail.ru; kirianov2002@mail.ru,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,4,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-656-3,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,47.0,,,,,,581,584,,,,,,4,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Operations Research & Management Science,BR9NX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000679066800131,0

However, in the context of limited funding for geological exploration programs and the reproduction of mineral resource base, the issue of priority areas identification for the development of regional mineral resource base that could become catalysts for the growth of region's economy is becoming topical. This is especially important for regions rich in mineral and raw materials resources, for which the natural and geographical factor is crucial for the specialization of regional industry, but at the same time that are poorly developed and covered, primarily in the infrastructural plan. The purpose of this article is to develop a methodology to calculate the investment potential of mineral resource base in the areas of new development. The method to achieve this goal is the development and use of an integral indicator of subsoil investment potential, adjusted by indicators of infrastructure coverage of the territory with the use of scoring expert assessments. As a result, a methodology was developed to calculate investment potential, taking into account a set of indicators for the expert assessment of infrastructure coverage, which was tested in the most difficult region in terms of assessment - the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia).","[Dadykin, V.

The historical aspects of the development of polytechnic education in Europe, as a set of professional engineering skills with entrepreneurial and managerial knowledge, have proved itself well over the past 150 years. We present the results of researches of changes in polytechnic education, which was developed on example of Admiral Makarov State University of Maritime and Inland Shipping, where studies are based on the formation of skills in the field of design, technological and research activities for water transport facilities and infrastructure. Shipping companies and enterprises from the water transport complex have been increasing the volumes of cargo transportation for the last 15-20 years, while infrastructure facilities and hydraulic structures do not always manage to increase the capacity for transshipment of weight. Constraining factor for intensive development is the conservatism of education, because in the existing format students do not acquire the necessary skills and new professions. The solution of this problem is the transition to forms of polytechnic education, which is carried out at the Institute of Water Transport. The complexity of constructing a new model of education for the development of polytechnic competences is a shortage of study time, which is supposed to be compensated by using the modern teaching technologies.

The interaction of target and control factors is described by means of regression equations. Equations with the highest percentage of explained regression, as well as repetitive control factors (each target factor had its own equation) became the basis for the construction of the simulation model in AnyLogic. The approach of system dynamics has been chosen from among three approaches of stimulation, allowing to work with incomplete data, to track changes in the model over time, as well as to build cause-and-effect relationships between factors.

Formulating the tasks of development and production in the form of an innovative project allows structuring and identifying emerging uncertainties. Existing project management methods and requirements for quality management systems identify uncertainties as positive and negative risks and risks and capabilities, respectively. In this sense, it is advisable to turn to the theory of entrepreneurship, where the concepts of risk and uncertainty are divided based on the possibility of using mathematical models or their inapplicability for non-computable uncertainty. A brief review of the methods and models for risk assessment is given. It is shown that risk assessments based on expert opinions, statistical and probabilistic methods, game theory methods, random and fuzzy sets are applicable to economic activities, but can't correctly represent innovative activities related to risks and opportunities. The problems of uncovering the uncertainties described in the works of Knight are given. Approaches to the disclosure of non-computable uncertainties based on the ontological approach and the use of methods of the theory of solving inventive problems for the stages of the innovation project are proposed. The ontological approach includes the description of problem areas and knowledge bases based on basic research and involves forecasting risks and opportunities through targeted search.

This article analyzes the factors that influence the expediency of equipment overhaul or modernization. The economic effect of repair or modernization is the equipment market value increase and enterprise value change. The equipment market value increase as a result of overhaul and modernization is not the only determining condition of implementation economic feasibility. Firstly, to make an optimal choice between overhaul and modernization of old equipment and the purchase of a new one, it is necessary to compare the economic effect of possible repairs with the amount of costs that will be required in the event of this repair. Secondly, you should consider the possibility of acquiring such equipment, either new or used, but in good condition. The author of the article proposes to compare the cost of replacing objects with the amount of overhaul and modernization cost and to analyze incremental indicators. In general, the economic effect that can be achieved after equipment overhaul and modernization is compared with its cost and considered as an element of business change value. This method can help to analyze whether capital repairs and modernization are beneficial, taking into account the enterprise economic and financial opportunities.","[Shcherbakova, N.

There are main problems of the use of concessions in heat supply, expressed in the transformation of public utilities with a socially significant direction into commercial services with the resulting negative consequences for the consumer. The conclusion is drawn that it is necessary to form an equitable tariff-setting system and to shift business priorities from maximizing the profit from the concession agreement to improving the quality of utility services. For this purpose it is recommended to establish specific quality targets in the interest of the population and to strengthen the permanent state and municipal control over their implementation.

However, over the past 20 years, the market has been driven by the huge social, economic and demographic changes that have influenced our eating habits. This has contributed to making the chilled food production and retail in the UK one of the world's fastest-growing food sectors with food retail stores, restaurants and cafeterias. One very important fixture in these commercial establishments is the display cabinet where food is chilled and displayed. Many guidelines & regulations exist regarding displaying of food in cabinets. Amongst these are ones that relate to food deterioration such as the Food Hygiene Regulations 1995 (updated in January 2006), which related specifically to the retail sale and distribution of chilled foods. The most important point of these regulations was a requirement for sensitive foodstuffs to be maintaining at 8 degrees C or below (Part II). These regulations were focused on reducing the risk of bacterial spoilage associated with chilled foods. The Regulations did not engage in the deterioration problems associated with moisture transfer and evaporating loss of unwrapped chilled foods displayed in delicatessen cabinets. This paper present result from theoretical and experimental investigation into the display shelf life in terms of bacterial spoilage and weight loss for some unwrapped sandwiches components including vegetables, tuna, cheese and beef. The output of this work showed that the display shelf life in terms of weight loss is shorter compared to the shelf life in terms of bacterial spoilage and it's related to food drying rate. Surface drying, increases the weight loss and leads to colour changes that are undesirable and results in shorter display shelf life. Weight loss was affected by air relative humidity, velocity and temperature. Therefore, more consideration should be given to environmental boundary conditions, which have direct impact on the quality and shelf life of unwrapped product. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Recently, a recursive estimation technique suitable for this class of stochastic processes has been introduced and discussed. It represents a computationally attractive alternative to the already established non-recursive estimation strategies since it is effective in terms of memory storage, computational complexity and its ability to estimate and control the EWMA modelling scheme in real time. The aim of the paper is to investigate prediction accuracy of different EWMA model estimators. By analysing a set of eighteen very diverse world stock indices, this study has shown that the recursive estimation scheme can be recommended due to its advantageous properties if predicting the volatility; it is competitive to other approaches commonly used in financial practice.","[Hendrych, Radek; Cipra, Tomas] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Dept Probabil & Math Stat, Sokolovska 83, Prague 18675 8, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Hendrych, R (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Dept Probabil & Math Stat, Sokolovska 83, Prague 18675 8, Czech Republic.",hendrych@karlin.mff.cuni.cz; cipra@karlin.mff.cuni.cz,"Hendrych, Radek/HJH-3526-2023; Cipra, Tomáš/N-8668-2019; Hendrych, Radek/O-8266-2017","Hendrych, Radek/0000-0003-3222-3148; Cipra, Tomáš/0000-0003-0604-324X; Hendrych, Radek/0000-0003-3222-3148",Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [P403/17/676S],Grant Agency of the Czech Republic(Grant Agency of the Czech RepublicNorwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD),This research was supported by the grant P403/17/676S provided by the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic.,,10,0,0,0,1,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-678-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,219,224,,,,,,6,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ7ED,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427151400038,0

The tool is demonstrated on a sample of three foods (milk, chicken and fish) in India, which historically has suffered significant interruptions. The effect of interruptions is quantified in terms of tonnage and monetary value of potential losses, in a number of simple scenarios. These losses are estimated for rural and urban areas of each Indian state. Our model indicates that extensions to the duration of power supply interruptions increases potential losses in domestic refrigerators, and that these losses are considerable when compared to losses expected in previous stages of the food supply chain. The current model's estimation of weight of food lost may be converted to a nutritional value, which opens an opportunity for new multidisciplinary areas of research. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Attention is focused on Markov games evolving on communicating Markov chains with two-players with opposite aims. Considering risk-sensitive optimality criteria means that total reward generated by the game is evaluated by exponential utility function with a given risk-sensitive coefficient. In particular, the first player (resp. the second player) tries to maximize (resp. minimize) the long-run risk-sensitive average reward. Observe that if the second player is dummy, the problem is reduced to finding optimal policy of the Markov decision chain with the risk-sensitive optimality. Recall that for the risk sensitivity coefficient equal to zero we arrive at traditional optimality criteria. In this article, connections between risk-sensitive and risk-neutral Markov decision chains and Markov games models are studied using discrepancy functions. Explicit formulae for bounds on the risk-sensitive average long-run reward are reported. Policy iteration algorithm for finding suboptimal policies of both players is suggested. The obtained results are illustrated on numerical example.","[Sladky, Karel] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Vodarenskou Vezi 4, Prague 18208 8, Czech Republic; [Martinez Cortes, Victor Manuel] Autonomous Metropolitan Univ, Dept Math, Iztapalapa Campus, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Theory & Automation of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana - Mexico,"Sladky, K (通讯作者)，Czech Acad Sci, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Vodarenskou Vezi 4, Prague 18208 8, Czech Republic.",sladky@utia.cas.cz; mat.victor.m.mtz.c@gmail.com,,,Czech Science Foundation [15-10331S]; AS CR (Czech Republic) [171396]; CONACyT (Mexico),Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); AS CR (Czech Republic)(Czech Academy of SciencesCzech Republic Government); CONACyT (Mexico)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)),This research was supported by the Czech Science Foundation under Grant 15-10331S and by CONACyT (Mexico) and AS CR (Czech Republic) under Project 171396.,,13,1,1,0,1,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-678-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,684,689,,,,,,6,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ7ED,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427151400117,0

It has been further enhanced since the international energy agency (IEA) puts effort to standardize such kind of technology. In this paper, a novel study has been carried out experimentally to control an indirect solar assisted heat pump (IDX-SAHP) system integrated with a latent heat storage (PCM) tank. The PCM heat exchanger tank was designed specially and controlled automatically which allowed storing excess energy during the day and releasing it when needed. In addition, a system control strategy has been purposely designed and implemented in a Building Management System (BMS) to ensure the stable and reliable system operations. The experimental results show that the PCM heat exchanger tank installation has a significant effect on the system operation stability and can improve the COP of the IDX-SAHP system at different weather conditions and a specified hot water load profile.

The application of this set of indicators allows the resource intensive monitoring of graduate mobility. The research revealed that, at different stages of professional realization, the importance and relevance of competitive advantages of employment types vary. Thus, entering the market, the field-specific type of employment is realized in the conditions of high entry barriers and limits the possibility of getting larger values which characterize the employment advantages. During this period, the non-specific and search types of employment dominate. Then, the situation changes, and the non-specific employment limiters become significant, which makes much more difficult for the graduates, who have chosen the nonspecific jobs, to satisfy their value preferences.","[Borisova, A.] Novosibirsk State Tech Univ, Dept Management, Novosibirsk, Russia",Novosibirsk State Technical University,"Borisova, A (通讯作者)，Novosibirsk State Tech Univ, Dept Management, Novosibirsk, Russia.",a.borisova@corp.nstu.ru,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-656-3,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,47.0,,,,,,6,11,,,,,,6,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Operations Research & Management Science,BR9NX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000679066800002,0

It was found that in 2016 the food security of the region under study was at an acceptable level. The deviation of the food safety index of the region from the optimal value was due to insufficient volumes of production of such important food products as milk and meat, a significant degree of differentiation of the population's incomes and a high proportion of food expenditures in the structure of household consumption expenditures.","[Buyanova, M.

In fact, new industrial cities and their impact on economic development of regions remain beyond many scholars' interest and consideration. In order to fill the information gap, the authors, with reference to the official statistic data available, explore the significance of new industrial cities in regional economy in two directions: socio-economic and technological development of a Russian Federation subject. The study suggests that the economic development of Russia in 2010-2015 was driven by regions with new industrial cities and their contribution into the process. Twenty new industrial cities with 18 out of the total top Russian technology companies can be considered the nuclei of the concentrated accumulation of the national technological potential and technological advancement.

It is illustrated that the development of available technologies leads to the reduction of manufacturing costs, what, consequently, results in the increase of the quantity of manufactured goods and price reduction. However, revenue dynamics and profit margins are less clear, and the decrease after reaching the peak replaces the initial growth. It is proved that innovation performance depends on the slopes of supply and demand curves. Generally, innovation performance goes down along with the decrease of price elasticity of demand, and with the limit on the resources used in production. The proportionality ratio K is derived, and its high values lead to reduced efficiency of incremental innovations implementation.","[Simonov, A. B.; Tarasova, I. A.; Simonova, I.

Supercritical CO2 power generation systems have been investigated by scientists and engineers mostly for large scale applications. However, when the electrical target output power is lower (50-100 kW), there are additional challenges on the turbomachinery design that need to be addressed. In the current research work, with reference to simple regenerative cycle architecture, the design of small scale sCO(2) radial compressor and turbine are firstly addressed through the similarity approach. Further to this study, numerical CFD simulations are performed to optimize the 3D design of the impellers and of the stators.

One of the commonly used and popular subclasses of path-dependent options is formed by so-called lookback options with payoff depending on the minimum or maximum price of the underlying asset attained during the lifetime of the option and enabling the investors to sell at the highest or buy at the lowest price, i.e., the most favourable one. Commonly, the maximum or minimum are monitored at discrete dates so that there is no analytical pricing formulae and one has to rely on numerical techniques. In this paper we present a PDE approach to European lookback options leading to the usual Black-Scholes equation, where the path-dependent variable appears as a parameter only and discrete sampling is balanced by introducing the jump conditions across the sampling dates. Since the pricing equation is the same as for the plain vanilla option, the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method is applied to the problem in the same manner, except for the treatment of jump conditions at each monitoring date.

The experimental work was carried out using two identical commercial open display cabinets; one cabinet equipped with conventional/commercial shelves while the other one equipped with the new actively-cooled flat heat pipe shelves. Both cabinets were placed inside an ISO-certified environmentally controlled test chamber and experiments were carried out under stable environmental conditions. Food block simulators and real food products were used for the tests. The temperature distribution inside the real food products and the power consumption of the cabinets were measured for the cabinets' set point of 2.0 degrees C. The experimental outcomes were that the use of the heat pipe shelves can homogenize the temperature profile of the products and improve the heat transfer between the cabinet, the shelves and the products. Moreover, the heat pipe shelves facilitated the reduction of the electrical energy consumption of the cabinet by 12% approximately. Finally, a primary of the acidity levels (pH) of the products was conducted. The experiments showed that almost all products placed on the heat pipe shelves, after 20 days of experiments, had almost the same pH values, even 20 days beyond their expiration date.

In fact, CO2 is an inexpensive, non-toxic, non-flammable, thermally stable and eco-friendly compound. Moreover, CO2 in its supercritical state shows an extreme increase in density that allows turbomachinery downsizing and a high cycle efficiency due to the reduced work required by the compression stage. In addition, supercritical CO2 permits a better temperature glide matching within the heat source which increases the overall efficiency of waste heat utilization. With the aim of identifying pro and cons of different sCO(2) cycle layouts, this paper investigated four design Joule-Brayton configurations at increasing complexity: simple regenerative, with recompression, with reheating and with recompression and reheating. The research methodology is based on 1st and 2nd laws thermodynamic analyses and includes correlations to estimate the investment costs of the equipment.

The choice of the optimal method for estimation of the risks of small busi-nesses financing is characterized by the complexity and high degree of various factors and conditions interdependence, and also by the need of taking into ac-count all possible parameters of the economic system. While carrying out information training, there is a need to identify first all the constraints that are imposed on the use of resources necessary to achieve the stra-tegic objectives of financing, as well as to determine the most beneficial alterna-tive to which these resources need to be invested. The list of risks inherent in entrepreneurship is extremely wide. The choice of a method for assessing the risk of financing is objectively one of the most im-portant stages of investment planning, and its purpose is to identify the extent of the possible consequences of the risk. Therefore, when considering each particular type of risk, as a criterion for ac-cepting or not accepting an investment project, it becomes necessary to apply multi-criteria analysis methods in order to choose the best alternative. The authors suggest the algorithm for estimation of the risks of small busi-nesses financing. In the course of the research conducted in the article, it is convincingly proved that the suggested algorithm provides an objective estimation of the options for small businesses financing, encompassing a list of possible heterogeneous risks that may arise during the implementation of the investment project, while reveal-ing the most effective project for implementation in the first place. The received preference vector for the group of risk factors determines the top-priority objects for investments in the small business sector.","[Astarkina, N. R.; Kurbatova, E. S.; Puzanova, E.

However, the essence and structure are still the subject of scientific research. This article determines that along with the existence of subjective, ideal and real values, the subjective values are the most interesting from the point of view of economic evaluation and distribution within the framework of the total economic value concept. The presented genesis of the term of-value, analysis of the total economic value concept development and the theory of ecosystem services contributed to the creation of an author's approach to the distribution of values. We justify the inclusion in indirect value the cultural services as opposed to the direct value; option value takes into account the value in use by future individuals; we remobilize the quasi-option value in the structure of total economic value. The paper provides an improved total economic value model. This model takes into account the time aspect, the understanding of the term-value and theoretical principles of ecosystem services and author's principle of value evaluation-based on the best possible alternative. The practical implications of the research is to improve the economic mechanism of government regulation of natural resource management by clarifying and improving the consistent basis for the economic evaluation of the value of natural resources for making managerial decisions on their involvement in economic turnover.","[Dushin, A., V; Yurak, V.

Mutual understanding is a desirable outcome of any interaction, because communication is designed to provide it. The research based on English belles-lettres works was aimed at revealing linguistic means employed in the English language to express compromise in monocultural and intercultural communication. There can mainly be singled out three ways of language manifestation of compromise in English: verbal, non-verbal and combined ones. The participants of communication situations under analysis are representatives of Western and Eastern cultures, in the broad sense of these notions. The analysis helped to reveal the preferred way or ways of expressing a compromise decision regarding the cultural identity of a speaker through English as a lingua franca.

The potential factors influencing the variability of money market interest rates are considered within a near zero level of main policy rate variability. At the same time, model optimal main policy rate shows significant volatility due to changes in the structural characteristics of economy facing deep economic and financial shocks, changing perception of inflation risks, central bank's weakened credibility and uncertainty about the efficient transmission of monetary measures. Money market interest rates are modeled with a VAR model with exogenous variables. The model parameters are estimated with the use of publicly available quarterly data for the Czech Republic for a period from 2000q1 to 2016q4 in two stages. First the parameters of the corresponding model are identified using the Bayesian technique. Then the matrix used to convert the structural system into its reduced form is quantified through the sign restriction approach. These two parameter groups are then used to decompose money market interest rate series into a series of cumulative structural shocks of each endogenous component in the model.","[Bruna, Karel; Quang Van Tran] Univ Econ, Dept Monetary Theory & Policy, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Bruna, K (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Dept Monetary Theory & Policy, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague, Czech Republic.",bruna@vse.cz; tran@vse.cz,"Bruna, Karel/AAD-9178-2020; Tran, Quang Van/GRJ-1138-2022","Bruna, Karel/0000-0003-3690-1364;","University of Economics, Prague [IP 100040]","University of Economics, Prague","This paper is supported by grant No. IP 100040 of the University of Economics, Prague.",,14,0,0,0,1,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-678-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,90,95,,,,,,6,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ7ED,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427151400016,0

Let us suppose that a young married couple is in a position of client. Young people know that an expected and also unexpected unpleasant financial situation can happen. Many unpleasant financial situation can be caused by a random factor. Consequently stochastic methods are suitable to secure against them. The aim of the suggested model is not only to state a maximal reasonable value of loans, but also to endure unpleasant financial period. To this end we employ stochastic optimization theory. A few suitable models will be introduced. The choice of the model depends on environment of the young people. Models will be with deterministic constraints, probability constraints, but also with stochastic dominance constraints. The suggested models will be analyzed both from the numerical point of view and from possible method solution based on data.

Measures able to lower the debt and increase the economic growth simultaneously seems to be difficult to find. Following the most intuitional case of the consolidation when fiscal authority increases taxation or cuts public spending could not lead to better perform. If the debt declines slower than the GDP, the debt quota will rise anyway. From very simple example one can see an interaction of the public debt and the economic performance especially during economic downturns. Then, it is important to look for measures that can enhance the growth and are, at least, the debt neutral. Therefore, the aim of the contribution is to examine whether the level neutral change in structure of the public debt could have desirable effect on the economic growth of advanced economies. There are some theoretical linkages which suggest that the debt structure can influence the growth rates. Arnold's et al. [ 2] methodology enables to estimate effect of internal debt structure change which has no direct effect on the level of public debt. The dataset covers period from 2000 to 2015 of all OECD countries of which data are available for the econometric analysis (up to 24). Hence the panel data regression is employed to estimate results and 3 debt decompositions of the public debt are made. Namely, i) by the original maturity of debt instruments, ii) by the currency which is used to issue debt, iii) by the residency of creditors. The results suggest that the most important shift seems to be from domestic to foreign creditors which is associated with higher economic growth rates. Similar but not as strong effects is the shift from domestic to foreign currency and finally the shift from long term debt to short term debt instruments.","[Murin, Martin] Masaryk Univ, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 41-A, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Murín, M (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 41-A, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",martin.murin@mail.muni.cz,"Murin, Martin/S-8419-2019","Murin, Martin/0000-0003-0070-4270",Faculty of Economics and Administration [MUNI/A/1076/2016],Faculty of Economics and Administration,This work was supported by funding of specific research at Faculty of Economics and Administration - project MUNI/A/1076/2016.

The research results have shown that those who intend to migrate tend to be less satisfied with their life in the city, and some domains of life in the city, such as: government, economic situation and social conditions, opportunity of education in the city. Those who intend to migrate are less satisfied with their profession and opportunity of self-realization in it, and also their income level. The findings suggest that those who have no migration intentions tend to be much more satisfied with the area where they live than those who intend to move.","[Bakina, A., V; Yaremtchuk, S., V; Orlova, O.

Knowledge of the income distribution and its comparison using different socio-economic, demographic and spatiotemporal perspectives is a prerequisite for the quantitative evaluation of living standard, level of social welfare and equality in redistribution of the goods created in society. The presented paper focuses on an analysis and comparison of the income distribution shape in the households of all 14 Czech regions. According to the fact that regions of the Czech Republic mutually differ not only in the extent of job opportunities, but also in demographic structure of inhabitants (age, education, etc.), we can expect also differences in the shape of regional income distributions. The aim of the paper is to construct suitable models of income distribution and identify regional regional differences. For this purpose, both parametric and nonparametric models of frequency distributions will be used. Nonparametric approaches are represented by Gaussian kernel estimates. Among parametric methods we can employ some of simple probability distribution models - most frequently two- and three parametric lognormal models - or chose more demanding but also more accurate methods, i.e. estimate a model of income distribution based on finite mixtures of densities. This method is usually used for the modeling of distributions of random variables in heterogeneous populations and therefore in our case it comprises a better alternative.","[Bartosova, Jitka; Bina, Vladislav] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Management, Dept Exact Methods, Jarosovska 1117-2, Jindrichuv Hradec, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Bartosová, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Fac Management, Dept Exact Methods, Jarosovska 1117-2, Jindrichuv Hradec, Czech Republic.",bartosov@fm.vse.cz; bina@fm.vse.cz,"Bína, Vladislav/JAO-0614-2023; Bína, Vladislav/M-2056-2018","Bína, Vladislav/0000-0002-9480-9489","Institutional support of the long-term development (Faculty of Management in Jindrichuv Hradec, University of Economics, Prague) [IP 600040]","Institutional support of the long-term development (Faculty of Management in Jindrichuv Hradec, University of Economics, Prague)","Supported by Institutional support of the long-term development (Faculty of Management in Jindrichuv Hradec, University of Economics, Prague) under grant number IP 600040.",,14,0,0,1,1,OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE,PRAGUE 3,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",2453-9902,,978-80-245-2277-7,APPLI MATH STAT ECON,Applications of Mathematics and Statistics in Economics Conference Proceedings,,2018,,,,,,,7,17,,,,,,11,"Economics; Mathematics, Applied; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BO8KL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000527695100001,0

The set of coefficients encompasses liquidity ratios, working capital ratios and ratios of short-term liabilities. The method of the systematic and statistical analysis has shown that the regarded company has quite high coefficients characterizing its liquidity. However, the situation connected with accounts payable and financing fixed assets discloses the problem of the company's management that does not make rational decisions in terms of the formation sources. It is specified that the organization should improve the process of selecting sources of financing assets with varying degrees of liquidity. The enterprise sticks to the policy that means in accordance with which this legal entity is supposed not to take out loans. Albeit, if the company cannot increase its equity, the best solution is to take a long-term loan rather thanuse its accounts payable for these purposes. The conclusion defines that the analyzed organization has some substantial problems related to electricity sales markets. The sales market in Ufa is inundated, the demand is satisfied and will be reduced in the nearest future because of energy saving programs.

A very frequent discussed consequence of the population aging is the financial sustainability of the pension system, especially, if it is based on PAYG principle. One of the possible measure supposed is logically increase of the retirement age. There naturally arises an important question of the appropriate linkage of the retirement age with the level of mortality. Alternative threshold can be based on the concept of so-called prospective age (the age in which the remaining life expectancy is the same as the remaining life expectancy of a person in given age and standard mortality pattern). However this threshold does not reflect well the actual age of the person and it would cause that the period of expected economic activity would rise while the period of pension receipt would remain constant. A possible compromise of these both definitions may be the concept of so-called relative prospective pension age based on the relative remaining life expectancy (the ratio of remaining life expectancy and the total expected life span - the sum of age reached and remaining life expectancy at this age). The pension age can be thereafter defined e.g. as the relative prospective age corresponding to the age of 65 years and mortality pattern of European Union in 2016. The paper presents the computation of proposed pension age in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Spain until 2080 based on the relative prospective age concept and corresponding old age dependency ratios. The baseline scenario of the population projection of Eurostat 2015 has been used for mortality projection.","[Fiala, Tomas; Langhamrova, Jitka] Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Demog, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",,"Fiala, T (通讯作者)，Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Demog, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",fiala@vse.cz; langhamj@vse.cz,"Langhamrová, Jitka/Z-2115-2019",,GA CR [1513283S]; Grant Agency of the Czech Republic,GA CR(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Grant Agency of the Czech Republic(Grant Agency of the Czech RepublicNorwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD),"The support of the grant scheme PROJECTION OF THE CZECH REPUBLIC POPULATION ACCORDING TO EDUCATIONAL LEVEL AND MARITAL STATUS, No. GA CR 1513283S by the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic is gladly acknowledged.",,11,0,0,0,1,OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE,PRAGUE 3,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",2453-9902,,978-80-245-2277-7,APPLI MATH STAT ECON,Applications of Mathematics and Statistics in Economics Conference Proceedings,,2018,,,,,,,76,84,,,,,,9,"Economics; Mathematics, Applied; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BO8KL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000527695100007,0

The approach proposed in the article involves considering the influence of disturbances on the part of the external environment, assessment of dependence of the applied technologies and technological stability. The obtained results can be used in the selection of technologies to ensure economic security production systems.","[Minkin, D. Yu] NRC Kurchatov Inst, Moscow, Russia; [Vlasova, T.

Using model constructs built on the base of dynamic and panel data, the authors received the estimates of effect of social investments on parameters of population welfare in the Far East in 2000-2017. As part of traditional approach to quantity analysis of regression dependence both aggregate (macro-region) and local (disaggregated by territories) indicators are considered. The article shows that the relation between expenses on healthcare and indicators of population welfare becomes statistically significant only when taking into account spatial distribution, which means that the effects concentrate in certain territories. The article establishes that in case of counting the expenses by territories, the effect of social investments on the changes in population welfare is much lower than when measuring it using aggregate social investments in the whole region. It is shown that aggregated measurements of effects from social investments produce inflated expectations. Increasing state expenses on population welfare in the region makes sense only when taking into account spatial and industrial distribution of budgetary resources.","[Naiden, S.

Taking into account the proposed algorithm, the authors' classification of resource regions as well as regions prepared for smart specialization is presented, based on a consistent and complete division of regions into the groups proposed in the work. It was shown that the resource regions, depending on the degree of readiness for smart specialization, have a different level of PPP development. It is determined in the dynamics that the resource regions with higher readiness for smart specialization have a higher level of PPP development. While in resource regions unprepared for integrated development, as well as in enclave regions (regions with economic and infrastructure isolation from macro-regional and all-Russian ties), it is necessary to develop PPP mechanisms with the subsequent increase of the economic, infrastructural, innovative, personnel and qualification levels. This will allow for the organization of integrated exploitation with the involvement of the necessary volume of private investments for sustainable development in the long term.","[Provornaya, I., V; Eder, L., V; Nemov, V.

Instead, only a lower and upper bound (interval for the dependent variable) is observable. In this case, the vector of regression parameters may be only partially identified, or unidentified at all. We make as weak assumptions as possible on the process generating the observable intervals to make the regression parameters partially identified. First we consider the finite-sample identification region for the OLS-estimator. Then we construct the identification region for the vector of regression parameters as a limit of the finite-sample regions. We derive explicit bounds for the limit set. Although we construct the bounds only in case of two regressors, the idea can be pushed further to regression models with a general number of regressors. The derived bounds depend only on observable quantities (such as the variance of a regressor or covariance between the regressor and the widths of the intervals of the dependent varible) and can be estimated from finite samples. We also suggest some possible ways of further research to (i) refine the bounds suggested in this paper, (ii) tighten the bounds using additional assumptions with identifying power.","[Cerny, Michal; Rada, Miroslav; Sokol, Ondrej; Holy, Vladimir] Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Econometr, Winston Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Cerny, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Econometr, Winston Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067, Czech Republic.",cernym@vse.cz; miroslav.rada@vse.cz; ondrej.sokol@vse.cz; vladimir.holy@vse.cz,"Holý, Vladimír/I-5814-2018",,"Czech Science Foundation [16-00408S]; Internal Grant Agency (I.G.A.) of University of Economics, Prague, Czech Republic [F4/63/2016]","Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Internal Grant Agency (I.G.A.) of University of Economics, Prague, Czech Republic","The work of M.

An innovative project is not an economic system (structure), because it does not have its own domestic resource. Each project is unique, has a limited duration and one-off nature. This is its distinctive feature from the standpoint of the research. In this regard, the competitiveness of an innovative project has a specific nature and meaning, which differs from traditional views on the competitiveness of an economic system. According to the authors, competitiveness of an innovative project is the quality of its content that makes the project to be capable to have all possible effects and effectiveness to all interested parties at each stage of its life cycle.

It should be noted that the sphere of higher education is multifaceted: it not only affects the direction of state policy, educational standards, but also determines the status of the actors operating in this field. The fundamental difference between the Russian legislative framework of education and the legislative sources of the educational law of Western countries is that the subject of legal regulation in Russian educational legislation is not so much the actual educational relations as the relations in the management of education and its economy. This led to an understanding of the branch of educational legislation as being of a complex nature. Russia has embarked on integration into a single European space, reinforcing its intentions with concrete steps, namely, the reform of the Soviet school and the transition to the European educational system.

Costs in phase of implementation of the project vary depending on the internal and external factors, which cannot be clearly predicted in advance. In the practice of project management, actual costs (AC) are usually not sufficiently known and so they are very often only estimated during the project duration. For the Earned Value Management (EVM), while tracking project progress, knowledge of the AC is crucial. Any distortion or incorrect estimate of the AC leads to distortion of all EVM characteristics. CPI (Cost Performance Index) and CV% (Cost Variance) within EVM describe the status and progress of the project and demonstrate its success, are based on correct value of AC, and thus AC bias leads to bias and distortion of any prediction of future cost development (ETC, EAC, etc.). Our proposal published in this paper is based on the use of optimistic, neutral and pessimistic scenarios for the development of current costs during project implementation. Proposals of scenarios are based on mathematical model designed by authors and complementing already existing models for the planned value (PV) estimation within EVM (published by authors in previous papers). This article aims to provide a comprehensive proposal how to modify the EVM based on mathematical models for AC and PV estimations.","[Bartoska, Jan; Subrt, Tomas; Kucera, Petr] Dept Syst Engn FEM CULS, Kamycka 129, Prague, Czech Republic",,"Bartoska, J (通讯作者)，Dept Syst Engn FEM CULS, Kamycka 129, Prague, Czech Republic.",bartoska@pef.czu.cz; subrt@pef.czu.cz; kucera@pef.czu.cz,"Kučera, Petr/F-8318-2017; Bartoška, Jan/C-8992-2017; Subrt, Tomas/H-8542-2018","Bartoška, Jan/0000-0003-0935-5978; Subrt, Tomas/0000-0002-4437-1431",,,,,15,0,0,0,1,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-678-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,24,29,,,,,,6,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ7ED,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427151400005,0

This paper aims at comparing various regression methods on various data sets. First, the prediction performance of common robust regression estimators are compared on a set of 24 real data sets from public repositories. Further, the results are used as input for a metalearning study over 9 selected features of individual data sets. On the whole, the least trimmed squares turns out to be superior to the least squares or M-estimators in the majority of the data sets, while the process of metalearning does not succeed in a very reliable prediction of the most suitable estimator for a given data set.","[Kalina, Jan; Pestova, Barbora] Inst Comp Sci CAS, Pod Vodarenskou Vezi 2, Prague 18207 8, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Computer Science of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Kalina, J (通讯作者)，Inst Comp Sci CAS, Pod Vodarenskou Vezi 2, Prague 18207 8, Czech Republic.",kalina@cs.cas.cz; pestova@cs.cas.cz,"Pestova, Barbora/H-8831-2017; Kalina, Jan/E-4287-2012","Kalina, Jan/0000-0002-8491-0364",Czech Science Foundation [17-01251S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),The project was supported by the project 17-01251S of the Czech Science Foundation.,,13,3,3,0,1,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-678-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,307,312,,,,,,6,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ7ED,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427151400053,0

For analysis, the assessment methodology of the corporate governance quality proposed by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) is used. Such papers as companies' charters, shareholders' meeting conclusions, annual reports, and the reports of the media on corporate events have served as the initial information base about the compliance with recommendations for corporate management. The quality of implementing corporate governance standards was comparatively assessed in eight Russian companies. The first (primary) level for the OECD Principles implementation is characterized by the implementation of 15 standards. Almost every company has already complied with these standards. The implementation of 24 standards was also verified that characterize the achievement of the company's second (advanced) corporate level. It turned out that only one company out of eight investigated fully implemented all standards of the first and second levels. Voluntary compliance with corporate governance standards makes the corporation more sustainable and investor-attractive that ultimately contributes to its development. Russian companies under study are still in the beginning of the international standards implementation in corporate governance practices. Only the primary level of standards implementation has been achieved that means that only mandatory requirements of applicable law are complied with. A lot of more advanced standards have already been used by companies.

Scientific approaches should be used to use the opportunities in the analysis and assessment of the development of entrepreneurial structures (residents of the territories of advanced development and the free port of Vladivostok). The integrative approach, which combines approaches from the standpoint of modern understand-ing of entrepreneurship, entrepreneurial orientation of firms, formation of the entrepreneurial ecosystem, is one of the promising approaches. It is proposed to consider entrepreneurship in a market economy as an innovative activity of economic entities accompanied by a risk, consisting in the creation of new capital in the course of the implementation of the opportunities of the corre-sponding transformation not only of resources, but also of factors, conditions, forms, methods, means and results of economic activity, and in obtaining on this basis of various forms of busi-ness income. The degree of implementation of business projects by resident companies in territo-ries with a special institutional regime should be determined by the indicators of growth of the corresponding forms of capital. The entrepreneurial orientation of resident firms should be stud-ied and evaluated by characteristics such as innovation, proactivity, risk-taking, autonomy and competitive aggressiveness. The concept of entrepreneurial ecosystem as a set of interdependent scientists and factors coordinated in such a way that they contribute to productive entrepreneur-ship is introduced into scientific use.

The genaralized form of harmonic mean can be used also in choosing the optimal value of smoothing parameter in kernel density function, where two kernel method parameters should be fixed: the kernel function and the smoothing parameter. The shape of kernel function and the value of smoothing parameter influence the final form of the density estimator. In paper the generalized form of harmonic mean applied in smoothing parameter choice is analysed. Additionally the new method of choosing the optimal value of smoothing parameter is proposed and the properties of the kernel density estimation are regarded with respect to the values of smoothing parameter basing on the generalized form of harmonic means with differeent values of harmonic mean parameter.","[Baszczynska, Aleksandra] Univ Lodz, Dept Stat Methods, 41-43 Rewolucji 1905 St, PL-90214 Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Baszczynska, A (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Dept Stat Methods, 41-43 Rewolucji 1905 St, PL-90214 Lodz, Poland.",albasz@uni.lodz.pl,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,1,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-678-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,36,41,,,,,,6,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ7ED,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427151400007,0

This model incorporates a standard set of rigidities such as investment adjustment cost, habit formation, external risk premium, and incomplete exchange rate pass-through. The model allows for two approaches to the labour market - the real wage rigidity specified in spirit of the search and matching models, and the nominal wage rigidity a la Calvo wage setting. The model is estimated on a set of fourteen observable variables, including the unemployment rate. Our research is in the early stage, however, preliminary results suggest that the real wage rigidity is more appropriate modelling approach.

Since this type of data can be considered as a realisation of stochastic process with unknown properties, it can be analysed with the tools of fractal geometry. In the particular case of stock market indices, one can investigate any individual index using state space reconstruction according to Whitney theorem. The second possibility of the analysis is the study of development of a group of different indices describing the state of the market at a specific time. Subsequently, long-time stock market history is useful for the investigation of the states as vectors in Euclidean space. Their fractal nature can be studied using correlation dimension. The paper presents several approaches to its estimation and compares the results in terms of the individual stock market behaviour. As a referential technique, the classical approach using correlation sum is presented and its performance is discussed in the context of obtained results. Furthermore, the analysis is useful for the dependency analysis and measure of predictability of time series.","[Dlask, Martin; Kukal, Jaromir] Czech Tech Univ, Fac Nucl Sci & Phys Engn, Trojanova 12, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech Technical University Prague,"Dlask, M (通讯作者)，Czech Tech Univ, Fac Nucl Sci & Phys Engn, Trojanova 12, Prague, Czech Republic.",mar-tin.dlask@fjfi.cvut.cz; jaromir.kukal@fjfi.cvut.cz,,,Czech Technical University [SGS17/196/OHK4/3T/14],Czech Technical University,Supported by the grant No. SGS17/196/OHK4/3T/14 of the Czech Technical University.,,21,2,2,0,4,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-678-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,119,124,,,,,,6,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ7ED,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427151400021,0

It then uses the example of a dish of roast beef and Yorkshire pudding to explore energy use in food production and consumption. Part 1 of this paper conducts a meta-analysis of 33 roast beef and Yorkshire pudding recipes in order to create a representative recipe for analysis. Part 2 of this paper then uses life cycle assessment and energy use data is coupled with the representative recipe of roast beef and Yorkshire pudding, to calculate the embodied energy of the meal. Seven interventions are modelled to illustrate how sustainable cookery can play a role as part of a sustainable food system. Interventions show that sustainable cookery has the potential to reduce cookery related energy use by 18%, and integrating sustainable cookery within a sustainable food system has the potential to reduce the total energy use by 55%. Finally, the paper discusses the issue of how the adoption of the sustainable cookery agenda may help or hinder attempts to shift consumers towards sustainable diets. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Linguistic approximation techniques are based on approximation and hence the nature of the approximated output of mathematical model can be altered a bit by the application of these methods. LA can be considered beneficial in linguistic fuzzy modelling, as long as the interpretability and understand-ability of the provided linguistic outputs outweighs the possible loss/distortion of information. In many cases the distortion of information might be small and as such completely acceptable. Recently, however, Stoklasa and Talasek (2015) pointed out that when specific thresholds are of importance in the decision-making situation (e.g. the border between gains and losses), LA can distort the outcome of the decision-making situation by providing a loss label for a gain and vice-versa. In this paper, we investigate the phenomenon under different linguistic scales used for the approximation and provide a thorough discussion of this phenomenon in the context of linguistic approximation.","[Stoklasa, Jan; Talasek, Tomas] Palacky Univ Olomouc, Dept Appl Econ, Krizkovskeho 12, Olomouc, Czech Republic; [Stoklasa, Jan] Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Sch Business & Management, Skinnarilankatu 34, Lappeenranta, Finland",Palacky University Olomouc; Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT,"Stoklasa, J (通讯作者)，Palacky Univ Olomouc, Dept Appl Econ, Krizkovskeho 12, Olomouc, Czech Republic.;Stoklasa, J (通讯作者)，Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Sch Business & Management, Skinnarilankatu 34, Lappeenranta, Finland.",jan.stoklasa@upol.cz; tomas.talasek@upol.cz,"Stoklasa, Jan/O-5858-2016; Talášek, Tomáš/E-3464-2017","Talášek, Tomáš/0000-0001-8632-4599",Internal Grant Agency of Palacky University Olomouc [IGA FF 2017 011],Internal Grant Agency of Palacky University Olomouc,Supported by the grant No. IGA FF 2017 011 of the Internal Grant Agency of Palacky University Olomouc.,,23,0,0,0,0,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-678-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,726,731,,,,,,6,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ7ED,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427151400124,0

Two bargaining models are established for the sellers and buyers in indefinite period and finite period. For the indefinite period, the complete equilibrium solution of the bargaining game between the buyers and sellers is obtained. Hereby, imposing some constraints on the time, the game equilibrium solution on the second stage is obtained. At the same time, a multiple game model is constructed and the commence point is discussed. The result shows that the game between sellers and buyers depends on the ratio of each one's discount factor. The time and commitment between sellers and buyers increase the sellers' cost, hence the final price can only be implemented within a certain range, which is related with the proposal cost of sellers, the number of games, and the punishment cost in each round.","[Wang, Rui; Li, Deng-Feng] Fuzhou Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Fuzhou 350116, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Wang, Rui] Fujian Jiangxia Univ, Sch Business Management, Fuzhou 350108, Fujian, Peoples R China",Fuzhou University; Fujian Jiangxia University,"Li, DF (通讯作者)，Fuzhou Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Fuzhou 350116, Fujian, Peoples R China.",lidengfeng@fzu.edu.cn,,"li, dengfeng/0000-0002-4963-4181",Key Project of Natural Science Foundation of China [71231003]; young teacher education research project of Fujian province [JAS150641],Key Project of Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); young teacher education research project of Fujian province,"We are grateful to the referees for their helpful and constructive comments, which have significantly improved the presentation of this paper.

First, the interactions between a group of weekly patients and a response agent of emergency department are modeled as a non-cooperative game, after which a threat, vulnerability, and consequence value (i.e., TVC) of each type of patients for emergency event is derived from Nash equilibrium of game. Second, four TVC values of emergency events are utilized for computation of the Shapely value for each type of patient. The deployment of emergency medical resources is carried out based on their expected marginal contribution. Then, the model scheduled daily physicians, nurses, and beds in emergency department.

The process of additive and multiplicative growth of economic reliability indicators is briefly substantiated. The probability and intensity of the system state are singled out among these indicators. These indicators were considered in relation to the exponential distribution law of random variables associated with multiplicative growth. The growth of economic reliability indicators is expressed through the natural logarithm, which allows to determine the amount of information belonging to the system element. The additive growth is due to the event occurrence with some probability, which transferring an element from one state to the opposite, and the multiplicative growth is due to the simplest streaming process of the states of system elements. Considering the total growth, the mathematical expressions for determining the information entropy are obtained. These expressions are based on logarithmic calculations. Quantitative values of entropy are a measure of assessing the state and level of economic reliability of the system.","[Dulesov, A. S.; Eremeeva, O. S.; Karandeev, D. J.; Krasnova, T.

Estimation could be based on parametric or non parametric approaches. Correct identification of probability distributions in parametric approach could lead to accurate inferences about liability. It could lead to greater reliability in estimation and in the best case, to reduce the costs of capital. Skewness-kurtosis graph is a very useful tool for an identification of probability distribution. It is based on intra-relations between moments of the probability distribution. Probability distributions typical for insurance are lognormal, Pareto, gamma distribution and many others. A lot of them could be classified as heavy-tail or long-tail distribution, i.e. extreme values have high probability of being selected in a random sample. Estimates of product moments of skewness and kurtosis are sensitive to the extreme values presence and are limited by a sample size. L-moments are a robust alternative to product moments. This contribution is focused on skewness-kurtosis graph based on L-moments, so-called L-skewness, and L-kurtosis.

Mainstream theory of consumption, though it is aware of this effect, for its focus primarily on the aggregate consumption, it pays virtually no attention to this. However, if it is possible to accurately describe and quantify this so-called relative income effect, it will mean a relevant contribution to the explanation of individual consumption patterns or consumption of income categories. The aim of this work is to find and precisely quantify the impact of relative income on the marginal propensity to consume on the example of Hungarian households and thus to support the idea of interdependent concept of utility and consumption. To achieve this goal, we use a panel regression analysis. The results unambiguously confirm the statistical validity of the initial hypothesis, which shows that the consumption decisions of Hungarian households are interdependent.

Novel aspects of the research are the usage of rotary positive displacement expanders as prime movers of the TFC system as well as the reference to working fluids and their mixtures at the state of the art. In particular, the role of a correct built-in volume ratio of the expander with respect to the pressure ratio of the thermodynamic cycle is emphasized. In fact, a mismatching of these two quantities would lead to an isochoric expansion process which, in turn, might negatively affect the overall power recovery. With reference to a transcritical CO2 stream at 100 degrees C as heat source for the TFC system, parametric and screening studies were carried out using different expander built(-)in volume ratios and working fluids respectively. Among the fluids analyzed, results showed that pure substances such as R1234ze(E) and propane would provide a greater specific work but, on the other hand, would require built-in volume ratios (8 and 14) that are beyond the capabilities of rotary positive displacement expanders (5). The addition of CO2 to the afore mentioned working fluids would ease the mismatching issue but, at the same time, would reduce the specific power output. Regarding the built-in volume ratio analysis, it was found that optimal values change in accordance to the working fluid and refer to an expansion process with a slight isochoric phase.

In this paper, a modelling approach is presented which can quantify the energy requirements of heated glasshouse food production. Based on the outputs from the model, benchmarking and comparison among different glasshouse types and growers is possible. Additionally, the effect of spatial and annual weather trends on the heating and cooling requirements of glasshouses are quantified.

The Levy flights are random non-Gaussian step sizes following alpha stable distribution. However, this random variable is very difficult to be generated in the multivariatal case, the step size generation procedure has never been treated accordingly so far. To examine the effectiveness of the general usage of this possibility, the goal of this paper is to introduce the multivariate alpha stable random variable step size generation technique into several novel optimization algorithms.

The results showed that the penetration dehydration effect of propylene glycol and glycerol is not as obvious as sodium chloride. These three increase Ca2+-ATPase activity at different levels. And they reduce the water activity of dried tilapia fish, and the capability of them: sodium chloride>glycerol>propylene glycol. Glycerol and propylene glycol can increase the rehydration rate while sodium chloride lessens it. Based on the results, the response surface analysis was used to optimize while the water activity and the Ca2+-ATPase activity were taken as the response values. Investigating interaction between several pretreatment reagents, a combined pretreatment method was obtained: Propylene glycol 2% + glycerol 3% + NaCl1%. Therefore, the appropriate pretreatment reagents and their combinations can be selected according to the concerns of the different quality indexes of the samples, and the conclusion can provide a reference for the drying pretreatment of similar products.

The developed software allows for forecasting key parameters of the development of various oil and gas facilities. Approbation of the algorithm was performed on the Eastern Siberia and the Far East. The region is characterized by the presence of significant oil and gas resources and a low degree of their exploration, which creates the conditions for the start of large-scale production. Currently large-scale natural gas production in Eastern Siberia is constrained by the lack of a gas transportation infrastructure, however PAO Gazprom completes the construction of the Siberia Power pipeline in late 2019. Structure and quality of the region's resource base have a significant influence on the dynamics of gas production. The natural gas of Eastern Siberia has complex composition and contains a large number of homologs of methane (ethane, propane, butane, helium, etc.).

With the help of correlation analysis, it was defined that there is a connection between the position of the subjects in the innovation development rating and the position in the rating of their socioeconomic situation. Then, using the dispersion analysis, the authors of the article established a causal relationship between the level of socio-economic development of regions and the level of their innovative development. The statistical processing was carried out using a software package Statistica 10. The authors pointed out that there are two most often mentioned factors which restrain the development of innovative activity of depressed regions: Socio-economic conditions of innovation activity and Scientific and technical potential. The first factor is determined by the level of efficiency of the regional economy, the availability of human resources for innovation, the level of development of the information society. The second is determined by the state of financial and human resources for innovation and the effectiveness of research and development. The development and implementation of measures to improve the effectiveness of the use of these factors will have the greatest impact on the development of innovative activities of depressed constituent entities of the Russian Federation and, accordingly, will contribute to increasing their level of socio-economic development.","[Kislitsyna, V.

In constructing mathematical models, the authors, in addition to the classical Keynes multiplier (according to R. Allen) use the concept of accelerator. In the economic models of NGP dynamics traditionally this relationship is a linear function, and in more complex mathematical models it is a nonlinear function. R. Allen also pointed to the need to consider the delay (lag). Different types of delay are often based on mathematical differential equations with lag (differential equations with deviating argument). In the works of P.M. Simonov, it was first proposed to simulate the lag in the form. In this paper a nonlinear accelerator is considered rather extensively and mathematically justified. It is applied to the modified model of NGP by Phillips-Goodwin allowing for lag of the input of induced investments.","[Pushkarev, G. A.; Vorob'eva, E. Yu; Sokolov, V.

Emissions happen in different stages of meat production ranging from agricultural input production, feed production, livestock production to slaughtering, meat processing, and retail. An overview of direct emissions from processes in the meat sector themselves and indirect emissions from energy consumptions would provide a clearer picture for potential CC impact reduction. This paper explores the total GHG emissions and data availability within the meat sector of the pig, chicken, and cattle meat product system. Through statistical data provided by FAOSTAT and supplementary data from literature, the CC impacts of energy use and process GHG emissions in the pig, chicken and cattle meat life cycle are estimated. Cattle dominates, but pig and chicken meat have a sizable amount of GHG emissions with a relatively high contribution from agricultural inputs and post-farm processes. However, uncertainty and unavailability of data are large for the energy consumption, direct GHG emissions, and product flows of post-farm and agricultural input processes. In order to gain a more complete understanding of the total CC impacts of the meat sector, further research is necessary to reduce the uncertainty in the considered life cycle stages and to quantify the processes and meat products that have been excluded from this study.

On the one hand, there are some politicians who want to raise it, which is not surprising with the elections approaching. On the other hand, economic experts, and especially employers, are reluctant. Let us, for the moment, accept that the minimum wage is to be raised; a question remains by how much, or on which economic variables its increase should be dependent. One possibility is to tie the minimum wage with the average wage. The present paper will try to show that this would be an absurd option. We are going to show on real data what the consequences of the increased minimum wage and, especially, the impact on the wage distribution would be. Further, we will consider different levels of the minimum wage and study several scenarios related to changes in all wages after an increase of the minimum wage limit.","[Marek, Lubos; Vrabec, Michal] Univ Econ, Dept Stat & Probabil, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13057 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Marek, L (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Dept Stat & Probabil, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13057 3, Czech Republic.",marek@vse.cz; vrabec@vse.cz,"Marek, Lubos/HRC-4615-2023","Marek, Lubos/0000-0003-4761-1936",Czech Science Foundation [P402/12/G097],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),This paper was written with the support of the Czech Science Foundation project No. P402/12/G097 DYME - Dynamic Models in Economics.,,5,0,0,0,1,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-678-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,430,435,,,,,,6,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ7ED,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427151400074,0

Although from the multicriteria point of view the photovoltaic power stations are not well evaluated the low investment costs and easy accessibility of suitable lands are strong points of photovoltaic energy and so the number of newly built photovoltaic power stations is huge. In this paper the renewable energy sources are analyzed from multicriteria point of view, especially by using data envelopment analysis because photovoltaic power stations are typical production units.

The state space is defined by a moving standard deviation of lengths 10, 20, 30. Nine trading strategies are calculated for each of the models. For each of these trading strategies the achieved yield and the number of transactions are calculated. The study was performed on historical daily prices (open and close) of the CEZ shares in the ten years period from early 2006 to the end of 2015.

The paper deals with the problem of spurious correlation measures due to the heteroskedasticity which might lead to improper inferences about the presence of contagion. The problem is solved by incorporating information about time-varying volatility into the methodology based on estimation of conditional probability of co-movements between equity returns. The proposed methodology is split into three stages. First the integrated variance is estimated using various approaches such as realized kernel and the pre-averaging approach which incorporates data sampled in high-frequency. Second the time-varying quantiles are modeled as conditional autoregressive quantiles using estimated variance. Finally, the conditional probability of co-movement is estimated based on co-exceedance of corresponding quantiles of random variables. The model is then used for investigating asymmetric behavior of contagion during crisis on equity returns of S&P 500 index. For some sectors the results report a significant increase in sector equity return comovements in bear markets during the crisis of period between years 1998 and 2016 and insignificant changes in bull markets for all sector indices.","[Tomanova, Petra] Univ Econ, Dept Econometr, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 3, Czech Republic",,"Tomanová, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Dept Econometr, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 3, Czech Republic.",pe-tra.tomanova@vse.cz,"Tomanová, Petra/AAS-4066-2021; Tomanová, Petra/HGA-3029-2022","Tomanová, Petra/0000-0001-8072-3193; Tomanová, Petra/0000-0001-8072-3193","Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, University of Economics, Prague [VSE IGA F4/63/2016]","Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, University of Economics, Prague","This work was supported by the research grant VSE IGA F4/63/2016, Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, University of Economics, Prague.

We recall briefly the methods of incomplete data analysis, then we concentrate to the case of fixed left truncation and parametric models of distribution. The Cramer-von Mises, Anderson-Darling, and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov minimum distance estimators, the maximum likelihood, and the moment estimators are used, their performance is compared, with the aid of randomly generated examples covering also the case of heavy-tailed distribution. Higher robustness of some distance-based estimators is demonstrated.

Harbin is one of the largest cities of the Northeast of China which was founded in 1898 as the central point of railway construction. Rapid construction pace turned it into a city of European level in two decades. A large number of temporary people who came to construction with the purpose of big earnings contributed to the rapid development of the hospitality industry: hotels, restaurants, entertainment sphere. And even the beginning of the Russo-Japanese war of 1904-1905 did not, as usual, lead to a decrease in business activity in this sphere, but, on the contrary, stimulated even greater development, as, basically, supplies of troops were passing through Harbin, and money continued to enter the sphere of hospitality in large quantities. To reveal the theme archival sources, memoirs of contemporaries and periodicals published in the Far East including Harbin were used. The history of both the industry itself and the activity of the main entrepreneurs - hoteliers and restaurateurs are shown.","[Chernov, V.

These parks implement the principles of circular economy, such as industrial symbiosis, waste recycling, energy saving, etc. Russia is just at the beginning of the process of elaboration of eco-industrial parks development policy. The mission of the eco-industrial parks in Russia is to fulfill the role of a laboratory for advanced researches on improving energy efficiency, resource saving and obtaining synergies through pooling the assets and intellectual capital of residents in the eco-industrial park and sharing the infrastructural subsystems. For the successful operation of eco-industrial parks, combining industrial, research and educational activities, it is necessary to attract and use resources efficiently. First, we are talking about material, financial and labor resources. Equally important is the creation of an advanced information system in the form of constantly functioning monitoring that provides an eco-industrial park with complete, reliable and up-to-date information on modern innovation processes.

The paper investigates the ways of applying the concept of logistics to the financial flows of the cultural industry, which will increase the efficiency of the entire service system as a whole. The relationship between the financial and related information flows in the mutual relations of subjects of the culture and creativity industry is presented in the form of a scheme. In order to ensure the high competitiveness of cultural industry services based on the use of integrated service systems, an algorithm for the formation of an information-analytical database has been developed, which allows to improve the quality of services provided to the consumer. The creation of the information and analytical database of the culture industry allows to carry out the re-vision of the operating enterprises of the culture industry for the further development of the complex of organizational and economic measures for the formation and practical implementation of Integra in modern conditions. Criteria for structuring the cultural industries to create of integrated service systems are: availability of infrastructure in the cultural industry; remoteness from the cultural centers; population and age; human security; the demand for culture. All the above points allow us to confirm the feasibility of application of logistic approach to improve the efficiency of financing, such as from-individual project activities of the cultural industries and the cultural industries as a whole.","[Malshina, N.

On this methodological basis, a holistic model of the subject area of space knowledge is constructed. The space reality sciences are of particular interest, methodological complexity and value. An important place among them has the problem of the subject area of space research formation. To solve it, in modern astronomy it is necessary to apply new methods of knowledge. A method of systematic philosophical analysis in this subject area knowledge is a leading one. At the same time, the systematic-philosophical analysis and the appropriate approach to the study of the subject area of astronomy allows identifying and justifying cosmology as an integral system of knowledge. The ontological foundations of modern astronomical knowledge allow us deeply comprehend the objective world, cosmic reality as a self-organizing and self-developing system, and also help lay the foundation for the construction of an integral model of the subject of modern space science. Modern astronomical science faces important epistemological and logic-methodological challenges: find out what is the subject and the structure of cosmos science.

This fact reveals its broad area of possible applicability. The article deals with a modification of the transportation problem; the modification consists in a specific nonlinear form of the objective function which has not been found in literature. In the article, it is considered that a carrier offers a lower carriage to a customer if a certain (minimum) number of goods is transported. Such type of the transportation problem has already been considered in the past but the objective criterion has been assumed to be continuous nonlinear. In our modification nonlinearity of the objective criterion is discontinuous (stepped) and is decreasing (the carriage per unit is decreasing with the increasing number of transported goods). The task can be solved as balanced (the total supply and the total demand are equal) or unbalanced (the total supply and the total demand are not equal). A linear mixed integer mathematical model which models the modification of the transportation problem is presented in the article. To test the model and to find a dependence of the calculation time on input data some calculation experiments are presented in the article. The calculation experiments are carried out using optimisation software Xpress - IVE.","[Graf, Vojtech; Teichmann, Dusan; Dorda, Michal] VSB TU Ostrava, Fac Mech Engn, Inst Transport, 17 Listopadu 15, Ostrava 70833, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Graf, V (通讯作者)，VSB TU Ostrava, Fac Mech Engn, Inst Transport, 17 Listopadu 15, Ostrava 70833, Czech Republic.",vojtech.graf@vsb.cz; dusan.teichmann@vsb.cz; michal.dorda@vsb.cz,"Dorda, Michal/B-4396-2013; Graf, Vojtěch/AAP-3215-2021","Graf, Vojtěch/0000-0002-8101-8098",,,,,7,1,1,0,0,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-678-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,201,206,,,,,,6,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ7ED,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427151400035,0

In this work we present a combined way of using a multiple correspondence analysis as multivariate analysis method that integrates ideas from multidimensional scaling in the field of people analytics. Several managers formulated ideas concerning possible dependencies and associations among length and frequency of absenteeism events, age of an employee, sex and employee's designation (blue collar, white collar). These ideas are formulated as hypotheses and tested on data set summarizing information about more than five thousand employees of six production companies from Moravian-Silesian region during period 01/2015 - 12/2016. Associations and particular patterns among specified categorical variables are interpreted using Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA).

We first argue that the logic of Rotemberg and Saloner (1986) presupposes two determinants for collusion, namely (1) market shares are publicly observable, and (2) volatility of market shares due to exogenous factors is limited. We make our arguments in a model in which firms repeatedly play a Bertrand type price competition game, while market shares are determined by a stochastic process, conditional on current market shares and prices. Following Rotemberg and Saloner (1986), we show under the two conditions of public observability and limited volatility of market shares that firms can collude using dynamic price adjustment strategies. We show that when the first condition (public observability) is violated, we revert to the logic of Green and Porter (1984). When the second condition (limited volatility of market shares) is violated, for example when consumer loyalty has decreased, we also observe that collusion can no longer be sustained, in line with the arguments in Stigler (1964).","[Peeters, Ronald; Peters, Hans; Pot, Erik; Vermeulen, Dries] Maastricht Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University,"Peters, H (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Maastricht, Netherlands.",r.peeters@maastrichtuniversity.nl; h.peters@maastrichtuniversity.nl; erikalexanderpot@gmail.com; d.vermeulen@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"Peeters, Ronald/H-4070-2015","Vermeulen, Dries/0000-0003-1514-7518",,,,,9,0,0,0,3,SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",1865-0929,1865-0937,978-981-10-6753-2; 978-981-10-6752-5,COMM COM INF SC,,,2017,758.0,,,,,,3,17,,10.1007/978-981-10-6753-2_1,0.0,,,15,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BL5GE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000451446900001,0

Impulse response analysis is used to describe the time path of one of the variables in the VAR to shocks from the other explanatory variables. Based on responses groups of similar countries are created. Our results prove the Granger causality running from labour productivity to unit labour costs just in Sweden, Finland, Luxembourg and Austria. The causality running from unit labour costs to labour productivity is observed in most of the rest of the European countries.

All these elements are inextricably linked and interdependent under current conditions. It is explains the enormous role played by the issues of social development in the modern world and, in particular in reforming Russia. The conditions necessary for the successful implementation of the state policy of economic growth are identified: the existence of a systematically linked setting of goals and objectives of public policy; stability of the public administration system; regulatory, legal, organizational and resource support; system interaction of central and regional authorities in the implementation of innovation policy. The analysis of the dynamics of indicators of socio-economic development in Russia in recent years shows the presence of the sharpest contradictions that persist in the social sphere. Thus, the relevance of the article is conditioned by the need to study the process of formation and development of the competitiveness of the national economy in various aspects and at different levels, to reveal its political determinants, and to choose the model of Russia's economic development towards its integration into the global economy in the context of globalization.","[Ershov, B.

The paper is aimed at substantiating and developing the major components of the concept of a new motivational environment on the basis of the economic phenomenon of happiness from the standpoint of subjective assessments by the younger generation, and identifying general objective factors and conditions that determine happiness. The authors prove the hypothesis that subjective evaluation of the state of happiness is founded on objective and universal factors forming the economic phenomenon of happiness in the new economic reality. The study covered young people as the most creative group of population with lower social inertia. The quantitative and qualitative methods of statistical analysis were applied: time series, the ranking method, rank correlation, correlation and regression analysis and econometric modeling. The study proves that material conditions and socio-psychological factors are the elements of a single system that, when interacting, produce a synergy effect generating a qualitatively new motivation for enhancing economic activity that ensures effective self-realization. The identified objective factors in social and economic equilibrium (happiness) are proposed as the basis for the formation policy of a new motivational environment that ensures the realization of economic interests of people, especially the youth.","[Ilyukhin, A.

We have performed a CAD-simulation using this technique on the basis of the generally accepted sequence of design stages, taking into account the identified factors that determine the choice of requirements for inclusive clothing for people with musculoskeletal disorders. In addition, we have identified the factors that determine the choice of requirements for inclusive clothing for people with musculoskeletal disorders. Also we the proposed the principles for evaluating the quality of design solutions for inclusive clothing. The obtained model of the automated process of designing inclusive clothes based on the IDEF0 standards has been tested as an example of clothes for people using wheelchair.

The test rig consists of a number of essential components including a CO2 turboexpander with high speed generator, finned-tube air cooled condenser, liquid receiver, CO2 liquid pump and CO2 gas generator. The CO2 is heated in the plate-type gas generator by hot thermal oil flow which is circulated and heated by exhaust flue gases from an 80kWe microturbine CUP unit. The test rig has been fully commissioned, instrumented, controlled and is ready to operate experiment as required. Subsequently, at constant heat sink (ambient) and heat source (thermal oil) temperatures, a series of experiments have been carried out to examine the effects of various important parameters on the T-CO2 system performance. These include thermal oil flow rate and CO2 mass flow rate etc. Preliminary experimental results show that the CO2 TPC is applicable for the low temperature heat sources to generate power although further efficiency improvements are needed.

We present variational formulation of American option problem with special attention to early exercise action effect. Next, we discuss financially motivated additive decomposition of American option price into a European option price and another part due to the extra premium required by early exercising the option contract. As the optimal exercise boundary is a free boundary, its determination is coupled with the determination of the option price. Therefore, a closed-form expression of the free boundary is not attainable in general. We discuss in detail a derivation of an asymptotic expression of the early exercise boundary. Finally, we present some numerical results of determination of free boundary based upon this approach.

Greater uptake of alternative business models in the UK could help to create a more sustainable industry in retail refrigeration. (C) 2017 The Authors.

There is a great demand for cost effective and sustainable antifouling solutions. An increase in internal fouling results in poor thermal efficiency during food processing. This is coupled with poor heat and mass transfer local to the metal surface of designed heat exchangers, pipes and other equipment. Internal fouling could also potentially increase unwanted fluid flow pressure due to restricted flow. [1, 2] It is demonstrated in this work, how fouling is mitigated with ultrasound non-invasively during pilot scale production. When using a plate heat exchanger set-point temperature of 140 degrees C, 128 degrees C and 138 degrees C was achieved without and with an attached ultrasonic transducer respectively. The duration for complete fouling of a tubular heat exchanger increased from 10 to 25 hours with ultrasonic transducers. The presence of ultrasound reduces the carbon footprint owing to substantially reduced fouling. (C) 2017 The Authors.

The first part focuses on a literature review of the use of DEA in evaluating regional efficiency. Nowadays, DEA becomes a suitable analysis tool for setting a competitive resp. non-competitive position of each NUTS 3 region within the Czech Republic. The next part of the article describes the research methodology. The method of DEA used for the evaluation is applied to the NUTS 3 regions based on a particular set of regional input and output variables and other regional characteristics. The regional inputs and outputs variables form the key elements of the system evaluated for each administrative region in the sense of its effective resp. ineffective economic status. Regional efficiency can be thus perceived as a reflection of competitiveness.

Variance and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) are assumed as risk measures and mean-risk optimal portfolios are then compared to 1/N strategy on out of the sample dataset where its performance is discussed in detail. Both algorithms outperformed 1/N strategy on risk-adjusted basis on simulated dataset of stable multivariate-normally distributed returns. However, performance of tested models were not superior to 1/N diversification on the real dataset.

This paper is devoted to the problem where a decision-maker (company) chooses a portfolio of suppliers to cover all his/her supply needs. It is shown here that it is insufficient to take the ranking of suppliers and to select the first few in order. The problem is solved by the PROMETHEE V method, which is a unique combination of the outranking method of multi-attribute decision-making and mathematical optimisation (first, the rankings of alternatives is found using the PROMETHEE II method, and then the optimal portfolio is selected based on that ranking using the integer programming).

The modern concept also covers the nutrition factor and problems, which are related with falsification, the use of the new food technologies including the production of the food products by genetic engineering and nanotechnology, the use of the complex food additives and the introduction of the new types of the packaging materials. The analysis shows that these problems are typical for many countries, therefore, there isn't a need to develop only a national, but also within the framework of the economic integration entities, the concept of the food safety management system, initiated and coordinated by FAO / WHO.

This problem can be solved with the help of the roles and responsibilities matrix which provides a clear definition of the staff's functions. It also shows the possibilities for interaction and the adequate distribution of responsibilities within an organization. Designing the university's quality management system means defining the staff's competences and responsibilities. The roles and responsibilities matrix relies on the inventory of the university's activities and processes. It is also based on a thorough analysis of the university's structure. Unlike the job description which defines the roles and responsibilities of a particular employee and mainly reflects the vertical relationships in a hierarchy, the responsibility matrix shows clearly the relationships between several employees who are active participants included in an integrated system. Furthermore, the matrix enables executives to avoid the duplication of functions; it accelerates decision-making and raises accountability. In fact, the responsibility matrix represents a table of binary relations between a certain amount of business processes and the body of staff and departments within an organization. The horizontal lines of the table connect the university's business processes and the vertical columns contain the representatives of the educational institution. The responsibility matrix allows executives to evaluate the data horizontally and vertically. On the one hand, the executives are able to identify the participants of a certain process, to evaluate the effectiveness of the allocation of assignments and duties. On the other hand, they can estimate the amount and content of a certain work load within a particular business process. The analysis of the responsibility matrix results in the definition of duties, roles and the type of interaction between the representatives of the university's administration staff. This data underlies the job descriptions and department regulations. As a result, the responsibility matrix requires the evaluation of the university's organizational structure and basic processes. The responsibility matrix represents a table of binary relations between a certain number of business processes and a body of the administration staff within an organization.","[Eremenko, S.

The problem is relevant for energy intensive industries of modern Russia, striving to follow the path of low carbon development. The article analyzes the need for increasing responsibility of Russian corporations in ecological sphere through raising the informativeness of non-financial reporting on energy efficiency, management of greenhouse gas emissions as well as eco-logical management in transition to low-carbon economy.

The authors give their own definition of the concept a future economist's competitiveness and define its structural components. The choice of the competitiveness' structural components, which are the abilities (informational, communicative, analytical, projective, evaluative-reflective, value-orientational), is determined by the specific types of a future economist's professional activities: computational-economic, analytical, research, organizational-managerial. The technology of project activity is considered to be an effective means of forming future economists' competitiveness in the process of professional training.

Today the Internet is the main channel for the transfer of socialized content within the framework of formalized secondary socialization. One of the form of the influence is distance education. Distance education is aimed to people who have already passed the stage of primary socialization, except for individual cases when distance learning is used in the framework of primary socialization. Within the Internet there is a fairly large number of types of distance learning, which now are an effective educational tool.

Theoretical significance of the paper lies in developing approaches to the BRICS currencies' internationalization as a multi-dimensional process. The article is also theoretically significant because its major outcomes and conclusions deepen and enrich the theory of the currency internationalization by means of analyzing the BRICS currencies' circulation and use in the contemporary WSC.

The aim of the paper is not only to evaluate the absolute achievements of the countries but evaluate their performance with respect to the resources they can use.

LGWH is heat below 100 degrees C and there is no cost effective solution commercially available and, as 63% of waste heat is at a temperature below 100 degrees C, there is a significant untapped resource. Cost effectiveness is the key barriers that have left this market untapped. Exergyn's technology will change this as it is very simple, which allows costs to be reduced, and will enable LGWH to be recovered in a wide range of applications to deliver low cost, zero emission electricity on demand. The Exergyn Drive (TM) applies a solid state drive to utilise hot water of suitable temperatures (c. 90 degrees C) from sources such as reciprocating engines, industrial processes or geothermal resources. Installation is also simple, potentially a flow and return from the heat source and an electrical hook up utilising heat directly from engine jackets without the need for heat exchangers, which enhances efficiency and reduces costs.

It often happens that a max-min matrix equation with exact data is unsolvable. Therefore, we replace matrix elements with intervals of possible values. In this way, we obtain an interval matrix equation. We shall deal with interval max-min matrix equations with bounded solution, in which a solution has to be from the given interval of possible values. We can define several types of solvability of interval max-min matrix equations with bounded solution. In this paper, we shall deal with four of them.

The problem is complex because there is lack of risk assessment methods which allow to prepare a full risk analysis, in particular dedicated for the industrial areas. The article provides a concept of application of mixed method study for assessing the risk for one foundry in Poland. Castings production is an specific industry where the processes are very complicated and unstable, therefore the use of a multiple tool to illustrate the risk will be an added value for the company. This kind of approach allows to make a full risk assessment analysis what cannot be done by a single statistical techniques with some limitations. In this paper empirical and simulation data is used. The proposal of multi-tool can enable effective risk estimation, assist in determining the significance of the data set and to facilitate accurate decision-making.

At first, we use factor analysis for reduction of the data dimension. Several meaningful results with different number of factors are found. We use the method of cluster analysis (with different settings) in order to identify the group of active and bankrupted companies; this analysis is based on original financial data and on artificial factors. Both steps are repeated for the data coming from one, two and three years before bankruptcy. Influence of data dimension reduction on cluster analysis results is discussed and final recommendations for further analyses are given.","[Stankova, Michaela; Hampel, David] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Stat & Operat Anal, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Stanková, M (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Stat & Operat Anal, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",xstanko7@node.mendelu.cz; david.hampel.uso@mendelu.cz,"Staňková, Michaela/AAT-9796-2020; Hampel, David/B-6765-2013","Staňková, Michaela/0000-0003-3789-3570; Hampel, David/0000-0002-3865-5948",Grant Agency IGA PEF MENDELU [PEF/DP/2017027],Grant Agency IGA PEF MENDELU,This article was supported by the grant No. PEF/DP/2017027 of the Grant Agency IGA PEF MENDELU.,,11,2,2,0,2,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-678-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,714,719,,,,,,6,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ7ED,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427151400122,0

That is why harmonization of standards plays an important role in the development of international industrial cooperation and joint resolution to improve quality assurance. Based on the above considerations, the problem of standards harmonization remains vital and important. This article provides the results of comparative analysis of RF standards in a certain sector of industry based on GOST classifier, and demonstrates evolution of development and harmonization of standards in modern economic environment.

A special case of such problems appears in the personnel task scheduling where the decision maker (manager) is looking for a minimal number of workers to cover all prescribed shifts. This problem can be classified as a tactical fixed interval scheduling. In this paper, we focus on scheduling of jobs with uncertain processing intervals where the finishing times are modelled as random variables with a known probability distribution. We provide a stochastic integer programming formulation with a joint chance constraint which ensures the reliability of the resulting schedule. We propose an iterative decomposition algorithm for a reformulation where the partial operational FIS problems can be solved as the min-cost network flow problems.

Parametric analysis of the level of diversification allows us to study the stability of the structure of optimal portfolios in relation to the investor preferences regarding the expected return and skewness. In this paper we determine the optimal portfolios of stocks listed on Warsaw Stock Exchange, which have the same degree of diversification.

Medium variant forecast predicts moderate growth rates of sugar crystal from 18.40 CZK/kg to 19.12 CZK/kg. The upper variant with a 90% probability promises a significant increase to 22.98 CZK/kg. The low variant expects decline of the price to 15.26 CZK/kg in 08/2017.

Much work at the above problems has been done and interesting results have been found. Yet, several aspects were neglected and need to be addressed in more details. Traditional distribution of task or virtual machine allocation is based on simple load balancing techniques, e.g. round robin, in coming data stream selection, etc. This kind of distribution does not reflect the real utilization of resource or problem such as communication between virtual machines, virtual machine co-location interference, composition of power consumption optimization at multiple levels of components, or physical machine with multi-core CPU.

In health economics, three types of models are most commonly used to this purpose: Markov cohort model, Monte Carlo simulation and discrete event simulation (DES). In the first part of the paper, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method and their use in the context of the Czech health-care system and data availability. It is argued that DES is the preferred method with regards to results accuracy since the other methods rely more heavily on a number of questionable assumptions. However, the quality of the data we have collected for Czechia does not allow us to directly use this method. Consequently, we start to build our model on the methodology using Monte Carlo simulation that was previously established to estimate economic outcomes of early identification of AD in the USA. Bearing in mind the specificities of the Czech context as well as the existing data sources, and upon careful scrutiny of each parameter and assumption, we modify this model to bring it as close to DES as possible.","[Smrckova, Hana Marie; Sladek, Vaclav; Arltova, Marketa; Cerny, Jakub] Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Nam Winstona Churchilla 1938-4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Smrcková, HM (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Nam Winstona Churchilla 1938-4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",xsmrh00@vse.cz; xslav20@vse.cz; arltova@vse.cz; xcerj129@vse.cz,"Arltová, Markéta/P-4315-2018","Arltova, Marketa/0000-0001-7313-6927","Internal Grant Agency of the University of Economics, Prague [F4/38/2017]","Internal Grant Agency of the University of Economics, Prague","Supported by the grant No. F4/38/2017 of the Internal Grant Agency of the University of Economics, Prague.",,16,0,0,0,8,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-678-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,690,695,,,,,,6,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ7ED,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427151400118,0

These cabinets, however, are less energy efficient than cabinets with glass doors because of the interactions between the air curtain, that is used to provide an artificial barrier between the air in the cabinets, and the air in food premises. To improve the energy efficiency of open fronted refrigerated display cabinets, many types of air curtains have been designed, including single layer air curtains, multi-layer air curtains and shelf tip air curtains amongst others. An approach, considered in recent years to improve the efficiency of air curtains is the use of air guiding strips at the front face of the shelves of open-type vertical refrigerated display cabinets with single layer air curtains. This paper uses Computational Fluid Dynamics modelling to investigate the influence of air guiding strips on the performance of vertical multi-deck refrigerated display cabinets. The results showed that the air guiding strips accelerate the air curtain vertically; leading to a stronger and stiffer air curtain, consequently inhibit the infiltration of the ambient warm air into the cabinet. The average temperature of simulated food in the cabinet decreases by 4.9 degrees C compared to the cabinet without the strip due to the improved protection of the stiffer air curtain. The cooling capacity required to maintain the food chilled decreases by 34%. (C) 2017 The Authors.

The modern agricultural system is wasteful, with Europe generating some 700 million tonnes of agrifood (agricultural and food) waste each year. The Agricultural Centre for Sustainable Energy Systems (ACSES) at Harper Adams University is involved in a major research and innovation project (AgroCycle) on the application of the 'circular economy' across the agri-food sector. In the context of the agrifood chain, the `circular economy' aims to reduce waste while also making best use of the 'wastes' produced by using economically viable processes and procedures to increase their value. Led by University College Dublin, AgroCycle is a Horizon 2020 collaborative project with 26 partners. AgroCycle will address such opportunities directly by implementation of the 'circular economy' across the agri-food sector. The authors will present (a) a summary of the AgroCycle project and (b) the role played by Harper Adams in the project in evaluating the potential for small-scale anaerobic digestion (AD) technology that can be applied on farm to provide local heat, energy and nutrient recovery from mixed agricultural wastes.

Then, we develop a simplified method to compute the IV least square prenucleolus of a special subclass of IV cooperative games with fuzzy coalitions in Choquet integral forms. In this method, we give some weaker coalition size monotonicity-like conditions, which can always ensure that the least square prenucleolus of our defined cooperative games with fuzzy coalitions in Choquet integral form are monotonic and non-decreasing functions of fuzzy coalitions' values. Hereby, the lower and upper bounds of the proposed IV least square prenucleolus can be directly obtained via utilizing the lower and upper bounds of the IV coalitions values, respectively.

Analysis has shown many businesses successfully use the stock market mechanisms not only to invest their temporarily disposable assets in securities portfolio, but also for speculation. Research has shown that in the modern world, the ever-larger bulk of stock exchange transactions are done by using mechanical trading systems (trading robots). AI-based systems stand out of mechanical trading systems. Our effort has produced a neural-network trading algorithm for speculative stock transactions with the SiH8 futures contract in USD. The developed neural network is a perception that has an six-parameter input layer, a hidden layer, and a single-parameter output layer that tells the user to either buy (+1) or sell a financial instrument.

Spinach (Spinacia oleracea) is one of the main leafy vegetables contributing to the RTE industry. Due to its tender and soft texture, spinach leaves tend to undergo different degrees of injuries during processing steps which affect their quality and shelf life. In this study, the effect of compression on quality degradation of spinach leaves during storage was investigated. Spinach leaves were subjected to compression using Universal Testing Machine where Young's modulus for spinach in bulk amount; imitating packaged spinach in the industry was evaluated. Visual appearance was assessed by Population test where leaves were classified into categories according to degree of damage and percentage of deterioration was evaluated by analyzing RGB images using ImageJ. To understand the behavior better, microstructural property of the spinach was observed under light microscope. Organic spinach was found to be the best in resisting stress and damage compared to Teen, Salad and Baby spinach. Reducing weight of spinach inside the packaging bag, while putting appropriate weight reduced the possibility of the leaves inside the bag to be compressed due to the crowdedness inside the bag thus lowered the risk for accidental mechanical leaf damage. Including already broken leaves inside the packaging bag together with good leaves accelerates the deterioration of the whole leaves inside the bag. Halfway and complete teared leaves were found to be not acceptable to eat after 8 days of storage whereas control, undamaged and minor teared leaves were still acceptable to eat after 14 days of storage. The mechanical stress gave significant effect on the physical quality and mechanical property of spinach. Increasing the compression force did not change the cell sizes but changed the structure of the cells. This work provide basis to understand the physical quality and mechanical property of bulk spinach which can be used to improve the quality and shelf life of the packaged RTE spinach throughout the distribution chain.

I, the effect of freezing with temperature fluctuations on the microstructure and dissolution of aerated and non-aerated freeze-dried concentrated coffee (50 and 60% w/w) is presented. Samples were either frozen at-40 C or subjected to fluctuating temperatures between-40 and-20 degrees C prior to drying. Total freezing time was kept constant for both freezing profiles. Microstructural characteristics of the freeze-dried solids were revealed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high speed camera was used to record the dissolution process. Solution with 60% solids nucleated at lower temperatures (<-20 degrees C) and developed smaller pore sizes (by 70%) than 50% concentration. SEM micrographs of the freeze-dried solids showed the formation of voids similar to the shape of crystal dendrites in less concentrated coffee sample. Aerated systems were characterized by growth of small dendrites (20-40 um) within large air bubbles which diameter varied from 200-1000 um. Meanwhile, collapsed microstructure was observed in 60% coffee but was not visible on aerated sample. Temperature fluctuations doubled the observed pore sizes in both concentrations which effectively accelerated the dissolution process. Morphology of ice crystals is also affected by the periodic temperature fluctuations with growth of hexagonal ice crystals (50100 m) was evidence from the SEM images. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Furthermore, most of the energy sources that drive the industrial sector are fossil fuel based. Every industrial process is characterised by a multitude of waste heat streams at different temperature levels whose recovery would undoubtedly contribute to the enhancement of the sustainability of the industrial sites and their products. Waste heat recovery systems can offer significant energy savings and substantial greenhouse gas emission reductions. For the latter to materialise technological improvements and innovations aimed at improving the energy efficiency of heat recovery equipment and reducing installation costs should take place. This paper outlines the opportunities and the potential for industrial heat recovery in the European Union by identifying and quantifying primary energy consumption in the major industrial sectors and their related waste streams and temperature levels. Through a systematic analysis considering waste heat and Carnot's potential estimation, detailed results are given for all industrial sectors, temperature ranges and EU countries. The 'big picture' is rather promising with regards to the estimated total waste heat potential. (C) 2017 The Authors.

To overcome this problem, the author developed a method of transformation of PF with variable parameters into a modified production function with constant parameters and a variable effect on the economic growth of technological progress and others unaccounted factors. The modified PF describes more adequately real economic processes than traditional PF with constant parameters. It some cyclicity in the production efficiency of the Russian economy was revealed on the basis of the worked out toolkit. A sharp decline in the production efficiency of the Russian economy was observed at the beginning of the analyzed period in 1990-1994. The unstable growth of the Russian economy corresponds to the period 1995-1997. The decline in the production efficiency of the Russian economy in 1998-1999 was a result of a negative impact of consequences of the Asian financial crisis of 1997. The highest and most stable rates of economic growth due to the impact of intensive factors were observed for the Russian economy during 2000-2008. The decline in the production efficiency of the Russian economy in 2009-2010 was a result of the impact of the global financial and economic crisis of 2008.

The grouping approach is special due to the degree of aggregation applied, while the combination of the features being analyzed depends on the study objectives, the mapping of problem areas (elements) and the subject of research. The first group is made up of economic factors (spatial and sectoral structure of the economy; taxation (tax burden), population well-being; and available investment resources). The group of institutional factors includes corruption, administrative barriers, the stability of the legal and regulatory framework. The group of social factors encompasses population's expectations, established stereotypes etc. The most important economic factor that is considered in the article is the eco-nomic well-being of the population in Russia's regions. By comparing data for all constituent regions of Russia, the authors have established an inverse correlation between percapita income and the number of people employed in the informal sector. There is a stronger tendency towards nonobserved economic activities in poorer regions and vice versa. The authors also draw a conclusion that cause-effect relationships in the spatial differentiation of the non-observed economy are rarely manifested vividly, and that factors pertaining to the occurrence and spread of this phenomenon vary by region and change over time.

The effect of traditional dough processing steps: dividing, rounding, resting, pinning and panning, on bread roll crumb and finish was investigated. Data presented here suggests that dough can be divided using alternative technologies (Pressure driven (PD); Pressure vacuum (PV); Extrusion (EX)). PV and EX doughs result in good crumb. However, if the number of intermediate handling steps is reduced, the external fmish is poor. Alternative process configurations can be employed to achieve good crumb morphology in bread rolls without oil and dusting flour. However, the external fmish suffers. Suggesting dough handling processes required to achieve a good crumb and a smooth surface may not be complimentarily. There is substantial interplay between dividing approach and intermediate handling in the development of dough to achieve both internal and external bread roll quality attributes. A lower energy process with less dough handling may not actually be cost effective yet. As dough smoothing appears to be required, which may not eliminate the use of process aid.

All carbon containing wastes have an energy potential and the food industry should focus on recovering that energy to offset their reliance on fossil-fuel derived energy sources. This paper focuses on the novel use of intermediate pyrolysis for decarbonizing the food chain, through the treatment of food and packaging waste, to recover energy. The TCR is a versatile technology which overcomes many of the traditional problems associated with fast pyrolysis and can thermo-chemically convert a range of different feedstocks, including inaccessible lignin and some inorganic, recalcitrant materials. The feedstocks are converted into new fuel sources; char, bio-oil (thermally stable) and permanent gases, for further electrical and heat generation.

Bio-gas obtained from anaerobic digestion of farm and food industry waste is largely composed of 60% CH4 and 40% CO2. For injection of bio-methane into the gas distribution network it is necessary to remove CO2 from the biogas so that a richer CH4 stream is injected to satisfy gas network requirements. Chemical separation processes using solvents that react with CO2 or physically processes using adsorbents or membranes in which CO2 is retained are currently under investigation to reduce associated energy consumption whilst maximizing CO2 removal. In the case of sorbent based processes, research is mainly focused on the optimal design of pressure swing adsorption (PSA) cycles. In this work, a comparative techno-economic study of bio-gas upgrading for bio-methane production using solvent based processes and pressure swing adsorption cycles is presented. The results show that, pressure swing adsorption cycles exhibit 37% lower capital costs and 10% lower average life-time costs compared to solvent based technologies. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Each batch is distributed to a pair of examiners who evaluate each test by points in a given range. Awarded points by examinators, which may be biased due to examinator attitude, represent observations. We assume that the observations are the sums of realizations of bias and true values.

Via this income inequality gap we can measure success of redistribution function of economic policy that means the success of social policy in reducing income inequalities in society.

The city's image characteristics are identified. The characteristics are the opinions of the following groups of people: city residents, people who know about the city from media sources but have not visited the city before, tourists, holidaymakers, and business people. 4500 people took part in the survey. The following positive image characteristics of Vladivostok have been determined: geographic location (sea city, unique flora and fauna, mild climate, warm and sunny autumn, opportunity for long, recreational use), areas near the city which are rich in various bio resources such as wild-growing herbs, fish and sea weeds of all sortsetc., the status of outpost in the Far East and proximity to the Asia-Pacific countries, and dynamic development. The following aspects have negative impact on the image of Vladivostok: environmental problems (air and sea pollution, lack of green space, poor water quality), high prices, poor level of service in hotels and public catering enterprises, uncomfortable urban environment (poor illumination, bad road and staircase conditions, difficulty in finding required places). The practical relevance of the research is the development of guidelines to improve the city image and identifying the approach to building the city brand.","[Konopleva, N.

It can help to identify groups of similar objects (e.g. countries) according to selected variables (e.g. economic indicators). The created groups (clusters) can be characterized based either on the variables used in clustering or on some other variables. The problem with using the methods of cluster analysis is that the analyst can obtain different results (assignments of objects into clusters) by different methods, and moreover, he needs to determine the number of clusters. Many coefficients for solving this problem have been proposed until now. However, the suggestion obtained by a certain coefficient can differ from another suggestion obtained by another coefficient. In addition, values of a certain coefficient can differ depending on the implementation in the software product. In this contribution, different approaches to the silhouette coefficient calculation are discussed. They concern the implementations of calculations in the R language and IBM SPSS Statistics system. It is analyzed how the different results influence decisions of an analyst in terms of both the choice of the suitable assignment of objects into clusters obtained by different algorithms, and the determination of the suitable number of clusters. The studied problems are illustrated using selected methods of cluster analysis applied to the EU countries characterized by the gender indicators.","[Rezankova, Hana] Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Stat & Probabil, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Rezanková, H (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Stat & Probabil, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague, Czech Republic.",hana.rezankova@vse.cz,"Rezankova, Hana/P-8370-2018",,"University of Economics, Prague [IGA F4/44/2018]","University of Economics, Prague","This work was supported by the University of Economics, Prague under Grant IGA F4/44/2018.",,14,0,0,0,5,OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE,PRAGUE 3,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",2453-9902,,978-80-245-2277-7,APPLI MATH STAT ECON,Applications of Mathematics and Statistics in Economics Conference Proceedings,,2018,,,,,,,259,268,,,,,,10,"Economics; Mathematics, Applied; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BO8KL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000527695100023,0

The solution is understood as a set of strategic measures, the implementation of which leads to certain strategic and economic consequences. The fuzzy modifications of the trade-off model, various models of proportional development, and models where multicriteria objective functions are generated through simulation procedures are proposed.

In practice, the states of the world can be described only vaguely. Therefore, in such a case we dealt with the decision matrix with fuzzy states of the world that were modelled by fuzzy sets on the universal set on which the probability distribution is given. However, the underlying probability distribution itself can be known also only vaguely. In such a case it is appropriate to apply a fuzzy probability measure. In the paper, we consider the case where the set of elementary events is finite and the probabilities of elementary events are fuzzy. We compare two approaches to expression of the expected values and the variances of the outcomes of alternatives. The first approach is inspired by the probability of a fuzzy event proposed by Zadeh. The second one is based on treating the decision matrix as a fuzzy rule bases system.

The vector of administrative influences is supposed to be directed to the development of the national innovation system. Being part of this system, the information and consulting support of the agro-industrial complex will play an essential role in the development of the agrarian sphere, provided that adequate and effective management is organized.

The aim of such integration is to increase the efficiency of production on the basis of organizational and managerial and technical and technological renovation. The slowed pace of innovation development, due to imperfections in the mechanisms of mastering the achievements of science and technology, are an important reason for the unsatisfactory state of agro-industrial production.

Pledge of motivation to increase the number of stra-tums, their growth and development is the formation of fertile soil presented by business incubators and business accelerators. Within the framework of this arti-cle, as an object of the scientific research, we consider business accelerators and its trend of corporate startup accelerator formation. The corporate accelerator is the most effective structure for promotion, develop-ment of startups and the simplest in terms of the company's infrastructure. How-ever, the creation of a corporate accelerator in our country is still not very popular. In many ways this is due to the fact that, firstly, the company does not see the ad-vantages of developing startup projects on its territory, and secondly, it does not have a clear mechanism for creating an accelerator. Within the compass of this study, the main task is to develop a clear, practical-oriented algorithm for corporate startup accelerator implementation. The analysis of the research presented by the authors showed that earlier the topic of creating an algorithm for the implementation of corporate startup accelerators was not raised in the scientific environment. The author analyzes and provides the features and components of the following stages of an accelerator creation: the formation of a mentors team, marketing and economic development of accelerating programs, business planning, the accelera-tor's marketing policy, the search for partners, the formation of its own trust fund, the formation of criteria for startups selecting and evaluating, the description of accelerator business processes, the creation of educational products, planning of accelerator work activities, legal documents processing, projects consulting plan development, the accelerator site creation.","[Danshina, V.

The development rate of small and medium-sized entities was modest over the last years, which was expressed in the growth of the number of enterprises, their financial turnover, the average number of employees. This is connected with certain policy of government support. These days the development of small and medium-sized business entities has obtained the strategic and multi-directional character. In this context, capital leverages hold a special place in the complex of measures of government support, which include taxation. Tax mechanisms are highly important for small and medium-sized entities as the high tax burden does not give them the opportunity to form necessary reserves of current assets, diverting a significant part of financial resources for tax liabilities implementation and specific conditions of participation in tax relationships provide realization of indirect financing which provokes the growth in the informal economy.","[Gorshkova, N., V; Ksenda, V.

In addition, the aging infrastructure of the energy complex requires large investment. In the conditions of the non-stationary economic regime, the optimal choice of financial, eco-nomic, institutional, administrative and regulatory instruments plays a special role in implementing measures aimed at increasing energy efficiency and de-veloping energy saving. The nature of the use of tools to improve the energy efficiency of the re-gional economy depends primarily on the level of socio-economic develop-ment of the territory that has been achieved. The current market mechanisms do not give the desired effect under non-stationary conditions. In such conditions, The basis for improving the energy efficiency of the region will be the instruments of state support. For the most effective use of instruments of state support in the region, the authors singled out: - Key elements that determine success in achieving the goal; - Power characteristics of the impact on the target; - The conditions for the most effective impact of instruments are not the re-sulting indicators: the way, direction and nature of the impact, the ability to adapt instruments to changing conditions. Any tool used to achieve the goals in the field of energy conservation and energy efficiency has certain characteristics. The set of characteristics of any instrument is standard, but in different types of regions it will appear in different ways. As a result, several tools with dif-ferent characteristics and a combination of these characteristics in the group will give a synergistic effect that will increase the effectiveness of achieving the goals set with the least cost.

The index is based on twenty-four indicators grouped in eleven topics concerning housing, income, jobs, community, education, environment, civic engagement, health, life satisfaction, safety and work-life balance. However, the OECD does not rank countries by the Better Life Index. Instead, users are encouraged to assign and share their own weights for the topics to design a composite indicator that can express their preferences on the contribution of each topic to well-being. The aim of this paper is to present and discuss the benefit of doubt approach to the construction of a composite index of well-being based on the eleven topics. By this approach, we assign to each country individual weights for the topics that can emphasize the strengths of the country in people's material conditions and quality of life.

To solve this problem, the author worked out a new tool in the form of a modified production function (PF) with variable parameters, based on the hypothesis of the variability of the rate of economic growth due to technical progress. Using modified PF lets reduce to a common base year the source data and estimate the PF for non-homogeneity periods which have both the periods of growth and decline. In the analysis, interest is not represented by the average annual contribution of production factors to product growth, but by the direct contribution of variable factors to product growth. The same result can be achieved both due to the extensive growth of production factors, and due to their qualitative growth. The developed by author tool lets evaluate intensive production factors contribution to output increase and determine the efficiency of development of the national economy. Verification of developed approach is shown by the example of the economic development of the USA. The development of the economy of the U.S. was predominantly intensive.

However, certain schemes, algorithms, methods, models and, approaches to the analysis and assessment of financial risks still remain to be poorly developed. In this view, there is emerging need for the development of a mechanism which would allow assessing the existing financial risks based on the available information sources. The above-mentioned factors render the topic of the current work highly relevant. In the present work we define in detail the concept of financial risks and provide the classification of financial risks.

We report further the development of the integrated matrix assessment method to estimate the risks of financial equilibrium disturbance. We highlight the potential advantages and drawbacks of this method, describe the key steps in the development and implementation of the discussed matrix method, and justify the choice of the indicator system on which the method is based. The practical relevance of the work is determined by the versatility of the proposed matrix diagnostic analysis method which may be used both in financial risk management to forecast financial insolvency and assess the risk of bankruptcy and in audit to provide support for the continuity assumption when carrying out the analytical review procedures.
