Previous studies are divided on the value implication of D&O insurance: some argue for various benefits of being covered by D&O insurance, whereas others focus on the managerial opportunism stemming from being insured. In order to address whether D&O insurance increases firm value, we utilize a sample of quoted Korean companies from a period in which the disclosure of D&O insurance information was mandatory and there was a significant cross-sectional variation in the firms' coverage of D&O insurance. We find that controlling for the endogeneity of D&O insurance coverage, D&O insurance increases firm value compared to noninsured firms. We also find evidence that the increase in firm value is pronounced for firms with greater growth opportunities, which suggests that D&O insurance can help firms to better convert growth opportunities into higher firm value.","[Hwang, Joon Ho] Korea Univ, Sch Business, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Byungmo] Dankook Univ, Dept Business Adm, Yongin, South Korea",Korea University; Dankook University,"Kim, B (通讯作者)，Dankook Univ, Dept Business Adm, Yongin, South Korea.",joonhwang@korea.ac.kr; bmkim@dankook.ac.kr,,,National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government [NRF-2013S1A2A1A01033232],National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government,This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2013S1A2A1A01033232).,,90,25,26,9,94,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

Since asset returns have substantial commonality, absence of near-arbitrage opportunities implies that the stochastic discount factor can be represented as a function of a few dominant sources of return variation. As long as some arbitrageurs are present, this conclusion applies even in an economy in which all cross-sectional variation in expected returns is caused by sentiment.

Less is known about its effects on psychological well-being, especially in developing countries with agriculture-based economies. In this paper, we test whether extreme temperature and precipitation in India have an effect on self-reported depression symptoms, cognitive and sleep difficulties, and ability to cope with and control life. We use time and geographic variation in weather and show that hot weather in the previous year worsens psychological well-being among rural, but not urban, Indian adults. We examine potential mechanisms and show that the effect is largely driven by hot temperatures during the agricultural season and could be partly attributed to a reduction in agricultural production. We further provide suggestive evidence that the effects of weather shocks could be mitigated with poverty reduction programs such as India's National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. Poor mental health has been associated with low productivity and high healthcare expenditures and is a serious concern in India and many developing countries. The adverse impacts of climate change on rural, agriculture-based economies such as India are likely to increase over time. Given that nearly half of the global population lives in rural areas and is vulnerable to climate variability, understanding the effects of climate on psychological well-being and identifying potential resolutions is critical for insuring vulnerable populations and breaking the poverty cycle.

While conjectures that publications in lower-rated journals likely have a negative impact on such judgments are common, there have been virtually no direct tests of their validity. Our intent is to provide results from such a test, one that involved asking economists from 44 universities throughout the world to rate either a publication list with only higher-rated journals or a list with all of these but with additional publications in lower-rated journals. Our primary finding was that, holding other things constant, adding publications in lower-rated journals to what is typically considered a good publication record does have a significant negative impact on economists' judgments of the value of the author's contribution.

Using a small open-economy model with uninsurable idiosyncratic risk, this paper shows that a gradual decline of 12% in the quarterly inflation rate leads to an aggregate welfare gain of 0.40% in consumption equivalent terms. The poor gain less than the economy on aggregate, despite holding a more inflation-prone financial portfolio. This is because unequal cash holdings make inflation tax payments of the poor much smaller than those of the rich. When inflation tax revenues finance redistributive transfers that provide insurance, cross-sectional gains become even more dispersed.","[Sunel, Enes] Sunel & Sunel Law Firm, Istanbul, Turkey",,"Sunel, E (通讯作者)，Sunel & Sunel Law Firm, Istanbul, Turkey.",enessunel@gmail.com,"Sunel, Enes/GOP-0733-2022",,,,,,46,2,3,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

The general question we analyze concerns the effects of Schumpeterian competition between existing and candidate entrepreneurs on economic growth and innovation policy in this region. We perform four specific tasks. First, when the flow rate of innovation function for the existing entrepreneurs is strictly concave, we delineate the circumstances in which competition between existing and candidate entrepreneurs leads to a unique balanced growth path (BGP) equilibrium. Second, we examine whether it is possible for the BGP equilibrium to involve different levels of R&D expenditures by the existing entrepreneurs. Third, we show how the BGP equilibrium is altered when the flow rate of innovation function for the existing entrepreneurs is constant. Finally, we study the impact that taxes and subsidies on R&D by existing and candidate entrepreneurs have on R&D expenditures and regional economic growth.","[Batabyal, Amitrajeet A.] Rochester Inst Technol, Dept Econ, 92 Lomb Mem Dr, Rochester, NY 14623 USA; [Yoo, Seung Jick] Sookmyung Womens Univ, Grad Sch Int Serv, 100 Cheongpa Ro,47 Gill, Seoul, South Korea",Rochester Institute of Technology; Sookmyung Women's University,"Yoo, SJ (通讯作者)，Sookmyung Womens Univ, Grad Sch Int Serv, 100 Cheongpa Ro,47 Gill, Seoul, South Korea.",aabgsh@rit.edu; sjyoo@sookmyung.ac.kr,"García, Francisco/AAJ-5004-2021","Batabyal, Amitrajeet/0000-0001-7813-1519; YOO, SEUNG JICK/0009-0009-3188-1019",Charles Koch Foundation; Gosnell endowment at RIT; Soolanyung Women's University Research [1-1703-2022],Charles Koch Foundation; Gosnell endowment at RIT; Soolanyung Women's University Research,"For their helpful comments on a previous version of this paper, we thank the Editor Hamid Beladi, two anonymous reviewers, and session participants in the RSAI NARSC Annual Conference in Vancouver, Canada, in November 2017, and in the International Conference in Renmin University of China in Beijing, China, in December 2017.

This raises the question of whether promoting the non-farm sector is detrimental to the performance of the farm sector. Unfortunately, the evidence base in West Africa and the Sahel for this important policy question is thin. In this paper we identify the covariates of the farm households' decision to participate in off-farm self-employment in rural Niger. We estimate the effect of that decision on farm activity investment. We find that participating in off-farm self-employment is highly correlated with farm and non-farm factors. Participation in off-farm self-employment is linked to increased agricultural spending on crop and livestock inputs, but a lower propensity to hire labour. Our results suggest that policies to promote the non-farm sector can support the development of the agricultural sector in rural Niger. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In a monocentric city with a bottleneck at the entrance to the CBD, residents choose their commute departure time jointly with residential location and housing consumption. Commuters arrive at the bottleneck in sequence sorted by residential location, so that more distant residents arrive later. The socially optimal toll makes central residents commute earlier in the morning than they would without the toll, which in turn induces a city that is less dense in the center and more dense further out.

Further corroborating these inferences, we find greater improvement in value-added growth when (1) independent directors with industry-CEO experience (IDICEs) have experience in more similar industries; (2) they create more shareholder value as CEO; and (3) they are current CEOs. In addition, IDICEs contribute to value-added growth most when firm environments and characteristics are conducive for active board-management interaction; namely, when product markets are more competitive and dynamic, when outsiders can more easily acquire firm-specific information, and when firms are younger and smaller. Consistent with our inferences on how IDICEs contribute to value-added growth, firms growing faster, less successfully innovating, and/or under strong governance tend to be matched with IDICEs.","[Kang, Shinwoo] Sejong Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, E.

We demonstrate the usefulness of our framework by comparing quantitative results for our aggregate model with those of a related model that includes within-age-cohort heterogeneity through productivity differences. When we assess proposals to switch from the current tax and transfer system in the United States to a mandatory saving-for-retirement system with no payroll taxation, we find that the aggregate predictions for the two models are close.

Such insider employs a max-min choice mechanism, so that in any round of trading she selects as her market order that which maximizes her expected profits against those market beliefs which penalize her most. Her trading strategy is equivalent to that of a risk-averse insider who does not face any Knightian uncertain and possesses risk-sensitive recursive preferences. As she finds it optimal to trade more aggressively and reveal her private information at a faster pace than her risk-neutral (expected-profit maximizer) counterpart, we find that ambiguity-aversion is beneficial to the efficiency of the market.

Recent literature has attributed this phenomenon to the non-market behaviors of Chinese multinationals. In this study, however, we investigate whether allowing for a comprehensive consideration of market factors such as capital intensity and natural resources of host country in determining the location of Chinese OFDI, could overturn the puzzle. We revisited the relationship between host-country institutional quality and Chinese OFDI, by using a panel data of Chinese outward investment in 132 economies from 2003 to 2012. The results suggest that the so-called unique institutional risk pattern of Chinese OFDI is simply a statistical artefact but not a real phenomenon. Without exception, Chinese multinationals are prone to locate their investments in countries with high institutional quality, less economic development and more natural resources, which was motivated by higher investment return and access to cheaper resources.","[Yang, Jiao-Hui] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Int Sch Business & Finance, Zhuhai 519082, Peoples R China; [Wang, Wei] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Lingnan Coll, 135 Xinganxi Rd, Guangzhou 510295, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Kai-Li] Tunghai Univ, Dept Finance, 1727,Sec 4,Taiwan Blvd, Taichung 40704, Taiwan; [Yeh, Chung-Ying] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Finance, 250,Kuo Kuang Rd, Taichung 402, Taiwan",Sun Yat Sen University; Sun Yat Sen University; Tunghai University; National Chung Hsing University,"Wang, W (通讯作者)，Sun Yat Sen Univ, Lingnan Coll, 135 Xinganxi Rd, Guangzhou 510295, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",yangjiaoh@mail.sysu.edu.cn; wangw48@mail.sysu.edu.cn; kaiwang@thu.edu.tw; cyyeh1@dragon.nchu.edu.tw,"Wang, Wei/J-4000-2016; Wang, Wei/JAN-7127-2023","Wang, Wei/0000-0002-5273-3332;",National Social Science Foundation of China [16ZDA042],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),"We are grateful for helpful comments and suggestions by the participants at the 2016 Joint Annual Meeting of Central Taiwan Finance Association (CTFA)/Financial Engineering Association of Taiwan (FEAT) (22 May 2016, Taichung, Taiwan).

This debate is still crucial for present day Egypt, a country facing major challenges, including food security, agriculture modernization, employment generation, and land fragmentation due to dramatic population growth. In this context, policy makers are always seeking the best land allocation system for these new lands. This paper analyzes the land tenure and land use dynamics of farmers' settlements during a program of land reclamation (from 1960 to 2010) in the Western Desert of the Nile Delta. The objective is to describe the land development paths of farm settlement and to identify promising dynamics by cross-referencing the farmers' stories and their livelihood achievements. To accomplish that, we conducted household surveys and interviews to learn the life stories' of 175 family farms. Our study finds that, beyond the rules and institutions that fixed the land tenure regimes and its distribution in these new lands, settlers have found different ways to hold on and secure their land farm, even if the unequal land distribution still structure the population. The results highlight also the dynamism of small-scale settlers, regarding livelihood diversification, to face the challenges of these desert environments. In addition, the dual-purpose system embedded in mixed crop-livestock systems can contribute to settlers' livelihood security. These realities confound the unchanged rhetoric of government and this calls for more social consideration of these new rural spaces based on a combination of heterogeneous networks off relationships and knowledge. The apparent gap between the macro- and micro-perspectives analyses also requires multi-scale assessments. Finally, the life-story method proves to be a complementary and useful approach to integrate the livelihood representation and dynamic. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper analyzes monthly foreign tourist arrivals into Brazil between 2003 and 2015 and finds that the 2014 FIFA World Cup increased foreign tourism by roughly 1 million visitors. This number far exceeded expectations, but we show that roughly a quarter of this increase in foreign tourism was caused by the fortuitous advancement of Argentina's national team, and potential hosts should not count on the event to consistently produce out-sized tourism figures.

India, where de facto responsibility for the power sector rests with subnational (state) governments, provides a useful laboratory to examine why. The state of West Bengal provides an example of public sector reform as an alternative to the so-called World Bank template for electricity liberalization, and a lens on the political preconditions for reform success. Drawing on 30 elite interviews in 2016 alongside comparative evidence from other Indian states, this article documents the reform design and assesses its success. West Bengal's reforms aimed at internally strengthening the utility against political interference. The study finds that this reform model delivered initial performance among the best of any Indian utility, and that successful reforms in several other states were also more statist than often recognized. However, longer-term sustainability remains challenging. While weak rural lobbies had some effect, the study explains this trajectory as the result of the transition from one-party dominance to intensified party-political competition, a finding that resonates with evidence from other Indian states. In contrast to influential political theories developed in the Global North, this suggests that party-political competition does not make Indian politicians more likely to deliver public services, but rather leads to short-termism and political capture of utilities. Conversely, under some conditions one-party dominance can encourage longer-term reforms. The study thus assesses the promise and limits of public sector reforms as an alternative to liberalization, and suggests how electoral competition can influence development priorities in Indian states.

However, at the same time the few existing studies have observed higher levels of long-distance travel and particularly air travel in the same densely built parts of urban regions. This may lead to GHG emissions reduction in local travel offset by the concomitant increase in long-distance travel. With this study we aim to identify the main factors involved in differences in local, national and long-distance travel patterns and the resulting GHG emissions, with a special focus on the role of the different urban zones in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area (HMA) in Finland. We used a softGIS survey to collect data on the personal travel of young adults living in HMA. SoftGIS methodology provides the opportunity to obtain detailed spatial data on participants' residential locations, travel destinations, and destination characteristics such as travel modes, frequencies and trip purposes. Special attention was paid to national and international trips, for which data were collected over 12 months, a period long enough to capture actual travel patterns. GHG emissions were assessed with a wide scope life cycle assessment (LCA) approach, including vehicles and infrastructure, and the results were elaborated with a two-part regression model on participation in travel and amount of GHG emissions. The study found that the residential location was associated with travel emissions on all scales, and independently from major socioeconomic characteristics. Residents of centrally located and densely built urban zones have on average lower emissions from local travel but higher emissions from international travel than residents of car oriented suburban zones, and the association holds true after controlling for income, education level and household type. Differences in emissions from local travel between most central and most suburban zones were almost completely offset by differences in emissions from international travel. International long-distance trips were a dominant source of travel -related GHG emissions in all urban zones, particularly due to plane flights.","[Czepkiewicz, Michal; Ottelin, Juudit; Ala-Mantila, Sanna; Heinonen, Jukka] Univ Iceland, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, VR 2,Hjaroarhaga 6, IS-107 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Ottelin, Juudit; Ala-Mantila, Sanna; Hasanzadeh, Kamyar; Kytta, Marketta] Aalto Univ, Dept Built Environm, Helsinki, Finland; [Czepkiewicz, Michal] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Inst Geoecol & Geoinformat, Poznan, Poland",University of Iceland; Aalto University; Adam Mickiewicz University,"Czepkiewicz, M (通讯作者)，Univ Iceland, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, VR 2,Hjaroarhaga 6, IS-107 Reykjavik, Iceland.",mcz@hi.is,"Hasanzadeh, Kamyar/AAJ-3649-2020; Czepkiewicz, Michał/AAD-6886-2020; Ottelin, Juudit/AAA-8887-2019; Heinonen, Jukka/K-6952-2015","Hasanzadeh, Kamyar/0000-0002-0705-7662; Czepkiewicz, Michał/0000-0001-7079-1723; Ottelin, Juudit/0000-0003-0878-5108; Ala-Mantila, Sanna/0000-0002-5140-7973; Heinonen, Jukka/0000-0002-7298-4999",University of Iceland Research Fund,University of Iceland Research Fund,The research presented in the article was funded by the University of Iceland Research Fund and the Marketta Kytta's tenure funding.,,62,43,43,3,48,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

We analyze spatial behavior of heterosexual married couples in Southern California based on the 2012 California Household Travel Survey and find that households living in areas with greater regional accessibility and neighborhood walkability have smaller, more centered, and more compact activity spaces overall compared to households in less compact areas, and that married pairs living in more accessible areas have greater equality in the size and centeredness of their activity spaces. We account for residential selection bias in our multivariate analysis and find that a ten unit increase in near-residence Walk Score was associated with a 12-18% decrease in activity space size, a 6-8% decrease in residential distancing, and a 12-13% increase in spatial concentration for both men and women. Men and women, however, had significantly different activity space behaviors regardless of their neighborhood type. Compared to women, men on average had larger activity spaces and conducted their activities farther from home. Overall, results support our hypothesis that compact development provides married couples greater flexibility in how they divide household out-of-home activities by making destinations more convenient and lowering the overall spatial fixity of these activities. Future research and planning efforts should carefully consider which aspects of compact, accessible development are most effective for a given local context.","[Lo, A.

The model is tractable and delivers closed forms for all equilibrium quantities. The study shows that money illusion leads the nominal shock risk to generate spillover effects on the real side of the economy and affects all equilibrium quantities, even without inflation disagreement. We find that bond yields increase, but the stock price decreases, as money illusion increases. Bond yield and stock price volatilities increase with fundamental disagreement, while the latter decreases with inflation disagreement. We also discover that the stock risk premium is inverse-U shaped as inflation disagreement increases. Moreover, we find that the optimistic investor holds positions in real bonds and stocks, and shorts the nominal bond to hedge against the risk of market changes, which is in line with the pessimistic investor's beliefs.","[Ma, Chaoqun; Wang, Hailong; Cheng, Fengchao; Hu, Duni] Hunan Univ, Business Sch, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China",Hunan University,"Wang, HL (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ, Business Sch, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China.",hailong@hnu.edu.cn,"Wang, Hailong/C-2641-2011","Wang, Hailong/0000-0002-6107-5095","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71431008, 71521061]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),We are particularly grateful to the anonymous referees for their insightful suggestions and comments.

Hawaii's relatively minor role as a winter nursery changed in the late 1990s after the seed corn industry was reshaped by a series of techno-scientific innovations and organizational restructuring. We draw attention to a molecular breeding technique called marker-assisted selection (MAS) that accelerates crop improvement cycles by making parent lines selection more efficient and by taking advantage of extra growing seasons in tropical locations such as Hawaii. Additionally, we argue that a wider application of MAS enhances seed firms' geographical flexibility, allowing them to capitalize on the institutional rents of Hawaii's agrarian politics and overcome challenges that might emerge in the future.","[Schrager, Benjamin; Suryanata, Krisnawati] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Geog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Schrager, B (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Geog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",schrager@hawaii.edu,,"Schrager, Benjamin/0000-0002-6174-6370; Suryanata, Krisnawati/0000-0003-4643-8385",,,,,76,8,8,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

This has led to increased car ownership and extensive car usage in the country as well as rapid and uncontrolled land usage and expansion of urban areas. The proposed study aims at determining individual and alternative-specific variables that influence citizens' choice of the transportation mode for commuting trips. Data used in the proposed analysis were obtained by means of a computer-assisted telephonic interview survey conducted in the metropolitan area of Cluj-Napoca in July 2015. The one-time retrospective survey assumed an alternative ticketing policy for public transport, and subsequently, a methodology for simultaneously evaluating revealed-preference and stated-intentions mode choices was adopted to evaluate the willingness of commuters to adopt such a policy. As no such study had previously been performed in Romania, this work serves to fill a void in available literature by revealing the role of demographic, socioeconomic, and attitudinal characteristics along with transport supply and built environment in explaining commuting patterns in the country. As age influences the desires and priorities concerning travel behavior, the proposed study sheds light on how generational differences serve to influence urban transport towards sustainability through non-coercive interventions in post-communist transitional societies.","[Tosa, Cristian] Tech Univ Cluj Napoca, Fac Civil Engn, 72-74 Observ Str, Cluj Napoca 400363, Romania; [Sato, Hitomi; Morikawa, Takayuki] Nagoya Univ, Inst Innovat Future Soc, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648603, Japan; [Miwa, Tomio] Inst Mat & Syst Sustainabil, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648603, Japan",Technical University of Cluj Napoca; Nagoya University,"Tosa, C (通讯作者)，Fac Constructii, 72-74 Observ Str, Cluj Napoca 4700363, Romania.",cristian.tosa@infra.utcluj.ro,"Miwa, Tomio/I-6084-2014; Tosa, Cristian/AAD-6679-2022; Sato, Hitomi/I-6357-2014; Toșa, Cristian/I-4246-2017","Miwa, Tomio/0000-0001-9385-7844; Tosa, Cristian/0000-0003-0986-4131; Sato, Hitomi/0000-0001-5162-7995","KAKENHI from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [2604707, 15F14707]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15F14707] Funding Source: KAKEN","KAKENHI from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",The author acknowledges financial support from the KAKENHI Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (number 2604707 and 15F14707) received from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).

However, the ways investors evaluate and react to such behaviors are less clear. By investigating stock market reactions to three regulatory changes related to share pledging in Taiwan, this study shows that firms whose directors make share pledges experience significantly higher stock returns around these events, compared with those without such directors. Institutional investors increase their shareholdings of pledging (i.e., less compliant) firms after the passage of the 2011 amendment to the Company Act, indicating that reduced agency problems increase institutions' willingness to hold shares of less compliant firms. The results for stock trading and firm valuation also are more significant for firms with controlling shareholders, which are more likely to be expropriated. These results are consistent with the alignment hypothesis, in which firms that are less compliant with the rules benefit more from legislative changes. They also offer important implications, by showing how adjusting legal regulations can help improve investor protections. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

There are studies arguing that finance can facilitate growth and increase stability. However, the recent global financial crisis has led some to argue that finance can decrease stability and lead to more crises. This paper constructs a non-monotonic framework of quantity of finance (measured by leverage) and financial crisis and decomposes leverage into fundamental and excess components. Using cross-country level data, the empirical results confirms that it is excess leverage, rather than fundamental leverage, that results in the increase of probability of financial crisis. Further empirical results show that excess leverage leads to a higher probability of currency crisis, asset price collapse, and banking crisis, while fundamental leverage helps alleviates the crises. This paper reconciles the two contrasting views of the relationship between finance and economic development and provides strong policy implication to pay special attention to the sudden increase of leverage, which is probably excessive, rather than fundamental leverage.","[Zhang, Xun; He, Zongyue; Zhu, Jiali] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Stat, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xun] Shanghai Finance Inst, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Li, Jing] Chongqing Technol & Business Univ, Natl Res Ctr Upper Yangtze River, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Li, Jing] Chongqing Technol & Business Univ, Sch Econ, Chongqing, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University; Chongqing Technology & Business University; Chongqing Technology & Business University,"Li, J (通讯作者)，Chongqing Technol & Business Univ, Natl Res Ctr Upper Yangtze River, Chongqing, Peoples R China.",zhangxun@bnu.edu.cn; ljfcm@163.com,"feng, chen/JLM-8296-2023; Wang, Hao/ABB-8923-2020; ZHU, JIALI/JNE-3065-2023","Wang, Hao/0000-0001-9109-6017;",,,,,38,2,2,2,24,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1062-9408,1879-0860,,N AM J ECON FINANC,N.

This article argues that centralizing the budget process raises the levels of taxation by limiting the ability of individual government officials to veto tax increases in line with common-pool-problem arguments regarding public finances. Using detailed data on budgetary procedures from 15 EU countries, the empirical analysis shows that greater centralization of the budget process increases taxation as a share of GDP and that both the type of budget centralization and level of government fractionalization matter for the size of this effect. The results suggest that further centralizing the budget process limits government debt and deficits by increasing public revenues as well as constraining public spending.","[Aaskoven, Lasse] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Polit Sci, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Aaskoven, L (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Polit Sci, Copenhagen, Denmark.",lasse.aaskoven@ifs.ku.dk,,"Aaskoven, Lasse/0000-0001-5489-9785",,,,,21,2,2,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,MAR,2018,174.0,3-4,,,,,335,349,,10.1007/s11127-018-0507-7,0.0,,,15,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,FW2PM,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000425146200008,0

Population aging can be discussed from different perspectives, exploring various challenges associated with it. The authors examined marketing communications from the point of view of a target group, over age 55. The main objective of this study was to find out which marketing communication tools those over age 55 prefer, including selected aspects of printed advertising. At the same time, it was examined whether there is a different gender perspective on this issue. To find out answers to the main question of this study, we conducted quantitative research by using a questionnaire survey among the population over age 55 living in the Czech Republic (Zlin Region). The results of this study were compared with the results of a previous study conducted in 2014, focusing on the marketing communication tools targeted at the 55+ group from the point of view of companies. The research results have shown that the target groups' most effective (preferred) marketing communication tools are printed materials (leaflets and catalogues), sales promotions, competitions, club memberships, gifts, fairs, markets and fairs, and last but not least, newspapers and magazines. Based on the results, it can be said that these tools, in comparison with others, contain sufficient information that the customer can read and think about, save, and eventually return to them. At the same time, they are tools that bring a certain benefit or advantage to the customer, which can then be verified in person. If the results are compared from a gender perspective, different preferences were revealed in the selection of marketing communication tools. There were also different views on some selected aspects of printed materials. These findings can be implemented by companies and organizations in their marketing campaigns, allowing them to better reach the target group of people over age 55. Focusing on new markets, including a new, forward-looking target group, can give companies a competitive edge.","[Baresova, Petra; Horakova, Monika; Urbanek, Tomas] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Baresová, P (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic.",baresova@utb.cz; mhorakova@utb.cz; turbanek@utb.cz,"Urbanek, Tomas/HMP-5380-2023; Urbanek, Tomas/B-5165-2015","Urbanek, Tomas/0000-0002-6307-2824;",,,,,42,2,3,1,19,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

Despite quantitative importance in explaining business cycles, a comovement problem emerges because the shocks generate intertemporal substitution effects away from consumption toward investment. This paper resolves the problem by extending the standard sticky-price model to a two-sector model with consumer durable services. When durable goods are used as investment in capital and consumer durables, positive capital investment shocks also generate intratemporal substitution effects away from consumer durable services toward nondurable consumption that dominates intertemporal effects. Consequently, consumption increases, and the comovement problem is resolved.","[Chen, Been-Lon] Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Liao, Shian-Yu] Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Int Business, Taoyuan, Taiwan",Academia Sinica - Taiwan; Chung Yuan Christian University,"Chen, BL (通讯作者)，Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei, Taiwan.",bchen@econ.sinica.edu.tw; syliao@cycu.edu.tw,,"Liao, Shian-Yu/0000-0002-6883-1826",,,,,51,4,4,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

These high returns often need to be balanced by the high liquidity costs of trading in illiquid emerging markets. Several studies have shown that central bank and government policies are significant determinants of market liquidity. We investigate the influence of monetary and fiscal policy variables on the market and firm level liquidity of eight emerging stock markets of Asia. Using four different (il)liquidity measures and nine macroeconomic variables, we find that changes in the money supply, government expenditure and private borrowing significantly affect stock market liquidity. Illiquidity is also strongly affected by the bank rate, short-term interest rate and government borrowing. We demonstrate that 'crowding out' and 'cost of funds' effects exist in these markets. Other major findings are that some markets are more sensitive to local macroeconomic news than world factors, the impact on size based portfolios largely depends on the instruments used by the central banks and government, the liquidity of the manufacturing sector is affected by changes in any policy variables, financial institutions are only influenced by monetary policy variables, and the service sector is least affected.

It finds that the growth in cross-border positions in relation to world GDP has come to a halt. This reflects much weaker capital flows to and from advanced economies, with diminished cross-border banking activity, and an increase in the weight of emerging economies in global GDP, as these economies have lower external assets and liabilities than advanced economies. Cross-border FDI positions have continued to expand, unlike positions in portfolio instruments and other investment. This expansion reflects primarily positions vis-a-vis financial centers, suggesting that the complexity of the corporate structure of large multinational corporations is playing an important role. The paper also explores the cross-country drivers of foreign ownership of domestic debt securities, highlighting in particular the role of the euro debt crisis in explaining its evolution.","[Lane, Philip R.] Cent Bank Ireland, Dublin, Ireland; [Lane, Philip R.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; [Lane, Philip R.; Milesi-Ferretti, Gian Maria] London Based Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England; [Milesi-Ferretti, Gian Maria] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",European Central Bank; Central Bank of Ireland; Trinity College Dublin; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; International Monetary Fund,"Milesi-Ferretti, GM (通讯作者)，London Based Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England.;Milesi-Ferretti, GM (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",governor@centralbank.ie; gmilesiferretti@imf.org,,,Irish Research Council,"Irish Research Council(Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology)","We are very grateful to our discussants Linda Tesar, Anne-Laure Delatte, and Jana Riedel, and to Serkan Arslanalp, Thomas Elkjaer, Thornton Matheson, Victoria Perry, Neeltje Van Horen, two anonymous referees, participants to the IMF's 2016 Annual Research Conference, the Jean Monnet Workshop on Financial Globalization and Its Spillovers, and seminars at the Bank of England, the Banque de France, the Bank of Italy, and France Strategie for useful comments.

During this time, the presence of a main bank has been weakened, the ownership of institutional investors has rapidly increased, and independent outside directors have been introduced in many firms. We find that top executive turnover sensitivity to corporate performance has not changed despite skepticism on corporate governance of Japanese firms. On the other hand, there is a shift from return on assets (ROA) to return on equity (ROE) and stock returns as performance indicators that turnover is most sensitive to. We also examine possible sources of this change. We find that foreign institutional investors strengthen the turnover sensitivity to ROE after banking crisis when their shareholding has dramatically increased. This result allows us to interpret that they began to play a disciplinary role. In contrast, we do not find that independent outside directors have any significant effect of enhancing turnover sensitivity to ROE, unless a firm appointed independent outside directors more than three. While the scope of the main bank's authority has substantially contracted, strong ties with main banks increase turnover sensitivity in the more recent period, indicating that main banks continue to perform a certain role in disciplining management.","[Miyajima, Hideaki; Ogawa, Ryo] Waseda Univ, Grad Sch Commerce, Shinju Ku, 1-6-1 Nishi Waseda, Tokyo 1698050, Japan; [Saito, Takuji] Keio Univ, Grad Sch Business Adm, Kohoku Ku, 4-1-1 Hiyoshi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2238526, Japan",Waseda University; Keio University,"Miyajima, H (通讯作者)，Waseda Univ, Grad Sch Commerce, Shinju Ku, 1-6-1 Nishi Waseda, Tokyo 1698050, Japan.",miyajima@waseda.jp; ryo.ogawa@aoni.waseda.jp; tsaito@kbs.keio.ac.jp,,,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology research grant MEXT KAKENHI [15H01958, 25780207]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS); JSPS; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25780207, 15H01958, 17K03810, 16K17148, 15H03375] Funding Source: KAKEN","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology research grant MEXT KAKENHI; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We are grateful for comments from participants at the RIETI, Taiwan National University, Hitotsubashi University, NBER-CEPR-TCER conference, and Development Bank of Japan (DBJ) academic seminars.

In this paper, we empirically analyse, for the whole banking sector as well as for selected categories of banks, whether the reduction in loan volume was supply-side-driven. The results suggest that a credit crunch did not occur in Germany during the recent economic crisis. Apart from substantial policy interventions, our results offer two explanations: First, excess demand for loans dropped, as firms reverted to other external financing instruments, particularly industrial bonds. Second, those banks operating at the regional level only were not affected by the crisis. In this regard, the three-pillar structure of the German banking system contributed to stable credit financing, as banks differ in their operating behaviours and in their customers.","[Schmidt, Torsten; Zwick, Lina] RWI Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany",RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Zwick, L (通讯作者)，RWI Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany.",lina.zwick@rwi-essen.de,,,,,,,49,2,3,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

Downward wage rigidity has been considered as a critical determinant of various macroeconomic and financial phenomena. This study examines the effect of a country's wage rigidity on its sovereign credit rating after measuring downward wage rigidities based on a regime-switching model. The results indicate that greater wage rigidity induces lower sovereign credit rating. We find that wage rigidity amplifies cash flow fluctuations and magnified cash flow volatility negatively affects sovereign credit rating. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The optimal contract may insulate managers from the risk of growth-induced dismissal after periods of good performance.

The reforms are often cast as an iconic moment of neoliberal deregulation and a key episode in the globalization of financial markets. Such accounts stress that the state played an active role in constructing the reforms and upholding the global market relations they produced, yet they remain unclear about the state's direct interest in pursuing financial market liberalization. The article contends that domestic concerns over sovereign debt management were central to the state's pursuit of regulatory change. The Big Bang reforms greatly expanded the size and liquidity of the market for British sovereign debt. This empowered the state, improving its capacity to conduct monetary policy and to raise finance on better terms.

We empirically examine the impact of complete analysts' coverage termination on stocks' liquidity, price discovery, and insider trading profitability. Termination leads to deteriorating liquidity and price efficiency, more informed trading, and higher profitability of insider trades. The magnitude of these effects depends on the strength of insiders' ownership and on management's decision whether to improve the firm's information environment after coverage termination. Institutional investors alleviate, but do not eliminate, the negative effects of termination.","[Ellul, Andrew] Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Ellul, Andrew] Univ Naples Federico II, Ctr Studies Econ & Finance, Naples, Italy; [Ellul, Andrew] European Corp Governance Inst, Brussels, Belgium; [Panayides, Marios] Univ Pittsburgh, Katz Grad Sch Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; IU Kelley School of Business; University of Naples Federico II; European Corporate Governance Institute; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Ellul, A (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.;Ellul, A (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, Ctr Studies Econ & Finance, Naples, Italy.;Ellul, A (通讯作者)，European Corp Governance Inst, Brussels, Belgium.",anellul@indiana.edu; mpanayides@katz.pitt.edu,,,,,,,53,47,48,5,45,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

Regression results based on six regions with 141 countries reveal that although the role of foreign (global or regional) saving has increased over time, there are regional differences: domestic saving is the major source of investment financing in North America with an increasing role of regional and global savings over time, while regional saving is the main source in Europe. Global saving has been the main source of investment financing in other regions where domestic and regional financial markets are not well developed. However, the role of regional saving has significantly increased in recent years in the Asia-Pacific and in Latin America. Regionalism such as financial and monetary cooperation is likely to have increased the role of regional saving.","[Kim, Soyoung] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, 599 Gwanak Ro, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Sunghyun] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Choi, Yoonseok] Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Korea University,"Kim, S (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",soyoungkim@snu.ac.kr; shenrykim@skku.edu; yoonchoi3@korea.edu,,"Choi, Yoonseok/0000-0003-4980-5101; Kim, Sunghyun/0000-0002-9326-1028",Korea Research Foundation Grant - Korean Government [NRF-2014S1A5B8060964],Korea Research Foundation Grant - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government),This work is supported by the Korea Research Foundation Grant funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2014S1A5B8060964).,,37,3,3,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

We argue that the act of growth option exercise decreases information asymmetry about the firm, which in turn reduces the relative cost of issuing information-sensitive securities such as equity. We show that leverage is negatively correlated with unexpected capital expenditure, our proxy for growth option conversion. The negative relationship becomes stronger when the information environment of a firm deteriorates following a reduction in analyst coverage after a brokerage house merger.

Our dataset is from the 2011, 2013, and 2015 results of the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprise Survey in Viet Nam. Using the Heckman technique to control for sample selection bias, the estimates do not provide evidence for discrimination against female-owned enterprises in the formal lending market. Specifically, female entrepreneurs have a higher probability of getting a loan and they pay lower interest rates in comparison with male entrepreneurs. No discrimination in formal credit markets may arise from the preference for informal loans over formal loans as entrepreneurs tend to borrow informal loans before applying for formal ones. Further analysis shows that social capital could facilitate loan applications: firms that have a closer relationship with government officials and other business people can get loans of longer duration.

Our panel data estimation results support the thesis that art experts have positive and significant impact on high-skilled experts and that these individuals flock where art experts are. We also find that regional per capita income and employment have positive and robust effect on the distribution of high-skilled professionals. The positive effects suggest that the distribution of the high-skilled labor force is a reflection of economic and non-economic factors.","[Tiruneh, Esubalew Alehegn] Cleveland State Univ, Dept Econ, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA; [Sacchetti, Silvia] Univ Trento, Dept Sociol & Social Res, Trento, Italy; [Tortia, Ermanno] Univ Trento, Dept Econ & Management, Trento, Italy",University System of Ohio; Cleveland State University; University of Trento; University of Trento,"Sacchetti, S (通讯作者)，Univ Trento, Dept Sociol & Social Res, Trento, Italy.",silvia.sacchetti@unitn.it,"Sacchetti, Silvia/A-5533-2009","Sacchetti, Silvia/0000-0002-5662-2074; Tortia, Ermanno/0000-0002-2138-1119",,,,,51,5,5,1,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1024-5294,1477-2221,,COMPET CHANG,Compet.

Their relationship-based supply chain worked for a family firm, but will this approach continue to work as they expand rapidly? A disruption in their egg supply exposed the firm to risks they never anticipated. Now, they are rethinking their entire supply chain, including their most important raw material: flour. How can they strategically manage their raw material needs while sustaining double-digit growth? How do they identify and mitigate risks in their chain?

The market risks are often underestimated but even a flexible response to the changes is not able to turn the negative consequences of their influence. The companies can suffer financial losses and can lose their competitiveness. The SMEs create 99.9 % of the overall number of the entrepreneurial subjects in Slovakia. This was the reason why we realised a questionnaire research aimed at the risk management in the Slovak SMEs in 2017. Based on the research results we worked out an analysis of the market risk sources and assessed the dependence of the market risks on the company size and the duration of doing business through the dispersion analysis by using the quantitative statistical tools. The results confirmed there was a certain rate of dependence between the intensity of the perceived market risks of the SMEs in dependence on the duration of doing business and there was also dependence between the market risk intensity the SMEs feel and the company size. For the market crisis to be effectively managed, it is important to define the risk management process exactly, not only from the point of view of the tools and methods but also to define exactly not only the responsibility of the company owners and managers but also that of the particular employees in the risk management area.","[Buganova, Katarina; Hudakova, Maria; Masar, Matej] Univ Zilina, Fac Secur Engn, Zilina, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Buganova, K (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Secur Engn, Zilina, Slovakia.",Katarina.Buganova@fbi.uniza.sk; Maria.Hudakova@fbi.uniza.sk; Matej.Masar@fbi.uniza.sk,"Masár, Matej/P-2763-2019; Buganova, Katarina/AAD-5278-2020; Masár, Matej/A-6373-2019; Hudakova, Maria/S-6206-2017","Buganova, Katarina/0000-0002-0596-5229; Masár, Matej/0000-0003-4189-2984; Hudakova, Maria/0000-0002-0756-0962",Scientific Grant Agency: The project VEGA [1/0560/16]; KEGA [030ZU4/2018],Scientific Grant Agency: The project VEGA; KEGA,Publication of this paper was supported by the Scientific Grant Agency: The project VEGA No. 1/0560/16 - Risk Management of Small and Medium Sized Enterprises in Slovakia as Prevention of Company Crises.

In this framework, a particular field is constituted by luxury items, such as wine. Wine is particularly suitable to marketing effects, both extrinsic (label) and intrinsic features (volatile composition and color) lead to the constitution of the experienced value, and the analysis of the contribution of olfaction to the process of tasting is fundamental in order to study flavor perception. Scope of the present study was to investigate the reaction to the smell and the gustation of the wine, with and without the olfactory contribution, through an electroencephalographic index, assumed as an indicator of approach or withdrawal (AW) motivation, and an autonomic index (emotional index-EI), deriving from the matching of heart rate and galvanic skin response activity. Results of this pilot research showed a statistically significant increase of the EI values in correspondence with wine-smelling phase in comparison with the other two phases (p < 0.01) and a trend of major avoidance attitude in correspondence with wine tasting with the olfactory component in comparison with the other two conditions. This result could be explained by the lack of specific subjects' expertise. Present data suggest a synergic action exerted by olfaction and gustation sensory modalities, where manipulation could be further studied so to investigate emotional and cognitive aspects of wine tasting experience.","[Cherubino, Patrizia; Cartocci, Giulia; Modica, Enrica; Rossi, Dario; Babiloni, Fabio] Sapienza Univ, Dept Mol Med, Viale Regina Elena 291, I-00161 Rome, Italy; [Cherubino, Patrizia; Cartocci, Giulia; Modica, Enrica; Rossi, Dario; Mancini, Marco; Trettel, Arianna; Babiloni, Fabio] BrainSigns Srl, Via Sesto Celere 7-C, I-00152 Rome, Italy; [Babiloni, Fabio] Hangzhou Dianzi Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Sapienza University Rome; Hangzhou Dianzi University,"Cherubino, P (通讯作者)，Sapienza Univ, Dept Mol Med, Viale Regina Elena 291, I-00161 Rome, Italy.",patrizia.cherubino@brainsigns.com; giulia.cartocci@uniroma1.it; enrica.modica@uniroma1.it; dario.rossi@uniroma1.it; marco.mancini@brainsigns.com; arianna.trettel@brainsigns.com; fabio.babiloni@uniroma1.it,,"Cherubino, Patrizia/0000-0001-7669-5855","Fondazione Banfi, Montalcino, Italy","Fondazione Banfi, Montalcino, Italy","This work was partially done under a grant agreement by the Fondazione Banfi, Montalcino, Italy, accorded to F.B. for the study of the neurometric signature of the wine tasting.",,46,3,3,4,20,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-99187-0; 978-3-319-99186-3,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,199,209,,10.1007/978-3-319-99187-0_15,0.0,,,11,Behavioral Sciences; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Behavioral Sciences; Business & Economics,BM1WR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000460629400015,0

To better understand consumers' financial behavior, economic surveys such as the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) ask participants to report expectations about the stock market. However, readability statistics suggest that the HRS' stock market expectations questions use relatively complex wording, which may contribute to their relatively high rates of missing responses. Here, the authors build on survey design research to improve the readability of these questions. In 2 experiments using national online panels, they test whether revising stock market expectation questions to reduce their difficulty affects respondents' (1) survey experience, as measured by percent of missing answers and ratings of question clarity and difficulty, and (2) response validity, as assessed by respondents' confidence in their answer and comparisons between expectations and stock market outcomes. In both studies, the authors' revisions improved survey experience. Unfortunately, revisions also decreased the perceived (Study 1) and actual (Study 2) validity of responses.

The problem has raised during and after the financial crisis, when despite an increase in the number and severity of operational risk events, capital requirements for operational risk remained stable or even fell for the standardized approaches.

Previous studies have examined the effectiveness of individual coping strategies in mitigating the impact of adverse weather shocks, but no study to date has presented a comprehensive evaluation of alternative coping strategies. We employ household panel data spanning 15 years to estimate the impact of weather shocks on consumption and poverty dynamics in rural Ethiopia, along with the effectiveness of household coping strategies in alleviating the impact of shocks. We find that rainfall increases are positively associated with per adult equivalent consumption, while high temperatures are negatively associated with consumption. In terms of household coping strategies, formal social safety net transfers mitigate the impact of adverse rainfall shocks on consumption and off-farm employment mitigates the impact of high-temperature shocks. Simulations suggest that rainfall shocks and formal social safety net transfers significantly influence household poverty dynamics. By contrast, high-temperature shocks and off-farm employment have less impact on poverty dynamics. The results highlight the need for social protection programs that support existing household coping strategies and that can rapidly respond to weather shocks. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

It estimates the causal effect of parental education, parental time with children, and parental income during early childhood on the educational outcomes of children. Estimating the causal effects of time with children, income, and parental education is challenging because parental time with children is usually unavailable in many datasets and because of the problem of endogeneity of parental income, time with children, and education. The authors, therefore, use an instrumental variables approach to estimate the causal effects. They find that once they account for the parental time input with children, parental income during the first five years is no longer statistically significant. The parental time investments of both parents in early childhood are each statistically and quantitatively significant determinants of the educational outcomes of children.","[Gayle, George-Levi; Golan, Limor] Washington Univ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Gayle, George-Levi; Golan, Limor] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA; [Soytas, Mehmet A.] Ozyegin Univ, Istanbul, Turkey",Washington University (WUSTL); Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; Ozyegin University,"Gayle, GL (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.;Gayle, GL (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA.",,"Soytas, Mehmet Ali/L-7687-2019","Soytas, Mehmet Ali/0000-0001-5839-6069",,,,,15,4,5,8,33,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

In this study, by analyzing the response mechanism of slopes in South China to heavy rainfall, the slope unit was selected as the basic unit for early warning, and the concept of slope physical mechanism model (SINMAP) was used for reference and expansion. Through the introduction of heavy rainfall impact coefficients and coupled hydrological models and landslide stability analysis models, Shallow landslide warning model suitable for the geological environment in South China was established. Taking Song gang River as a case, an early warning process calculation was carried out. The results show that the model calculation process is suitable for the small watershed area and the calculation results of the model are ideal. Construct a landslide space early warning model and explore the critical rainfall threshold for inducing landslides to provide a scientific basis for warning and prevention of landslide hazards.","[Gong, Qinghua; Wang, Jun; Yuan, Shaoxiong; Chen, Jun] Guangdong Open Lab Geospatial Informat Technol &, Guangzhou 510070, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Gong, Qinghua; Wang, Jun; Yuan, Shaoxiong; Chen, Jun] Guangzhou Inst Geog, Guangzhou 510070, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Junxiang] Huangshan Univ, Tourism Coll, Huangshan 245021, Peoples R China","Guangdong Academy of Sciences; Guangzhou Institute of Geography, Guangdong Academy of Sciences; Huangshan University","Gong, QH (通讯作者)，Guangdong Open Lab Geospatial Informat Technol &, Guangzhou 510070, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;Gong, QH (通讯作者)，Guangzhou Inst Geog, Guangzhou 510070, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",,,,"Chinese National Natural Science Foundation [41671506]; GDAS' Special Project of Science and Technology Development [2017GDASCX-0803, 2017GDASCX-0101]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2018A030310469]; Science and Technology Plan Projects of Guangzhou [201804010126, 201803030025]",Chinese National Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); GDAS' Special Project of Science and Technology Development; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); Science and Technology Plan Projects of Guangzhou,"This paper is supported by Chinese National Natural Science Foundation (41671506) and GDAS' Special Project of Science and Technology Development (2017GDASCX-0803, 2017GDASCX-0101),.

This recent (re)appreciation of the role of nutrition as a fundamental element of development policy and a driver of economic growth generates the need for new analytical tools to determine the potential nutritional gains of development programmes and policies as well as the costs of not acting on nutrition imperatives in multisectoral public policy initiatives. This shifts the focus of policy analysis towards multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary domains, creating a need for training and research that spans multiple disciplines in which most graduates and professionals do not yet have the training and tools to conduct appropriate analyses. Capacity is essential to address critical skills shortages and high demand and professional development to keep pace with change. This paper identifies what the implications of recent development imply for agricultural economics training institutions, research and the profession in general and in particular in South Africa.","[Hendriks, Sheryl L.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, Private Bag X20, ZA-0028 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Hendriks, SL (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, Private Bag X20, ZA-0028 Pretoria, South Africa.",sheryl.hendriks@up.ac.za,"Hendriks, Sheryl L/E-6537-2010","Hendriks, Sheryl L/0000-0002-1487-4302",,,,,47,5,5,0,9,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2018,57.0,3-4,,,,,167,180,,10.1080/03031853.2018.1479974,0.0,,,14,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,HD1WR,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000452303600001,0

However, knowledge about the differences in the perceived benefits of participation in different organisations and certification schemes is limited. In this paper, we distinguish between three types of farmer organisations in the Indonesian coffee sector: farmer groups, cooperatives, and KUBEs. We compare the benefits farmers perceive from participating in these forms of organisations, including the benefits for unorganised farmers and farmers in different certification schemes (Fair Trade, UTZ, the Rainforest Alliance, and 4C). We find that certified farmers perceive higher benefits than uncertified farmers, and that organised farmers perceive higher benefits than unorganised smallholders. Farmers who hold dual membership (in a farmer group and a KUBE or cooperative) perceive greater benefits than farmers who participate in farmer groups. Although farmers in different certification schemes significantly differ in the benefits they perceive, we could not identify clear patterns based on the schemes. We conclude that integration of the different organisational forms, as well as a more concentrated collaboration between the ministries underlying each organisational form, may improve the benefits perceived by farmers in the Indonesian coffee sector.","[Ibnu, Muhammad; Offermans, Astrid; Glasbergen, Pieter] Maastricht Univ, ICIS, Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University,"Ibnu, M (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, ICIS, Maastricht, Netherlands.",muhammad.ibnu@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"Ibnu, Muhammad/AAG-1143-2020","Offermans, Astrid/0000-0001-5253-6593; Ibnu, muhammad/0000-0003-4219-0730","Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW); Directorate General of Higher Education (DIKTI) of the Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education (Indonesia)","Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW); Directorate General of Higher Education (DIKTI) of the Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education (Indonesia)","This research was conducted as part of the Scientific Programme Indonesia- Netherlands (SPIN) project on Social and Economic Effects of Partnering for Sustainable Change in Agricultural Commodity Chains in Indonesia.

The contributions in this special issue highlight three aspects of Africa's unfolding economic transformation since 2000: remarkable progress for the region as a whole, highly uneven progress across countries, and unresolved questions about the sustainability of the transformations. The drivers of the region's economic transformations are diverse, and include improved governance, strong agricultural growth in some countries, employment expansion in informal rural off-farm activities, strong local and foreign investment, a period of high global commodity prices, and policy reforms undertaken in earlier decades. Agricultural growth, by expanding job opportunities in the non-farm sectors through multiplier effects, is likely to remain an important driver of continued transformation, though it will increasingly need to rely on productivity growth rather than area expansion.","[Jayne, T.

Although innovation literature is rife with the suggestions to leveraging social network to collaborate with consumers in new product development, extent literature does not offer much guidance to engage consumers in online co-commercialization phase. Since consumers tend to believe more in other consumers, engaging consumers in online endorsing might be particularly fruitful in helping to foster acceptance. In this article, the authors consider the nexus of social media and consumer online co-promotion behavior by examining how surprise intensity and task structure affect consumer endorsing content generation in social media. The results show that surprise intensity helps to foster copromotion willingness. Task intensity weaken the positive effect of surprise intensity on co-promotion intention. Regarding social network type, it didn't moderate the effect of surprise intensity on co-promotion willingness. The findings shed light on consumer co-commercialization, a potentially important new agenda of cocreation in innovation process. This study contributes to cocreation and engagement marketing literature. At the same time, managers obtain recommendations for leveraging surprise intensity and task structure to enhance the success of copromotion engagement initiatives.","[Jia, Weiwei] Jilin Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Informat Engn, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China",Jilin University of Finance & Economics,"Jia, WW (通讯作者)，Jilin Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Informat Engn, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China.",jiaweiwei123@hotmail.com,,,National Social Science Foundation of China [17CGL006],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),This research is supported by National Social Science Foundation of China (No.17CGL006).,,32,0,0,0,4,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-623-5,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,56.0,,,,,,229,234,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO0KO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000491539600052,0

The study results conclude that the perceived behavioral control and subjective norm were the most important factors explaining respondents' behavioral intention. Attitude, though found not to be a significant determining factor, was however significantly influenced by perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use.

The authors have been dealing in the long run with economic efficiency of large scale infrastructure projects in the Czech Republic in both methodological and factual terms. Investor of the large scale infrastructure projects (highways) is Road and Highway Directorate. Large amount of funds are also spent on regional level within individual regions of the Czech Republic on investment activities related to lower level roads without which the territory and the backbone networks could not function properly. Investors of middle and small infrastructure projects are municipalities. The research activities aimed at creating methodological procedures for socio-economic assessment of transport infrastructure projects at these two different levels. Projects selected for implementation must always take into account a Pareto optimum, respecting the 3E principles and be beneficial for the development of the territory. The research focuses on finding common and distinct sub-processes within the methodological approaches for assessing the socio-economic efficiency of the projects and their impact on regional development. The examined variables are particularly investment costs and socio-economic benefits related in particular to reducing operating costs, travel time and negative externalities. The analysis has been carried out on two data sets, 47 Czech large scale infrastructure projects and 18 small/middle size infrastructure projects implemented in the South Moravian Region. The output is the evaluation of the socio-economic impact of the new/reconstructed transport infrastructure projects on the investigated territory.","[Korytarova, Jana; Rudolecka, Michaela; Hromadka, Vit] Brno Univ Technol, Brno, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,"Korytarova, J (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Brno, Czech Republic.",korytarova.j@fce.vutbr.cz; rudolecka.m@fce.vutbr.cz; hromadka.v@fce.vutbr.cz,"Hromadka, Vit/G-5587-2019","Hromadka, Vit/0000-0002-9590-9828; Korytarova, Jana/0000-0002-0046-0141","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports [LO1408]; Brno University of Technology [FAST-18-5584]","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic); Brno University of Technology","This paper has been worked out under the project no.

The results of the policy, however, were far below all expectations. Furthermore, it flooded emerging markets (EMs) with low-priced dollars. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the overall and individual impacts of the policy on EMs. Design/methodology/approach - This study uses panel data regression model together with the fixed effects model. Also, a unit root test is conducted to check stationary properties of the data, as well as Durbin-Watson statistic to check serial correlation issues in the models. In estimating empirical models, this paper employs macroeconomic data set of stock market returns, exchange rates, lending interest rates, consumer price index, monetary aggregates and foreign exchange reserves from seven diversified emerging economies. The EMs in this study include China, Indonesia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Russia and Brazil. The time period undertaken in this study is from 2008 to 2012. In order to measure impacts of the different stages of the policy, the authors use dummy variables to represent each stage of the policy. Findings - The results of the study show that the QE policy has significant impacts on foreign exchange reserves, foreign exchange markets and stock markets of the sample economies. Domestic credit markets, however, appear to be least influenced field by the policy. Finally, the results show that only the first stage of the policy exhibits strong significant impacts, however, leverage of the policy decreases over time. Research limitations/implications - Further studies may use different samples, also variables that measure foreign capital inflows such as changes in financial accounts, foreign direct investment and foreign portfolio investment. Originality/value - The present study has the following contributions on assessing the impacts of QE policy. First, the overall and individual impacts of the policy are analyzed. Second, in order to establish more valid results, the sample of this study is designed to include several EMs from three continents and diverse regions.","[Lin, Joung-Yol] Tamkang Univ, Dept Global Polit & Econ, New Taipei, Taiwan; [Batmunkh, Munkh-Ulzii John; Moslehpour, Massoud] Asia Univ, Dept Business Adm, Taichung, Taiwan; [Lin, Chuang-Yuang; Lei, Ka-Man] Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Business Adm, New Taipei, Taiwan",Tamkang University; Asia University Taiwan; National Taipei University,"Moslehpour, M (通讯作者)，Asia Univ, Dept Business Adm, Taichung, Taiwan.",writetodrm@gmail.com,"Moslehpour, Massoud/AAS-9807-2021; Batmunkh, Munkh-Ulzii/T-9287-2019","Moslehpour, Massoud/0000-0001-8808-2407; Batmunkh, Munkh-Ulzii/0000-0002-6881-9755",,,,,41,7,7,0,31,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

This paper summarizes the theoretical discussion of the food regime method, and of the identification of different food regime periods throughout modern history. While it is widely accepted that the so-called second food regime has already ended, there is much discussion on whether or not it is possible to talk about a more recent third food regime. This paper traces the evolution of the wheat complex over the second food regime (1947-1973) and over the next 45 years, and offers an explanation for the evolution of world wheat trade distribution, based on food regime analysis. Certain authors have claimed that the collapse of the WTO Doha round of negotiations may be understood as a hangover from the second food regime. Similarly, this paper argues that the increasing wheat dependence of poor and insecure countries over the past 40 years may be considered as a path dependence outcome of a process initiated during the second food regime.","[Luis Gonzalez-Esteban, Angel] Univ Salamanca, Edificio FES,Campus Miguel de Unamuno, Salamanca 37007, Spain",University of Salamanca,"González-Esteban, AL (通讯作者)，Univ Salamanca, Edificio FES,Campus Miguel de Unamuno, Salamanca 37007, Spain.",algonzal@usal.es,"Gonzalez-Esteban, Angel Luis/Q-6026-2018","Gonzalez-Esteban, Angel Luis/0000-0002-8942-3338",,,,,54,14,14,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Rapid demographic changes are not only a major challenge of public spending, workforce and consumptions patterns but also a major opportunity for new jobs and growth. The aim of this article is to assess the level of advancement in the realization of the silver economy concept in European Union countries and its influence on poverty and social exclusion. The concept of silver economy in the European Union and challenges related to ageing in the area of public finance were discussed. The silver economy index was built using the old dependency ratio, active ageing index and age-related public spending. The conducted research shows that it is difficult to indicate a statistically significant relationship between the level of advancement of the silver economy concept and the level of people at risk of social exclusion rate. The study indicates that the silver economy ratio is the highest in Nordic countries and France, and in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe this concept is much less developed. At the same time, countries accepted to the European Union after 2004 are characterized with higher level of at-risk-of poverty and social exclusion rate, as well as relatively low age-related spendings and relatively high old dependency ratios.","[Maj-Wasniowska, Katarzyna; Walega, Agnieszka; Walega, Grzegorz] Cracow Univ Econ, Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Maj-Wasniowska, K (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Krakow, Poland.",,"Wałęga, Grzegorz/T-9206-2019; Wałęga, Agnieszka/ABD-6566-2021","Wałęga, Grzegorz/0000-0002-4355-5204;",,,,,25,1,1,9,37,INTL INST SOCIAL & ECONOMIC SCI,PRAGUE,"TREBESOVSKA 2038/14, PRAGUE, 193 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87927-77-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,341,353,,10.20472/EFC.2018.010.023,0.0,,,13,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2CO,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000505164900023,0

Less noticed has been the importance of commodity correlations, and their increase after 2006, in the risk faced by producers. To assess their impact, we perform an empirical analysis of the market value of commodity producers' output. In a sample of 56 countries producing 26 commodities we find that diversification and correlations strongly explain output value volatility. During 1987-2006, producers effectively specialized in a single commodity had an average output value volatility of 27.0% while producers of three or more commodities had a 12.7% volatility. In this period average correlation was 8% and diversification was very effective. In the 2007-12 period, correlations averaged 26% and output volatilities for specialized and diversified commodities were 30.4% and 19.5% respectively, thus reducing the benefit of diversification at a time of macroeconomic distress. In 2013-16, output volatilities reverted to levels close to those in 1987-2006 as commodities decorrelated again. Our findings should be relevant to policy makers embarking in diversification efforts and in the analysis of macroeconomic risk of commodity producers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

For this reason, the present study combines a quasi-experiment (choice-based conjoint analysis) and direct questions (Likert scales) to measure the job preferences of 568 agricultural students in Germany and compares the results. In addition to finding gender differences, the study found that 'income' and 'future perspective' are the most important job characteristics for the job choice of agricultural students, and that they also prefer an increasing 'work-life-balance' as well as a 'rural location' for their future employer. Insights about job characteristics' attractiveness lead to a more transparent environment in which employers and (potential) employees make better-informed decisions, resulting in increased job satisfaction, performance and career sustainability.","[Meyerding, Stephan G.

This EU setting under the auspices of Europe 2020 is complemented by the national laws of EU member states. The e-Justiced portal should be placed where all this data is migrated and where European SMEs are able to not only look for information about their business partners and competitors, but as well post information about them, even if this is not required by the EU law and/or national laws. Since the e-Justice portal has been operating for several years, updated and improved, its current version should be assessed and tested whether it is a real, transparent and free source of information about SMEs. Therefore, after a legislative overview, a practical case study is performed. Similar SMEs incorporated in the majority of EU member states are selected (McDonald's, BurgerKing, KFC and Subway) and the availability of their annual accounts is assessed. The results do not support the pro-EU hypothesis that these annual accounts are available in a similar manner and under similar conditions. Namely, despite all the e-transparency rhetoric, it seems that many national business registers and/or SMEs are not ready to freely go for an e-reporting of annual accounts and so an asymmetry of information and a potential for unfair competition is created.","[Pelikanova, Radka MacGregor] Angloamer Univ, Prague, Czech Republic",Anglo-American University,"Pelikánová, RM (通讯作者)，Angloamer Univ, Prague, Czech Republic.",radkamacgregor@yahoo.com; robertkmacgregor@yahoo.com,"MacGregor Pelikanova, Radka/G-2601-2018; MacGregor, Robert/E-9858-2019","MacGregor Pelikanova, Radka/0000-0001-9628-7146; MacGregor, Robert/0000-0003-2888-3880",,,,,36,2,2,1,5,ANGLO-AMER UNIV,PRAHA 1,"LETENSKA 5, PRAHA 1, 118 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-906585-7-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,142,157,,,,,,16,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM3BI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000461826900014,0

The aim of this research is to identify the factors that might limit or develop the consumption of seafood products, as well as the potential influence of culinary television programs on consumption patterns.","[Raftowicz-Filipkiewicz, Magdalena] Univ Sci & Environm Wroclaw, Wroclaw, Poland; [Le Gallic, Bertrand; Nourry, Myriam; Pirrone, Claudio] Univ Brest, Brest, France",Universite de Bretagne Occidentale,"Raftowicz-Filipkiewicz, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sci & Environm Wroclaw, Wroclaw, Poland.",magdalena.raftowicz-filipkiewicz@upwr.edu.pl; bertrand.legallic@univ-brest.fr,"Raftowicz, Magdalena/ABF-3476-2020","Raftowicz, Magdalena/0000-0002-3022-6946",,,,,7,0,0,0,2,WYDAWNICTWO UNIWERSYTETU EKONOMICZNEGO W POZNANIU,Poznan,"ul.

As elsewhere, protected areas in Latin America link the governance of people, territory, and resources by reinterpreting and reclassifying practices and environments. Set in highland Peru, the article focuses on how such revisions imply contestation of both history and future. It explores particular modes of claiming space through an archeology of the claims to knowledge and legitimacy put forward by a national park and a campesino community, respectively. Claims to space entwine with social struggles about local development where territorial claims are based on different notions of history and interpretations of the esthetic and productive values of the landscape. While the park officials navigate interests of conservation, tourism, and extraction, the campesino community mobilizes a different set of values and interests based on their historical occupation of the territories. These processes of contestation over authority and legitimacy highlight different views on the role of landscapes in the history and progress of local communities. Conservation may not only dispossess people of their land and natural resources, but also of labor and territorial sovereignty. This case shows how an Andean campesino community counters such movements by a wide repertoire of legal and social actions that works simultaneously in legal and extra-legal domains. Paper works mediate claims to territorial sovereignty, people, and resources. These claims involve contestations over interpretations of history which, besides their oral forms, materialize in paperwork such as official communications, community records, and cadastral maps, as well as in visual representations, internal statutes, and deliberate history writing.

This paper asks whether this level of growth is a new normal for Indonesiai.e. do government efforts and the global environment matter, or will the country's economic growth remain at around 5% annually. If private consumption, the major component of GDP, continues to grow at its current level and inflation is controlled, this paper concludes that Indonesia might maintain its current annual growth rate of 5% for several more years. The probability of higher growth, however, is not promising. Lower growth seems more likely. To ensure the current level of economic growth will be sustained in the foreseeable future, this paper recommends stricter economic reforms to allow larger and more productive capital investments; more aggressive management of exchange rates to improve the country's competitiveness; a more effective fiscal space to support improvements to needed infrastructure by developing innovation to increase revenue; a reduced energy subsidy; and a more flexible upper bound of deficit. Effective programs to improve the country's human capital and innovation are crucial.","[Resosudarmo, Budy P.] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Abdurohman] Minist Finance, Jakarta, Indonesia",Australian National University; Ministry of Finance of Republic of Indonesia,"Resosudarmo, BP (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",,"Resosudarmo, Budy P/K-1129-2017",,,,,,46,7,9,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

In order to achieve this, as an environmental analysis tool the Ishikawa diagram or cause-effect diagram was used. The main findings are that in Romania, to a large extent, accounting is not disconnected from taxation, although steps were made in this direction through the adoption and implementation by the listed companies of the IFRS. There can be noticed a book-tax alignment tendency in what concerns the accounting result and the tax result, although there are regulatory differences meant to address the possible temptation towards the manipulation of the accounting result by the taxpayer. To some extent it can be argued that the main user of the financial reports issued according to accounting rules and regulations is mainly the state and to a smaller extent the other stakeholders and that sometimes professional judgments made by specialists when choosing accounting policies and treatments are influenced by taxation.","[Timofte (Coca), Cristina; Tanasa (Brinzaru), Simona-Maria] Stefan Cel Mare Univ, Suceava, Romania",Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava,"Tanasa, SM (通讯作者)，Stefan Cel Mare Univ, Suceava, Romania.",cristinat.coca@gmail.com; tanasa_simona19@yahoo.com,"Timofte, Cristina/AAR-9372-2020; Tanasa, Simona-Maria Brinzaru/AAS-2583-2020",,,,,,12,0,0,1,16,LUMEN PUBLISHING HOUSE,IASI,"2, TEPES VODA STR, IASI, 700 714, ROMANIA",,,978-1-910129-18-0,,,,2018,,,,,,,413,420,,10.18662/lumproc.91,0.0,,,8,Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BM9BY,,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470307900036,0

The research concludes that there is currently no definition of the term destination, generally accepted and the concept of tourist destination has evolved mainly because of the increase in competition, the impact of new technologies and the changes in quantitative and behavioural demand.

The use of an innovative logistics-based costing model allowed to determine the basic logistics cost ratios both at a general level and in a process-based approach (by stages and by basic logistics processes), taking total/actual process costs into account. In livestock farms, the ratio of logistics costs to total costs was twice as high as in crop farms, and ranged from 30.4% to 42.9% of total costs. In crop farms, the corresponding ratio varied from 15.8% to 23.6%. The analysis of logistics costs by basic logistics processes shows that the largest difference in ratios between the farms was observed for warehousing processes.

The data document a surge in the number of fiscal councils since the 2008-09 economic and financial crisis, and also illustrate that well-designed fiscal councils are associated with stronger fiscal performance and better macro-economic and budgetary forecasts. Key features of effective fiscal councils include operational independence from politics, the provision or public assessment of budgetary forecasts, a strong presence in the public debate and the monitoring of compliance with fiscal policy rules.","[Debrun, Xavier; Kinda, Tidiane] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Debrun, X (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",xdebrun@imf.org; tkinda@imf.org,,"Debrun, Xavier/0000-0002-6355-6626",,,,,32,18,20,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

In this article, we test the hypothesis that group identity triggers social norms or heuristics, using reaction times collected in a series of simple distributive tasks (minidictator games). We control for individual preferences using the degree of selfishness expressed in the allocation decisions, and we account for variations in the difficulty of making decisions based on subjects' prosocial inclination. Our results support the heuristic hypothesis: Generosity seems to be an effect of fast and frugal behavioral rules that simplify decisions, especially when it conflicts with an underlying tendency to behave in a self-interested manner. In the language of dual-process theories, group identity triggers System 1 processes that facilitate choice and override slow, calculative decision-making.","[Filippin, Antonio; Guala, Francesco] Univ Milan, Dept Econ Management & Quantitat Methods, Via Conservatorio 7, I-20122 Milan, Italy; [Filippin, Antonio] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of Milan; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Guala, F (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, Dept Econ Management & Quantitat Methods, Via Conservatorio 7, I-20122 Milan, Italy.",francesco.guala@unimi.it,"Filippin, Antonio/L-4243-2017; Guala, Francesco/B-6425-2015",,University of Milan grant; Rientro dei Cervelli scholarship,University of Milan grant; Rientro dei Cervelli scholarship,We thank Manuela Raimondi and the experimental laboratory of the University of Parma for providing logistic support.

A greater degree of comparability lowers information acquisition costs, reduces the uncertainties associated with performance evaluation, and increases the overall quantity and quality of information available to corporate outsiders which, in turn, helps to ease the external financing constraints of the firm. Using a large US sample from 1981 to 2013, we find consistent evidence that financial statement comparability significantly reduces cash holdings of the firm. We also find that this relation is mediated by financing constraints, financial reporting quality and corporate governance. These findings are robust to alternative specification of comparability, cash holdings and to the alternative regression specifications and endogeneity tests.

We generate inference, in terms of a full set of elasticities, consistent with neoclassical microeconomic theory and the data generating process. Our results are in line with earlier findings in the literature based on shorter duration samples and different methodologies. They have important implications for climate policy intervention designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We show that there is a small but statistically significant substitution possibility between crude oil and natural gas, but not between crude oil and coal. We also provide evidence that natural gas is a substitute for coal when the price of coal changes, but coal is not a substitute for natural gas when the price of natural gas changes.","[Hossain, A.

We also find that foreign equity investments are concentrated in firms above a certain size. Moreover, foreign investors show a preference for large, profitable, highly liquid, and growth firms, as well as firms with large boards. However, after controlling for other firm-specific factors, we find that chaebol (Korean business group) firms are not more attractive to foreign investors than non-chaebol firms.

Moreover, there may be agency problems, and uninformed investors may also be deterred from seeking financial advice. The readability of these disclosures has decreased over the past seven years. These results are consistent among four different readability proxies and contradict SEC requirements for plain English language in disclosures, specifically for firms providing financial planning services to individuals.

By looking at entrepreneurs in the IT services sector in Swedish non-core regions between 1991 and 2010, the article investigates the interaction between individuals' embeddedness in local networks and their exposure to external knowledge accumulation opportunities across different geographical settings, as well as its impact on their entrepreneurial activities. The results of the analysis suggest that individuals with broad spatial relocation histories are more likely to start IT firms in non-core regions, which, in turn, may be expected to survive longer. It is, therefore, claimed that non-local knowledge accumulated through spatial relocation is an important complement to embeddedness in local networks in non-core regions. This complementarity is further related to the evolution of the IT services sector over time.","[Martynovich, Mikhail] Lund Univ, Lund Univ, Fac Social Sci, Dept Human Geog, Solvegatan 10, S-22362 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Martynovich, M (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Lund Univ, Fac Social Sci, Dept Human Geog, Solvegatan 10, S-22362 Lund, Sweden.",mikhail.martynovich@keg.lu.se,"Martynovich, Mikhail/AAZ-4092-2021","Martynovich, Mikhail/0000-0002-0776-480X",,,,,82,17,17,6,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Despite this, little is known about how family members negotiate financial and domestic contributions post-return. This qualitative study used a phenomenological methodology to explore the experiences of Australian parents and young adults who returned to co-residence in terms of the younger family members' contributions to their household. Findings revealed that the young adults acknowledged the need to contribute but often varied in how much assistance they offered. For the most part, the extent of this contribution reflected their parents' actions; the tendency not to ask for assistance and undertake tasks themselves meant offspring were not given incentives to contribute. While this at times resulted in unmet expectations and frustration among parents, they continued to act in ways that favourably accommodated their offspring. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the negotiation between parents and young adults in regards to household contributions, and the need for further qualitative investigation in this area.","[Warner, Elyse; Henderson-Wilson, Claire; Andrews, Fiona] Deakin Univ, Fac Hlth, Sch Hlth & Social Dev, 221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia",Deakin University,"Warner, E (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Fac Hlth, Sch Hlth & Social Dev, 221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia.",elyse.warner@deakin.edu.au,"Henderson-Wilson, Claire/AAP-2914-2021; Andrews, Fiona/HOC-3244-2023","Andrews, Fiona/0000-0001-5082-1702",,,,,75,6,6,0,5,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

Designers meet users' needs by developing solutions to complex trade-offs-reverse salients-between a product's characteristics. The fundamental ergonomic design challenge in portable computers concerns the reverse salient between two ergonomic factors: screen size and weight. It is easier to view information on larger screens, but portability is negatively affected by the weight of larger batteries required to power larger screens. This ergonomic reverse salient shaped the innovation trajectory of the portable computer, from the selection of the clamshell portable over alterative design configurations, to the search for more efficient batteries and new types of screens. Based on hedonic price analysis on data of ergonomic and technological characteristics, we show that (i) screen size and weight are key components in hedonic price functions, (ii) the interaction between screen size and weight is distinct from interactions between other, technological, characteristics that affect computing power, and (iii) positive prices are paid for the product solutions to the ergonomic reverse salient.","[Windrum, Paul] Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Nottingham, England; [Frenken, Koen] Univ Utrecht, Inst Sustainable Dev, Innovat Studies, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Green, Lawrence] Birmingham City Univ, Birmingham Inst Art & Design, Birmingham, England",University of Nottingham; Utrecht University; Birmingham City University,"Frenken, K (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Inst Sustainable Dev, Innovat Studies, Utrecht, Netherlands.",paul.windrum@nottingham.ac.uk; k.frenken@uu.nl; lawrence.green@bcu.ac.uk,"Frenken, Koen/C-4486-2017","Frenken, Koen/0000-0003-4731-0201; Green, Lawrence/0000-0002-9781-8700",,,,,79,4,4,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

The results of SD and MV show that varying of calendar anomalies over time support the AMH in Islamic stock indices. The most vital finding is that the Islamic indices achieved greater efficiency over time, particularly during the recent financial crisis, when their prevalence greatly increased. Thus, the results suggest that the AMH offers a better explanation of the behavior of calendar anomalies than the Efficient Market Hypothesis. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We aim testing whether the level of development is a mediating factor in the innovation-productivity link. The data used have been drawn from the World Bank panel enterprise surveys, for 2006 and 2010. First, we estimate total factor productivity (TFP) and, second, we use the estimated TFP as a regressor or as dependent variable, in two models for testing self-selection of the most productive firms into innovation or the existence of returns to innovation in terms of productivity. Our results confirm the mediating role of the level of development in the innovation-productivity link: both the self-selection and the returns-to-innovation hypotheses work only for the upper-middle income countries.","[Constanza Demmel, M.] Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Dept Estruct Econ, Valencia, Spain; [Manez, Juan A.; Rochina-Barrachina, Maria E.; Sanchis-Llopis, Juan A.] Univ Valencia, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Manez, Juan A.; Rochina-Barrachina, Maria E.; Sanchis-Llopis, Juan A.] Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, ERI CES, Valencia 46022, Spain",University of Valencia; University of Valencia; University of Valencia,"Sanchis-Llopis, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Valencia 46022, Spain.;Sanchis-Llopis, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, ERI CES, Valencia 46022, Spain.",sanchisl@uv.es,"Llopis, Juan A.

Indeed, existing literature does not provide a punctual estimate of this effect for developing countries. This paper fills this gap, by exploiting a self-constructed dataset which provides, for a 22-year period, information concerning IPR reforms involving pharmaceuticals for 74 developed and developing countries. The identification strategy exploits the different timing across these countries of two sets of IPR reforms. Domestic innovation is measured as citation-weighted domestic patent applications filed at the European Patent Office (EPO): the highly skewed distribution of the dependent variable, and the high number of zero observations, are taken into account using count data models. In particular, a Zero Inflated Negative Binomial model is adopted, to overcome previous literature assumption that all innovations are patented in the main markets of reference, and to take into consideration the choice not to patent at the EPO. Results show that innovation is sensitive to IPR protection, but not to its degree. Moreover, the effect is not long lasting. My study also finds that developing countries profit significantly less than developed ones from the protection, benefiting from an effect that is roughly half of that for developed countries. Consequent policy implications are examined, and include the conclusions that a one size fits all approach can be inappropriate, and that gradual reforms should be preferred to rare reforms that greatly alter the level of IPR protection.

Government in the economy finances its constant fraction of unproductive expenditures through taxing output, penalty revenues, and seigniorage. By endogenizing the individual decision of tax evasion, we show that the ratio of government tax revenues over output is not monotonously related to the tax rate, whereas economic growth is always decreasing in the tax rate. We then consider a scenario that the government first selects a growth rate of nominal money and then the tax rate is endogenously determined by the government budget constraint. Given this, our model finds a threshold level of inflation in which the inflation-growth nexus may be positive or negative for initial inflation below it, but is definitely negative for initial inflation over it. We also find that the negative relationship for initial inflation over this threshold level is convex. These conclusions are consistent with recent empirical studies.","[Hung, Fu-Sheng] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei 116, Taiwan",National Chengchi University,"Hung, FS (通讯作者)，Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei 116, Taiwan.",fshung@nccu.edu.tw,,,Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan (ROC),Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan (ROC),"Comments from an anonymous referee are extremely helpful.

This might not be a correct policy prescription for resource-rich sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries, where public capital is very low to support the needed economic growth. In such countries, rents from resources serve as an opportunity to scale-up the needed public capital. Using a panel data for the period 19902013, we find in line with the scaling-up hypothesis that resource rents significantly increases public investment in SSA and that this tends to depend on the quality of political institutions. Moreover, we also find evidence of a positive effect of public investment on economic growth, which also depends on the level of resource rents.","[Karimu, Amin] Umea Univ, Ctr Environm & Resource Econ, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Karimu, Amin] Univ Ghana, Sch Business, Accra, Ghana; [Adu, George] Uppsala Univ, Nordic Africa Inst, Uppsala, Sweden; [Adu, George] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Kumasi, Ghana; [Marbuah, George; Mensah, Justice Tei; Amuakwa-Mensah, Franklin] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, Uppsala, Sweden",Umea University; University of Ghana; Uppsala University; Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Karimu, A (通讯作者)，Umea Univ, Ctr Environm & Resource Econ, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.",amin.karimu@econ.umu.se,"Amuakwa-Mensah, Franklin/K-1937-2013; Karimu, Amin/JFK-6275-2023; Marbuah, George/I-1975-2019","Amuakwa-Mensah, Franklin/0000-0002-3581-4704; Karimu, Amin/0000-0003-3931-8828; Marbuah, George/0000-0003-4126-6270",United Nations University World Institute for Development Economics Research (UNU-WIDER),United Nations University World Institute for Development Economics Research (UNU-WIDER),We wish to acknowledge support from the United Nations University World Institute for Development Economics Research (UNU-WIDER) project team on 'Managing Natural Resource Wealth' towards the conduct of this research.

The current study fills the gaps in the empirical studies by examining the competition in different banking markets (i.e. deposit market, loan market and non-interest income market) in China and further evaluating their impacts on bank profitability. The findings show that the non-interest income market has a higher level of competition compared to the deposit market and loan market. It is further reported that a lower level of competition in deposit market leads to an increase in the profitability of Chinese commercial banks. Finally, the results suggest that shadow banking improves the profitability of Chinese banks. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

There are fierce debates on how Sub-Saharan Africa can foster pro-poor growth and the role of agriculture and small- versus large-scale farming in poverty reduction. We contribute to this debate with micro-economic empirical evidence from the Senegal River Delta, an area that recently experienced rapid rural development. We use household survey data from two panel rounds in 2006 and 2013 and a cluster analysis to investigate livelihood, income, and poverty dynamics in the region. We find that with 4.3% annual growth in average household income, 29.5 percentage points' poverty reduction, and 4.2 percentage points' inequality reduction over the period 2006-13, development in the Senegal River Delta region has been remarkably pro-poor. Income growth and poverty reduction have been most impressive among households moving into wage employment on large-scale horticultural export farms and in an emerging service sector. Income growth in small-scale agriculture and non-farm businesses has been more modest but has affected the largest number of households. Transformation in both farm and non-farm sectors has driven rural development in the Senegal River Delta region, and investments in both large- and small-scale agriculture have contributed importantly to household income growth and poverty reduction. Our findings imply that (foreign) investments in large-scale commercial and export-oriented farming can trigger pro-poor growth directly through employment effects and indirectly through investment and consumption linkages with the small-scale farm and non-farm sector.

Innovation activities, measured by patent-based proxies, are not, on average, affected by which policy is in place. Innovation activities, however, drop significantly during times of policy uncertainty measured by national elections. The drop is greater for more influential innovations (citations in the right tail, exploratory rather than exploitative innovations) and for innovation-intensive industries. We use close presidential elections and ethnic fractionalization to address endo-geneity concerns.

A shift worker is anyone who follows a work schedule that is outside of the typical daytime working hours of a business day and commute after dark-by walking or bicycling to a transit stop. However, poor visibility conditions on sidewalks and bicycle lanes often thwart safety of their walking and bicycling activities. Therefore, this paper develops two simple scores-nighttime accessibility score for walking (NASW) and nighttime accessibility for bicycling (NASB) - for evaluating nighttime infrastructure for pedestrians and bicyclist. The scores consider the employment data, travel time and the physical distribution of streetlight poles along the sidewalks and bicycle lanes. Data from the city of El Paso in Texas is used to demonstrate the applicability of the two scores. Employment data from three prominent service industry sectors known to employ low-income shift workers - i) Retail Trade, ii) Accommodation and Food Services, and iii) Health Care and Social Assistance - are used for demonstration purposes. It is observed that amongst the three sectors analyzed, both NASW and NASB values are higher for regions in El Paso with low-income employment concentrations from the Health Care and Social Assistance sector. It is also observed that some prominent regions in north-east, south-east and west of El Paso need improvements in streetlight systems, sidewalks and bicycle network to facilitate walking and bicycling amongst low-income shift workers employed in Retail Trade, and Accommodation and Food Services industry sectors to access transit stops at night.","[Chandra, Shailesh] Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Civil Engn & Construct Engn Management, 1250 Bellflower Blvd,MS 5101,VEC 506, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA; [Jimenez, Jose] Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Civil Engn & Construct Engn Management, 1250 Bellflower Blvd,MS 5101, Long Beach, CA 90803 USA; [Radhakrishnan, Ramalingam] Prairie View A&M Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Prairie View, TX 77446 USA",California State University System; California State University Long Beach; California State University System; California State University Long Beach; Texas A&M University System; Prairie View A&M University,"Chandra, S (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Civil Engn & Construct Engn Management, 1250 Bellflower Blvd,MS 5101,VEC 506, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA.",shailesh.chandra@csulb.edu; jimenez_2991@hotmail.com; raradha@pvamu.edu,,"Chandra, Shailesh/0000-0002-1558-0285",,,,,62,21,22,4,35,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Contrary, fiscal consolidations have no significant effect on economic activity when private debt is low. These results are robust to alternative definitions of private-debt overhang, the composition of fiscal consolidations, and controlling for the state of the business cycle and government debt overhang.

Some studies show that spared landscapes with clearly separated intensive agriculture and pristine forest are better for biodiversity and other ecosystem services, whereas others demonstrate the benefits of shared mosaic landscapes composed of a mix of forest types, agricultural fields, grassland, and plantations. Increasingly, these scientific views have been depolarized, recognizing that both shared and spared landscapes have a role to play, depending on the context. However, it is less clear from the literature what drives actual policy-making related to land sparing and land sharing in developing countries and what the outcomes of these policies are. We therefore reviewed the international peer-reviewed literature for evidence of policies that aim at land sparing or land sharing in developing countries, the driving forces behind these policies and their outcomes. We also searched for evidence of whether the scientific debates have had an effect on land policy-making and explored the hypothesis that land sparing is the dominant land policy paradigm. We show that all countries represented in the studies have land sparing policies and half of them also have land sharing policies, although the latter appear inferior and under-funded. Drivers of land policies are very diverse, ranging from international commitments in conventions to various national-level pressures, but there is little evidence that scientific results have affected these policies. The policy outcomes in terms of ecosystem services and livelihoods are also very diverse. We conclude based on the studies reviewed that context is indeed very important for understanding different design and outcomes of land sparing and land sharing policies and that more evidence is needed on the processes for integration of rapidly evolving scientific debates in land policy-making in developing countries.

I find that the existence of uninformed managers causes informed managers with relative performance concerns to trade less informatively, engendering less informative prices. When managers are differentially informed, they need to forecast the average performance based on private signals, and each manager may place more weight on the private signal if the signal provides good information about the average performance. The price aggregates those signals and thus becomes more informative.","[Qiu, Zhigang] Renmin Univ China, Hanging Adv Inst Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Qiu, Zhigang] Renmin Univ China, Finance & Int Monetary Inst IMI, Beijing, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; Renmin University of China,"Qiu, ZG (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Hanging Adv Inst Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Qiu, ZG (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Finance & Int Monetary Inst IMI, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhigang.qiu@ruc.edu.cn,"Qiu, Zhigang/AAQ-5854-2021",,Renmin University of China [15XNL015],Renmin University of China,"I am extremely grateful to my supervisors Dimitri Vayanos and Kathy Yuan for their continuous encouragement and invaluable guidance.

In Koltai's view and argument, a long-run policy is needed to provide alternative future pathways for members of these cohorts.

Previous studies show that firm leverage responds differently to CEO power changes. In order to capture this non-linear relationship, we employ an innovative dynamic panel threshold model, this novel method allows the estimation of threshold effects with panel data even in case of endogenous regressors. Using a panel-dataset of Chinese SMEs from 2009 to 2013, we find that a CEO power threshold exists in the CEO power-firm leverage association. CEO power has a strong positive and statistically significant determinant of firm leverage, in the low-CEO power firms. However, at high-CEO regime, the impact is negative but insignificant determinant of leverage. The results are robust to alternative measures of leverage and CEO power, as well as additional explanatory variables.","[Chao, Chi Chur; Hu, May; Li, Tongxia] Deakin Univ, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Munir, Qaiser] Univ Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Saga, Malaysia",Deakin University; Universiti Malaysia Sabah,"Chao, CC (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Geelong, Vic, Australia.",c.chao@deakin.edu.au; may.hu@deakin.edu.au; qaiser@ums.edu.my; lilar@deakin.edu.au,"Munir, Qaiser/J-9665-2019; Munir, Qaiser/K-1948-2019","Munir, Qaiser/0000-0002-5009-9788; Munir, Qaiser/0000-0002-5009-9788; LI, TONGXIA/0000-0001-5787-3193",,,,,55,22,24,8,48,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

Using firm-level data for a sample of 55,596 firms in 79 countries, we find that financial inclusion, i.e., the distribution of financial services across firms, has a positive impact on firm growth. This positive impact is magnified when bank markets are less concentrated, a proxy for more competition among banks. We also find that more competitive banks favor firm growth only at high levels of financial inclusion, while bank concentration is particularly favorable to foreign and state-owned firms and increases firm growth at low levels of financial inclusion. In countries with limited financial deepening, the quality of the banking system (financial inclusion and bank competition) may be as important in promoting firm performance as its overall size.

Linking implies that permits issued in one system can be traded internationally for use in the other. We show how the nature of uncertainty, market sizes, and sunk costs of linking determine EA. Even when sunk costs are small so EA > 0, autarky can be preferable to one partner, depending on jurisdiction characteristics. Moreover, one partner's permit price volatility under linking may increase without making linking the less preferred option. An empirical application calibrates jurisdiction characteristics to demonstrate the economic significance of our results, which can make linking partner match crucial for the effectiveness and success of the Paris Agreement.","[Doda, Baran; Taschini, Luca] Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Sydney, NSW, Australia",,"Doda, B (通讯作者)，Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",L.B.Doda@lse.ac.uk; L.Taschini1@lse.ac.uk,,"Taschini, Luca/0000-0001-5355-1736",ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy; UK Economic and Social Research Council; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); UK Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Part of this research was supported by the ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy, which is funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council.

However, there is no agreement in the existing literature on how aid dispersion should be measured and few studies of the extent of the problem. We argue for using the Theil Index for both recipients and donors. This relative inequality measure has a major advantage: it allows for a perfect decomposition into variation between and within entities. Exploiting this property, we can rank official donors and recipients not only in terms of the total spread, but also assess the contributions of geographic and sectoral dispersion. We provide a detailed picture of developments along various dimensions (globally as well as for countries, income groups, and regions, over 1998-13). We further distinguish between bilateral and multilateral donors. Consistent with other studies using more limited samples, we find little effect of the Paris Agenda overall. Aid is more fragmented in Sub-Saharan Africa and in the poorest countries. Globally as well as for most donor and recipient countries, between variation is the main driver of the spread, lending support to the geographic concentration policies many donor countries have adopted. Bilateral aid has been somewhat more dispersed than multilateral aid and in both cases the large number of donors controlling similar shares of total funds is a major driver of the total spread. The latter suggests that concentration could also be achieved through a reduction of the number of actors on the donor side of the aid industry, a perspective that previous studies using other measures have been unable to capture.

Specifically, I take advantage of an Italian law that empowers the central government to replace democratically elected municipal officials who are potentially connected with the mafia with a commission of non-elected administrators. Fixed-effects model estimates that focus on a sample of municipalities from three Italian regions (Campania, Calabria and Sicilia) for the period 1998 to 2013 show that in municipalities where the city council is dismissed because of the presence of mafia-connected officials, there is a reduction in public investments in neighboring municipalities. Additional empirical evidence suggests that this reduction may be because law enforcement spillovers reduce misconduct in neighboring municipalities. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

As the discourse has advanced, terms such as community-driven development and community capacity-building (CCB) have become widely used and attracted significant funding. Yet, despite the prominent place CCB has come to occupy in development discourse and practice, relatively little attention has been given to the process of capacity-building at the level of the community, particularly as it is understood by key protagonists. The authors present a descriptive case-study of two CCB programs in Yunnan, China, examining how capacity is understood by the key protagonists at the level of individuals, institutions, and communities, and which capacities are identified as built at each level. The authors show that while there are expected differences in the perceptions of the CCB process and outcomes at different levels, there are also clear overlaps, and that capacities develop simultaneously at different levels, in an interactive and mutually reinforcing manner. The results suggest that the interconnection across levels may be very important to study further. This study helps fill a gap in the CCB literature and contributes insights that could improve the effectiveness of community development projects. In addition, it provides insight into the specific case of CCB in China, where literature has tended to focus on institutional capacity and relationships between civil society organizations and the government rather than process and outcomes at the community level.

Among other things, we observe that there exist some interaction between LLPs and existing prudential, accounting, institutional, cultural, religious, tax and fiscal frameworks which differ across countries; and we find that managerial discretion in provisioning is strongly linked to income smoothing, capital management, signalling, tax management and other objectives. We also address several issues including the ethical dimensions of income smoothing, factors influencing income smoothing, methodological issues in LLP modelling and the dynamic loan loss provisioning experiment; which opens up several avenues for further research such as: finding a balance between sufficient LLPs which regulators want versus transparent LLPs which standard setters want; the sensitivity of abnormal LLPs to changes in equity; the persistence of abnormal LLPs following CEO exit; country-specific interventions that induce LLP procyclicality in emerging countries; the impact of Basel III on banks' provisioning discretion; LLP behaviour among systemic and non-systemic financial institutions; etc. We conclude that regulators need to pay attention to how much discretion lending institutions should have in determining reported provision estimates, and this has been a long standing issue.

Formal tests conducted indicate that high persistence is an intrinsic characteristic in the majority of the RIRs. We consider local-persistent model to assess the degree of persistence in these series. The findings from this devise reveal that RIRs are persistent, but are characterized by a mean-reverting process. The consistency of the persistence comparable amongst the series is confirmed after accounting for the volatility of the consumption growth. Applying a test proposed by Leybourne et al. (2007a) that allows for long memory dynamics, we reconfirm the characteristic of the series. Building on previous studies, this paper provides favorable support for the long-run Fisher hypothesis and help to solve an intertemporal consumption behavior puzzle across the emerging and advanced countries.

A DCC-GARCH model and a dynamic conditional variance decomposition method are applied to the local currency weekly government bond yields of eight East Asian markets over the period January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2012. We find low levels of integration between the local bond markets in the ASEAN4 (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand) and the external markets in terms of both dynamic conditional correlations and dynamic conditional variance decompositions. There has been no upward trend in these two measures of integration for emerging East Asian countries. However, Hong Kong and Singapore are highly integrated with the external markets.

This paper fills that gap by examining the cash holdings of US property-liability insurers in order to analyze the difference in cash holdings and cash adjustments between public and private stock insurers and between mutual and stock insurers within the private insurer category. We find that public insurers hold much less cash than private stock insurers, which differs from the findings for non-financial firms. Additionally, we find that mutual insurers hold less cash than private stock insurers. Public insurers adjust their cash holdings much faster toward their target cash levels than private stock insurers do when facing an extreme cash shortfall, but their adjustment speed is indifferent from that of private stock insurers when both having excess cash. Mutual insurers are able to adjust cash holdings slightly faster than private stock insurers when there is an extreme cash shortfall but are indifferent in adjustment speed from private stock insurers when having excess cash in hand. Overall, our results are more consistent with the financing frictions hypothesis of cash holdings and are inconsistent with the owner-manager agency problems of free cash flow. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Consistent with expectations, we show that firm productivity (and age) are significant determinants of firm exit. Cross-country analysis shows, however, that the relationship between productivity as well as age and exit is mitigated by some country-level factors. In particular, we show either's effect is substantially weakened in low-income economies, economies with limited openness to international trade, and in economies with cumbersome bankruptcy procedures. To address issues of sample attrition and selection bias presented by survey-based estimates, corrections are applied using information when a firm's operating status is uncertain. The expected negative relationship between firm labor productivity and the likelihood of exit is robust to these corrections, as is the negative relationship between firm exit and age.","[Aga, Gemechu; Francis, David] Enterprise Anal World Bank, Dev Econ, 2121 Penn Ave,NW F 4K-226, Washington, DC 20433 USA",,"Francis, D (通讯作者)，Enterprise Anal World Bank, Dev Econ, 2121 Penn Ave,NW F 4K-226, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",gayanaaga@worldbank.org; dfrancis@worldbank.org,,,,,,,55,9,10,0,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We use a first-difference approach to show that in an effort to beat benchmarks, fund managers controlling large pension assets tend to increase their exposure to high-beta stocks, while aiming to maintain tracking errors around the benchmark. The findings support theoretical conjectures that benchmarking can lead managers to tilt their portfolio toward high-beta stocks and away from low-beta stocks, which can reinforce observed pricing anomalies.","[Christoffersen, Susan E.

Specifically, we analyze how firms grow along several dimensions (growth of sales, employment, assets, and operating profits) using Structural Vector Autoregressions. Causal relations are identified by using information contained in the (non-Gaussian) growth rate distributions. For most firms, the growth process starts with employment growth, which is then followed by sales growth, then growth of operating profits, and finally growth of assets. In contrast, high growth firms put more emphasis on growth of operating profits driving other dimensions of growth, with employment growth occurring at the end.","[Coad, Alex; Siepel, Josh] Univ Sussex, SPRU, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Coad, Alex] European Commiss, JRC IPTS, Seville, Spain; [Cowling, Marc] Univ Brighton, Brighton, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex; European Commission Joint Research Centre; University of Brighton,"Coad, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, SPRU, Brighton, E Sussex, England.;Coad, A (通讯作者)，European Commiss, JRC IPTS, Seville, Spain.",Alexander.Coad@ec.europa.eu; M.Cowling2@brighton.ac.uk; J.Siepel@sussex.ac.uk,"Coad, Alex/H-8938-2012","Coad, Alex/0000-0002-5706-0528; Cowling, Marc/0000-0001-5731-8712",ESRC grant [ES/J008427/1]; ESRC [ES/J008427/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J008427/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC grant(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors are indebted to Albert Bravo Biosca, Tommaso Ciarli, Louise Marston, Ben Martin, Alessia Moneta, and Paul Nightingale, as well as seminar participants at NESTA and SPRU, and two anonymous reviewers for many helpful comments and discussions.

This is an important question as development policy is often formed on the basis that placing resources in the hands of women results in greater household welfare. Indonesia provides the ideal opportunity to study this issue because it is home to ethnic groups with very different gender norms from male dominance (the patrilineal Batak) to female dominance (the matrilineal Minangkabau). Using IFLS data for three rounds, we consider the impact of decision-making by the dominant spouse on household expenditure on education. We find that, in Indonesia, when the dominant spouse (male or female) has sole control of decision making, there is an overall negative impact on education expenditure. This leads us to argue that it is more important to consider the issue of spousal dominance, than to wholly focus on gender. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

I find that management forecasts of annual earnings conveying relatively large negative earnings news are systematically optimistic, and it is more (less) pronounced for firms with greater litigation risk or financial distress (net insider sale). The results suggest that fear of immediate lawsuits or job loss instead of trading opportunism motivates managers to understate large negative earnings news to mitigate immediate significantly negative consequences. I also provide evidence consistent with the market not identifying the bias in managers' annual earnings guidance. This study has important implications for market participants relying on annual management forecasts to form earnings expectations early in the fiscal year and for regulators attempting to balance the quality and quantity of management guidance.

Auditors are regularly criticized for having high thresholds, which results in too few going concern reports. We apply Shannon entropy from information theory as the criterion to evaluate the informational value of the audit report. Shannon entropy provides a measure of the expected information content associated with the realization of an uncertain event. First, we estimate the client's probability of bankruptcy in our sample. Second, using the distribution of the probability of bankruptcy we calculate the entropy at each point of the probability of bankruptcy. We find that entropy is maximized at the 0.08 probability of bankruptcy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper conducts two-stage least-squares regressions. The second stage is a regression of the logarithm of real gross domestic product per capita on each of the cultural attributes that are considered in this study. In the first stage, the geographic factors that statistically explain a cultural aspect are used as instrumental variables.

Our panel dataset that includes 353 MFIs from across the globe indicates that 'only' 55% of the MFIs have a CEO with a business education. The empirical results indicate that MFIs with CEOs who have a business education perform significantly better, financially and socially, than MFIs managed by CEOs with other types of educational backgrounds.

More specifically, using data on Italian banks' bilateral interbank positions between 1998 and 2013, we analyze the impact of the following events on each bank's network centrality: the liquidity crisis in August 2007, the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, Eurosystem's long term refinancing operations (LTROs) between 2009 and 2012, the sovereign debt crisis in July 2011, and the announcement of Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) in 2012. The results show that the 2007 liquidity crisis and especially the collapse of Lehman Brothers are associated with a marked reduction of the relative interconnectedness of the Italian banking sector (i.e., a shift in the distribution of banks' centrality to the left, away from the most connected bank). In the following years, the system progressively recovered its initial patterns of integration among banks, which coincided with the main Eurosystem's monetary policy interventions. However, the average outcome conceals different results across banks, depending on their characteristics and initial positions within the system. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We show that under standard assumptions, excess returns are affine in the risk neutral innovations in the factors. This framework has several important advantages. First, it allows for an easy estimation of models that are more flexible than the AR(1). Indeed, we estimate models with more general dynamics, like ARFIMA(p, d, q), almost as easily as AR(1). Second, within our framework the dimension of the unrestricted model is the same for the AR(1) as it is for the richer models, and does not expand in line with the state vector as it does in a yield or log price framework. This makes it appropriate to test all of these risk neutral dynamic specifications against the same OLS unrestricted alternative. Our results for the US Treasury bond market show that the unrestricted model is preferred to the AR(1) by the Bayesian Information Criterion, but the opposite conclusion is reached for more flexible models. A final advantage of the excess returns framework is that the pricing errors are much lower than for the equivalent log price system. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The potential welfare gain from optimizing capital taxation in the presence of a universal retirement transfer system is relatively higher.

The context is one of a fragile state in which destructive legacies of Liberia's 1989-2003 civil war continue to dominate people's lives. A nine-month civic education intervention administered by Liberian civil society organization partners provided training on election procedures and a forum for monthly discussion of governance issues. A nine-month security committee intervention administered in partnership with the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Liberia provided a forum for villagers and international peacekeepers to discuss security threats and develop violence early warning and reaction procedures, with the aim of improving citizens' perceptions of security during the election. We evaluate these programs' effects on actual voter behavior in addition to surveyed attitudes. We find that civic education increased enthusiasm for electoral participation, produced a coordinated shift from parochial to national candidates, and increased willingness to report on manipulation. A program combining the two interventions had similar effects. The security committees produced a modest reduction in parochial voting. The policy implications are that third-party actors can play a productive role in helping to overcome barriers to information, voter coordination, and security.

This effect appears to be linked to banks' exposure to rollover risk resulting from their increasing use of short-term uninsured funding. Banks that use more wholesale funding shorten both the maturity of newly issued loans and the maturity of their loan portfolios. These results are not present among banks that rely predominantly on insured deposits. The link between wholesale funding and loan maturity is robust, and holds when we include firm-year fixed effects, suggesting that the decline in loan maturity is bank driven. In line with this premise, we find that the slope of the loan yield curve becomes steeper for banks that use more wholesale funding and that borrowers turn to the bond market to raise funding with longer maturity in response to banks' loan maturity shortening.","[Paligorova, Teodora] Bank Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Santos, Joao A.

The expansion of the rural road network in Africa is praised for reducing spatial isolation, lowering transport cost, increasing access to markets, and bringing services closer to home. However, different segments of society will benefit differently from the establishment of a rural road. This difference may lead to dynamics that either exacerbate or reduce existing inequities, which forms the central question for this paper. As part of a broader study on the multiple (in)direct effects of rural roads on productive employment, we undertook oral testimonies in four municipalities to explore how people perceive road impacts on livelihoods, mobility, and work. CLDs were then used to assemble those seemingly loose observations into a systematized view of the whole. The exercise reveals conflicting feedback processes that may dominate system at different times and drive the inequities between surplus food producers and laborer households up or down. The method used can be particularly useful for studying similar infrastructures that seemingly bring benefits to all, but may cause subtle, concealed or delayed effects, and ultimately surprising system behavior.

Here, we test whether people are inclined to forgo monetary rewards in order to retain agency when faced with choices that could lead to losses and gains. In a simple choice task, we show that participants choose to pay in order to control their own payoff more than they should if they were to maximize monetary rewards and minimize monetary losses. This tendency cannot be explained by participants' overconfidence in their own ability, as their perceived ability was elicited and accounted for. Nor can the results be explained by lack of information. Rather, the results seem to reflect an intrinsic value for choice, which emerges in the domain of both gains and of losses. Moreover, our data indicate that participants are aware that they are making suboptimal choices in the normative sense, but do so anyway, presumably for psychological gains.","[Bobadilla-Suarez, Sebastian; Sharot, Tali] UCL, Dept Expt Psychol, Affect Brain Lab, London WC1H 0AP, England; [Bobadilla-Suarez, Sebastian] Alan Turing Inst, 96 Euston Rd, London NW1 2DB, England; [Sunstein, Cass R.] Harvard Univ, Harvard Law Sch, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of London; University College London; Harvard University,"Bobadilla-Suarez, S; Sharot, T (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Expt Psychol, Affect Brain Lab, London WC1H 0AP, England.;Bobadilla-Suarez, S (通讯作者)，Alan Turing Inst, 96 Euston Rd, London NW1 2DB, England.;Sunstein, CR (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Harvard Law Sch, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",sebastian.suarez.12@ucl.ac.uk; csunstei@law.harvard.edu; t.sharot@ucl.ac.uk,"Bobadilla-Suarez, Sebastian/AAF-3277-2020; Sunstein, Cass/AAV-8196-2020","Bobadilla-Suarez, Sebastian/0000-0002-5951-0772",Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT); Wellcome Trust,Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust),"This work was supported by a scholarship from Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT) to S.B.S. and a Wellcome Trust Career Development Fellowship to T.S.

In today's turbulent economic environment, competitiveness has become more important than ever for a firm's survival and success. However, there is a gap in studies focusing on corporate governance and capital structure in the context of Sri Lanka. The aim of this study is to empirically investigate whether attributes of corporate governance affect decisions on capital structure of listed companies in Sri Lanka. The sample of the study consisted of 138 non-financial listed companies for five-year period from 2009 to 2013. Board size, board composition, leadership structure, board committees, and managerial ownership were used as corporate governance variables whereas debt ratio as the measure of capital structure and return on assets (ROA) and firm size as control variables. The variables were empirically tested by multiple regression analysis. The findings revealed that there is no significant effect of corporate governance attributes except board composition & board committee on capital structure. The variable of board composition has a significant positive effect and board committee has a negative effect on capital structure.","[Bulathsinhalage, Siromi] Adv Technol Inst, Gampaha, Sri Lanka; [Pathirawasam, Chandrapala] Univ Kelaniya, Fac Commerce & Management Studies, Dept Commerce & Financial Management, Colombo, Sri Lanka",University Kelaniya,"Bulathsinhalage, S (通讯作者)，Adv Technol Inst, Gampaha, Sri Lanka.",Siromibulathsinhalage@yahoo.com; pathi3@yahoo.com,,,,,,,40,14,17,0,10,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

Aggregate intangible capital stock is usually estimated using the so-called Corrado-Hulten-Sichel (CHS) new growth accounting framework. Yet this framework has not received much academic scrutiny to-date. This article proposes a validity test of two intangible investment series in the CHS framework, namely brand equity and architectural and engineering designs. The test involves assessing the extent to which these intangible investment series explain the demand for trademarks and design rights. The econometric analysis is performed on an unbalanced panel of 32 countries from 1980 to 2010. The results suggest that brand equity investment is a powerful predictor of trademark applications. However, investment in design activity is not correlated with the count of design rights, which I take as evidence that current methodologies do not account well for design activities.","[de Rassenfosse, Gaetan] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Coll Management Technol, Chair Innovat & Intellectual Property Policy, 0DY 201 A,Stn 5, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne,"de Rassenfosse, G (通讯作者)，Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Coll Management Technol, Chair Innovat & Intellectual Property Policy, 0DY 201 A,Stn 5, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",gaetan.derassenfosse@epfl.ch,"de Rassenfosse, Gaétan/HJB-1549-2022; de Rassenfosse, Gaétan/A-3051-2009","de Rassenfosse, Gaétan/0000-0002-7862-0918;","Australian Government Department of Industry, Innovation, Science, Research, and Tertiary Education (DIISRTE)","Australian Government Department of Industry, Innovation, Science, Research, and Tertiary Education (DIISRTE)","I performed part of the research when I was a senior research fellow at the University of Melbourne.

This paper examines the impact of household perceptions of land tenure security on technical efficiency using detailed household-level data collected in Minle County in northwest China. The authors find that the (perceived) tenure security provided by land certificates encourages part-time farming with relatively low technical efficiency. The renting out of land by households with migrant members can only partly make up for this negative effect, because land rental markets are thin and highly fragmented. Therefore, the provision of land certificates to rural households has a negative impact on technical efficiency. For tenure security provided by the expected absence of land reallocations in the near future, on the other hand, the authors find that it reduces temporary migration and thereby contributes to higher technical efficiency.","[Ma, Xianlei; Heerink, Nico; Feng, Shuyi; Shi, Xiaoping] Nanjing Agr Univ, China Ctr Land Policy Res, 6 Tongwei Rd, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Ma, Xianlei] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Publ Anministrat, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Heerink, Nico] Wageningen Univ, Dept Social Sci, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Heerink, Nico; Feng, Shuyi; Shi, Xiaoping] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Publ Adm, 6 Tongwei Rd, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Heerink, Nico] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Publ Adm, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Nanjing Agricultural University; Nanjing Agricultural University; Wageningen University & Research; Nanjing Agricultural University; Zhejiang University,"Ma, XL (通讯作者)，Nanjing Agr Univ, China Ctr Land Policy Res, 6 Tongwei Rd, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Ma, XL (通讯作者)，Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Publ Anministrat, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",maxianlei@njau.edu.cn; nico.heerink@wur.nl; shuyifeng@njau.edu.cn; serena2@njau.edu.cn,"Heerink, Nico/AAA-2045-2020","Heerink, Nico/0000-0002-9911-3501","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71373127, 71573134, 71322301]; Programme Strategic Scientific Alliances of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW); Ministry of Science and Technology, P.R.

The Portuguese case is particularly relevant to study because the level of participation in the labor market for older workers is about six times higher when compared with European countries. The empirical analysis uses Quadros de Pessoal (Tables of Personnel) Portuguese micro database, employer-employee matched files. Specifically, we use data of workers with more than 50 years old and hired during the previous 5 years, splitting the cross-section sample according to firm size. The tested explanatory variables are related to employee, job and firm characteristics. The results show that some determinants of the age of hiring are similar to those obtained previously for other countries. Additionally, sectors of activity with specific private occupational pensions plans affect the hiring of old workers and there are signs of changes in the hiring behavior in last years, probably associated with recent changes in social security laws. Furthermore, the results are relevant for policy design since they identify the sectors and jobs where opportunities for hiring older workers are higher. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This study investigates how weather shocks triggered social distress in British colonial Africa. Further, it intervenes in a long-standing and unsettled debate concerning the effects of agricultural commercialization on the abilities of rural communities to cope with exogenous shocks. We collect qualitative evidence from annual administrative records to explore the mechanisms linking weather extremes to harvest failures and social distress. We also conduct econometric testing on a novel panel dataset of 143 administrative districts across west, south-central, and east Africa in the Interwar Era (1920-39). Our findings are twofold. First, we find robust evidence that rainfall anomalies (both drought and excessive precipitation) are associated with spikes in imprisonment (our proxy for social distress). We argue that the key causal pathway is the loss of agricultural income, which results in higher imprisonment for theft, unrest, debt, and tax default. Second, we find that the impact of weather shocks on distress is partially mitigated by the cultivation of export crops. Our findings suggest that, even in the British colonial context, smallholder export crop cultivation led to higher private incomes as well as greater public investment. Our findings speak to a topic of considerable urgency today as the process of global climate change accelerates, generating more severe and unpredictable climatic extremes. An increased understanding and identification of adaptive and mitigating factors would assist in targeting policy interventions and designing adaptive institutions to support vulnerable rural societies.

The confirmatory bias provides a unified rationale for several existing stylized facts, including excess volatility, excess volume, and momentum. It also delivers novel predictions for which we find empirical support using data on analysts' earnings forecasts: traders update beliefs depending on the sign of past signals and previous beliefs, and, at the stock level, differences of opinion are larger when past signals have different signs.","[Pouget, Sebastien; Villeneuve, Stephane] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Pouget, Sebastien] IAE, Grenoble, France; [Pouget, Sebastien; Villeneuve, Stephane] Univ Toulouse 1 Capitole, Toulouse, France; [Sauvagnat, Julien] Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy; [Sauvagnat, Julien] IGIER, Milan, Italy; [Sauvagnat, Julien] CEPR, Washington, DC USA",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Bocconi University; Bocconi University; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Pouget, S (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France.;Pouget, S (通讯作者)，IAE, Grenoble, France.;Pouget, S (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse 1 Capitole, Toulouse, France.",spouget@univ-tlse1.fr,"SAUVAGNAT, JULIEN/D-2936-2016","SAUVAGNAT, JULIEN/0000-0001-7930-8558",Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-09-BLAN-0358-01]; Chaire SCOR at IDEI-R; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-09-BLAN-0358] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR),Agence Nationale de la Recherche(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Chaire SCOR at IDEI-R; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"We are grateful to Nicholas Barberis, Bruno Biais, Sylvain Friederich, Ron Kaniel, Hyun-woo Lee, Thomas Mariotti, Richard Payne, Matthew Rabin, Jean-Charles Rochet, Hersh Shefrin, Dimitri Vayanos, and Wei Xiong; seminar participants at Bristol University and Toulouse University; and participants at the American Finance Association and the NBER Behavioral Finance meeting for providing useful comments.

This paper studies road pricing with reference-dependent preferences, modeled by a linear gain-loss utility function. Given this specification, we find that the socially optimal road toll is smaller than the optimal toll in the absence of reference dependence, and it declines in the degree of loss aversion. Loss aversion can also explain the empirical observation that support for road pricing is lower before than after its introduction. We further show that loss aversion may increase or reduce lobbying efforts by driver organizations against the introduction of tolling. It will increase lobbying if a high toll is proposed but drivers initially believe that the probability that it will be introduced is small. Lastly, loss aversion unambiguously reduces lobbying by organizations of non-drivers (representing, for example, environmentalists or public transport users) in favor of the introduction of a toll.

The model also features endogenous balance sheet choices and a novel formulation of the capital ratio, in which assets are risk-weighted by risk-sensitivity measures. We find that the presence of endogenous LTV ratios exacerbates the procyclicality of lending. Moreover, the model captures the role played by prudential regulatory frameworks in affecting business cycle fluctuations and restoring macroeconomic and financial stability.

We observe positive herding effects in different types of funds during recessionary periods, whereas we fmd evidence of negative herding behavior in most types of funds during expansionary periods. Our results for asymmetric herding indicate that US fund managers exhibit stronger positive herding behavior when the market is decreasing, when the fund size is smaller and when the fund's period of establishment is shorter during a recessionary period. Conversely, a negative herding effect is stronger when the market is rising, when the fund is larger, and when the funds period of establishment is longer during an expansionary period. The herding behavior of US fund managers is primarily informational during an expansionary period, but significant information-value herding only exists in the following six months.","[Fang, Hao] Hwa Hsia Univ Technol, Dept Assets & Property Management, 111 Gong Jhuan Rd, New Taipei 23568, Taiwan; [Shen, Chung-Hua] Shih Chien Univ, Coll Management, Dept Finance & Banking, 70 Dazhi St, Taipei 10462, Taiwan; [Lee, Yen-Hsien] Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Finance, 200 Chung Pei Rd, Chungli 32023, Taiwan",Shih Chien University; Chung Yuan Christian University,"Lee, YH (通讯作者)，Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Finance, 200 Chung Pei Rd, Chungli 32023, Taiwan.",hihaoa@gmail.com; clishen01@ntu.edu.tw; yh@cycu.edu.tw,"Fang, Hao/AAW-3714-2021","Fang, Hao/0000-0003-3874-5537",,,,,38,19,21,2,36,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

PES programs have been increasingly applied to communities who collectively manage their lands. While a number of authors have expressed concerns about the ability of said programs to generate additional environmental benefits and the potential for PES to counter community resource management arrangements, few empirical studies have explicitly examined PES in the context of communal resource management. Here, we take advantage of the gradual rollout of an Ecuadorian PES program to compare land-use behavior on collective lands in participant communities to households in communities that are waiting to participate. The goals of the analysis are to (a) identify if the PES program has produced changes in land-use, (b) assess the degree to which household characteristics and communal governance conditions drive land-use behavior, and (c) explore the interplay between PES and communal resource management institutions. Data were gathered from a cross-sectional survey of 399 households located in 11 communities. We use difference-in-differences to estimate the average effect of PES program participation on household behavior. Logit models, coupled with qualitative analysis, unpack how communal governance characteristics influence land-use behavior and the interplay between communal governance conditions and PES. We find that PES reduced the number of households grazing livestock on collective lands by 12%, however, household and communal governance factors are also instrumental in determining land-use decisions. Our results provide empirical insights into the debate over PES in collective resource management and illustrate how PES and communal resource management institutions can build upon each other to attain desired household conservation behavior.

This paper argues that measuring these reallocation effects requires accounting for detailed input types because, for example, differences in wages across producers often reflect the skill mix of workers, not allocative inefficiency. The paper develops an approach to measuring reallocation that accounts for worker skill and the composition of capital assets, thus focuses on the set of countries for which this information is available. The results show once input heterogeneity is accounted for, the effects of reallocation on aggregate productivity were small on average, but sizable in a subset of countries. Panel regressions indicate that reallocation effects are related to population distribution and government effectiveness.","[Samuels, Jon D.] Bur Econ Anal, 4600 Silver Hill Rd, Suitland, MD 20746 USA; [Samuels, Jon D.] Inst Quantitat Social Sci, Cambridge, MA 02313 USA",,"Samuels, JD (通讯作者)，Bur Econ Anal, 4600 Silver Hill Rd, Suitland, MD 20746 USA.;Samuels, JD (通讯作者)，Inst Quantitat Social Sci, Cambridge, MA 02313 USA.",jon.samuels@bea.gov,"Samuels, Jon/AAR-9054-2020","Samuels, Jon/0000-0002-7040-1366",,,,,21,6,6,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

A shallower credit term structure predicts decreases in default risk and increases in future profitability, as well as favorable earnings surprises. Further, the slope of the credit term structure negatively predicts future stock returns. While systematic slope risk is priced, information diffusion from the credit market to equities, particularly in less visible stocks, plays an additional role in accounting for return predictability from credit slopes. That is, such predictability is less evident in stocks with high institutional ownership, analyst coverage, and liquidity, and vice versa. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Our system generalised method of moments estimation results indicate that the macroeconomic environment influences firm growth both directly and indirectly.

The contesting of rents associated with different policies affects the regulatory structure and influences the political choice of an environmental policy target.

Greater diversification across risk measures is conducive to closing this knowledge gap. What we find is that performance increases considerably if we combine single-item risk measures to form multiple-item risk measures. Results are improved the more single-item measures they contain, and also if these single-item risk measures use different elicitation methods.

New global institutions were established to promote universal norms of governance based on the 1992 Dublin Principles and its version of Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM). Many of these prescriptions were contested, not least because of their advocacy of market-based approaches to address what were posed as challenges of scarcity and environmental sustainability. The paper examines the drivers that have informed different conceptualisations of water governance. It shows how scarcity has become central to narratives that sought to focus governance at the river basin scale, to restrict water use in favour of the protection and restoration of water resource ecosystems and to prioritize economic efficiency through market mechanisms. It then reviews the experience of a diverse set of countries, some of which have implemented systemic governance reforms and others whose trajectories have been more evolutionary, driven by domestic contexts. These practical experiences, supported by a growing understanding of polycentric approaches and how networks cross and link a range of geographic and administrative scales, have given rise to alternatives to the normative IWRM, river basin-focused approaches to water governance. Despite continuing concerns about planetary environmental boundaries and transboundary security, these are proving to be weak motivations for adoption of formal global systems of water governance. Instead, new narratives emphasise locally-diverse approaches that see water governed within problem-sheds rather than water-sheds. Water governance remains a scene of contestation between local and global criteria and developmental and environmental goals. But, in the face of challenges of complexity and diversity and the emerging understanding of network governance, emerging practitioner oriented guidance is focusing on general principles and explicitly avoiding normative approaches.

In response, many governments have enacted or are considering taxes on energy-dense foods. Perhaps the most commonly recommended policy is a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). This paper estimates the extent to which a tax on SSBs is passed through to consumers in the form of higher prices. We examine the first city-level tax on SSBs in the United States, which was enacted by the voters of Berkeley, California, in November 2014. We collected the prices of various brands and sizes of SSBs and other beverages before and after the implementation of the tax from a near-census of convenience stores and supermarkets in Berkeley, California. We also collected prices from stores in a control city: San Francisco, where a similar voter referendum failed despite majority support. Estimates from difference-in-differences models indicate that, across all brands and sizes of products examined, 43.1 percent (95 percent confidence interval: 27.7 to 58.4 percent) of the Berkeley tax was passed on to consumers. The estimates also are consistent with cross-border shopping.

We examine default rates by initial rating, accuracy ratios, migration metrics, instantaneous upgrade and downgrade intensities, and rating changes over bonds' lives in multivariate regressions. These approaches reveal substantial and persistent differences across broad asset classes, as well as across subcategories of structured finance products. Our results are best explained by variation in rating agency incentives and variation in underlying risk profiles. We conclude that regulations requiring ratings to perform comparably across asset classes will prove difficult to enforce.

We introduce novel instrumental variables based on common legal system origin, common federal system, geographical position and relative country size. The positive relationship between fiscal decentralisation and economic growth that we find remains valid when using these instrumental variables. Using fiscal decentralisation measures that better reflect the autonomy of subnational governments changes this relationship.

If the market size increases with number of firms, patent protection reduces R&D investment if the cost of R&D is sufficiently high, and higher product differentiation increases the possibility of lower R&D investment under patent protection.

Properly designing and assessing housing policies in China or elsewhere requires knowing the price and income elasticities of housing demand. While demand elasticities for housing have been much studied around the globe, relatively few studies have estimated housing elasticities in formerly planned economies. We use the unusually rich data from the 1991 to 2006 Chinese Health and Nutrition Surveys to estimate that in China's renewed market phase the permanent income elasticity of housing services demand in China is .70 and the elasticity of housing services demand with respect to the price of space is .64. We also estimate that in China the own-price and income elasticities of the demand for habitable space are .38 and .29, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Targeting the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, it cuts funding to warlords by discouraging manufacturers from sourcing tin, tungsten, and tantalum from the region. Building from Mancur Olson's stationary bandit metaphor, we describe some channels through which the legislation could backfire, inciting violence. Using georeferenced data, we find the legislation increased looting of civilians and shifted militia battles toward unregulated gold-mining territories.

In the basic model with urban unemployment, we find that an inflow of foreign capital will expand the skilled-unskilled wage inequality if the elasticity of substitution between labor arid capital in the urban unskilled sector is large enough, and that stricter pollution control will expand the wage inequality if the elasticity of substitution between labor and pollution is small enough. In the extended model with full employment, we find that the intensity of capital plays a crucial role.

The aim of this paper was to put forth a three-dimensional approach of total quality management and provide some concrete action ways through which organizations in Romania that implement total or partial quality management integrated systems would produce significant competitive advantages. The main research methods used were: the questionnaire, document analysis, applications offered by Word and Excel and the Statistical Package for Social Sciences, one of the most complete software packages with which we calculated means and standard deviations and determined and analysed correlations between variables and various quality parameters. In this research, have been identified the main key success factors, the vulnerabilities and weaknesses of the systems, their causes and the necessary changes through which the three-dimensional approach of total quality management could become a preferred strategic option with a major positive impact upon business excellence.

In an out-of-sample exercise incorporating realistic transaction costs, the portfolio strategy delivers a Sharpe ratio of 0.82 with positive skewness.

Each and every step in survey generation processes is explained starting from expert interviews and finally statistical analyses. Starting with 45 candidate questions, the study offers a 28 item scale that can measure service quality in after sales car services with high reliability. The scale can be extended to cover aftersales services in general for any type of product and also could be used as input to other models such as QFD and MADM.

The trigger, in the case that is reported in this paper, was the installation of a new college in a rural community in Northern Ghana where heretofore, no comprehensive tertiary education had been available. The college established an outreach program which was destined to provide the community with increased opportunities for improving the overall social and economic well-being. Thus, creating an outer circle of engagement through accessing government officials, local businesses, community councils, health workers, traditional leaders (tribal chiefs), religious leaders and heads of NGOs on topics like labor relations, conflict resolution, sustainability management, social responsibility, cultural diversity, and social inclusiveness. At the onset, the members of the community contributed their traditional views on these topics and how this would combine with knowledge brought in through the new college. Since rural communities in Africa have a very intimate and intense relation to nature, good hands-on skills and an abundance of indigenous wisdom, it was felt that this combination would result in a rich body of knowledge and competencies. Ultimately, a valuable base would be developed from this knowledge for an inventory of intellectual capital that can be transferred to generations of descendants. At the heart of this endeavor was the Center for Cross Cultural Ethics and Sustainable Development, an institution created by the college, to move these efforts forward. From a theoretical perspective, this case embeds a variety of systems-thinking constructs. First, Co-creation which combines indigenous wisdom with new knowledge guardian brought in by the college's academicians and outside practitioners assigned to the Center for Cross Cultural Ethics and Sustainable Development. Second, coalescing equi-finality and multi-finality to arrive at a balance between community needs that can be satisfied short-term and needs for which long-term solutions are required. Third, conjoining self-organization and relationality. Finally, to generate intellectual capital from both the traditional and the newly acquired skills and knowledge in the community, a systems-thinking interpretation would be employed where an auto-poietic system (the intellectual capital) interacts with the environment (the community) and processes self-reference and other-reference.","[Bardy, Roland; Rubens, Arthur] Florida Gulf Coast Univ, Lutgert Coll Business, Ft Myers, FL 33965 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida Gulf Coast University,"Bardy, R (通讯作者)，Florida Gulf Coast Univ, Lutgert Coll Business, Ft Myers, FL 33965 USA.",rbardy@t-online.de; arubens@fgcu.edu,,,,,,,40,1,2,1,10,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-911218-31-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2017,,,,,,,18,25,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI0KF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404891000003,0

This paper further examines the co-movement and dynamics (i.e. changes) within and between these markets. This empirical analysis finds implied volatility of the treasury market MOVE Index can forecast the implied volatility of the equities market (VIX), though not always reliably. The signals between the VIX and MOVE Indexes in the last ten years has changed and the gap between these markets has widened. A relationship not witnessed since the early days before the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. The contributing factor to this widening gap is the greater volatility experienced by the MOVE Index compared to its VIX counterpart heightened by the record-low global interest rates and lack of liquidity in the bond market.

In this article we delve into the study of organizational innovation by presenting a comparative analysis of this type of innovation at the European level between 2006 and 2012. This study is based on the data of the Eurostat's Community Innovation Survey (CIS), using CIS 2006 (2006-2008) and CIS 2012 (2010-2012). In a preliminary analysis, we observe a decrease in the organizational innovative activity at the European level. Since it is a study that includes temporal evolution, the article studies the persistence of the organizational innovation in the context of organizational learning and includes other factors such as size, countries and sector organization in the research. When the company size factor is analysed, better performance of the large enterprises in the different types of organizational innovation is observed; when abandonment of organizational innovation is examined, further declined in the small and medium enterprises is identified. Additionally, the role of organizational innovation involving external relations is studied, as organizational innovation is not restricted to organizational structures, administrative processes, and managerial practices ad intra but opens to the environment in which the organization develops, and it is influenced by the effect of building innovation communities of practice. Among other contributions, the research shows the deterioration in organizational innovation as one third of the companies that innovated organizationally have stopped doing so in the period analysed, the establishment of preferences among the types of Organisational Innovations, the lower weight of the Innovation in new methods of organising external relations and its good resilience. In terms of sectors, the role that Information and Communication Technologies can play in promoting the organizational innovation seems relevant.","[Bujidos-Casado, Maria; Navio-Marco, Julio; Rodrigo-Moya, Beatriz] Univ Nacl Educ Distancia, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED),"Bujidos-Casado, M (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Educ Distancia, Madrid, Spain.",mbujidos1@alumno.uned.es; jnavio@cee.uned.es; brodrigo@cee.uned.es,"MARCO, JULIO NAVIO/R-9286-2018; RODRIGO Moya, Beatriz/ABF-7756-2021","MARCO, JULIO NAVIO/0000-0001-5163-9777;",,,,,47,2,3,0,10,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-911218-31-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2017,,,,,,,42,50,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI0KF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404891000006,0

Up to now there are only few studies investigating how these pictures are perceived. The current study examines how these pictures from pig fattening barns are looked at and how they are evaluated by students (without and with connection to agriculture; in the following named as citizens and farmers) to derive recommendations for the choice of pictures. Therefore, a survey is combined with eye-tracking. Pictures of a pen with fully slatted floor are evaluated negatively by citizens and different pictures of the same pen influence the evaluation. This is not the case for farmers who evaluate the pictures in a more neutral manner. However, the eye movements of farmers and citizens when viewing the pictures are very similar in general. Independent of the picture, the face regions and bodies of the animals are always viewed at first. Furthermore, we show that citizens do not recognize toys in a barn and unattractive or common pictures are viewed less. First recommendations for choosing pictures for public relations in agriculture can be drawn from the results.","[Busch, Gesa; Gauly, Sarah Arianna; Spiller, Achim] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany; [Busch, Gesa] Freie Univ Bozen, Bolzano, Italy",University of Gottingen; Free University of Bozen-Bolzano,"Busch, G (通讯作者)，Georg August Univ Gottingen, Dept Agrarokon & Rurale Entwicklung, Mkt Lebensmittel & Agrarprod, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",gesa.busch@unibz.it,"Busch, Gesa/AAI-1529-2020; Busch, Gesa/JHT-5738-2023; Spiller, Achim/CAJ-5518-2022",,,,,,48,13,13,0,8,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

In spite that managerial incentives influence corporate R&D spending, some also argue corporate R&D spending a function of managerial incentive schemes. This paper applies the simultaneous equation to investigate the association between managerial discretion on R&D investments and the incentive scheme of CEO compensations by using the sample firms listed in Taiwan Security Exchange and Taipei Exchange. The results indicate that the listed firms in Taiwan simultaneously determine corporate R&D investments and CEO compensations. They reward their CEOs in compliance with their efforts on R&D investments and CEO compensation motivates CEOs to align their interests with firms' long-term investments on R&D. A further analysis of the protection effect from the directors' and officers' (D&O) liability insurance suggests that D&O protection intensifies the relationship between R&D investments and CEO compensation. It encourages CEOs to allocate resources on R&D activities and make CEO incentive contracts efficacious on corporate long-term investments. The result is robust in the electronic industry of Taiwan.

The present study selected some famous academic journals in the field of tourism and reviewed the studies of environmental interpretation research. Findings indicated that in the past decade, environmental interpretation research mainly focused on characteristics of effective personal interpretation and interpretive programs as well as interpretation outcomes. Most studies adopted quantitative methods and data were collected via questionnaire surveys and interviews. Countries like America, Australia, Canada, New Zealand etc. attached importance to interpretation research and the settings involved in the research were mainly national parks, outdoor recreation and entertainment settings, wild life reserves and nature-based settings etc. It was found that interpretation studies gradually shift to visitors' affective outcomes. The author of this study holds that future interpretation research should base empirical studies on appropriate theories and scientific measurement tools. In addition, interpretation at cultural heritage settings should be taken into consideration.","[Cheng, Tian'e; Cao, Mingming] Northwest Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Xian 710127, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jun] Shanxi Normal Univ, Coll Geog Sci, Linfen 041000, Peoples R China",Northwest University Xi'an; Shanxi Normal University,"Wang, J (通讯作者)，Shanxi Normal Univ, Coll Geog Sci, Linfen 041000, Peoples R China.",,,,Research Project: A Study of Optimization of Interpretive System in Tourist Destinations in Shaanxi [2013JK0301]; Research Project: Teaching Team of Translation Courses at Northwest University [JX13058],Research Project: A Study of Optimization of Interpretive System in Tourist Destinations in Shaanxi; Research Project: Teaching Team of Translation Courses at Northwest University,Funded by the Research Projects: A Study of Optimization of Interpretive System in Tourist Destinations in Shaanxi (2013JK0301); Teaching Team of Translation Courses at Northwest University (JX13058).,,30,1,1,4,10,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-437-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,32.0,,,,,,481,487,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6HK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426689600100,0

As the most widely consumed animal protein, a special focus is placed on poultry, which is disaggregated into two separate product groups, namely IQF portions and other poultry products, providing an improved understanding of demand preferences among different poultry cuts. In light of the changes that have occurred in both global agricultural markets and the South African consumer environment over the past decade, the model is estimated based on monthly data from January 2008 to September 2014, yielding short run elasticities. Expenditure elasticity estimates for IQF portions, other poultry products, pork, mutton and beef were 1.17, 1.24, 0.44, 1.07 and 0.8 respectively and the compensated own-price elasticities were estimated as -0.61, -0.43, -0.72, -0.96 and -0.11 for IQF portions, other poultry products, pork, mutton and beef, respectively. Most of the estimated elasticities conformed to a priori expectations, with the exception of poultry expenditure elasticities, which were higher than expected and in line with luxury goods, rather than normal goods, as the most affordable source of protein. Within the lower income consumer groups, where poultry dominates meat consumption, it was argued that meat in itself is a luxury good, reflected in the elasticities of poultry as the most affordable entry point into the meat market.","[Delport, Marion; Louw, Marlene; Davids, Tracy; Vermeulen, Hester; Meyer, Ferdi] Univ Pretoria, Bur Food & Agr Policy, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Delport, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Bur Food & Agr Policy, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",mariondelport21@gmail.com,"Davids, Tracy/AAH-3782-2019; Vermeulen, Hester/P-5739-2016","Davids, Tracy/0000-0001-7576-8135;",,,,,39,16,18,1,14,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2017,56.0,1,,,,,13,27,,10.1080/03031853.2017.1286249,0.0,,,15,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,EO1XP,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000396491500002,0

We also focused on the size of lobbyist expenditures. Our investigation suggests that neither of the investigated strategies prevailed and other strategies may be naturally used by lobbyists.","[Fisar, Milos; Spalek, Jiri; Urbanova, Daniela] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Fisar, M (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno, Czech Republic.",milos.fisar@econ.muni.cz; jiri.spalek@econ.muni.cz; 370727@mail.muni.cz,"Špalek, Jiří/J-9210-2012","Špalek, Jiří/0000-0001-5832-4946",Czech Science Foundation Impact of Transparency of Lobbying on Democratization and Its Consequences [16-08786S]; Masaryk University [MUNI/A/0996/2015],Czech Science Foundation Impact of Transparency of Lobbying on Democratization and Its Consequences; Masaryk University,"This research was supported by the Czech Science Foundation, project no. 16-08786S Impact of Transparency of Lobbying on Democratization and Its Consequences, and Masaryk University, project no.

This study examines whether the source of debt matters for women's role in household financial decisions. Drawing on a household survey from rural Tamil Nadu, we categorise women's loans along the lines of accessibility and formality into 'planned loans' and 'instant loans'. We find that 'instant loans'support women's bargaining power in various types of household financial decisions, whereas 'planned loans' have no impact. This surprising result is better understood when the nature of 'instant loans' is examined -these are frequently usurious, involve coercive enforcement methods and are considered socially debasing. Hence women who use them perform a convenient role for their households and in return gain some negotiating power.","[Garikipati, Supriya] Univ Liverpool, Sch Management, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Garikipati, Supriya; Agier, Isabelle; Guerin, Isabelle; Szafarz, Ariane] Ctr European Res Microfinance CERMi, Brussels, Belgium; [Agier, Isabelle; Guerin, Isabelle] Univ Paris Diderot, CESSMA, IRD Cessma, Paris, France; [Szafarz, Ariane] ULB, SBS EM, CEB, Brussels, Belgium",University of Liverpool; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Garikipati, S (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpoolg, Sch Management, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.",s.garikipati@liverpool.ac.uk,"Guerin, Isabelle/AAU-4398-2021","Garikipati, Supriya/0000-0001-8576-8227; Szafarz, Ariane/0000-0002-5286-421X",French Institute of Pondicherry; Belgian Science Policy Office,French Institute of Pondicherry; Belgian Science Policy Office(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office),This work was supported by the French Institute of Pondicherry and the Belgian Science Policy Office.,,45,21,23,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Many studies demonstrate the fact that the substantial part of the major causes of mortality and morbidity is closely related to the social status and also to the economic position of the population. People with the highest socio-economic status have the best health, whilst the lowest health level is observed in humans with the lowest socio-economic status. Thus, it can be stated there is a very close linkage. In general, diabetes mellitus is associated with other diseases too. The socio-economic aspects play an important role in a field of the related research. The outcome of the analysis shows that the Gini coefficient and a share of the Roma nationality have a positive impact on the standardised mortality rate of the diabetes mellitus, whilst the unemployment rate, the income, the poverty, and the income quintile ratio have a negative influence. The biggest impact is caused by the income quintile ratio, which can be described in the terms of its meaning as one of the most important income indicators. This outcome is able to serve as an elementary part of a platform for further research.","[Gavurova, Beata] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Banking & Investment, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia; [Kovac, Viliam] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Finance, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice; Technical University Kosice,"Gavurova, B (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Banking & Investment, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia.",beata.gavurova@tuke.sk; viliam.kovac@tuke.sk,"Gavurová, Beáta/N-9159-2018; Kováč, Viliam/AAH-5542-2019","Gavurová, Beáta/0000-0002-0606-879X; Kováč, Viliam/0000-0002-5265-9005","Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic [1/0945/17]","Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic","This contribution is created within the project supported by the Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic 1/0945/17 Research of the economic quantification of marketing processes aimed at increasing the value for the patient, multi-dimensional analyses of the marketing mix of health facilities and quantification of their importance in the process of establishing a system to measure the quality and effectiveness of health system in the Slovak Republic.",,23,0,0,0,1,"TECHNICAL UNIV KOSICE, FAC ECONOMICS",KOSICE,"RAMPOVA 1731-7, KOSICE, DZUNGL A-DZUNGL A 040 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-553-2906-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,218,227,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO1YB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000503056700023,0

More precisely, it tests the link between three inequality measures and religious conflicts of low intensity in Indian villages. The three inequality measures are the overall (or vertical) inequality, and its decomposition for religious groups, into a between-group component (horizontal) and a within-group component. The results show that the two components of aggregated inequality have opposite links with conflicts. Indeed, on the one hand, within-group inequality appears to increase the incidence of conflicts between religious groups. On the other hand, when between-group inequality plays a significant part, it decreases the incidence of conflicts. Income distribution is thus a correlate of conflict incidence, even for low intensity conflicts. Moreover, the documented empirical relation is consistent with the most recent theories, which underline the importance of the mobilization constraint for conflict incidence. On the contrary, results are inconsistent with an interpretation of conflicts as triggered by greed or grievance.","[Girard, Victoire] Univ Orleans, CNRS, LEO, UMR 7322, F-45067 Orleans, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite de Orleans,"Girard, V (通讯作者)，Univ Orleans, CNRS, LEO, UMR 7322, F-45067 Orleans, France.",victoire.girard@univ-orleans.fr,"Girard, Victoire/AAD-4028-2020","Girard, Victoire/0000-0001-9983-7238",,,,,38,0,0,2,8,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

The results confirm that cocoa farmers' socio-economic characteristics correlate with the perceived benefits of the cocoa cooperative in the Tocache area. The analyses suggest that although some farmers have a higher cocoa profit, they were less satisfied with their cooperative's services compared to members who are older, have less education, have fewer family members, or were farmers for a longer time, and they are more dependent on their cocoa crop. Managers and board members of the Central Cacao de Aroma cooperative may find it helpful to focus on farmers' socioeconomic characteristics and pay particular attention to dissatisfied farmers.

We estimate dynamic panel model using data of EU 28 countries with fiscal rule index as interaction variable. Due to the heterogeneity of government expenditure we also analyse the cyclicality of government expenditure components. The cyclicality of total government expenditure is not significantly affected by the presence of fiscal rules, however, the same is not true for the cyclicality of government consumption and investment. More specifically as the fiscal rule index increases, government consumption and investment behave more counter-cyclically. The fiscal rule index threshold where pro-cyclicality changes to counter-cyclicality was identified to be 1.812 for investment and 2.242 for consumption.","[Kamenik, Martin] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Econ Theories, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Kameník, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Econ Theories, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia.",martin.kamenik@tuke.sk,,,project VEGA [1/0994/15],project VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),The paper was elaborated within the project VEGA No. 1/0994/15.,,20,0,0,0,1,"TECHNICAL UNIV KOSICE, FAC ECONOMICS",KOSICE,"RAMPOVA 1731-7, KOSICE, DZUNGL A-DZUNGL A 040 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-553-2906-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,359,367,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO1YB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000503056700038,0

For this purpose a nonparametric Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) has been applied. DEA is a mathematical technique commonly used to evaluate a so-called technical efficiency. As the concept of efficiency in the economic theory is multidimensional, the concept of efficiency in the public sector has been examined initially. The study introduces the twofold conceptualization of the efficiency (technical and substantive) as the reason of ambiguity that affects the public sector as the object of performance evaluation. Data Envelopment Analysis has estimated 12 states as efficient units (Slovakia, Romania, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Luxembourg, Ireland, Netherlands, Sweden, Austria, Lithuania and Malta). The fact that among the efficient states there are post-communist countries as well as the richest and most highly developed countries in the world, should be assessed positively. Furthermore, 16 states have been evaluated as relatively inefficient. Their inefficiency gap ranges from an insignificant 1% in Estonia up to 26% in the case of Greece.

Excessive expenses on logistics make it difficult to organize well-planned transportation of commodity goods from Northeast China to the world markets. Consequently, the drawback in social and economic development of Northeast China creates demographic tension on the border between China and Russia. The logistics expenses could be whittled down with the help of new logistics network, i.e. the seaports of the South of Primorsky region like Posyet or Zarubino. Additionally, in the summer period the commodity goods may be shipped to Europe through the Northern Sea Route. Northern Sea Route is an option that may significantly reduce the logistics expenses and allow raising the prosperity of the Northeast China.

In these negotiations there are still many open questions, including dealing with the European protection of geographical indications (GIs). The objective of this paper is, therefore, to evaluate the impact of different GI products and protection levels in bilateral trade partnerships between the EU itself and third countries for the purpose of food policy recommendations in current negotiation processes. Based on panel data on agri-food trade of EU member countries with all trading partners for the period from 1996 to 2010, a gravity approach is used to estimate bilateral trade effects of GIs. The findings suggest that the protection of diverting products and levels for GIs have opposite effects on EUs trade partnerships. As results, considering EUs overall trade, GIs on wines and spirits only have a trade-creating effect if these are highly protected, while for other agricultural products only lower protection levels increase bilateral trade significantly.","[Leufkens, Daniel] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Giessen, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Leufkens, D (通讯作者)，Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Inst Agr Policy & Market Res, Senckenbergstr 3, D-35390 Giessen, Germany.",daniel.leufkens@agrar.uni-giessen.de,,,,,,,44,8,9,1,12,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

This study assesses the viability of using scavenged albizia to promote green urbanism and disaster resilience in Hawaii. Kaka'ako, a commercial and retail district of Honolulu (situated along the southern shores of the island of O'ahu, Hawaii) is used as a case study. Local and practical solutions including green urbanism and technologic innovations such as Computer Numerical Control (CNC) are emphasized. This paper emphasizes local employment and University of Hawaii based technology, thereby minimizing the use of builders from outside the state. Innovative design strategies are herein proposed to overcome this dependency on imports and help the state of Hawaii to achieve long-term resilience and sustainability. Advances in ecological economics and multiple criteria decision analysis yield the following outcomes for the three decision alternatives: Status Quo/ Disposal (0.14), Biofuel (0.39) and Manufacturing (0.37).","[Levy, Jason] Univ Hawaii West Oahu, Dept Publ Adm, Kapolei, HI 96707 USA; [Valenti, Joey] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Architecture, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Yu, Peiyong] Univ Hawaii West Oahu, Dept Econ, Kapolei, HI USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Levy, J (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii West Oahu, Dept Publ Adm, Kapolei, HI 96707 USA.",jlevy@hawaii.edu; jvalenti@hawaii.edu; pyu@hawaii.edu,"Yu, Patricia/JTV-0541-2023",,,,,,11,0,0,0,5,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-50164-2; 978-3-319-50163-5,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2017,6.0,,,,,,349,363,,10.1007/978-3-319-50164-2_22,0.0,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM4WA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000464091900022,0

This paper compares the expected undertaking return between three different models. We have the following conclusions: First, when the costs difference between Government and Insurance Company undertaking Supplementary Major Medical Insurance are not obvious, Government will have higher expected return; second, when there is large gap on the costs between Government and Insurance Company undertaking Supplementary Major Medical Insurance, Insurance Company will have higher profit and Government can enjoy the free rider welfare in a win-win situation at the same time; third, when the costs difference between Government and Insurance Company undertaking Major Medical Insurance are big, Insurance Company is expected to have a greater return than Government.","[Li Qingxia; Huang Can] Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China",Xiamen University,"Li, QX (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.",liqx@xmu.edu.cn; 1548977446@qq.com,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,10,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,,,,,2017,,,,,,,489,507,,,,,,19,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK8HD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000442810700034,0

Motivated by the pronounced entrenchment phenomenon at dual class firms due to divergence between voting and cash flow rights, we are interested in whether dual class firms adopt corporate disclosure choices that imply greater opacity as well as employ judgment in financing reporting to misguide the outside shareholders about the firm's true performance. Based on a sample of 12,672 firms from 19 countries during 1994-2010, we find that dual class status is associated with poorer information environment and increased accrual-based earnings management, consistent with the notion that managers of dual class firms exhibit incentives to conceal private control benefits from the outside shareholders. Results further suggest that dual class ownership structure weakens the mitigating impact of investor protection on earnings management. Following unification, firms experience an improvement in information environment and a decrease in earnings manipulation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This study uses vertical price transmission analysis, with time series econometric techniques, to determine how underlying commodity prices manifest in final retail prices and the associated reasons for it. Implications for food inflation are also reflected on. Two value chains, namely wheat-to-bread and maize-to-maize meal are considered due to their importance as staples in low(er) income consumer diets in South Africa. Results indicate full price transmission in the wheat-to-bread chain but incomplete price transmission in the maize-to-maize meal chain. In addition, prices in the wheat-to-bread chain are determined at producer and consumer level and bi-directional transmission takes place, whereas maize prices are determined at retail level and transmitted through the chain, to commodity level. Symmetry in price adjustment was not rejected in both chains. Implications of the findings for staple food inflation is that it does not seem that the price determination and price transmission processes in these chains are contributing factors to the inflationary pressures that these chains have experienced over the past decade. Symmetric price transmission in both chains seems to suggest no opportunistic behaviour on the part of firms to exploit situations where commodity prices decrease.","[Louw, Marlene; Meyer, Ferdi] Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, Pretoria, South Africa; [Louw, Marlene; Meyer, Ferdi] Univ Pretoria, Bur Food & Agr Policy, Pretoria, South Africa; [Kirsten, Johann] Univ Stellenbosch, Bureau Econ Res, Stellenbosch, South Africa",University of Pretoria; University of Pretoria; Stellenbosch University,"Louw, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, Pretoria, South Africa.;Louw, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Bur Food & Agr Policy, Pretoria, South Africa.",Marlene.labuschagne@up.ac.za,"Kirsten, Johann/AAC-8055-2019",,,,,,31,2,3,0,9,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2017,56.0,2,,,,,110,122,,10.1080/03031853.2017.1313751,0.0,,,13,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,EW9IJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402831700003,0

Regression analysis were carried out on people between 30 to 60 years and over 60, each in binary Logistic model. The former focuses on the time and economic burden of family members and their own security requirements for the future. The latter focuses on the elderly own physical condition and nursing needs. Through the modeling analysis, we obtained 13 significant factors for people over 60: Characteristic factors (region, gender, age, residence, education level), Health factors (health self-evaluation, Barthel Index, number of chronic diseases), Life factors (living pattern, number of children), Economic factors (monthly disposable income), Cognitive factors (medical insurance, endowment insurance).

These extreme weather events present a threat to livelihoods and sustainability of agricultural production in the region. However, several climate-smart agricultural technologies (including drought-tolerant maize) believed to offer adaptation to climate variability in maize-based farming systems have been widely adopted. Moreover, empirical work on these technologies is limited. This paper demonstrates how by adopting drought-tolerant maize, a climate-smart agricultural technology impacts on the quantities of maize produced, sold and consumed in Zimbabwe. Using primary data on smallholder farmers collected in 2011 in Zimbabwe's four districts, we employed propensity score matching techniques to construct a suitable comparison group and calculate the average treatment effect on the treated sample. We find that, the adoption of drought-tolerant maize (DTM) in rural Zimbabwe significantly enhances overall maize productivity and consequently the quantities set aside for sale and personal household consumption. Our study therefore suggests that, systematic expansion of climate-smart agricultural technologies such as adoption of drought-tolerant maize can significantly improve maize yields, sales and consumption in rural Zimbabwe. Our empirical results, robust to sensitivity checks, strongly point to the overall importance of DTM adoption in Zimbabwe. The findings from this paper also have very important implications for overall efforts on the promotion of climate-smart agriculture technologies in Africa and other developing countries.","[Makate, Clifton] Tongji Univ, UNEP Tongji Inst Environm Sustainable Dev, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Wang, Rongchang] Tongji Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Key Lab Yangtze Aquat Environm MOE, State Key Lab Pollut Control & Resource Reuse, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Makate, Marshall] SUNY Albany, 1400 Washington Ave, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Mango, Nelson] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT Mt Pleasant, Harare, Zimbabwe",Tongji University; Tongji University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany,"Makate, C (通讯作者)，Tongji Univ, UNEP Tongji Inst Environm Sustainable Dev, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.",ruumakate@gmail.com,"Makate, Marshall/M-9231-2016; Wang, Rongchang/ABA-1998-2021; Makate, Clifton/GWV-1821-2022; Makate, Clifton/ACV-8483-2022","Makate, Marshall/0000-0002-2005-2970; Wang, Rongchang/0000-0002-4520-6630; Makate, Clifton/0000-0002-6061-6638",International Fund for Agricultural Development; International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT),International Fund for Agricultural Development; International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT),The authors would like to acknowledge the financial assistance received from the International Fund for Agricultural Development and International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) that was used in carrying out this study.,,41,30,31,1,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2017,56.0,1,,,,,67,81,,10.1080/03031853.2017.1283241,0.0,,,15,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,EO1XP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000396491500006,0

In consequence, the successful introduction of new services is becoming increasingly important as a key driver for economic growth and profitability of large manufacturing firms, such as car manufacturers. This paper is concerned with the contribution of service innovation to customer loyalty. It uses the automotive aftersales business as an example to evaluate if the introduction of innovation such as connected services creates loyalty. In this paper customer loyalty is regarded as future repurchase intentions of existing customers. The goal of this academic contribution is developing a three-step model for measuring the contribution of Connected Service Innovation (CSI) towards loyalty. The approach is based first on literature review on service innovation and customer loyalty. In the seconds step a conceptualization of CSI is conducted. Based on the results of the conceptualization and on existing literature on customer loyalty a model of effects can be derived to empirically measure the effect of CSI towards customer loyalty. The aim of this paper is the explorative conceptualization of CSI in the framework of automotive aftersales business. The result is based on interviews with automotive experts with the target to identify key attributes of CSI. Next, the identified attributes are further analysed within the scope of a qualitative, written survey with active customers of CSI using the method of means-end analysis. Based on these results the concept of CSI is designed. Results will help car manufacturers and their dealer-networks to fine tune their approach of Connected Services and to improve the service offering. Reliability of the findings will be considered after empirical testing the derived model in the near future.","[Manowicz, Adam-Alexander] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Manowicz, AA (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,,,,,,,22,0,0,1,7,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-286-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,357,365,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393400036,0

Similar to the situation in Eastern Europe, this type of ownership was quite widespread in China, particularly during the 1990s. Based on the existing literature and available statistical data, the purpose of this paper is to identify drivers of, and barriers to, the development of employee ownership in China. Design/methodology/approach - The scattered evidence from the literature and official statistical sources are collected and structured in a systematic analysis where the drivers and barriers for employee ownership in the transition process from plan to market are identified at three levels: society, the company and the individual. Findings - Employee ownership developed as a transitory stage between state and private ownership; employees acquired ownership stakes as part of the privatisation of small-and medium-sized state-owned enterprises as well as collectively owned enterprises. However, in most cases the dynamics of ownership resulted in dominant ownership by managers. This trend became more noticeable at later stages of the privatisation process. Research limitations/implications - The paper shows how policies and institutional settings at the society level are determining for the development of employee ownership. Originality/value - The contribution of the paper is to give a general and systematic analysis of the development of employee ownership in China both based on a comprehensive literature review and by utilising existing statistical sources.","[Mygind, Niels] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Int Econ & Management, Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Faigen, Benjamin] Copenhagen Business Sch, Frederiksberg, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School; Copenhagen Business School,"Mygind, N (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Int Econ & Management, Frederiksberg, Denmark.",nm.int@cbs.dk,,,,,,,66,0,0,0,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

More and more financial resources are needed for the development of this industry; that is why, according to the authors, it is necessary to improve the management system and to apply the modern investment tools. The aim of this work is to examine the possibility of the application of the modern tools to stimulate the investment-innovative activity in the HPU sector and to prove its efficiency. The authors developed the model of the investment and innovation tool of management in the HPU sector based on the investment tax credit (ITC) which contributes to the development of organizational-economic relations in the HPU sector. In the article, the key parameters of granting the investment tax credit for the development of the investmentinnovative activity in the HPU sector are considered in detail. The evaluation scheme of granting investment tax credit for the implementation of the innovative activity in the HPU sector is given, and it allows defining the parameters of the tax discrimination, taking into consideration possible threats of arising signs of insolvency (bankruptcy) of organizations in the HPU sector. Also, the technique of investment tax credit cost and payment deferral calculation is given. This technique allows calculating the necessary sum of payments considering accrued interests both for each accounting period and for the whole period of lending. After the conducted research, the authors concluded that a postponement of the use of tax obligations in the form of deferral helps to restore the financial situation of the HPU and creates the conditions for ITC registration to the sum of implemented innovations. So, the ITC is targeted and contributes to the transformation of innovative processes which enable us to reach the modern level of socio-economic development and to achieve maximum efficiency in the HPU sector.","[Nikituk, Lyubov] Irkutsk Natl Res Tech Univ, Lermontov St 83, Irkutsk 664074, Russia; [Korotkova, Galina] Petrovsky Coll, Baltiskaya St 35, St Petersburg 198095, Russia",Irkutsk National Research Technical University (INRTU),"Nikituk, L (通讯作者)，Irkutsk Natl Res Tech Univ, Lermontov St 83, Irkutsk 664074, Russia.",love175@yandex.ru,,,,,,,21,1,1,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-408-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,38.0,,,,,,482,487,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI9HY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416099600079,0

But the studies done until now have inadequately represented the effect of socio-economic stratification on the relationship between built environment factors and non-motorized transport (NMT) mode choice, which is important in context of a developing country like India. The present study, done in the city of Bangalore, analyzes the influence of built environment factors-density and diversity- on the mode choice and trip distance for the two segments: respondents owning at least one personal vehicle and respondents not owning any personal vehicle. The built environment factors are analyzed for their marginal effects in the presence of various solo-demographic and alternate specific attributes. The results of the built environment factors for the vehicle non-owning group highlighted the requirement of a policy framework to reduce their trip distance by controlling their employment and housing location. The gender of a commuter had a significant effect on the choice of modes, and the results that females had a higher likelihood of using NMT compared with males contradicted the results in other cities.

This is because never before have customers had real-time access to so much information about functionality, quality, prices, customer service or alternatives and never before has it been easier for customers to switch to a competitor in the space of seconds. Therefore, the main aim of this paper is to provide current knowledge about reputation management in a concentrated form and to point out how the digitalization of communication is revolutionizing corporate reputation.

In this paper, we show that much of the rise can be explained by a tendency of firms to grant the same number of options each year. Number-rigidity implies that the grant-date value of option awards will grow with firm equity returns, which were very high on average during the tech boom. Further, other forms of CEO compensation did not adjust to offset the dramatic growth in the value of option pay. Number-rigidity in options can also explain the increased dispersion in pay, the difference in growth between the US and other countries, and the increased correlation between pay and firm-specific equity returns. We present evidence that number-rigidity arose from a lack of sophistication about option valuation that is akin to money illusion. We show that regulatory changes requiring transparent expensing of the grant-date value of options led to a decline in number-rigidity and helps explain why executive pay increased less with equity returns during the housing boom in the mid-2000s.

In order to ensure the continuity of business success, insurance companies must differentiate themselves from other market actors, and this can be achieved by creating a clear and positive image. A positive image, which is clearly profiled, can contribute to the allocation of an insurance company from direct market competitors, but also it can eliminate the distance and alienation of insurance companies and target public. Therefore, this paper has analyzed the influence of corporate image of insurance companies on their business. The data were collected using a questionnaire. Respondents were users of insurance companies' services. Special attention was paid to the impact of the overall corporate image observed through an assessment of respondents according to six aspects of the business activities of insurance companies (service levels, speed and quality of the process, distribution, physical environment, employment, promotional activities) on the purchase of insurance companies' services through the amount of achieved income (achieved insurance premium).

The objective of the paper is to discuss the current state of the Polish organic food processing as well as its main strengths and weaknesses. The study is based on an inquiry research carried out on 75 organic food processing companies and the data of the Agricultural and Food Quality Inspection. The conducted investigation proved that undertaking the organic food processing may be recognized as an advantage. The main reasons for starting organic food processing were gaining new markets and competitiveness enhancement. Having undertaken the organic processing, the entrepreneurs observed financial condition and image improvement. The weaker parties of this kind of business activity were insufficient level of organic raw material supply and lack of delivery continuity. The next disadvantage was dispersion of organic farms that impeded efficient flow of products. Solutions to this problem may become close cooperation between market actors in these two spheres and creating producers groups.","[Smoluk-Sikorska, Joanna; Luczka, Wladyslawa; Kalinowski, Slawomir] Poznan Univ Life Scineces, Dept Econ, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Life Sciences,"Smoluk-Sikorska, J (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Life Scineces, Dept Econ, Poznan, Poland.",smoluk@up.poznan.pl; smoluk@up.poznan.pl; smoluk@up.poznan.pl,"Smoluk-Sikorska, Joanna/J-5187-2019; Kalinowski, Sławomir Marcin/AAV-2422-2021","Smoluk-Sikorska, Joanna/0000-0001-9599-0497; Kalinowski, Sławomir Marcin/0000-0002-8068-4312",,,,,8,7,7,0,1,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2787-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2017,,,,,,,349,354,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BJ1CL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417392400047,0

For a further study on the influence of solvency ratio to the level of companies' performance, this paper assume that the there is not a simply linear or symmetric relation between these two factors, and there will be different relations when the solvency ratio is in different range of value. To study the internal relation between solvency ratio and company's performance, this paper use panel threshold regression model by Hansen (1999), finding that there is a threshold relation that is firstly positive then negative between the two factors. The result shows that solvency ratio has a significant positive promotion effect on companies' performance before it reaches the thresholds 297%, then the effect is attenuated marginally, and it becomes a negative effect when solvency ratio is higher than threshold 620%. This paper suggests that life insurance companies should neither decrease solvency ratio excessively for short-term profit, nor should they increase solvency ratio continuously for low risk. Only if the solvency ratio is maintained in an appropriate range, can the companies' general development reach the optimum level.","[Song Baizhi; Sun Hui] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Insurance, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Bian Chenyu] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat & Math, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics; Central University of Finance & Economics,"Song, BZ (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Insurance, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.",Songbz1999@163.com; bcy124@163.com; llsh0927@126.com,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,3,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,,,,,2017,,,,,,,63,76,,,,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK8HD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000442810700005,0

The research problem was the deterioration of Thai heritage destinations due to lack of effective sustainable tourism management of tourism stakeholders. The samples of this paper were 400 tourists who were visiting heritage destinations of Thailand, i e museums, temples, archaeological sites, historical buildings/cities and world heritage sites. The data was collected by using purposive sampling method and self-administered questionnaire The questionnaire covered all three aspects of sustainable tourism: environmental; economic and socio-cultural. Additionally, descriptive statistic including percentage, mean and standard deviation were utilized to analyze the data. Hypothesis tests were conducted by using statistical techniques t-test and F-test. The research results illustrated that most of the respondents rated actions towards all aspects of sustainable tourism in overall at the degree of moderate implementation. In details, it was found that respondents rated the actions towards environmental aspect at the degree of high implementation. Nevertheless, they rated both the actions towards economic and social-cultural aspects at the same degree of moderate implementation. In testing the hypothesis, the means on the implementation of sustainable tourism at heritage destinations of Thailand were not different at the significant statistical level of 0.05, when classified the respondents according to gender. Consequently, several recommendations were advised for Thai tourism stakeholders in order to provide knowledge and motivate tourists on sustainable tourism.","[Trivedi, Akhilesh] Dusit Thani Coll, Bangkok, Thailand",Dusit Thani College Bangkok,"Trivedi, A (通讯作者)，Dusit Thani Coll, Bangkok, Thailand.",,,,,,,,22,0,0,1,2,BC GRUP INC,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH, 2134 SOK, DERELI APT.

They create jobs as employers and as purchasers of inputs from the private sector. Local governments are often responsible for regulating local economic activities and providing the social and physical infrastructure which complements private economic activities. In liberal market regimes the opinion is generally divided on whether municipalities who intervene in market in developing their own government enterprises, promote local economic development or, in contrary, create an additional competition in private sector. The aim of the article is to outline possible scenarios for local government intervention in order to correct market failures at the local level. The methodology is based on the literature review about local economic development, and the concept of market failure. This allows to distinguish between a variety of approaches to local economic development policies, such as the business-oriented approach, or the poverty reduction-oriented approach, such as the reduction of unemployment. Additionally, an e-mail survey of Latvian local governments conducted in May of 2016 about their views on local economic intervention provided an additional insight in describing the scenario. The assessment of economic role of local and regional governments shows that in nearly all EU countries local and regional authorities are allowed to engage in economic activity. In some cases, there are restrictions or safeguards such as prohibitions on exercising a monopoly, ceilings (whether absolute or percentage) on equity participation, or a requirement that activities be reconcilable with the local authority's interests. Theoretical investigation of the concept of market failure as well as the results of the survey show that local government's interpretation of the market failure in practice largely depends on it's the strategic orientation and economic capabilities. Before the implementation of the particular method of correcting the market failure, the local government need to be aware of whether the free market mechanism can solve the specific problems. In cases where the provision of services for the private market players is a high risk, risk mitigation strategies or alternative economic development models have to be considered.","[Valtenbergs, Visvaldis] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia; [Brigsa, Sandra; Livina, Agita] Vidzeme Univ Appl Sci, Valmiera, Latvia; [Vilka, Inga] Publiskas Parvaldes Konsultacijas, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia; Vidzeme University of Applied Sciences,"Valtenbergs, V (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,"Livina, Agita/AHE-8723-2022; Brigsa, Sandra/AAJ-3191-2021","Livina, Agita/0000-0003-2804-9132;",,,,,24,0,0,1,2,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-286-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,690,701,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393400069,0

The achievements are outstanding, including the increase of average life expectancy to 74.5 years, the decrease of infant mortality rates to less than 12 % and maternal mortality rate to less than 22/100000by 2015. The new healthcare reform has been 7 years since it started, and the study and evaluation on the effectiveness and efficiency of the reforms are apparently needed. This paper focus on the relationship between the residents' health status and the health resource input to evaluate the healthcare reform for the purpose of further increasing efficiency of healthcare resource input. Methodology: The multivariate linear regression model, specifically a three stage least square (3 SLS) method, is established based on the panel data of the developed areas of nine provinces (municipalities) in China from 2009 to 2015 with neglecting the regional development imbalance. The dependent variable in maternal mortality is chosen as the proxy variable of health output and the total health expenses, the number of healthcare personnel per thousand beds and per thousand people as the proxy variable of health resources input for explanatory variables, others including the per capita GDP and local finance income as the proxy variable of economic development, the illiteracy rate as the proxy variable of education, the urban population proportion as the proxy variable of social factors and the population density as the proxy variable of living environment. Results: The increase of the medical and healthcare resources significantly improves the health status of the residents in these areas accordingly. The previous year's health status of the residents influences the health are resource input. The effect of the local economic growth of these areas on the health status of their residents is not significant, while the part of the residents with higher level of education indeed pays more attention to personal health status. Conclusion: The continuing increase of government investment to healthcare resources is required. However, this spending needs to coordinate with the medical and healthcare market and the government's resource allocation with the emphasis on the efficiency increase of health resources input. Meanwhile, the educational and environmental issues must be stressed.","[Wang Yuanyuan; Weng Xiaodan; Sun Fei] Shanghai Univ Int Business & Econ, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of International Business & Economics,"Weng, XD (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Int Business & Econ, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China.",2474074475@qq.com; wengxd2006@163.com; 1040618412@qq.com,"Lv, Yuanjie/AER-0767-2022; Wang, Yuan/HHC-1520-2022; Wang, Yuan/GRF-3621-2022; WANG, YUANYUAN/IQR-4295-2023",,,,,,18,1,1,2,5,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,,,,,2017,,,,,,,93,104,,,,,,12,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK8HD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000442810700007,0

The paper also demonstrates that the success of these innovations in supranational competitions has increased thanks to such innovative projects.","[Wildmannova, Mirka] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Wildmannová, M (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",mirkaw@econ.muni.cz,"Wildmannová, Mirka/C-4390-2015",,[MUNI/A/1083/2016],,"This paper was drawn up within the project Vyzkum obcanske spolecnosti: od standardu k extremu, registration number MUNI/A/1083/2016.",,19,0,0,0,1,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

The base of economic and social development increasingly depends on new technologies, high-qualified and competent labour force, the potential of high schools and R&D centres, ITC infrastructure and the government pro-innovative policy as well. There are no doubts, that we have to do with fundamental changes determined by intellectual capital - human and social ones. Poland should benefit from its UE membership privileges, opportunities and draw up a proinnovative policy, which will help the economy to become aspiring to a knowledge-based one at least. The business capabilities of creating and implementing innovations resulting to high value added products and services seem to be critical for the process. Consequently, the business access to convenient sources of financing their innovative activities makes it possible. In every market economy family businesses constitute the majority of business population. In Poland over 70% of businesses are under the control of families. Therefore it is important to get to know how the innovative processes proceed in such business entities from the financial point of view. Referring to the literature studies and empirical research (including own ones) on family entrepreneurship innovative activity, the paper presents the results of the author's main, survey research of 115 family businesses ranked in The Forbes Diamond List in 2016 (Polish edition) and refers to the research hypotheses mentioned earlier.

The dynamics of and factors influencing ownership in Chinese cities need careful investigation. Using fixed effects models applied to annual panel data (1994-2012; 293 cities) this study aimed to achieve the following: 1) assess the relationships between car ownership and average Annual income per capita, population, built-up area, road area per capita, urban population density, number of taxis and bus passenger volume; 2) examine the variation of these relationships across geographical regions (East, middle, and West China) and city sizes (cities with small, medium, large, and super-large populations). The results showed that car ownership was positively associated with average annual income per capita, built-up area, road area per capita, urban population density, and number of taxis at the national level. All associations, except with the number of taxis, varied significantly across geographical regions. Built-up area, road area per capita, and number of taxis had different associations with car ownership depending on city sizes. The findings improve the understanding of relationships between car ownership and urban environments vis-a-vis variations in income and infrastructure per capita, population density, and transportation alternatives. These results have important policy implications for managing cars and health problems related to cars in China. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The influence the decreasing of VAT on basic food products market is in the article quantified by the trade and welfare analysis. We used functions of supply and demand for chosen basic food product. The consumption of basic food products decreased significantly in period 2004-2016. On contrary, the monthly net earnings per habitant in the Slovak Republic had been increasing on yearly basis. The Slovak Republic belongs to the countries with the lowest income in the EU countries. For these reasons the government decided on decreasing the VAT for basic food products (e.g. milk, bread and butter), on the level of 50 percent of the VAT base. The descriptive statistic of VAT charges for food products in EU countries shows, that the average charge is 9.92% with standard deviation 3.68. The most frequent charges are on the level 9 percent and 10 percent. Half of the countries has the charge lower than 9.5 percent. In the SR food products were charged by the basic VAT on the level 20 percent in 2015, which was the highest charge among the EU countries.","[Zentkova, Iveta; Hoskova, Elena] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Zentková, I (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",iveta.zentkova@uniag.sk; elena.hoskova@uniag.sk,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,3,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2787-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2017,,,,,,,448,456,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BJ1CL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417392400061,0

We present contrasting evidence from China, where actively managed stock mutual funds successfully time the size factor (small minus big) despite a negative unconditional loading. Size-factor timing is an important aspect of manager skill, as it attributes to over 50% of fund alpha. We show that the timing skill arises from funds' intra-period trading. Relatedly, funds with bigger return gaps exhibit more timing skill. Moreover, we find that mutual funds increase their size-factor exposure after high market turnover. However, mutual funds' factor-timing skill remains significant after controlling for lagged turnover.","[Chen, Qinhua; Chi, Yeguang] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, SAIF, 211 West Huaihai Rd, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Chi, YG (通讯作者)，Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, SAIF, 211 West Huaihai Rd, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China.",qhCHEN.15@saif.sjtu.edu.cn; ygchi@saif.sjtu.edu.cn,,,,,,,28,13,13,0,22,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5398,1879-1727,,J EMPIR FINANC,J.

In a simple theoretical framework we show that the dispersion of debt maturities constitutes an important dimension of capital structure choice, driven by firm characteristics and debt rollover risk. Guided by these predictions we establish two main empirical results. First, using an exogenous shock to rollover risk, we document a significant increase in maturity dispersion for firms that need to roll over maturing debt. Second, we find strong support that maturities of newly issued debt are influenced by pre-existing maturity profiles. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Although the speed of information incorporation has increased in recent years, profits have not.

Advocates of the legislation justified these preferences in part as a way to encourage new business investment and as a response to international tax competition. However, Congress failed to effectively achieve these goals by appropriately targeting these preferences on an economically coherent category of business income - such as the normal returns to new investment - and by protecting the domestic tax base as they addressed international pressures. Instead, the law extends its tax cuts to a variety of economic returns, including returns to labor of highly-compensated domestic service providers, but only if income is earned in certain forms and in certain sectors of the economy. As a result, the legislation generates substantial new inequity, tax planning opportunities, and administrative challenges for the IRS-none of which was necessary to increase investment and reduce international profit shifting.","[Glogower, Ari] Ohio State Univ, Moritz Coll Law, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Kamin, David] NYU, Sch Law, New York, NY 10003 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; New York University,"Glogower, A (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Moritz Coll Law, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",glogower.2@osu.edu; kamin@nyu.edu,,,,,,,24,1,2,1,6,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

Some combinations of resource transfer (carrot) and increased effectiveness of defense (stick) increase production efficiency by decreasing the total amount of appropriative activities in a conflict.

Empirical evidence is obtained from a survey of 471 bank loan officers in Spain, who are asked to answer in relation to audited and not-audited firms. Using a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) approach, the results obtained confirm that the loan officers' willingness to facilitate SMEs' access to credit is positively influenced by their general perception about the AIQ, but only if it is audited. In the case of not-audited firms, AIQ does not play a direct role in credit granting decision, but is relevant in trust formation. Besides, in the case of audited firms, only the competence dimension of trust is relevant, whereas in not-audited firms, both competence and honesty have an impact on credit granting. Benevolence does not have an influence in any case.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the persistence nature of the different inflation episodes while controlling for the effects of demand- and supply-side factors, which are modeled as regime-dependent. Design/methodology/approach This paper used the Markov-switching dynamic regression and annual time series data. Findings The results showed that high inflation regime is more persistent than low inflation regime, with a respective average duration of an escape of 3.5 and 2.57 years, which suggests that price stability achievements are less sustainable. In both regimes, demand- and supply-side factors play significant roles in driving inflation, but the effect of the latter dominates. Thus, on the argument of whether inflation in Ghana is structural or monetary, the results support the former. The roles of both structural and monetary factors have changed over time, but that of the former has been more significant and important in Ghana. Originality/value This study provides the first empirical attempt, in the case of Ghana, that examines the persistence nature of different inflation regimes, while modeling the effects of supply and demand factors as regime dependent. In the modeling sense, the authors also contribute by ruling out the assumption that the researcher knows the processes responsible for each observation at each point in time.","[Adom, Philip Kofi] Ghana Inst Management & Publ Adm, Sch Publ Serv & Governance, Accra, Ghana; [Adom, Philip Kofi] City Univ Hong Kong, Coll Business, Sch Energy & Environm, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Agradi, Mawunyo Prosper; Quaidoo, Christopher] Univ Profess Studies, Dept Banking & Finance, Accra, Ghana",City University of Hong Kong,"Adom, PK (通讯作者)，Ghana Inst Management & Publ Adm, Sch Publ Serv & Governance, Accra, Ghana.;Adom, PK (通讯作者)，City Univ Hong Kong, Coll Business, Sch Energy & Environm, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",adomonline@Yahoo.co.uk; Mawunyo.agradi@upsamail.edu.gh; christopher.quaidoo@upsamail.edu.gh,"Quaidoo, Christopher/GZG-9972-2022; ADOM, Prof. PHILIP KOFI/K-4651-2017","Agradi, Mawunyo/0000-0002-4565-2040; ADOM, Prof. PHILIP KOFI/0000-0001-8135-7260",,,,,57,3,3,0,1,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Design/methodology/approach Data were collected through a structured questionnaire using sample size of 319 newly established ventures in Pakistan - an emerging economy. The hypotheses were tested with structural equation modeling by using AMOS 21. Findings Results of the study indicate that business networking, financial networking and political networking significantly and positively contribute to new ventures performance and competitive advantage. Results also show that competitive advantage is a strong mediator between financial networking and new venture performance, as well as between business networking and new venture performance, respectively. However, in case of relationship between political networking and new venture performance, competitive advantage plays only a partial mediating role. Practical implications The study suggests that the owners and managers of new ventures should devote considerable efforts to developing all the three types of networks; in particular these networks are important for newly established ventures operating in emerging markets to access resources and to enhance performance. Originality/value Extensive review of available literature indicates that this is the first paper to assess the impact of networking on new ventures' performance with a mediating role of competitive advantage.

Design/methodology/approach The objective of the research will be achieved through the application of multivariate factor analysis and cluster analysis techniques. Findings The paper shows the importance of the institutional framework and governance for the countries of Latin America and demonstrates the heterogeneity in the areas of institutions and governance in the region. The paper also confirms the presence of differentiated groups of countries that can and should collaborate with each other to enhance the socio-economic development of the region in a globalized context. Research limitations/implications Due to the limited Latin America countries example in this paper, the authors consider for future studies would be to enlarge the number of countries and to implement same study to Asian countries. Practical implications The main contribution of this study in practice is that by classifying countries into clusters with similarities and differences, this study allows politicians and the institutional leaders to redesign current and/or formulate new policies aimed at institutional quality and good governance. In addition, results of the study should be taken into account by institutions such as the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank when deciding on multilateral support or when taking financing decisions as the type of support and the conditions applied should be differentiated according to the cluster in question. Also, in the context of academic research, the clusters will allow comparative studies that can assess the impact of the institutional framework and other variables on indicators such as direct foreign investment, economic growth or sociological ones, such as poverty, the distribution of income, etc. Originality/value This paper provides the analysis of the Institutional Framework and Governance in Latin America under the multivariate analysis approach.","[Cardenas, Gilberto; Salas, Alvaro] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Econ & Publ Finance, Madrid, Spain; [Garcia, Sofia] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Appl Econ, Madrid, Spain",Autonomous University of Madrid; Autonomous University of Madrid,"Cárdenas, G (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Econ & Publ Finance, Madrid, Spain.",gilberto.cardenas@uam.es; sofia.garcia@uam.es; alvaro.salas@uam.es,,,,,,,56,12,12,0,15,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Design/methodology/approach This study first estimates the TFP growth using a growth accounting framework. In the second stage, the authors examine the long-run and short-run impact of innovation on TFP growth using the ARDL bound testing approach. Findings The results indicate a cointegrating relationship between innovation and TFP growth. Further, coefficients of long-run elasticity show that the increase in overall innovation activities improves the TFP growth. Other factors such as human capital, financial development and FDI do not affect the TFP growth in the long run; however, these variables significantly affect the productivity growth in the short run. Practical implications Findings of the study suggest that the innovation-friendly policies such as the strengthening of intellectual property rights, R&D subsidies and innovation rebates may spur the productivity growth, and hence, good growth and prosperity as well. Originality/value Having devoted a large volume of literature to address the sources of economic growth, the present study focuses on the determinants of TFP growth in India which may fall in similar category but differ in several angles: First, the authors construct a TFP index using a growth accounting framework. Second, the authors construct an innovation index using principal component analysis which is new to the literature and also an innovation index. Third, given the scanty innovation activities in low developed countries like India and its widening role in the contemporary literature, special emphasis will be given to this aspect. Finally, the effect of the examined relationship on TFP growth in the long run and short run provides several implications for policy purpose to the developing nations like India.","[Kale, Seenaiah] Inst Studies Ind Dev, New Delhi, India; [Rath, Badri Narayan] Indian Inst Technol Hyderabad, Dept Liberal Arts, Hyderabad, Telangana, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Hyderabad,"Rath, BN (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol Hyderabad, Dept Liberal Arts, Hyderabad, Telangana, India.",seenueconomiks@gmail.com; badri@iith.ac.in,"Kale, Seenaiah/T-1452-2019; Rath, Badri Narayan/Y-6505-2019","Rath, Badri Narayan/0000-0002-6842-4278; kale, seenaiah/0000-0003-3097-5936",,,,,84,11,11,5,27,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Cross-sectional analyses are applied to two samples (1,252 and 2,026 individuals) from two representative household surveys conducted in 2007 and 2012 in Bejaia, an east-central region of Algeria. In the first place, using a Mincer earnings function shows there is a substantial wage gap regarding the formal/informal wage employment divide. However, human capital theory applies to formal employees rather than to informal ones. Hence, labor market segmentation is not reducible to earnings functions. In the second place, a multinomial logit model captures the determinants of occupational mobility, which depend on the characteristics of individuals: age, gender, marital status, and human capital. Finally, the paper explores from a longitudinal perspective a cohort of 445 individuals both surveyed in 2007 and 2012. The aforementioned determinants explain the patterns of occupational mobility of active individuals who experience a change that improves or deteriorates their job position, while shifting in both directions across the formal and the informal sector and within the informal sector.","[Adair, Philippe] Univ Paris Est Creteil, Creteil, France; [Bellache, Youghourta] Univ Abderrahmane Mira, Bejaia, Algeria",Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Universite de Bejaia,"Adair, P (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Est Creteil, Fac Econ & Management, ERUDITE, 61 Ave Gen Gaulle, F-94000 Creteil, France.",adair@u-pec.fr,,"Adair, Philippe/0000-0002-6474-2420; BELLACHE, Youghourta/0000-0002-6427-0718",,,,,37,1,1,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Concurrently, the US adopted an excess profits tax, which created a tax bias in favor of equity financing. Despite this tax bias, firms in need of external funds largely issued debt, not equity, to finance investment spikes when the excess profits tax was in effect. Further, we find these firms systematically reduced debt after the war, whereas other firms did not. The results support models that link the dynamics of firms' financing decisions with the dynamics of their investment opportunities and are inconsistent with models that emphasize taxes as a primary determinant of financing decisions.

In India, marriage traditions dictate that two ceremonies take place: the wedding and the gauna ceremony. These differ in timing and purpose. After the wedding, the bride and groom do not necessarily live together. The gauna ceremony indicates the start of marital life and the consummation of the marriage. Results indicate that women in local government decrease the likelihood of child marriage, and delay the age at first marriage and the gauna ceremony. Delaying marriage has important policy implications for both the bride and her future children as it improves education, autonomy over fertility, and health. The results indicate that after 18 years of implementation, exposure to women in government can reduce the prevalence of child marriage.","[Castilla, Carolina] Colgate Univ, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA",Colgate University,"Castilla, C (通讯作者)，Colgate Univ, Dept Econ, 13 Oak Dr, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA.",ccastilla@colgate.edu,,"Castilla, Carolina/0000-0002-8908-1091",United Nations University World Institute for Development Economics Research (UNU-WIDER),United Nations University World Institute for Development Economics Research (UNU-WIDER),United Nations University World Institute for Development Economics Research (UNU-WIDER),,28,9,9,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

This paper contributes to analyses of resilience by studying how theories of change (ToC) processes used by development organizations might lead to social exclusions, and seeking ways to make these more inclusive. Adopting insights from participatory monitoring and evaluation, the paper first presents fieldwork from four villages in Myanmar to compare local experiences of risk and resilience with the ToCs underlying pathways to resilience based on building anticipatory, absorptive, and adaptive capacities. The paper then uses interviews with the development organizations using these pathways to identify how ToC processes might exclude local experiences and causes of risk, and to seek ways to make processes more inclusive. The research finds that development organizations can contribute to shared ToCs for resilience, but adopt tacitly different models of risk that reduce attention to more transformative socio-economic pathways to resilience. Consequently, there is a need to consider how resilience and ToCs can become insufficiently scrutinized boundary objects when they are shared by actors with different models of risk and intervention.

Criterion-based assessment of authentic disciplinary tasks is shown to be effective in detecting incremental improvement in competencies, and learning gains on standardized tests were significant and meaningful for problem solving, critical thinking, and communication. The use of standardized assessment has limitations, but feedback to departments enabled learning needs to be addressed. These examples are highlighted as part of a continuous improvement model to develop competencies by tailoring curriculum and learning strategies, assessing student achievement, and using the data to inform high-impact strategies for attainment of competencies.","[Frank, Brian; Salem, Deena; Kaupp, Jake; Lindley-Peart, Max] Queens Univ, Fac Engn & Appl Sci, Kingston, ON, Canada; [Simper, Natalie] Queens Univ, Off Provost, Kingston, ON, Canada; [Cai, Bei] Queens Univ, Dept Phys Engn Phys & Astron, Kingston, ON, Canada",Queens University - Canada; Queens University - Canada; Queens University - Canada,"Frank, B (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Fac Engn & Appl Sci, Kingston, ON, Canada.",,"Simper, Natalie/AAA-5794-2021","Simper, Natalie/0000-0002-1309-1074",Higher Education Quality Council of Ontario; DuPont Canada Chair in Engineering Education Research and Development,Higher Education Quality Council of Ontario; DuPont Canada Chair in Engineering Education Research and Development,We thank the reviewers for their helpful feedback on a draft of this article.

For the 632 largest cities in the world we construct panel data describing population, measures of centralization calculated from lights at night data, and the extent of each of the 138 subway systems in these cities. These data indicate that large cities are more likely to have subways but that subways have an economically insignificant effect on urban population growth. Our data also indicate that subways cause cities to decentralize, although the effect is smaller than previously documented effects of highways on decentralization. For a subset of subway cities we observe panel data describing subway and bus ridership. For those cities we find that a 10% increase in subway extent causes about a 6% increase in subway ridership and has no effect on bus ridership.","[Gonzalez-Navarro, Marco] Univ Calif Berkeley, Agr & Resource Econ Dept, Giannini Hall 207, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Turner, Matthew A.] Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Box B, Providence, RI 02912 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Brown University,"Turner, MA (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Box B, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",marcog@berkeley.edu; matthew_turner@brown.edu,"gonzalez-navarro, marco/AAL-2475-2020","gonzalez-navarro, marco/0000-0002-4572-3398",Multi-Donor Trust Fund by the World Bank; UK Department for International Development; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Intemational Growth Centre; Ontario Work-Study program; Societe du Grand Paris; Property and Environment Research Center; Enaudi Institute of Economics and Finance,Multi-Donor Trust Fund by the World Bank; UK Department for International Development; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Intemational Growth Centre; Ontario Work-Study program; Societe du Grand Paris; Property and Environment Research Center; Enaudi Institute of Economics and Finance,"We are grateful to Fern Ramoutar, Mandy Saddradini, Mohamed Salat, and Farhan Yahya for their assistance compiling the subway data.

Using detailed data on district level land tenure, crop produce, and conflict intensity in Peru and Colombia, estimates show that exogenous negative price shocks increase the intensity of conflict in districts with a greater presence of individual ownership, relative to other types of land tenure. The finding is consistent with small landowners in the export sector experiencing a sharper downturn in labor market outcomes thus reducing the opportunity cost of participating in insurgent groups.

In marked contrast to the previous studies, we analyzed whether recent regional economic and financial integration in Asia were driven by global (U.S.) shock or regional (Japanese and Chinese) shock, using the GVAR model that allows global inter-linkages between domestic and foreign variables. By estimating generalized impulse responses of Asian economies' real outputs and interest rates to global and regional shocks, we found that the Chinese shock exerted more real and financial influences on Asian economies than the U.S. shock. Another regional shock, i.e., the Japanese shock, had a far smaller influence on Asian economies. The relative importance of regional shocks originating from China needs to be considered when establishing regional monetary arrangements in Asia.","[Ong, Sheue Li] Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Sato, Kiyotaka] Yokohama Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Sato, Kiyotaka] Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Business & Law, Churchlands, WA, Australia",Universiti Malaya; Yokohama National University; Edith Cowan University,"Ong, SL (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",ongsl@um.edu.my; sato@ynu.ac.jp,"Ong, Sheue Li/M-6645-2018; Sato, Kiyotaka/F-6489-2018","Ong, Sheue Li/0000-0002-2013-4343; Sato, Kiyotaka/0000-0002-1611-9191","Yokohama National University; JSPS (Japan Society for the Promotion of Science) KAKENHI [16H03638, 16H03627, 17KT0032, 24243041, 24330101]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16H03627, 17KT0032, 16H03638] Funding Source: KAKEN","Yokohama National University; JSPS (Japan Society for the Promotion of Science) KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This study is financially supported by Yokohama National University and the JSPS (Japan Society for the Promotion of Science) KAKENHI Grant Number 16H03638, 16H03627, 17KT0032, 24243041, and 24330101.

Facebook, for example, is trying to bring each person the most meaningful content, which means the advertising is ultra-customized based on the user activity and preferences, but this kind of personalisation can easily have an unpleasant side effect. The advertising for touristic destinations can become very complex by using fine-tuned campaigns triggered by user consumption patterns revealed in the digital world. By adding a button like buy now, the social media apps can easily integrate important ecommerce features, so the advertising of today is not only about presenting the content but also about instantly buying products and services. This paper highlights the way in which advertising messages emerging social media can quickly have a greatly improved success rate. Research methodology took as its starting point the findings of scientific studies published in the literature, the obtained results being interpreted from the perspective of the authors' personal considerations on the topic of the paper. The conclusions highlight the main trends related to increasing the success rate of advertisements in tourism by using social media and by choosing the most appropriate platforms, advertising methods and buying tools such as augmented and/or virtual reality that allow to experiment in advance a travel package, placing of advertising messages on the platforms with the greatest impact and including the direct purchase options inside the add, so that viewing the message can be immediately followed by the acquisition of the promoted services.","[Sarbu, Roxana; Alecu, Felician; Dina, Razvan] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Alecu, F (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",felician.alecu@ie.ase.ro,"ALECU, FELICIAN/IQS-7817-2023; Dina, Razvan/I-5139-2017; Sarbu, Roxana/Q-9937-2017; Felician, Alecu/AAP-8342-2021","Dina, Razvan/0000-0002-9360-4756;",,,,,20,9,12,8,82,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2018,20.0,,,,12,,1016,1028,,10.24818/EA/2018/S12/1016,0.0,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GY5HR,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448604700013,0

We hypothesize that daughters who are mothers have a stronger incentive than sons who are fathers to demonstrate to their children the appropriate way of caring for one's parents. The reason underlying this hypothesis is that women on average live longer than men, they tend to marry men who are older than they are and, thus, they are more likely than men to spend their last years without a spouse. Because it is more effective and less costly to care for parents if they live nearby, daughters with children do not move as far away from the parental home as sons with children or childless offspring. Data on the distance between the children's location and the parents' location extracted from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), in conjunction with data on selected demographic characteristics and institutional indicators taken from Eurostat, the OECD, and the World Bank, lend support to our hypothesis: compared to childless daughters, childless sons, and sons who are fathers, daughters who are mothers choose to live closer to their parents' home.

They help to determine who sees entrepreneurship as an available and desirable career path. Entrepreneurs use their contacts to raise funds for and to recruit employees and partners to their ventures. Social relationships also influence where and when entrepreneurs want to spend their leisure time. Because of these factors, entrepreneurs tend to found their firms in the places that they live (and in the industries in which they have been employed). That, in turn, implies that industries will tend to become and remain concentrated in a small number of places, even when firms do not benefit from this clustering.","[Sorenson, Olav] Yale Sch Management, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",Yale University,"Sorenson, O (通讯作者)，Yale Sch Management, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",olav.sorenson@yale.edu,"Sorenson, Olav/ABE-5373-2020; PENG, Xiao-bao/J-4466-2012","Sorenson, Olav/0000-0002-0599-6738;",,,,,83,40,48,3,53,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

An experimental study on the influence of time scarcity and quantity of information on the voter decision making process",PUBLIC CHOICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Decision making; Political information; Correct vote; Heuristics; Issue voting,ELECTION; KNOWLEDGE; IDEOLOGY,"Classical theories of political representation claim that high levels of political knowledge and awareness across the electorate are crucial for a well-functioning democracy. In real life, though, the actual amount of political information possessed by voters is small and unevenly distributed. In addition, electoral decision making is complex and often characterized by severe time pressure. This study therefore experimentally tests the theoretical framework of fast and frugal voters and the less-is-more effect (Gigerenzer and Goldstein in Psychol Rev 103(4):650-669, 1996), which expects that in some instances low levels of political knowledge may actually result in equally good or even better outcomes than in the case of well-informed decisions. It is hence assumed that employing specific cognitive shortcuts can help voters make good and quick decisions, even with a lack of information. We have used a laboratory experiment to create an environment characterized by severe time pressure that allowed for only shallow information search and limited comparisons across alternatives. Subjects were able to base their decisions only on a small number of criteria operationalized by candidates' positions on current political issues with various levels of perceived salience. Voters appear to simplify decision making by focusing mainly on those policy attitudes they consider important. Consequently, it seems that shifting the decision-making strategy from accuracy to efficiency has no effect on the final outcome.","[Toth, Michal; Chytilek, Roman] Masaryk Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Fac Social Studies, Jostova 10, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Tóth, M (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Fac Social Studies, Jostova 10, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",toth@fss.muni.cz; chytilek@fss.muni.cz,"Toth, Michal/F-5547-2017; Chytilek, Roman/S-7496-2019","Toth, Michal/0000-0002-9026-1313; Chytilek, Roman/0000-0002-2900-7746","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic [MUNI/A/0850/2017]","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)","We would like to thank William F.

To do this, we develop a two-country model involving a backward economy that exchanges intermediate goods with a faster growing country. We obtain three main results regarding growth and welfare of the backward economy: (i) the growth-enhancing comparative advantage is facilitated by faster foreign growth; (ii) the growth rate may be negatively affected or unaffected by a domestic tariff, while it is always positively impacted by foreign growth; and (iii) a domestic tariff could be welfare-improving.","[Alvarez-Albelo, Carmen D.] Univ La Laguna, San Cristobal la Laguna, Spain; [Manresa, Antonio; Pigem-Vigo, Monica] Univ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain",Universidad de la Laguna; University of Barcelona,"Alvarez-Albelo, CD (通讯作者)，Univ La Laguna, San Cristobal la Laguna, Spain.",,"Alvarez-Albelo, Carmen D./F-4141-2016","Alvarez-Albelo, Carmen D./0000-0003-4220-3175","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2013-48884-C3-3-P, ECO 2012-34046, ECO 2013-41917-P]; Generalitat de Catalunya [2014 SGR-493, XREAP2015-308149]",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya),We are indebted with two anonymous referees for their comments and suggestions that have greatly improved our paper.

In line with the idea that IDISP reflects dispersion in investors' beliefs, we find that the negative IDISP-return relationship is particularly pronounced around earnings announcements, in high sentiment periods and among stocks that exhibit relatively high short-selling impediments. Moreover, the IDISP effect is highly persistent and robustly distinct from the effects of a large array of previously documented cross-sectional return predictors. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Ordinary-least-squares estimates could have been biased if parents factored the age of children into their migration decision. Using a sample of siblings from the 2000 US Census, we employed a family fixed-effects estimation strategy and found a negative and convex relationship between human capital and age-of-arrival. Teenage entrants' outcomes were worst affected compared to younger entrants. Language was found to be an important mediating factor via which age-of-arrival influenced education. The critical age for English proficiency was 8-10. Age-of-arrival affected education not only through language but also via heterogeneous origin country conditions. The additional privileges of birth-right citizenship, if any, were disentangled from the benefits of zero age-of-arrival for natives. Citizenship by birth provided few advantages, except for college enrollment. Results were robust to sample selection changes.","[Basu, Sukanya] Vassar Coll, Econ, 124 Raymond Ave,Box 22, Poughkeepsie, NY 12604 USA",Vassar College,"Basu, S (通讯作者)，Vassar Coll, Econ, 124 Raymond Ave,Box 22, Poughkeepsie, NY 12604 USA.",subasu@vassar.edu,,,,,,,43,8,13,0,13,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

The findings of Wald tests indicate a nonlinear and asymmetric pass-through from energy price shocks to aggregate US stock market prices.

National governments are building many of these roads, which are often perceived as disenfranchising Indigenous communities. Yet in the Canadian Arctic's Mackenzie Delta, a joint venture between two Indigenous-owned construction and transportation companies built the first public highway in North America to the Arctic Ocean, which opened in November 2017. This research, based on qualitative fieldwork in the lnuvialuit Settlement Region where the highway was constructed, challenges ideas that roads are invariably top-down initiatives which negatively impact Indigenous peoples and their lands. Inuvialuit community leaders lobbied for this road project and succeeded in winning CAD $299 million in government funding to construct the Inuvik-Tuktoyaktuk Highway. They leveraged opportunities afforded by land claims treaties and shifting geopolitics in the warming Arctic, which turned their region into a frontier of renewed national and global interest, to accumulate funding. Strategically, they discursively rescaled a road they sought to promote economic development and improve local mobility between two communities into a highway of national importance. This study thus extends work on tribal capitalism to explore the place-based dynamics of Indigenous political economies. It unpacks the scale oriented strategies Indigenous peoples use to advocate for new roads and increased connectivity, finding that these discourses and practices can complement the state's promotion of nation-building and market capitalism in frontier spaces. This research also suggests that more attention is required to the circumstances in which Indigenous peoples initiate or become partners in infrastructure development rather than examining only instances of resistance.

The relationship is tested using a German firm-based panel and a dynamic count data model estimating the propensity of firms to innovate in response to five initiating factors, namely the fulfillment of existing legal requirements, expectations towards future legal requirements, financial incentives, demand for eco-innovations and self-commitment. The heterogeneity of firms is controlled for using R&D intensity, the size, the sector and the region of the company. The results answer the central question concerning the design of environmental policies in order to foster eco-innovation. Comparing a static model to a dynamic one shows that only long term objectives and market incentives are positively associated with eco-innovation. Conventional regulatory tools, namely legally binding instruments, are not effective for triggering innovative behavior at the firm level. The results do not allow to confirm the Porter hypothesis but rather offer a refined version, emphasizing the nuances that apply to the concept of regulation. The claim is that what matters is not the type of the policy instrument but rather the perception of the instrument by firms.","[Bitat, Abdelfeteh] Univ St Louis Bruxelles, Blvd Jardin Bot 43, Brussels, Belgium",University Saint-Louis - Bruxelles,"Bitat, A (通讯作者)，Univ St Louis Bruxelles, Blvd Jardin Bot 43, Brussels, Belgium.",abdelfeteh.bitat@usaintlouis.be,"BITAT, Abdelfeteh/D-7026-2018","BITAT, Abdelfeteh/0000-0002-0997-0332",,,,,91,32,33,2,82,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1309-4297,2147-4281,,EURASIAN BUS REV,Eurasian Bus.

This paper empirically argues that the increase in external market demand resulting from exchange rate changes had significant impacts on R&D expenditure of manufacturing firms in South Korea. Empirical analyses using South Korean firm-level panel data from 1981 to 1995 show that the exchange rate change was a significant driver of increased R&D expenditure. The South Korean firms whose exporting goods were similar to those produced in Japan were more sensitive to the exchange rate changes (especially Japanese yen's appreciation) than the firms whose exporting goods were less similar to Japanese exports. The result suggests a causal relationship between external demand and R&D expenditure.,"[Branstetter, Lee G.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Branstetter, Lee G.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kwon, Namho] Korea Inst Publ Finance, Sejong Si 30147, South Korea",Carnegie Mellon University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kwon, N (通讯作者)，Korea Inst Publ Finance, Sejong Si 30147, South Korea.",branstet@cmu.edu; nhkwon@kipf.re.kr,,,"National Science Foundation (SciSIP) [1360170, 1360165]; CMU-Portugal Program; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; SBE Off Of Multidisciplinary Activities [1360170] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; SBE Off Of Multidisciplinary Activities [1360165] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation (SciSIP); CMU-Portugal Program; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; SBE Off Of Multidisciplinary Activities(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; SBE Off Of Multidisciplinary Activities(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the National Science Foundation (SciSIP grants no. 1360170 and 1360165) and from the CMU-Portugal Program.,,43,7,9,2,14,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0889-1583,1095-8681,,J JPN INT ECON,J.

We find that depending on where firms compete, strong asymmetry among regions (the two regions' different valuations of side payments and climate change damage) can produce self-enforcing cooperative agreements. Moreover, the South's optimal standard choice can be one of two polar cases, i.e., either the cleanest or the dirtiest, irrespective of the continuum of standards available. The results above can also hold true when both parties bargain over the South's emission tax.","[Cai, Dapeng] Nanzan Univ, Fac Econ, Showa Ku, 18 Yamazato Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4668673, Japan; [Li, Jie] Jinan Univ, Inst Ind Econ, 601 Huangpudadaoxi Rd, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Li, Jie] Jinan Univ, Inst Ind Org & Regulat, 601 Huangpudadaoxi Rd, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Jinan University; Jinan University,"Li, J (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Inst Ind Econ, 601 Huangpudadaoxi Rd, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;Li, J (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Inst Ind Org & Regulat, 601 Huangpudadaoxi Rd, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",dcai@nanzan-u.ac.jp; eflijie@jnu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71333007]; JSPS KAKENHI [26780143, 16K03677, 16K13365, 26380325]; Nanzan University Pache Research Subsidy I-A-2 for the 2016 academic year; Nito Foundation; National Social Science Fund of China [15BJL087, 14BJY017]; Guangdong Provincial Natural Science Foundation [2014A030313395]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [15JNYH001]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K13365, 26780143, 16K03677] Funding Source: KAKEN","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Nanzan University Pache Research Subsidy I-A-2 for the 2016 academic year; Nito Foundation; National Social Science Fund of China; Guangdong Provincial Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We would like to acknowledge support from the key project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71333007).

However, the employment and output impact of government contracts remains controversial. We use georeferenced data on United States (US) federal contracts, distinguishing between the location of the recipient and the location of the activity, for the years 2005-2014 in order to assess the employment and output impacts of federal contracting in metropolitan areas of the US. We resort to a shift-share instrument and precise location-specific fixed effects to estimate the causal impact of spending. Cities that receive more contract expenditure witness an expansion in output - with contracts generating $1.4 per dollar spent - but experience only modest increases in employment. The impact is also constrained geographically and short-lived. The results suggest that, on average, the effects of federal contracting on local economies are modest, meaning that attracting federal contracts may not be an effective urban development strategy.","[Gerritse, Michiel] Erasmus Univ, Burg Oudlaan 50, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Rodriguez-Pose, Andres] London Sch Econ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Rodríguez-Pose, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",gerritse@ese.eur.nl; a.rodriguez-pose@lse.ac.uk,"Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/B-8746-2008","Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/0000-0002-8041-0856",,,,,23,6,7,0,6,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0094-1190,1095-9068,,J URBAN ECON,J.

Here, we ask: what is equitable resilience? Our focus is on what resilience does on the ground in relation to development, adaptation and disaster management, and on identifying critical issues for engaging with equity in resilience practice. Using techniques from systematic reviews, with variants of equitable resilience as our key search terms, we carried out an analytical literature review which reveals four interconnected themes: subjectivities, inclusion, cross-scale interactions, and transformation. Drawing on this analysis, we find that 'equitable resilience' is increasingly likely when resilience practice takes into account issues of social vulnerability and differential access to power, knowledge, and resources; it requires starting from people's own perception of their position within their human environmental system, and it accounts for their realities and for their need for a change of circumstance to avoid imbalances of power into the future. Our approach moves beyond debates that focus on the ontological disconnect between resilience and social theory, to provide a definition that can be used in practice alongside resilience indicators to drive ground level interventions towards equitable outcomes.

These assets are infrequently traded, even when they are selected with activity requirements, and display great time-varying volatility during recession periods. However, the estimation of this liquidity proxy requires that the asset be traded daily continuously and that the volatility be proportional to the time interval. I propose a generalization of the original measure that allows for its practical estimation, even for non-continuous trading. The results show that this general version, estimated using information only from days with trades and discarding negative spreads, is more accurate than the standard one.","[Nieto, Belen] Univ Alicante, Financial Econ & Accounting, Ctra San Vicente Sn, E-03690 Alicante, Spain",Universitat d'Alacant,"Nieto, B (通讯作者)，Univ Alicante, Financial Econ & Accounting, Ctra San Vicente Sn, E-03690 Alicante, Spain.",belen.nieto@ua.es,"Nieto, Belen/H-4870-2011",,Generalitat Valenciana [PROMETEO/2017/158]; Spanish Department of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2015-67035-P]; Bank of Spain (Excellence in Education and Research Grant 2016),Generalitat Valenciana(Center for Forestry Research & Experimentation (CIEF)); Spanish Department of Economy and Competitiveness; Bank of Spain (Excellence in Education and Research Grant 2016),"This work was supported by the Generalitat Valenciana (PROMETEO/2017/158), the Spanish Department of Economy and Competitiveness (ECO2015-67035-P), and the Bank of Spain (Excellence in Education and Research Grant 2016).

This study examines whether shopping externalities or other scale effects offset this inventory externality for agents with the largest market presence. Data from Central Virginia shows that agents holding the greatest percentage of listings in the housing market obtain higher prices and sell listing faster than other agents. This pattern is consistent with the notion that top tier listing agents are able to exploit their market presence to generate meaningful positive shopping externality effects for individual clients. Propensity scoring models provide evidence that the performance advantage of these agents is not driven by differences in the types of houses they represent, but reflects agent productivity. On the other hand, top tier agents in terms of sales do not consistently obtain higher prices or shorter selling times for their listing clients. The shopping externalities associated with top tier listing agents do not appear to extend to top tier selling agents.","[Turnbull, Geoffrey K.] Univ Cent Florida, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Waller, Bennie D.] Longwood Univ, Farmville, VA 23909 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida; Longwood University,"Waller, BD (通讯作者)，Longwood Univ, Farmville, VA 23909 USA.",Geoffrey.Turnbull@ucf.edu; wallerbd@longwood.edu,"Waller, Bennie D./AAF-6043-2021; Waller, Bennie D/HKM-9179-2023",,,,,,38,7,9,0,19,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",1051-1377,1096-0791,,J HOUS ECON,J.

It documents that countries joining GATT/WTO after 1990 have implemented tariff-cum-tax reforms, lowering tariff rates and raising consumption tax rates, in particular through reform or introduction of a value added tax (VAT). Employing a panel of 97 developing and transitional countries, 31 of which joined GATT/WTO between 1990 and 2011, using robust difference-in-difference specifications as well as the synthetic control method, we find a statistically and economically significant decline in revenues from import duties. This finding supports concerns about revenue losses, but also corroborates the efficacy of the late Uruguay GATT and the WTO trade regimes in promoting free trade among new members. Regarding consumption taxes, we find robust evidence that revenue substitution was successful, since revenue losses from import duties were more than compensated for by enhanced revenues from consumption taxes. With regard to the timing of the revenue effects, our results show that revenue losses in import duties mostly take place at the time of membership or later. Changes in consumption taxation, however, exhibit pre-membership effects, as revenues are increased, and VAT is adopted, often a few years ahead of losses in import duties. No such effects are found before the start of the accession negotiations, indicating that consumption tax reforms are initiated once a country is on the road to GATT/WTO membership.

At the basis of the development of bio-economics, there is a successful implementation not only of top biotechnologies but also of new economic models that engage the economic agents in complex exchanges. Biotechnology companies are a true engine that helps the development of bio-economy basic mechanisms, optimization of their work having long-term repercussions. Companies that develop a sustainable knowledge management system that they integrate into their marketing strategy have the most prominent position on the market and gain multiple competitive advantages. The research, based on the qualitative research methodology in the form of an in-depth interview, highlights that the strategic decision regarding the implementation of a knowledge management system and the intelligent use of intellectual capital resources are correlated with variables such as: the managers' level of education in the field, corelating managers' activity to organizational culture. Knowledge, for new business models, is a good asset that can be capitalized; from this perspective, the implications at the level of marketing strategies are in the same time diverse and complex. Biotechnology SMEs will adapt to requirements by developing competitive advantages as a result of establishing relationships and developing exchanges within strategic alliances and less according to a classical model based on attributes that aims positioning of products or services above those of the competition.","[Gardan, Daniel Adrian; Andronie, Mihai; Gardan, Iuliana Petronela; Andronie, Irina Elena; Iatagan, Mariana] Spiru Haret Univ Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania",Spiru Haret University,"Gârdan, DA (通讯作者)，Spiru Haret Univ Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania.",danielgardan@gmail.com,"Gardan, Daniel Adrian/AAV-5169-2020; Gârdan, Iuliana Petronela/A-4811-2015; Andronie, Mihai/ABD-9856-2021; Gardan, Daniel Adrian/HMD-6584-2023","Gardan, Daniel Adrian/0000-0003-2569-6801; Gârdan, Iuliana Petronela/0000-0003-2757-1308; Gardan, Daniel Adrian/0000-0003-2569-6801; Hurloiu, Ion Iulian/0000-0002-7642-901X",,,,,44,11,12,1,31,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,AUG,2018,20.0,49,,,,,647,666,,10.24818/EA/2018/49/647,0.0,,,20,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GO8SD,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440364100009,0

Both economists and policymakers warn that population aging can have many deleterious effects on a country's economy including a decline in its saving rate, the emergence of a labor shortage, a deterioration in government finances owing to increased spending on old-age related programs, and reduced innovation and productivity growth. It is therefore imperative for countries to prepare themselves for the advent of an aged society. The emerging and developing countries in Asia are no exception, with the region generally lacking adequate systems in such areas as long-term care, public pensions, and health insurance. Against this background, an international workshop on Aging in Asia was held in Kitakyushu City, Japan, on November 15 to 16, 2016. The workshop was jointly sponsored by the Asian Development Bank Institute and the Asian Growth Research Institute and was organized by Charles Yuji Horioka, Peter J.

This special issue of the Review includes nine papers presented at this workshop plus one paper that was not presented there but was written by one of the workshop participants.

Constructing a novel firm-patent panel database from 29 countries, I find that transparency directly boosts innovative effort by reducing managerial career concerns. This effect operates through transparency's implicit contracting role: it reduces the sensitivity of management turnover to poor innovative output. Transparency also increases innovative efficiency through its governance role in facilitating efficient allocation of R&D capital. Nonetheless, the benefit of transparency is fully offset in environments with greater proprietary cost. These findings illuminate the unique roles and mechanisms of transparency in promoting innovation incentives and outcomes.","[Thong, Rong (Irene)] Univ Illinois, Dept Accounting, Chicago, IL 60607 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Thong, R (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Accounting, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",ronzhong@uic.edu,,,University of Illinois at Chicago; Trulaske College of Business of University of Missouri,University of Illinois at Chicago; Trulaske College of Business of University of Missouri,"This paper is based on my dissertation at the Robert J.

This study uses household survey data collected in the Poyang Lake area of China a region historically vulnerable to flooding to analyze rural vulnerability against the background of state-led development. We look at the three components of climate vulnerability: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity, and focus on examining households' allocations of assets and labor to illustrate the complex processes that affect rural livelihoods and households' adaptive capacity. We find that overall sensitivity to flooding has been reduced, particularly for those households with relatively high exposure. These changes suggest increased adaptive capacity and reduced flood vulnerability relative to the commune period and are the result of two main processes. First, the livelihoods of rural households have become increasingly differentiated amid broad industrial and urban development; and second, the presence of regional flood risk management has reduced exposure for agriculture oriented households.

For identification, I use unique security-level data from the German Microdatabase Securities Holdings Statistics. Banks and investment funds respond in a procyclical manner to past security-specific holding period returns. In contrast, insurance companies and pension funds act countercyclically; they buy when returns have been negative and sell after high returns. The heterogeneous responses can be explained by differences in their balance sheet structure. I exploit within-sector variation in the financial constraint to show that tighter constraints are associated with relatively more procyclical investment behavior. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We study herding behavior at the sector level during extreme oil market movements. Furthermore, we investigate the cross herding behavior between the two markets while including the volatility of the oil prices and investors' sentiment. We use a modified version of the cross section absolute deviation model to infer the impact of the oil market on industry herding. Our database covers a sample of all U.S. stocks from January 2000 to December 2017 on a daily basis. The results indicate that industry herding is absent in all sectors. However, when considering the extreme oil market movements, the results suggest that sector herding is more pronounced during oil market downturns than upturns. Moreover, we find that the oil market volatility and investors' sentiment reduce the industry herding. Our findings suggest that the herding is strongly related to the information in the oil market. In fact, investors use this information as trading signals, which affect their collective behavior. When the fear sentiment is high, investors do not follow the market consensus, but rather their own information making independent decisions.","[BenMabrouk, Houda] Univ Sousse, HEC Sousse, Sousse, Tunisia; [Litimi, Houda] Univ Sousse, HEC Sousse, LaREMFiQ Lab, Sousse, Tunisia",Universite de Sousse; Universite de Sousse,"BenMabrouk, H (通讯作者)，Univ Sousse, HEC Sousse, Sousse, Tunisia.",houda.benmabrouk.ihecs@gmail.com,,"Litimi, Houda/0000-0002-4385-7528",,,,,50,28,28,0,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1062-9408,1879-0860,,N AM J ECON FINANC,N.

We examine how this disservice undermines the potential recreational services by measuring the human response to environmental risk using exogenous variation in the risk of contracting Lyme Disease. We find evidence that individuals substitute away from spending time outdoors when there is greater risk of Lyme Disease infection. On average individuals spent 1.54 fewer minutes per day outdoors at the average, 72 U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, confirmed cases of Lyme Disease. We estimate lost outdoor recreation of 9.41 h per year per person in an average county in the Northeastern United States and an aggregate welfare loss on the order $2.8 billion to $5.0 billion per year.","[Berry, Kevin] Univ Alaska Anchorage, Inst Social & Econ Res, Dept Econ, 3211 Providence Dr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA; [Berry, Kevin; Fenichel, Eli P.] Yale Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Bayham, Jude] Calif State Univ Chico, Coll Agr, Chico, CA 95929 USA; [Meyer, Spencer R.] Highstead Fdn, POB 1097, Redding, CT 06875 USA",University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Anchorage; Yale University; California State University System; California State University Chico,"Berry, K (通讯作者)，Univ Alaska Anchorage, Inst Social & Econ Res, Dept Econ, 3211 Providence Dr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA.;Berry, K (通讯作者)，Yale Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",kberry13@alaska.edu,,"Berry, Kevin/0000-0002-6904-4349; Bayham, Jude/0000-0001-5383-2714",National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) at the National Institutes of Health [1R01GM100471-01]; NSF; NSF as part of the joint NSF-NIH-USDA Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases program [1414374]; NatureNet Science Program of The Nature Conservancy; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [1414374] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) at the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF as part of the joint NSF-NIH-USDA Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases program; NatureNet Science Program of The Nature Conservancy; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),This publication was made possible by Grant Number 1R01GM100471-01 from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) at the National Institutes of Health and NSF.

This article contributes to the latter literature by analysing whether, when and how local office-holders respond to the economic incentives embedded in exogenously imposed population thresholds leading to an increased number and remuneration of local politicians. Building on insights from the urban economics and public finance literatures, we argue that local politicians may strategically adjust fiscal and housing policies to stimulate in-migration when approaching a population threshold where their remuneration increases. Using data from all 589 Belgian municipalities over the period 1977-2016, our results confirm that approaching important population thresholds causes lower local tax rates and the granting of additional building permits (particularly for apartments). These policy changes occur early in the election cycle and, at least for housing policy, are restricted to incumbent mayors themselves expecting to benefit from crossing the population threshold.","[de Witte, Kristof] Maastricht Univ, Top Inst Evidence Based Educ Res, Kapoenstr 2, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [de Witte, Kristof] Univ Leuven KU Leuven, Leuven Econ Educ Res, Naamsestr 69, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Geys, Benny] Norwegian Business Sch BI, Nydalsveien 37, N-0442 Oslo, Norway; [Schonhage, Nanna Lauritz] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Appl Econ APEC, Pleinlaan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",Maastricht University; KU Leuven; BI Norwegian Business School; Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Geys, B (通讯作者)，Norwegian Business Sch BI, Nydalsveien 37, N-0442 Oslo, Norway.",k.dewitte@maastrichtuniversity.nl; Benny.Geys@bi.no,"Schönhage, Nanna Lauritz/AAT-6813-2021","Schönhage, Nanna Lauritz/0000-0001-7785-0829; Geys, Benny/0000-0003-4524-1820; De Witte, Kristof/0000-0003-0505-8642",FWO Vlaanderen [G000218N],FWO Vlaanderen(FWO),"We would like to thank the editor (Stuart Rosenthal), two anonymous referees, Andre Decoster, Jon Fiva, Ronny Freier, Erik Hernas, Joshua Holm, Sebastian Kessing, Sverre Kittelsen, Andreas Kotsadam, Espen Moen, Wim Moesen, Oyvind Aas Nilsen, Rune Sorensen, Viterslav Titl, participants at the 2016 European Economic Association Meeting and seminars at the universities of Budapest, Maastricht, Leuven, Lille, and Siegen as well as Frisch Centre and BI Norwegian Business School for insightful comments and discussions.

Since selling a stock at a loss is painful, an investor who sells at a loss must have particularly negative information.

Our topic of study is of major importance, as duration is a proxy for other dimensions, such as the magnitude of bubbles, the extent of macroeconomic imbalances, and the chance that a rational bubble turns into an irrational one. We answer two related questions: (i) Does prolonged domestic monetary-policy easing increase the duration of housing price bubbles? (ii) Does prolonged monetary-policy easing in the United States influence the housing bubbles' duration in other OECD countries? We show that the answer to the first question is a clear yes but that the answer to the second question is not as clear.

We show that this learning exhibits complementarity: learning more along one dimension increases the value of learning about the other. As a result, regulatory changes may be counterproductive. First, increasing transparency (i.e., making fundamental information cheaper to acquire) can make prices less informative when investors respond by learning relatively more about others. Second, public disclosures discourage private learning about fundamentals, while encouraging information acquisition about others. Accordingly, disclosing more fundamental information can decrease overall informational efficiency by decreasing price informativeness.","[Banerjee, Snehal] Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Davis, Jesse] Univ N Carolina, 300 Kenan Ctr Dr, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Gondhi, Naveen] INSEAD, Fontainebleau, France",University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; INSEAD Business School,"Davis, J (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, 300 Kenan Ctr Dr, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",Jesse_Davis@kenan-flagler.unc.edu,,"Banerjee, Snehal/0000-0003-3269-5188",,,,,65,38,47,9,39,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

We examine whether these spatial distributions of rural population in 2000 influence subsequent changes in the rate of poverty from 2000 to 2012 in 83 developing countries. We find no evidence of a direct impact on changes in poverty, but there is a significant indirect impact via the elasticity of poverty reduction with respect to growth. If climate change leads to more people concentrated in these areas, or an increase in unfavorable agricultural regions, then the poverty-reducing impact of overall per capita income growth could be further weakened. Reducing poverty will require targeting rural populations in less favored lands and remote areas and encouraging out-migration.","[Barbier, Edward B.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Hochard, Jacob P.] East Carolina Univ, Dept Econ, Greenville, NC USA; [Hochard, Jacob P.] East Carolina Univ, Inst Coastal Sci & Policy, Greenville, NC USA",Colorado State University; University of North Carolina; East Carolina University; University of North Carolina; East Carolina University,"Barbier, EB (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ, Dept Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",edward.barbier@colostate.edu,,"Hochard, Jacob/0000-0002-9502-2602","Economics of Land Degradation (ELD) Initiative - Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammernabeit (GIZ), Germany [81163559]","Economics of Land Degradation (ELD) Initiative - Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammernabeit (GIZ), Germany","The research was supported by the Economics of Land Degradation (ELD) Initiative, through financial support by the Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammernabeit (GIZ), Germany, under grant #81163559.

We show that adding a non-negativity constraint on reserves onto a simple linear-quadratic framework generates a time consistency problem. A central bank with full commitment achieves a gradual depreciation to the pure-float level by promising sustained future intervention, such that reserves are exhausted after particularly adverse shocks. A central bank without commitment intervenes little, wishing to preserve some reserves forever, so it suffers a larger immediate depreciation and achieves lower welfare. For more persistent shocks, the time consistency problem is greater, and simple intervention rules can achieve welfare gains relative to discretion.","[Basu, Suman S.; Ghosh, Atish R.; Ostry, Jonathan D.] Int Monetary Fund, Res Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Winant, Pablo E.] Bank England, London, England",International Monetary Fund; Bank of England,"Basu, SS (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Res Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",sbasu2@imf.org; aghosh@imf.org; jostry@imf.org; pablo.winant@bankofengland.co.uk,,,,,,,49,6,8,0,2,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

Using medical and prescription claims from a large national insurer, I estimate individual claim rates and out-of-pocket (OOP) costs of prescription contraceptives for 329,642 women aged 13 to 45 who were enrolled in private health insurance between January 2008 and December 2013. I find that OOP spending on contraceptives has decreased sharply since the implementation of the ACA mandate. Using a difference-in-difference model that leverages employer-level variation in compliance with the mandate, I estimate the effect of the mandate on use of both short- and long-term methods of prescription birth control. I find that the mandate has increased insurance claims for short-term contraceptive methods (the pill, patch, ring, shot, diaphragms/cervical caps, and prescription emergency contraception) by 4.8percent and increased initiation of long-term methods (intrauterine devices, implant, or sterilization) by 15.8percent. Using data from a national survey of reproductive age women during this same time period, a back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the mandate increased total use of any method of prescription contraceptive use by 2.95percentage points among privately insured women in 2013, or a 6.57percent relative increase. These increases in use of prescription contraceptives among privately insured women in the United States as a result of the ACA mandate have important potential implications for fertility rates, health care spending, and economic outcomes for women and their families.","[Becker, Nora V.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Internal Med, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Harvard University; Brigham & Women's Hospital,"Becker, NV (通讯作者)，Brigham & Womens Hosp, Internal Med, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",norabecker47@gmail.com,,,"NIH [T32-GM007170]; Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics at the University of Pennsylvania; Department of Health Care Management in the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania; HVMA-Primary Care Internal Medicine Residency Program at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, MA","NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics at the University of Pennsylvania; Department of Health Care Management in the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania; HVMA-Primary Care Internal Medicine Residency Program at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, MA","For helpful comments and discussion, I would like to thank Daniel Polsky, Mark Pauly, Scott Harrington, Guy David, Kevin Volpp, Ben Sommers, Corey Dukes, Karin Rhodes, Lance Becker, Preethi Rao, Elena Prager, Shulamite Huang, Sunita Desai, Ari Friedman, Kaitlin Daniels, and the current and former PhD students and faculty in the Department of Health Care Management at the University of Pennsylvania who participated in numerous seminars discussing this work.

Our results demonstrate that agency culture is indeed an important predictor of entrepreneurship and that this effect is moderated by constitutional provisions supporting economic freedom.

Our econometric methodology borrows from developments in the empirical trade literature to accommodate a dataset with numerous zero-value observations. Our results indicate that aid agency independence does not have significant effects on the determinants of bilateral aid flows at the extensive or intensive margins.

However, the dominance of individual players on this market leads to liquidity imbalance and, thus, might increase the risk for other banks. We test how different bank exposures in interbank market translates into other bank liquidity risk and credit supply. To this end, we use 207 bank exits from interbank markets between 1997 and 2013 in 52 emerging and developed countries. We find that the withdrawal of a bank with high net exposure on interbank market leads to a statistically significant drop in the liquidity position of the remaining banks. The effect is also economically significant. Finally, we find that a liquidity imbalance adversely affects the bank credit supply. Our findings suggest that the consequences are more severe for banks heavily relying on the local interbank market, for emerging countries and surprisingly in pre-crisis periods.

We argue that minority status is associated with lower trust in third-party institutions controlled by an ethnic out-group, and, as a result, leads to a preference for certain earnings over potentially risky investments. We test this hypothesis with multiple sources of evidence from Bosnia and Herzegovina. First, we experimentally elicit investment behavior among members of the same ethnic group on two sides of the boundary that makes some individuals majorities and others minorities. Second, we induce minority status in the lab. Analyses across the studies show that both natural and induced minority statuses lead to lower levels of investment. We provide ecological validity to the experimental results with the analysis of a large, representative household survey and an original survey of businessmen.

Further, the demographic and economic characteristics in relation to the deprivation index and city size are analysed in detail. Very large cities are endowed with better living conditions and infrastructural facilities, displaying lower magnitude of the index though this relationship is not very strong, suggesting the importance of other variables such as income, location and the overall level of urbanisation, impacting on the index value. Large cities experience agglomeration economies but they do not benefit all sections of the population equally, which in turn does not necessarily bring in proportionate decline in the deprivation index with a rise in city size. Further, other demographic and economic variables are examined in relation to the deprivation index and city size. Findings show Further, there is no marked improvement in these other indicators of development with increase in as city size increases.

We obtain two main results. First, the aggregate demand channel creates a trade-off between the recessionary impact of fiscal consolidation and the risk of a future sovereign debt crisis. Risk aversion has a large impact on output losses and on welfare. Second, we find that savers and borrowers disagree about the optimal path of sovereign deleveraging. The sovereign risk channel can therefore explain some of the rise in political disagreement about fiscal policy. We use a calibrated version of the model to shed light on sovereign deleveraging in the Eurozone.","[Philippon, Thomas] NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Philippon, Thomas] NBER, Washington, DC 20009 USA; [Philippon, Thomas] CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA; [Roldan, Francisco] NYU, New York, NY USA",New York University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); New York University,"Philippon, T (通讯作者)，NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10003 USA.;Philippon, T (通讯作者)，NBER, Washington, DC 20009 USA.;Philippon, T (通讯作者)，CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA.",tphilipp@stern.nyu.edu,"Perez Roldan, Francisco/HGE-5259-2022",,,,,,34,1,2,0,2,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

Within loan syndicates, we find that banks with less capital report lower risk estimates. Consistent with an effort to mitigate capital requirements, the sensitivity to capital is robust to bank fixed effects and greater for large, risky, and opaque credits. Also, low-capital banks' risk estimates have less explanatory power than those of high-capital banks with regard to loan prices, indicating that their estimates incorporate less information. Our results suggest banks underreport risk in response to capital constraints and highlight the perils of regulation premised on self-reporting.","[Plosser, Matthew C.; Santos, Joao A.

Theoretical models generally predict a positive relation between the two. Nevertheless, the empirical findings so far have been inconclusive. Using a generalization of the analytical framework developed by Theodossiou and Savva (2016) along with time-varying asymmetry, linked to the up-side and downside uncertainty, the risk-return puzzle is investigated across international stock markets. The investigation reveals that the contradictory findings are the result of ignoring the impact of skewness on the total price of risk. That is, in the absence of skewness the relationship between risk and return is positive as depicted by finance theory. However, negative skewness results in lowering the total price of risk and in some cases reverting its sign from positive to negative.","[Savva, Christos S.; Theodossiou, Panayiotis] Cyprus Univ Technol, Dept Commerce Finance & Shipping, POB 50329, CY-3603 Lemesos, Cyprus",Cyprus University of Technology,"Savva, CS (通讯作者)，Cyprus Univ Technol, Dept Commerce Finance & Shipping, POB 50329, CY-3603 Lemesos, Cyprus.",christos.savva@cut.ac.cy,"Savva, Christos/AGI-6048-2022","Savva, Christos/0000-0001-6562-4816; Theodossiou, Panayiotis/0000-0001-5556-2594",,,,,45,13,13,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1479-8409,1479-8417,,J FINANC ECONOMET,J.

Using a sample of 15 EU countries over the past three decades, our crisis dating follows the scheme of the European Systemic Risk Board. The exuberance indicators slightly outperform benchmark signaling and logit models. Variables based on credit- and debt-service are identified as better predictors than housing market variables, which in turn outperform stock market variables. The results corroborate the existing literature, which says financial crises are typically preceded by leveraged bubbles, and more specifically, that initial bubble signals from explosive growth in credit and asset prices are followed by a lift-off in debt-servicing costs as a financial crisis nears. The risk of financial crisis peaks just after the bubble bursts. Our results indicate that exuberance tests, which can be used in crisis prediction in a manner similar to conventional early warning models, may be readily incorporated into the toolkit of financial stability supervisors.

However, the neural substrates of decision-making in domains such as those involving emotion processing in social interactions have as yet remained largely unexplored. In this functional neuroimaging study, we used a paradigm developed in neuroeconomical studies of subjective preferences to uncover the neural substrates involved in deciding the degree of sadness in facial expressions, which convey information on sufferance in conspecifics. Because of the possible association of facial expressions with stimulus properties such as the capacity to be emotionally arousing, we used a procedure designed to control for this possible confound. The contrast representing differences in attributed sadness activated the precuneus and posterior cingular cortex, areas often implicated in studies of subjective preference. Also, the somatosensory cortex was active, an area associated with both sensory discrimination tasks in the visual domain and whose lesion is known to result in deficits in emotion recognition. In the same contrast, no activation of the amygdala, the substrate of emotional arousal, was detected (or of any other area associated with the sensory processing of faces, such as the fusiform gyrus). These results suggest that specific networks beyond those sensitive to the arousing properties of emotional stimuli are active when making choices in a social-cognitive domain.","[Viviani, Roberto] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Psychol, Innrain 52, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Viviani, Roberto; Dommes, Lisa; Bosch, Julia] Univ Ulm, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy 3, Ulm, Germany; [Stingl, Julia C.] Fed Inst Drugs & Med Devices, Bonn, Germany; [Stingl, Julia C.] Univ Bonn, Med Sch, Ctr Translat Med, Bonn, Germany; [Beschoner, Petra] Univ Ulm, Psychosomat & Psychotherapy Clin, Ulm, Germany",University of Innsbruck; Ulm University; University of Bonn; Ulm University,"Viviani, R (通讯作者)，Univ Innsbruck, Inst Psychol, Innrain 52, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",roberto.viviani@uibk.ac.at,"Stingl, Julia Carolin/ABA-7201-2020","Stingl, Julia Carolin/0000-0002-1566-8156; Viviani, Roberto/0000-0002-7517-6006","NeuronERANET grant (BrainCYP) [BMBF 01EW1402B]; Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM, Bonn)","NeuronERANET grant (BrainCYP); Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM, Bonn)","This is the revised text of a talk given at the 13th NeuroPsychoEconomics conference (June 8-9, 2017, Ant-werp, Belgium).

The revealed predictability is also of economic significance, as shown by examining the performance of portfolios constructed on the oil-based forecasts of stock volatility. Results from robustness tests suggest that oil volatility provides different information from traditional macro variables.

Using female membership in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) as a measure for women's political participation and relying on data provided by Chinese county chronicles, we show that female political participation in 1950 had a long-term and positive impact on gender equality of education in 1990. Relying on individual-level data provided by the 1990 census, we construct a panel dataset comprising of people of different age cohorts in individual counties and find that contemporary women's political participation significantly narrows the gender gap by raising girls' probability of enrollment and completion of school relative to those of boys. The positive effects remain when we use the time of liberation, i.e., the time when the CCP got control of a county, to construct an instrument for the female party membership in 1950 and future periods. These effects also remain significant when the period of Cultural Revolution is studied. Finally, we test two channels, the policy channel and the perception channel, by which these effects were possibly exerted. For the policy channel, public spending on education is studied; and for the perception channel, parents' aspiration and investment for daughters' education are studied. The paper finds supporting evidence for the perception channel, but not for the policy channel. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

An important challenge has been to combine efficiency and equity considerations in a single social welfare framework. The Chichilnisky criterion is one way to resolve this. We consider its implementation in the climate-economy model Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy (DICE), and compare results for different damage functions, namely the standard one in DICE and the one proposed by Weitzman implying potential large climate damages at high temperature increases. We calculate optimal climate policy for different parameter settings and compare the results with those under the green golden rule (only final utility matters) and classical utilitarianism (no discounting). Optimal emission abatement trajectories turn out to be very different between standard discounted utilitarianism, classical utilitarianism and Chichilnisky specifications. The results are very sensitive to the damage function, the climate sensitivity parameter and especially the Chichilnisky weight given to utility of generations in the far future. We discuss conditions and reasons for preferring either classical utilitarianism or the Chichilnisky criterion, and conclude that a critical factor is the time horizon used in climate policy analysis. Adopting sustainable preferences as formalized by the Chichilnisky criterion in climate policy analysis has the advantage that the very long-term implications of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere on the environment and human welfare are not downplayed.","[Botzen, W.

This issue is especially meaningful In countries such as Taiwan that have large numbers of firms with concentrated shareholdings. Consistent with the findings of Louis et al. (2012), our results indicate that accounting conservatism enhanced the value of cash holdings. In addition, our findings support both hypotheses H2a and H2b depending on the proportion of control-affiliated directors, agency problems, and financial crises. In general, the incentive effect of controlling shareholders, H2b, is supported at a relatively low proportion of control-affiliated directors, whereas the entrenchment effect of controlling shareholders, H2a, is confirmed at a relatively high proportion of control-affiliated directors. Moreover, the entrenchment effect is aggravated when a firm suffers a serious agency problem during a period of financial crisis. This study contributes to the current literature on the influence of accounting conservatism on cash value in the presence or absence of controlling shareholders.","[Lin, Cho -Min; Chan, Min-Lee; Chien, I-Hsin; Li, Kuan-Hua] Providence Univ, Dept Finance, 200,Sec 7,Taiwan Blvd, Taichung 43301, Taiwan",Providence University - Taiwan,"Chan, ML (通讯作者)，Providence Univ, Dept Finance, 200,Sec 7,Taiwan Blvd, Taichung 43301, Taiwan.",chanml@pu.edu.tw,,,National Science Council of R.O.C.

This measure satisfies several desirable properties, including distribution sensitivity, which deals with differences among the unemployed. It is particularly suited to developing countries because individuals in these countries display considerable variation in labor force participation, unemployment duration, and unemployment intensity. It can also be decomposed into mean and variance components and contributions to unemployment by various subgroups of the population. We use this measure and data from National Sample Surveys on employment and unemployment to understand unemployment in India during the period 1993 to 2012. We show that unemployment has generally fallen, although the distribution of unemployment has worsened. Moreover, unemployment is driven to a greater extent by higher educated groups; the unemployment among these groups is also fairly substantial. We explain these findings and suggest some policies.","[Motiram, Sripad] Univ Massachusetts, Boston, MA 02125 USA; [Naraparaju, Karthikeya] Indian Inst Management Indore, Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston; Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Indore,"Motiram, S (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02125 USA.",sripad.motiram@umb.edu,,"Naraparaju, Karthikeya/0000-0002-3333-0191",Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR) [RESPRO/31/ICSSR/2013-14/RPS],Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR),This work was supported by Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR) (Grant No. RESPRO/31/ICSSR/2013-14/RPS).,,49,1,1,1,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Over the last few years, the principles of the circular economy have been gradually integrated into several sectors, the consumer electronics industry being such an example. The applicability of the circular economy principles in this sector has been presented in the literature, but these approaches have taken into account, in particular, the physical, tangible components of electronic products, focusing on the existing interrelationships between the circular economy and the production and use of electronic devices and equipment. Given that electronic products often incorporate intangible components, namely the software necessary for their operation, we have chosen to address in this paper the problems of the circular economy from this perspective, the purpose of this paper being to emphasize the relation between the use of software products and the principles of circular economy. Thus, the paper presents the main opportunities and challenges that circular economy involves for all stakeholders, namely manufacturers of electronic goods and developers of the related software and their users. In order to determine the way consumers capitalize the possibilities to reuse the software components of IT products they use (computers, tablets, mobile phones), we have undertaken an exploratory research that took place between October and November 2017 on the basis of a structured questionnaire posted online and applied to Romanian young people, the number of respondents being 257. Research has shown the respondents easily adapt to new versions of software when they change their phone or laptop and there is a frequent transfer of equipment without considering the possibilities of reuse the software because when the respondents alienate these devices also delete the installed software.","[Onete, Cristian Bogdan; Albastroiu, Irina; Dina, Razvan] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Onete, CB (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",bogdan.onete@com.ase.ro,"Dina, Razvan/I-5139-2017; Onete, Cristian Bogdan/E-6579-2017; Albastroiu Nastase, Irina/AAN-1428-2020","Dina, Razvan/0000-0002-9360-4756; Albastroiu Nastase, Irina/0000-0003-4159-0572",,,,,29,5,5,4,23,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,MAY,2018,20.0,48,,,,,325,339,,10.24818/EA/2018/48/325,0.0,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GN9XV,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439567500007,0

This mandate excludes a price stabilization role. Procurement prices, based on production costs, are often set above market prices to encourage production. Several disbursements channels exist: grain provided free or at a discount to targeted vulnerable households; subsidized sales to millers; and sales to prisons or nongovernmental aid programs, typically at market-related prices. Given the perception that these activities are distortive, we use time-series econometrics to model maize price dynamics in select wholesale markets to capture the Agency's market impact. We find that its pricing strategy had an insignificant impact on prices during 2010/11-2014/15 despite a fairly significant presence in at least some regional markets. We recommend that the Agency reconsiders offering a price premium on procured maize or selling maize at discount to millers, as limited market spill-over effects imply the benefits are captured by only a few, even though its practice of providing subsidized or free maize to vulnerable people is not in question. Furthermore, current storage capacity expansion plans are not required and inconsistent with its food security mandate.","[Pierre, Guillaume; Magrini, Emiliano] FAO, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Pauw, Karl] IFPRI, Washington, DC 20005 USA",Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Pauw, K (通讯作者)，IFPRI, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",k.pauw@cgiar.org,,"Pauw, Karl/0000-0002-5104-173X; Pauw, Karl/0000-0001-6580-0939",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation),"At the time of writing, the authors were all researchers of the Monitoring and Analyzing Food and Agricultural Policies (MAFAP) program of the FAO, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

Does such a rule hold true for China at the present stage? Previous studies pay little attention to this issue due to the lack of related data. Merging the micro data from the Chinese General Social Survey in 2010 (CGSS2010) with the macro data at the corresponding urban level of China, as well as two types of satellite monitoring data, this paper investigates the effect of income on residents' WTP for environmental protection at both macro and micro perspectives based on the ordered Logit model. The results show that the rich do have stronger WTP for environmental protection. However, with the increase in residents' income, the marginal WTP for environmental protection will decline, and a reversal occurs at the top income level. Therefore, the WTP does not always rise with the increase in income, and the middle-income class has the strongest WTP for environmental protection. Moreover, after controlling individual characteristics, residents' WTP for environmental protection more depends on environmental pollution degree rather than urban average income level measured by both GDP per capita and the nighttime lights data from satellite monitoring. The residents in more polluted cities have stronger WTP for environmental protection. Therefore, it is not reasonable to improve people's environmental preferences purely through economic development. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Transit-oriented development (TOD) has been adopted as a major urban policy to achieve such integration. TOD explicitly promotes a balance between public transportation-driven supply and land use-driven demand, while simultaneously improving the pedestrian friendliness of the station areas. The objective of balancing transport with land use is the founding principle of the node-place model. Three principle dimensions can be evaluated under the extended version of this model: i) the node-index, reflecting the accessibility of the station area by several transportation modes; ii) the place-index, reflecting the land use features of the station areas; and iii) the design-index, reflecting the urban design conditions that influence pedestrian accessibility of the station areas. In this paper, we apply the extended node-place model at a local scale, using Lisbon subway stations as the focus points of our analysis, applying the same principles and methodology as for the metropolitan scale, but adjusting the parameters to reflect the subway network. Our results suggest that the introduction of a third index better distinguishes between balanced situations identified in the original node place model. In Lisbon, the average node index is higher than the place index, and the design index varies substantially across the subway network. In general terms, city center subway stations exhibit the highest index values, whereas peripheral stations tend to be more unbalanced. Transfer stations constitute special cases in the network, having high node and design indexes but average place indexes. The typology of Lisbon subway stations based on the extended node-place model might be used to support urban planning, specifically with regard to establishing regulations for locating activities and parking supply, guiding location-sensitive or place-based fiscal policies, and also identifying the types of intervention needed to achieve the desired integration between transportation accessibility, land use intensity and diversity, and urban design.","[Vale, David S.; Viana, Claudia M.; Pereira, Mauro] Univ Lisbon, Fac Architecture, CIAUD, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa,"Vale, DS (通讯作者)，Univ Lisbon, Fac Architecture, CIAUD, Lisbon, Portugal.",dvale@fa.ulisboa.pt,"Vale, David/N-8612-2013; Pereira, Mauro F./AFN-8056-2022; Viana, Claudia M./A-9352-2019","Vale, David/0000-0002-1403-0628; Pereira, Mauro F./0000-0002-4173-5279; Viana, Claudia M./0000-0001-6858-4522","Portuguese Funding Agency for Science, Research and Technology [UID/EAT/4008/2013]","Portuguese Funding Agency for Science, Research and Technology","We would like to acknowledge the financial support given to CIAUD by the Portuguese Funding Agency for Science, Research and Technology (project reference UID/EAT/4008/2013), and a special recognition to students who helped collecting the data on walking distance to the stations.",,46,68,72,33,148,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

According to the French and Roll (1986) 'decomposition of price formation', our empirical results rule out the possibility that volatility dynamics are driven by public information and mispricing, since the findings indicate that private information proxied by information-related intraday patterns of volatility and bid-ask spread would be the major cause of price variations. A test of the information hypothesis of Schlag and Stoll (2005) provides further support for the existence of private information in foreign institutional trading. Finally, when calculating the cumulative return for foreign institutional traders from detailed account-by-account trading data, the conclusions drawn from our empirical analysis remain unchanged.","[Weng, Pei-Shih] Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Finance, Hualien, Taiwan; [Tsai, Wei-Che] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung, Taiwan",National Dong Hwa University; National Sun Yat Sen University,"Tsai, WC (通讯作者)，70 Lienhai Rd, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan.",weiche@mail.nsysu.edu.tw,"Weng, Pei-Shih/AAL-3339-2021; Tsai, Wei-Che/K-9249-2016","Weng, Pei-Shih/0000-0002-0988-2041; Tsai, Wei-Che/0000-0002-0066-4822",Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan,"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","This paper has benefited from insightful comments and suggestions by Professor Thomas C.

Although these results are consistent with substantial transaction costs for closing large short positions, they also reveal that some short sellers are privately informed about positive future events and have timing ability in covering positions.","[Boehmer, Ekkehart] Singapore Management Univ, Lee Kong Chian Sch Business, Singapore, Singapore; [Duong, Truong X.] Iowa State Univ, Ivy Coll Business, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Huszar, Zsuzsa R.] NUS, Business Sch, Singapore, Singapore; [Huszar, Zsuzsa R.] NUS, RMI, Singapore, Singapore; [Huszar, Zsuzsa R.] NUS, IRES, Singapore, Singapore",Singapore Management University; Iowa State University; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore,"Duong, TX (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Ivy Coll Business, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",eboehmer@smu.edu.sg; tduong@iastate.edu; bizhzr@nus.edu.sg,"Huszar, Zsuzsa Reka/P-4211-2015","Huszar, Zsuzsa Reka/0000-0002-4325-5295","NUS [R-315-000-087-133, R-315-000-085-112]",NUS(National University of Singapore),Huszar acknowledges the generous financial support from a NUS startup grant (R-315-000-087-133) and an academic research grant (R-315-000-085-112).

Due to hedging, interest rate risk is small and the income from maturity transformation is only a small share of the net interest margin and the return on assets. However, interest rate risk positions do vary significantly between banks and over time. My results suggest that banks lower their interest rate risk significantly when the yield curve flattens. Interest rate risk is negatively related to on-balance sheet leverage and has a U-shaped relation with solvability for banks that do not use derivatives. Banks that received government assistance during the financial crisis have higher interest rate risk than banks that did not receive assistance.

This study analysed contract farming arrangements in the export banana industry in the Philippines amidst an expanding epidemic of Panama disease. We developed a political ecology of risk approach to investigate how ideas about technological and biological risks are influenced by contractual arrangements, and we borrowed from Cultural Theory the insight that risk and blame are connected concepts, always political, and disadvantage marginalized groups through disproportionate risk burdens. Data collection involved the study of contracts, interviews with decision-makers, and focus group discussions with agrarian cooperatives. The views of both large corporations as well as organized smallholders were recorded. We found that the former contractually compel the latter to bear the burden of the disease, while blaming them for its spread. Risk decisions were embedded in the dynamics of agrarian social relationships, and economic and political arrangements between actors influenced possibilities and limitations for disease control. We argue that the contractual stipulations, in concert with blaming processes, create a discursive environment that both allow inequitable relations to remain unquestioned, and constrain possibilities for control of Panama disease.","[de la Cruz, Jaye] Wageningen Univ & Res, Knowledge Technol & Innovat Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Jansen, Kees] Wageningen Univ & Res, Rural Sociol Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research,"de la Cruz, J (通讯作者)，4-F Leeuwenborch Bldg,Hollandseweg 1 Bldg 201, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",jaye.delacruz@wur.nl,"Jansen, Kees/C-3222-2008",,,,,,58,18,21,2,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Participants first generate resources in a real-effort task and then distribute them. In the partial allocation task, the participant determines the earnings for herself and another participant. In the impartial allocation task, the participant determines the earnings for two other participants. We also manipulate the participants' experience, i.e., whether they took part in similar allocation experiments before. We find that participants are more likely to allocate more resources to themselves than what they earned in the real effort task when they decide partially.

Using peer firms' idiosyncratic returns as an exogenous peer performance measure and the instrumental variable approach, we find that higher peer performance leads to higher discretionary accruals. This effect is salient for both industry leaders and followers and is robust to alternative discretionary accrual measures and alternative peer definitions. We examine two mechanisms through which peer performance affects firms' earnings management. We find that analysts revise their earnings forecasts according to peer performance and that when peer performance is higher, firms are less likely to meet or beat analyst consensus without managing earnings. This evidence suggests a capital market pressure mechanism. In addition, the effect of peer performance is more pronounced in firms using relative performance evaluation, suggesting a compensation pressure mechanism. In sum, our evidence suggests that managers report opportunistically to match peer performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Using the central idea of Akerlors 'social distance' theory, individual distance is calculated from their own group mean consumption and then we examine whether individuals from different social groups - caste and religion-are alienated across the distance distribution. Using India's household-level micro data on consumption expenditure covering three major survey rounds since the inception of the reform period, we find a non-unique pattern where the marginalised and minority group households tend to be alienated across the distance distribution. However, among them, the households with higher educational attainment become more integrated as reflected in the interaction effect of education. These results are robust even after controlling for the endogeneity of education. Given this significant group difference in consumption, we undertake a group-level comparison by creating a counterfactual group through exchanging the characteristics of the privileged group to the marginalised group (or Hindus to non Hindus), and find that the privileged group still consumes more than the counterfactual marginalised group, explaining around 77% of the estimated average consumption gap at the median quantile in 2011-12 (or 59% for Hindus versus Non-Hindus). This suggests other inherent identity-specific social factors as possible contributors to within-group alienation (relative to a better-off category) that can only be minimised through promoting education for the marginalised (or minority religion) group.

We adopt the LASSO method to select essential predictors among the variables mentioned in the literature. We show the preeminence of our proposed QHM through the fact that it presents a different degree of financial ratios' effect over various quantile levels. While DHM only confirms the aftermaths of stock return volatilities and total liabilities and the positive effects of stock price, stock excess return, and profitability on businesses, under high quantile levels QHM is able to supplement cash and short-term investment to total assets, market capitalization, and current liabilities ratio into the list of factors that influence a default. More interestingly, cash and short-term investment to total assets and market capitalization switch signs in high quantile levels, showing their different influence on companies with different risk levels. We also discover evidence for the distinction of default probability among different industrial sectors. Lastly, our proposed QHM empirically demonstrates improved out-of-sample forecasting performance.","[Manh Cuong Dong] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Econ, Taichung, Taiwan; [Tian, Shaonan] San Jose State Univ, Dept Mkt & Decis Sci, San Jose, CA 95192 USA; [Chen, Cathy W.

Q-method is applied among a sample of seventeen international accessibility experts to explore heterogeneity among experts with respect to the impacts of AVs on accessibility, and study different views and clusters of experts. Q -method statements are deductively categorized according to four accessibility components of the conceptual framework. Three viewpoints were extracted, indicating that experts expect AVs to influence accessibility through all four accessibility components. Viewpoint A expects that accessibility benefits stemming from AVs will be highly uncertain, mainly because of induced travel demand that will likely cancel out travel time and cost savings of AVs in the long term. Viewpoint B anticipates that accessibility changes because of AVs will have two opposing implications for urban form: densification of city center and further urban sprawl. Finally, viewpoint C expects that those who can afford an AV will mainly enjoy AVs benefits, thus AVs will have more negative than positive implications for social equity.","[Milakis, Dimitris] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Transport & Planning, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, POB 5048, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands; [Kroesen, Maarten; van Wee, Bert] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Transport & Logist Grp, POB 5015, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology; Delft University of Technology,"Milakis, D (通讯作者)，Delft Univ Technol, Dept Transport & Planning, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, POB 5048, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands.",d.milakis@tudelft.nl; M.Kroesen@tudelft.nl; G.P.vanWee@tudelft.nl,"Milakis, Dimitris/V-4895-2019","Milakis, Dimitris/0000-0001-5220-4206",,,,,30,83,87,2,29,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Increasing accompaniment of children, which is often carried out as car transportation, creates more motorized traffic, thus leading to lower likelihood of other children traveling independently and actively. Against this background, a two-step survey was conducted to analyse the active and independent mobility (AIM) of primary school children. In a first step, mobility licenses and mobility data were collected with the help of travel diaries including specific information on travel accompaniment. In the second step, in-depth interviews with parents were conducted. Although the data can only provide a snapshot of the independent mobility of primary school children, this study confirms that active and independent mobility is the result of a variety of factors. The results indicate that - besides trip distance and age-the type of school (all-day/half-day primary school) is likewise relevant. Based on the parents' assessments, significant sharing of trips takes place in case travel accompaniment is unnecessary. Depending on the parents' attitudes towards AIM, we identified three profiles (Promoters, Pragmatists and Protectors). Linking these profiles to indicators of AIM reveals that different attitudes manifest themselves in children's travel patterns. The results are limited as only two schools served as sources of data and it was not possible to decouple the parental profiles from children's ages. Overall, it can be concluded that there is potential for improved active and independent mobility in children.

Many governments and donors promote contract farming as part of agricultural development policies. However, there is serious concern whether smaller farmers can benefit from these arrangements. This paper presents the results of a systematic review that analysed the evidence in the literature on income effects for smallholders. The review included all studies with an econometric design to reduce selection bias in effect estimates. The meta-analysis covered 26 empirical instances of contract farming in 13 developing countries. The contracts varied widely, with varying service packages provided by the firm to the farmers. Using truth table analysis, we explored combinations of services associated with relatively high or relatively low income effects. The meta-analysis resulted in an overall pooled average effect size of 38%. However, we show that there are publication and survivor biases. Non-significant effects are systematically underreported. Moreover, all studies assessed the effectiveness of the contractual arrangement when these had already survived the start-up problems. Both sources of bias lead to an overestimation of the average income effect. The findings point to the need for substantial income effects for contract farming arrangements to survive over time. Both firms and farmers face risks; for example, farmers may side-sell products after having received the services from the firm. The most effective contractual arrangements included a price premium, especially when there was no farmers' organisation to broker the contract between the farmer and the firm. We show that smallholders can benefit from the contractual arrangement. However, the poorest farmers are rarely included; we show that, in 61% of the cases, the contract farmers had significantly larger landholdings or more assets than the average farmers in the region.

Specifically, I investigate whether the decrease in the rate of return to women's work discourages them from participating in the labor force by simulating expected net payroll tax rates and dependent benefits. Dependent benefits may reduce the net return to women's work, as they usually pay the full payroll tax without receiving marginal benefits for additional earnings if they claim benefits based on their husbands' earnings records. The results show that high net payroll tax rates reduce married women's work incentives, particularly those near retirement age.

Women and decision-making benefits from a son in India,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Son preference; Non-monetary benefits; Decision-making power; Intra-household allocation; India; Asia,RURAL INDIA; RESOURCE DISTRIBUTION; MARKET OPPORTUNITIES; GENETIC ENDOWMENTS; SOUTH-ASIA; PREFERENCE; GENDER; GIRLS; CHINA; ALLOCATION,"Son preference is widespread in a number of developing countries despite substantial improvements in education levels and economic development. One potential explanation for the persistence of this phenomenon is that individual household members like the mother derive large non-monetary benefits from giving birth to a son and therefore prefer boys to girls. Qualitative evidence suggests that such benefits exist and may depend on the child's age. This paper uses large nationally representative datasets from India and tests whether having a son leads to higher decision-making powers for mothers than having a daughter. Since the number and gender composition of children is likely to be non-random for families that want a son, I focus on first-born children for whom the sex ratio of girls relative to boys is normal. The main analysis also focuses on young children of up to six months, which gives parents little time to adjust desired birth-spacing intervals that could be systematically correlated with decision-making powers and child gender. The results show little evidence of consistently large female benefits shortly after birth, and any positive impacts of having a son disappear after the first six months. There are also no large benefits for adult sons. These empirical patterns do not support qualitative evidence suggesting that women benefit from the birth of a son through larger decision-making powers in the household because of increased respect by other household members. The benefits also do not heavily depend on the child's age, which is not consistent with a channel predicting a better bargaining position for women with adult sons who start taking over the running of the household. Overall, these results extend our understanding of individual-specific incentives for son preference. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

While, a meta-analysis is typically used to drawn inferences regarding the collective insights from an empirical literature, a regression meta-analysis can also be used to predict outcomes as a substitute for the conduct of a new study. Within the nonmarket-valuation literature benefit transfers are a special case of prediction where value estimates collected for one purpose are used as a basis for predicting value for unstudied applications. Balancing against the prediction opportunities provided by a regression meta-analysis is the potential prediction error. This paper considers some of these issues in the estimation of a regression meta-analysis to support prediction of nonmarket values for applications where an original study does not exist. We do not purport to address all elements of the error structure and prediction issues, but to present a more coherent focus to enhance future research on the validity and reliability of benefit-function transfers, and ultimately assist in enhancing the credibility of benefit transfers to support policy analyses.","[Boyle, Kevin J.] Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Wooldridge, Jeffrey M.] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; Michigan State University,"Boyle, KJ (通讯作者)，Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.;Wooldridge, JM (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",kjboyle@vt.edu; wooldri1@msu.edu,"Boyle, Kevin/HTP-1949-2023","Boyle, Kevin/0000-0001-6538-1471",,,,,46,14,19,2,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

One purpose of this paper is to test RD's internal validity across 15 studies. Each of them assesses the correspondence between causal estimates from an RD study and a randomized control trial (RCT) when the estimates are made at the same cutoff point where they should not differ asymptotically. However, statistical error, imperfect design implementation, and a plethora of different possible analysis options, mean that they might nonetheless differ. We test whether they do, assuming that the bias potential is greater with RDs than RCTs. A second purpose of this paper is to investigate the external validity of RD by exploring how the size of the bias estimates varies across the 15 studies, for they differ in their settings, interventions, analyses, and implementation details. Both Bayesian and frequentist meta-analysis methods show that the RD bias is below 0.01 standard deviations on average, indicating RD's high internal validity. When the study-specific estimates are shrunken to capitalize on the information the other studies provide, all the RD causal estimates fall within 0.07 standard deviations of their RCT counterparts, now indicating high external validity. With unshrunken estimates, the mean RD bias is still essentially zero, but the distribution of RD bias estimates is less tight, especially with smaller samples and when parametric RD analyses are used.","[Chaplin, Duncan D.; Zurovac, Jelena; Coopersmith, Jared S.] Math Policy Res, 1100 1st St NE, Washington, DC 20002 USA; [Cook, Thomas D.] George Washington Univ, Trachtenberg Sch Publ Policy, 805 21st St NW, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Finucane, Mariel M.; Vollmer, Lauren N.] Math Policy Res, 955 Massachusetts Ave,Suite 801, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Morris, Rebecca E.] George Washington Univ, Milken Inst Sch Publ Hlth, 950 New Hampshire Ave NW, Washington, DC 20052 USA",Mathematica; George Washington University; Mathematica; George Washington University,"Chaplin, DD (通讯作者)，Math Policy Res, 1100 1st St NE, Washington, DC 20002 USA.",DChaplin@Mathematica-mpr.com; t-cook@northwestern.edu; JZurovac@mathematica.net; JCoopersmith@mathematica-mpr.com; MFinucane@mathematica.net; LVollmer@mathematica-mpr.com; remorris@gwu.edu,"Chaplin, Duncan/ABH-8824-2020","Chaplin, Duncan/0000-0003-0531-348X","National Science Foundation [DRL-1228866, DGE-1544301]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This research was supported by National Science Foundation Grants: DRL-1228866 and DGE-1544301.

We develop a matching model with ethnic externalities in which landlords differ in the number of apartments they own within the same building. Larger landlords are more likely to discriminate only if some tenants are prejudiced against the minority group. Observing that minority tenants are less likely than majority group tenants to live in a building with a single large landlord is thus evidence of neighbor discrimination. We show empirically that African immigrants in France are significantly less likely to live in a building owned by a single landlord. This increases the probability that African immigrants live in public housing in localities with more single-landlord private apartment blocks.","[Combes, Pierre-Philippe] Univ Lyon, GATE Lyon St Etienne UMR 5824, CNRS, 93 Chemin Mouilles, F-69131 Ecully, France; [Combes, Pierre-Philippe] Sci Po, Dept Econ, 28 Rue St Peres, F-75007 Paris, France; [Decreuse, Bruno; Trannoy, Alain] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS EHESS Cent Marseille, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, 5-9 Blvd Bourdet,CS 50498, F-13205 Marseille 1, France; [Schmutz, Benoit] Ecole Polytech, Batiment ENSAE, F-91128 Palaiseau, France; [Schmutz, Benoit] CREST, Batiment ENSAE, F-91128 Palaiseau, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po); Aix-Marseille Universite; Institut Polytechnique de Paris,"Trannoy, A (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS EHESS Cent Marseille, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, 5-9 Blvd Bourdet,CS 50498, F-13205 Marseille 1, France.",decreuse@univ-amu.fr; benoit.schmutz@polytechnique.edu; alain.trannoy@univ-amu.fr,"Combes, Pierre-Philippe/Q-7020-2017",,"Direction de l'Animation de la Recherche, des Etudes et des Statistiques (Dares); French National Research Agency (ANR) as part of the Investissements d'Avenir program [ANR-10-EQPX-17]","Direction de l'Animation de la Recherche, des Etudes et des Statistiques (Dares); French National Research Agency (ANR) as part of the Investissements d'Avenir program(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR))","This paper updates work registered as CEPR working paper 9160.

They play a very important role in household nutrition management and resource management in terms of labor, off-farm products, and small savings. In the absence of help from formal and informal R and D and technology institutions, their knowledge and resources' exchange system has to be very robust to cope with the seasonal shortages arising due to climate fluctuations. The study found that these exchanges, spilling over caste or class boundaries, serve as valuable informal safety nets and contribute to household resilience. Researchers seeking to strengthen community coping strategies should pursue such polices and institutional interventions which strengthen women's resource exchange and exploitation mechanisms. We offer in the end a 4-E model involving exchange, expertise, ethics, and environmental consciousness which describes how these empower women and help in articulation of their unique coping strength at intra- and inert community levels. Lateral learning among community members sustains and enhances over time collective and household coping strategies with climate risks. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Given the persistence of rural poverty in Northeast Brazil and the existence of both land and credit market failures, land reforms remain important policy tools for alleviating poverty and increasing growth. This paper evaluates the impact of the recent National Program of Land Credit, a controversial market-assisted land reform program that provides access to land through private land markets. Household-level panel data covering similar beneficiary and control groups allows for identification using both propensity score weighting and difference-in-difference methodologies. The evidence indicates that the land Credit successfully transitions households into agriculture, with land holdings and investments increasing as a result of the program. As with many earlier land reform programs in Latin America, the new wave of market-assisted land reforms does not increase access to private credit. While land reforms have the potential to drive redistribution, poverty reduction, and growth, these findings suggest that ensuring greater access to credit, irrigation, and higher return economic activities remains important.

It also discusses the opportunities that hotel managers can take to improve the hotel online decision-making strategy to convert more effectively visitors into actual customers. Although social value creation of online platforms has been well researched in the specialized literature, recent research has not examined the ways the online social value can be maximized and put into effective commercial use. The paper reviews the dimensions and characteristics of the hotel online environment by integrating literature analysis and field research practices. It employs the analytic hierarchy process method to analyse key elements of the hotel online environment that can serve as a focal point for value creation. The literature review and field research conducted pinpoint three possibilities of creating online social value: (a) building online trust, (b) ensuring high quality of the online service, and (c) providing effective online communication experience. The paper results have given deeper understanding regarding potential areas of the hotel online environment where social value can be obtained. They prove applicability of the analytic hierarchy process method for evaluation and selection of strategies for online social value creation. At the same time, the paper provides new valuable insights to hoteliers, which might support their decisions to improve the business by proactively incorporating strategies for online social value maximization.","[Paunescu, Carmen] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Business Adm Foreign Languages, UNESCO Dept Business Adm, Calea Griviei 2-2A,Dist 1, Bucharest 010731, Romania; [Moraru, Remus] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Doctoral Sch Business Adm, Calea Griviei 2-2A,Dist 1, Bucharest 010731, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Paunescu, C (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Business Adm Foreign Languages, UNESCO Dept Business Adm, Calea Griviei 2-2A,Dist 1, Bucharest 010731, Romania.",carmen.paunescu@ase.ro; moraru_remus@yahoo.com,"Paunescu, Carmen/ABD-1883-2020; Moraru, Remus Christian/AAC-6951-2021","Moraru, Remus Christian/0000-0001-8734-6335",,,,,48,5,5,1,17,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

Successive governments in Nigeria continue to promote policies and agendas targeted to raise the competitiveness of the sector as part of the diversification of the economy and promote foreign direct investment (FDI). These efforts are yet to manifest in any significant reduction in importation of basic goods as well as double-digit unemployment rate. Several studies have focused on aspects of SME's performance with a sparse attention to the criticality of the impacts of conflict in the performance of the organisations leading to a wide gap in knowledge as to whether a conflict situation actually occurs in the SMEs, and if they do, how do they manifest? What are the impacts on performance and how effective are the administrative tools for managing them? This study attempts to bridge this gap. We adopt a survey method using a sample of 224 employees across a spectrum of industries located in Lagos, Ogun and Kwara States of the Federation of the Republic of Nigeria. While the prevalence of conflict was established in the study amongst the employees, compensation, reward and performance rating issues are most frequent sources of the conflict with behavioural manifestation including productivity scale down, battering the reputation and image of the employers as well as discouraging potential applicants. The study also found that most of the administrative tools to manage conflict are not considered very effective while a variation in the gender awareness to conflict was observed at the level of statistical significance. The study recommends conflict minimization strategies through a proper goal definition, conflict management skill upgrades with training, open communication, fair reward and compensation system. The risk of of the error occurrence is examined from the accountants' perspective. For this purpose, a questionnaire survey was used for data collection focusing on areas that are considered to be the most important by the accountants and the areas which are the most problematic.","[Remi, Samuel] Univ Lagos, Fac Business Adm, Dept Employment Relat & Human Resource Management, Lagos, Nigeria",University of Lagos,"Remi, S (通讯作者)，Univ Lagos, Fac Business Adm, Dept Employment Relat & Human Resource Management, Lagos, Nigeria.",remi.samuel@yahoo.com,,,,,,,37,3,5,1,32,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

The population's fading hopes regarding the outlook on the future seem to confirm this. This paper qualifies this interpretation using survey data collected by the Pew Research Center for the People covering 1999-2014. Over the first decade, the decline in hope cannot be traced back to the rising inequality. However, recent data from 2014 suggest that inequality is now a major driver of a lower than ever level of hope. Hence inequality is a recent factor, not the driver of the long-term decline in hope.","[Ritzen, Jo] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Zimmermann, Klaus F.] Harvard Univ, Ctr European Studies, 27 Kirkland St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Zimmermann, Klaus F.] UNU MERIT, Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University; Harvard University; Maastricht University,"Zimmermann, KF (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Ctr European Studies, 27 Kirkland St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Zimmermann, KF (通讯作者)，UNU MERIT, Maastricht, Netherlands.",klaus.f.zimmermann@gmail.com,,,,,,,24,5,5,1,4,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1309-4297,2147-4281,,EURASIAN BUS REV,Eurasian Bus.

This paper shows that introducing redistribution concerns changes the result. Capital mobility reduces income redistribution by increasing the efficiency costs of capital taxation. If public goods have positive distributional effects, providing more public goods counteracts the negative effects of capital mobility. Moreover, under the condition that labor income and capital income are positively correlated, less income redistribution through capital taxation can be compensated by stronger taxation of labor income. As a result, a higher level of public goods is desirable if capital mobility increases.","[Yang, Hongyan] Helmut Schmidt Univers, Hamburg, Germany",Helmut Schmidt University,"Yang, HY (通讯作者)，Helmut Schmidt Univers, Hamburg, Germany.",h.yang@hsu-hh.de,,,German Research Foundation [SFB 597],German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"Financial support by the German Research Foundation (SFB 597) is gratefully acknowledged.

What is the underlying transmission mechanism between value uncertainty and SEO discounts? Our findings suggest that: (1) the weighted average of investor bid prices is negatively correlated with value uncertainty, indicating an information cost effect; (2) the dispersion of bids (proxied by standard deviation of bid prices) is positively correlated with value uncertainty, indicating the presence of a heterogeneous investor beliefs effect; and (3) SEO discounts are negatively correlated with the weighted average bid price and with the bid price standard deviation. The magnitude of this impact on the SEO discounts, however, is larger for the weighted average bid price than the standard deviation, suggesting that the information cost effect outweighs the heterogeneous investor beliefs effect. Moreover, we find that investor bid prices (weighted average and standard deviation) form part of the transmission mechanism shaping the relationship between value uncertainty and SEO discounts.

The paper makes two important contributions. First, it accounts for the spillover effect of the stock of ideas on learning, which in turn promotes the production of innovative technologies. In doing so, it brings to the fore a two-way interaction between human capital and innovation. The paper then applies various econometric methods which confirm the above theoretical thesis. Second, the solutions of the model emphasize the important role public spending on infrastructure, human capital and R&D can play in promoting economic growth. However, the findings also show that trade-offs in the allocation of public spending may inevitably emerge. In particular, investment in public infrastructure at the expense of spending on R&D is less likely to succeed in promoting economic growth, whereas it may be more effective to foster growth through an offsetting cut in another productive component, namely, education. In light of these potential trade-offs, governments in low-income countries need to use their limited budgets as part of holistic measures in order to achieve efficient outcomes.","[Alpaslan, Baris] Ankara Yildirim Beyazit Univ, Fac Polit Sci, Ankara, Turkey; [Ali, Abdilahi] Aberystwyth Univ, Aberystwyth Business Sch, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales",Ankara Yildirim Beyazit University; Ankara University; Aberystwyth University,"Alpaslan, B (通讯作者)，Ankara Yildirim Beyazit Univ, Fac Polit Sci, Ankara, Turkey.",balpaslan@ybu.edu.tr,"Alpaslan, Baris/A-3541-2017","Alpaslan, Baris/0000-0002-7908-1557; Ali, Abdilahi/0000-0001-5398-0450",,,,,56,10,10,1,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

We develop a novel measure of bank interconnectedness using syndicated corporate loan portfolios, overlap based on industry and region, and different weights such as equal weights, size and relationships. We find that interconnectedness is driven mainly by bank diversification, less by bank size or overall loan market size. Interconnectedness is positively correlated with different bank-level systemic risk measures including SRISK, DIP and CoVaR, and such a positive correlation mainly arises from an elevated effect of interconnectedness on systemic risk during recessions.

Yet, the relationship between electrification and children's nutritional status is rarely explored in the literature. We attempt to fill this lacuna by offering microeconometric evidence from rural Bangladesh, where a rapid expansion of electrification and significant improvement in children's nutritional status were observed in the past two decades. We find that access to electricity has a positive impact on the nutritional status of children under five as measured by height-for-age Z-score (HAZ) by around 0.1-0.2 points using five rounds of Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey from 2000 to 2014. Our results also appear to indicate that the quality of electricity may influence the size of this positive impact. While our analysis of causal pathways is limited by the data availability, it suggests that the positive impact of electrification partially comes from increased wealth. For some years, the positive impact can also be attributed to reduced fertility and information exposure through TV viewing. On the contrary, we find little evidence that the impact is attributable to the improvement of local health facilities. Our findings underscore the importance of evaluating infrastructure programs such as rural electrification from a broad perspective as their impacts may go well beyond the economic benefits considered in a typical cost-benefit analysis. This in turn may encourage governments to invest more in basic infrastructure, which is still severely lacking in Bangladesh and many other countries in the rest of South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

This paper sheds light on the transport-education inequality nexus with reference to school accessibility by public transport in the SPMR. To assess school accessibility, we develop an accessibility index which combines information on the spatial distribution of adolescents, the location of existing schools, and the public transport provision serving the school catchment area into a single measure. The index is used to measure school accessibility locally across 633 areas within the SPMR. We use the index to simulate the impact of a policy aiming at increasing the centralisation of public secondary education provision, and find that it negatively affects public transport accessibility for students with the lowest levels of accessibility. These results illustrate how existing inequalities can be amplified by variable accessibility to schools across income groups and geographical space. The research suggests that educational inequality impacts of school agglomeration policies should be considered before centralisation takes place.","[Moreno-Monroy, Ana I.] OECD, Reg Dev Policy Div, Paris, France; [Lovelace, Robin] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Ramos, Frederico R.] Fundacao Getulio Vargas, CEPESP, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); University of Leeds; Getulio Vargas Foundation; Escola de Pos-Graduacao em Economia (EPGE),"Moreno-Monroy, AI (通讯作者)，OECD, Reg Dev Policy Div, Paris, France.",ana.morenomonroy@oecd.org,"Roman Ramos, Frederico/AAZ-1243-2020","Roman Ramos, Frederico/0000-0002-6314-6563; Moreno Monroy, Ana Isabel/0000-0002-8282-4067; Lovelace, Robin/0000-0001-5679-6536",ESRC [ES/L011891/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,23,62,67,9,58,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

I use the route network expansion of low-cost airlines to identify routes where the probability of future entry increases dramatically. I find that when a large portion of their market is threatened, incumbents significantly increase debt maturity before entry occurs. Overall, the main findings suggest that airlines respond to entry threats trading off the benefits of short-term financing for lower rollover risk. The results are consistent with models in which firms set their optimal debt structure in the presence of costly rollover failure. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We highlight various fundamental choices in policy design including (1) the level of the initial carbon tax, (2) the growth rate of the carbon tax trajectory of over time, and (3) alternative ways for revenue recycling. Without revenue recycling, we find that generations born before the tax is introduced experience smaller welfare losses, or even gain, relative to future generations. For sufficiently low growth rates of the tax trajectory, the impacts for distant future generations decrease over time. For future generations born after the introduction of the tax, the negative welfare impacts are the smallest (largest) when revenues are recycled through lowering pre-existing capital income taxes (through per-capita lump-sum rebates). For generations born before the tax is introduced, we find that lump-sum rebates favor very old generations and labor (capital) income tax recycling favors very young generations (generations of intermediate age).","[Rausch, Sebastian; Yonezawa, Hidemichi] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Management Technol & Econ, ETH CER ETH, Ctr Econ Res, Zurich, Switzerland; [Rausch, Sebastian] MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Rausch, Sebastian] ETH Zurich Swiss Fed Inst Technol Zurich, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Zurichbergstr 18, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Rausch, S (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Management Technol & Econ, ETH CER ETH, Ctr Econ Res, Zurich, Switzerland.;Rausch, S (通讯作者)，MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;Rausch, S (通讯作者)，ETH Zurich Swiss Fed Inst Technol Zurich, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Zurichbergstr 18, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.",srausch@ethz.ch,"Yonezawa, Hidemichi/ADE-5543-2022","Yonezawa, Hidemichi/0000-0002-9658-7226; Rausch, Sebastian/0000-0002-6379-8406",,,,,36,9,9,1,17,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2010-0078,2010-0086,,CLIM CHANG ECON,Clim.

We investigate whether these training sessions are effective and find that they are effective only for the diffusion of organic fertilizers but not for mulching. We suggest that this comes from the complexity of the innovations. Mulching is one of the simplest sustainable intensification technologies. It diffuses easily through peer learning and, after an initial training delivered to a critical mass of farmers, does not require training anymore. The use of organic fertilizers, in contrast, requires more specific knowledge and adaptation, which limits the effectiveness of peer learning and increases the effectiveness of training. This suggests that to achieve a widespread diffusion of sustainable intensification amongst Ghana's farmers, training sessions should focus on those practices that are complex and thus difficult to learn from peers.","[Wuepper, David; Sauer, Johannes] Tech Univ Munich, Agr Prod & Resource Econ, Munich, Germany; [Kleemann, Linda] Kiel Inst World Econ, Grp Poverty Reduct Equ & Dev, Kiel, Germany",Technical University of Munich; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Wuepper, D (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, Agr Prod & Resource Econ, Munich, Germany.",david.wuepper@tum.de,,"Sauer, Johannes (Jo)/0000-0003-2674-0229; Wuepper, David/0000-0002-1344-6023",,,,,70,8,8,1,25,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Mongolia can take an active part in this process, as the country is rich in energy resources and interested in their development to meet their domestic needs and exchange with neighboring countries. The establishment of interstate power interconnections in the Northeast Asia countries represents a topical task whose solution will make it possible to meet the demand of this region for electricity on mutually beneficial terms.

This research tests the law of 1/n in the Portuguese local context and finds that the law fails to apply. We suggest an alternative measure-the density of representation-to assess the impact of the rules of city council representation on local public expenditures. Density of representation is defined as the number of elected officials in the city council divided by city population. We find an S-shaped relationship between the density of representation and the level of local government expenditures. The level of municipal spending initially declines with increases in the density of representation, reflecting an increase in the ability of constituents to monitor their elected representatives. At higher levels of representation density, the relationship becomes positive, suggesting that the dynamics of the budgetary commons become salient. The relationship becomes negative again for extremely high density of representation owing to increases in the transaction costs of legislative decision-making. This paper discusses the implications of our findings for the reform of local government institutions and the rules of political representation.","[Bel, Germa] Univ Barcelona, Dept Polit Econ, Barcelona, Spain; [Raudla, Ringa] Tallinn Univ Technol, Ragnar Nurkse Sch Innovat & Governance, Tallinn, Estonia; [Rodrigues, Miguel; Tavares, Antonio F.] Univ Minho, Sch Econ & Management, Res Ctr Polit Sci, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal",University of Barcelona; Tallinn University of Technology; Universidade do Minho,"Tavares, AF (通讯作者)，Univ Minho, Sch Econ & Management, Res Ctr Polit Sci, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal.",gbel@ub.edu; ringa.raudla@ttu.ee; miguelangelo@eeg.uminho.pt; atavares@eeg.uminho.pt,"Tavares, Antonio F./E-5297-2010; Raudla, Ringa/AAJ-5845-2020; Bel, Germà/A-1388-2008; Rodrigues, Miguel A/F-2950-2018","Tavares, Antonio F./0000-0003-4888-5285; Bel, Germà/0000-0002-1330-8085; Rodrigues, Miguel A/0000-0002-2254-2607; Raudla, Ringa/0000-0003-4905-0685","project SmartEGOV: Harnessing EGOV for Smart Governance (Foundations, methods, Tools) [NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000037]; Norte Portugal Regional Operational Programme (NORTE), under the PORTUGAL 2020 Partnership Agreement, through the European Regional Development Fund (EFDR), from the Portuguese Science and Technology Foundation (Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia) [PEst-OE/CJP/UI0758/2014]; Estonian Research Council [PUT-1142]; Spanish Government [ECO2016-76866-R]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [Incentivo/CJP/UI0758/2014] Funding Source: FCT","project SmartEGOV: Harnessing EGOV for Smart Governance (Foundations, methods, Tools); Norte Portugal Regional Operational Programme (NORTE), under the PORTUGAL 2020 Partnership Agreement, through the European Regional Development Fund (EFDR), from the Portuguese Science and Technology Foundation (Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia); Estonian Research Council(Estonian Research Council); Spanish Government(Spanish Government); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))","The authors would like to thank Richard Feiock and Tjerk Budding for the comments and suggestions.

This valuation may originate from irrational behavior of optimistic investors who prefer lottery-like stocks, or from rational expectations of firms' profitability. Using a sample of small Canadian firms going public, the authors show that both individual investors and underwriters price loss firms higher than profit firms, everything being equal. Post-IPO 3-year underperformance does not differ statistically between loss and profit firms. Investors thus apparently behave irrationally for all firms, but their irrationality does not seem greater for loss firms.","[Carpentier, Cecile; Suret, Jean-Marc] Laval Univ, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Romon, Frederic] Skema Business Sch ECGC, Quebec City, PQ, Canada",Laval University,"Carpentier, C (通讯作者)，Laval Univ, Sch Accountancy, Fac Adm Sci, 2539 Pavil Palasis Prince, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",cecile.carpentier@fsa.ulaval.ca,,"Carpentier, Cecile/0000-0001-6080-9678; Suret, Jean-Marc/0000-0002-8249-9081; ROMON, Frederic/0000-0003-0989-2706",,,,,56,3,3,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

A reader who only quickly skims such a paper can easily categorize it as useless philosophy. My paper On abductive reasoning for strategic cases solution, published last year, attracted the attention of readers who were open to new approaches and did not shrink from contemplating the procedures outlined in it. Encouraged by the praise of my colleagues and participants at the ISCOBEMM conference, I decided to show how deep the rabbit hole goes and developed the strictly methodological approach into a practical application in the form of a case study. However, the lack of research into the topic and its significant complexity requires the proposed application of abductive reasoning to strategic cases solution to be put into a certain context. From the beginning, the three methods were meant to be used in the framework of the stakeholder approach, which served as the core for a new methodology of strategic management, enriched by game theory. The aim of this paper, therefore, is to introduce the new methodology of strategic management based on the stakeholder approach with a new structuring of the entrepreneurial environment in accordance with game theory. It also introduces schemes of handling decision-making situations with the solver having access to information typical for corporate practice, in which the proposed abductive reasoning application is ideal to differentiate the cooperative and competitive aspect of the relationship.","[Cenek, Martin; Mikus, Petr] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Corp Econ, Lipova 507-41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic; [Holik, Roman] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Lipova 507-41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno; Masaryk University Brno,"Cenek, M (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Corp Econ, Lipova 507-41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",martin.cenek@mail.muni.cz; 347732@mail.muni.cz; pierre@seznam.cz,"Mikus, Petr/AAE-1129-2020",,,,,,14,0,0,1,1,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-9164-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,18,25,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO1EW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000495441500003,0

Algeria has gone through several policies on the subject and has historically faced several difficulties in its economic policy. Based on a rentier economy, it attempted to diversify its revenues by investing in various sectors and using FDI. However, the attractiveness of FDI does not seem to match the country's ambitions. Algeria has interesting economic potential, particularly in the hydrocarbon sector, but does not yet have the technologies necessary for its development. The use of external technologies and their financing through FDI is part of the country's strategic thinking. Moreover, the country advocates, in an unfavorable institutional framework, a certain form of protectionism in view of the large profits generated by foreign firms that often escape the direct control of the State. It appears from this analysis that the country needs to carry out several reforms, mainly in the land sector and in the management of financial institutions, unsuited to the requirements of foreign partners.","[Chebira, Bonalem-Ammar] Univ Badji Molditar Annaba, Annaba, Algeria",,"Chebira, BA (通讯作者)，Univ Badji Molditar Annaba, Annaba, Algeria.",cheb.bou@gmail.com,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,0,WYDAWNICTWO UNIWERSYTETU EKONOMICZNEGO W POZNANIU,Poznan,"ul.

The common finding is that analysts' forecasts are not very accurate. Prior studies have tended to focus on the mean of forecasts and measure accuracy using various summaries of forecast errors. The present study sheds new light on the accuracy of analysts' forecasts, by measuring how well calibrated these forecasts are. The authors follow the tradition of calibration studies in psychological literature and measure the degree of calibration by the hit rate. They analyze a year's worth of data from the Institutional Brokers Estimate System database, which includes over 200,000 annual earnings forecasts made by over 6,000 analysts for over 5,000 companies. By using different ways to convert analysts' point estimates of earnings into a range of values, the authors establish the bounds that are necessary to determine the hit rates, and examine to what extent the actual earnings announced by the companies are bracketed by these intervals. These hit rates provide a more complete picture of the accuracy of the forecasts.","[Du, Ning] Depaul Univ, Chicago, IL 60604 USA; [Budescu, David V.] Fordham Univ, Bronx, NY 10458 USA",DePaul University; Fordham University,"Du, N (通讯作者)，Depaul Univ, Sch Accountancy & Management Informat Syst, One East Jackson Blvd, Chicago, IL 60604 USA.",ndu1@depaul.edu,,,,,,,43,12,13,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

This effect weakens over successive immigrant generations and cannot be detected for top executives apart from the CEO.

Using a spatial error regression model, the results show that sinkhole proximity and sinkhole exposure (density) create a negative externality and both have a significant negative effect on house prices. While the results show a negative effect of having a sinkhole on the property, those results are not statistically significant.","[Dumm, Randy E.] Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Sirmans, Stacy] Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Smersh, Greg T.] Univ S Florida, Tampa, FL 33620 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; State University System of Florida; Florida State University; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida,"Dumm, RE (通讯作者)，Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",randy.dumm@temple.edu; gsirmans@business.fsu.edu; gsmersh@usf.edu,,,,,,,26,7,8,1,4,AMER REAL ESTATE SOC,CLEMSON,"CLEMSON UNIV, SCH BUSINESS & BEHAVIORAL SCI, DEPT FINANCE, 314 SIRRINE HALL, CLEMSON, SC 29634 USA",0896-5803,,,J REAL ESTATE RES,J.

The paper reviews and makes a comparative analysis of the maize (corn) seed sector and its evolution in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Ethiopia drawing from seed sector surveys and secondary data. Enhancing farmers' access to and use of new maize varieties still presents a number of challenges in eastern Africa - not least due to a number of policy and institutional impediments to the development of the seed sector. The regional seed sectors also show some remarkable contrasts: they have evolved at different speeds and in different directions, driven by diverging agricultural growth opportunities and varying degrees of regulation, liberalization and restructuring.

Using multiple density forecast evaluation tools the proposed approach have been examined in one month ahead forecasting exercise for 22 emerging markets currencies rates vs. dollar. According to the log predictive density score criterion, in case of the majority of emerging markets' foreign exchange rates, the forecasting performance of the proposed approach is superior to the random walk forecast and AR-GARCH benchmarks. Further analysis of the proposed approach using coverage rates and Knuppel test indicate correct calibration of the density model. The conducted evaluation of the proposed approach suggests that such tool can be suitable for economists, risk managers, econometricians, or policy makers focused on producing accurate density forecasts of foreign exchange rates. The proposed approach is a valuable contribution to the existing literature on foreign exchange density forecasting.","[Jaworski, Krystian] Warsaw Sch Econ, Dept Econ 2, Coll World Econ, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics,"Jaworski, K (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Dept Econ 2, Coll World Econ, Warsaw, Poland.",kjawor@sgh.waw.pl,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,2,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-76228-9; 978-3-319-76227-2,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,13,21,,10.1007/978-3-319-76228-9_2,0.0,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1UI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448435600002,0

Hence, there should be a strong link between monetary policy rate uncertainty and equity return volatility, both in theory and data. This paper uses regression-based projections for realized variance to examine the relationship between short horizon forecasts of equity variance and proxies for monetary policy rate uncertainty. By assessing various projection models for UK, US and euro area equity indices, we show that the proxies for monetary policy rate uncertainty have a significant and positive predictive power for the equity return variance. Adding monetary policy rate uncertainty variables can significantly improve forecasting models for equity variance and volatility at weekly, monthly and even quarterly horizons. The findings imply that market views of short-term interest rate developments may indeed be embedded in equity prices and their variations. (C) 2017 The Bank of England. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Both Canada and Germany rely on immigrants to remain competitive in the economy due to low birth rates and an aging population in both countries. Canada and Germany are based on two contradictory discourses in their consideration of immigration. While Canada has relied since its colonization by the British and French on immigrants for economic expansion and nation building, Germany never considered itself to be an immigrant country, but rather as a host of guest workers who would leave 1 day when their labor power was not needed any longer. Thus, a cross-national comparison between two opposing immigration discourses is a valuable contribution to the global research on immigration as it can highlight similarities and differences in the successful economic integration of immigrants. Further, it can point to determining factors that contribute to the economic integration of immigrants. In order to measure if the two countries have differences in the success of economic integration of immigrants, the measures of unemployment rates, field of work, and income of immigrants are compared and contrasted.","[Krysa, Isabella] Fairleigh Dickinson Univ, Management Dept, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Nag, Sharmistha] Fairleigh Dickinson Univ, Dept Econ, Vancouver, BC, Canada",Fairleigh Dickinson University; Fairleigh Dickinson University,"Krysa, I (通讯作者)，Fairleigh Dickinson Univ, Management Dept, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",i.krysa@fdu.edu,,,,,,,0,0,0,1,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-58589-5; 978-3-319-58588-8,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,153,153,,10.1007/978-3-319-58589-5_11,0.0,,,1,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL0QR,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000446372200011,0

The daily ridership data utilized in the study is obtained from Nanjing Metro Agency, while meteorological data is from the Nanjing Meteorology Bureau. To address the main research questions of this paper, time-serials moving average method is extended and refined to define benchmark and to model ridership fluctuation (expressed as ridership residual). On the other hand, analyses of variance (ANOVAs) are introduced to examine meteorological events and temporal effects on ridership residuals. The data and result demonstrates that the impact of meteorological variables on daily ridership fluctuations generally results in a decrease in passengers on single lines and the travel network, especially on weekends. Precipitation related events produce more significant ridership fluctuations than temperature related events. Snowfall related events and large temperature deviations in winter account for the most dramatic changes in ridership. However, seasonality is not a significant factor in meteorological events-ridership residual relationship. This paper contributes to extending research on the weather-ridership relationship around the world especially to refining and extending the nine-term moving average method in this field. This could benefit metro operators by enabling them to add meteorological effects into their ridership prediction and budgeting work.","[Li, Junlong; Li, Xuhong; Chen, Dawei] Southeast Univ, Sch Transportat, Room 612,35 Jinxianghe Rd, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Godding, Lucy] Univ St Andrews, Dept Modern Languages, Coll Gate, St Andrews KY16 9AJ, Fife, Scotland; [Godding, Lucy] Zurcherstr 42, CH-8620 Wetzikon, Switzerland",Southeast University - China; University of St Andrews,"Li, JL (通讯作者)，Southeast Univ, Sch Transportat, Room 612,35 Jinxianghe Rd, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",junlong.li@seu.edu.cn,,,Innovation Programs for Graduates in Jiangsu Province [CXLX12_0112],Innovation Programs for Graduates in Jiangsu Province,"The authors would like to thank the supports from the Innovation Programs for Graduates in Jiangsu Province (CXLX12_0112).

The use of SURE permits us to account for cross-equation contemporaneous correlation which may arise due to correlated shocks to technological changes in the industry or from spillovers from industry wide or economy wide shocks. The results establish that simultaneous provision of domestic and international calls, and of telephone and internet lines are all cost increasing, while enhancing the use of existing network capacity is cost reducing.

The study was conducted in Lesotho with a sample size of 100 farmers. The empirical results reveal that access to credit increases net farm revenues by US$116.608 to US$136.894. Furthermore, savings, scale of production, membership of farmer associations and financial record keeping exert significant positive effects on access to credit, while higher interest rates reduce farmers' likelihood of securing credit from a financial institution.

The features of the set of institutions to have in place and the interactions among them, as well as the network cost allocation arrangements implemented, are critical issues to ensure an efficient and sufficient development of the grid. This paper addresses those issues and argues that they should be defined with the aim to properly take into account the benefits to be produced by network reinforcements, since these are driven by the benefits they produce. This article discusses how the expected benefits of transmission network expansion projects should affect the organization of the expansion of the grid, the expansion planning algorithms applied and the allocation of the cost of network reinforcements.

Indonesia as a country that has the largest Muslim population in the world, but in practice the realization of the optimization of the potential and utilization of waqf funds in Indonesia is still low, while Singapore which is a minority Muslim is able to utilize waqf funds optimally and productively. The priority of regulatory issues is less supportive, because regulation is the basis or legal basis for the management of waqf. The purpose of this research is to compare the regulation and management of waqf management in Indonesia and Singapore, so that the implications of this research result can be used as input for the development of waqf management in Indonesia. The research method used is descriptive qualitative approach and a statute approach. The results of this research is waqf regulation in Indonesia contained in Law No. 41 of 2004 and Government Regulation Number 42 of 2006 as implementing regulations. Waqf regulations in Singapore are found in the Administration of Muslim Law Act (AMLA) in the Act. No. 27 of 1966. Most of the management of waqf in Indonesia is still on the property of waqf not moving like land, but in its development Indonesia is developing waqf of movable property (cash waqf).

The authors argue that the repurchase announcements made by optimistic CEOs should be more credible than those made by nonoptimistic CEOs. Our results show that optimistic CEOs are more likely to actually buy back their shares after the announcements and the abnormal returns following repurchase announcements are larger for optimistic CEOs. This evidence suggests that CEO optimism is an important factor that the market seems to overlook while evaluating the credibility of open-market repurchase announcements.

Negative influence is played by trade barriers and positive by common traditions and common political background. Big countries trade a lot between each other, e.g. the USA and Canada on the same continent or the USA and Germany in different continents. Smaller countries, like the Czech Republic, do not have such an impact on the scale of world trade. The size of exports/imports is influenced by the fact whether or not they are part of some trading bloc, e.g., the EU in Europe or NAFTA in America. Accounting rules, namely IFRS, are expected to be perceived as a positive influence on the world trade of a particular country and on a country's FDI (Foreign Direct Investment). In this paper, we test the influence on foreign trade and FDI of using the gravity model within the EU. The influence of IFRS is also tested, although we might expect that its influence will be smaller than that of other factors. Contrary to our expectations, we have found that the influence of IFRS is not insignificant and is more pronounced after the year 2010 which coincides with the change of local regulations. This finding establishes an interesting signal relating to perceiving the increasing quality of the Czech economic environment including accounting regulations.","[Ugurlu, Erginbay] Istanbul Aydin Univ, Istanbul, Turkey; [Jindrichovska, Irena] Angloamer Univ, Prague, Czech Republic",Istanbul Aydin University; Anglo-American University,"Ugurlu, E (通讯作者)，Istanbul Aydin Univ, Istanbul, Turkey.",erginbay@gmail.com; irena.jindrichovska@aauni.edu,"Ugurlu, Erginbay/H-8209-2018; Ugurlu, Erginbay/AAH-1227-2019","Ugurlu, Erginbay/0000-0002-1297-1993;",Anglo-American University,Anglo-American University,"This paper was prepared with the support of the Anglo-American University, z.u.

Achieving a performance advanatge while not causing destructive effects is the new challange. Consequently, considering the UN's sustainable development goals (SDGs), this study investigated how environmental, social and governance factors (ESG) could contribute to a better financial performance for multinational companies. Due to the ecological, economic, and social consequences of business (Mebratu, 1998) it has never been more important for society to lean towards sustainable practices (Brune, 2016). As new challenges emerge, new concepts of how to deal with them evolve, including the concept of 'sustainable development' as a foundation to management thinking and descision making. Private businesses are a key component in acheiveing the UN's desired sustainable view, as they can help to fill the $3tn annual investment gap expected to be needed across the next 15 years (Earley, 2016). As a generation, millennials have a critical role to play in achieving a sustainable furture. Millennials are the next group of business thinkers and descisons makers. Based on research conducted by this study, eight out of ten London based millennials acknowledged the private sector has a critical role in helping to achieve a sustainable future for all. However, fewer than three in ten millennials actually believe that private businesses will take action, instead continuing to place their short-term profitability mindset ahead of sustainability (Tuffrey, 2016). With a world population of 50% under the age of 30 (WEF, 2017), and with millennials continuing to become more conscious of trends which affect the planet and their future, the expectation of businesses to act sustainably seems to be rising. This study confirmed a multitude of ways to increase business performance sustainably, such as driving sales by targeting consumers' increasing willingness to pay a premium for sustainable goods. A questionnaire supported this approach by confirming that 9 out of 10 millennial Londoners acknowledged that action on climate-change should be the responsibility of both individuals and private businesses. However, a smaller amount, only 4 out of 10 millennials surveyed, were willing to contribute by shifting their purchasing-behaviour, to more sustainable products, if prices were higher. Further to this, if a product was found to be unethical, the data collected showed 75% of millennials would take action by looking for a competitor or leaning towards an alternative (30% of those surveyed).

The preparation of the implementation project was an important part of the process which proved to be considerably time consuming and financially demanding. The case study includes a typical area of the given industry - discounts on goods (hardware) and services. The assessment of the impacts is based on the comparison of the previous situation - earlier revenue recognition -presented in the financial statements and a simulated influence of a new standard on these financial statements. The results showed the change in the revenues structure, and while adhering to ceteris paribus principle, an increase of revenues by 2% and increase of the net comprehensive income by 11% in the first year of applying IFRS 15. At the same time, a new item contract assets was introduced in the balancesheet as a part of non-current assets.

The FTE approach takes account of individuals' multiple jobs throughout the year and is therefore likely to give more accurate estimates of the pace of structural transformation. Since 2000, Africa has experienced a sharp decline in the share of its labour force in farming. Because of the seasonal nature of farming, the share of the labour force remaining in farming is substantially lower using the FTE approach than when examined in terms of individuals' primary sources of employment or total numbers of jobs. Using the FTE approach, the share of the labour force in farming ranges across the nine countries from 35 per cent in Ghana to 54 per cent in Rwanda. Employment in off-farm segments of agri-food systems is expanding rapidly in percentage terms, but in terms of absolute numbers, non-farm activities are by far the major source of employment outside of farming. Contrary to widespread perceptions, the mean age of adults engaged primarily in farming is not rising - in fact it is falling slightly in some countries and remains stable in most others. The pace at which the labour force is shifting out of agriculture is strongly and positively tied to the rate of lagged farm productivity growth. Given the unprecedented growth in the number of young Africans entering the labour market, an effective youth employment strategy in most African countries will rely on massive job expansion, which in turn will rely on the multiplier effects of agricultural productivity growth. Strategies that raise the returns to labour in farming therefore remain crucial for achieving rapid economic transformation and may constitute the core of effective youth employment strategies.","[Yeboah, Felix Kwame; Jayne, Thomas S.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, 446 W Circle Dr Room 211A, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Yeboah, FK (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, 446 W Circle Dr Room 211A, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",yeboahfe@msu.edu,,,MasterCard Foundation through the Agrifood Youth Employment and Engagement Study (AgYees); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation through the Guiding Investments in Sustainable Agricultural Intensification in Africa (GISAIA) grant; Food Security Policy Innovation Lab to Michigan State University; USAID's Bureau for Food Security,MasterCard Foundation through the Agrifood Youth Employment and Engagement Study (AgYees); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation through the Guiding Investments in Sustainable Agricultural Intensification in Africa (GISAIA) grant; Food Security Policy Innovation Lab to Michigan State University; USAID's Bureau for Food Security(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"We gratefully acknowledge funding for this study from The MasterCard Foundation through the Agrifood Youth Employment and Engagement Study (AgYees), the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation through the Guiding Investments in Sustainable Agricultural Intensification in Africa (GISAIA) grant, and the Food Security Policy Innovation Lab to Michigan State University, funded by USAID's Bureau for Food Security.",,67,60,63,16,241,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Incentivizing developing countries to participate in climate change mitigation often requires a mechanism for developed countries to finance projects in poorer countries. While several funding institutions have been established, African country participation has been low. In this analysis, we conduct interviews with climate change policy stakeholders from across the continent and find a general consensus that a lack of institutional capacity has limited the participation of African countries in existing climate change mitigation programs. To confirm this qualitative observation, we use data from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the World Bank to examine the correlation between country-year measures of institutional capacity and the number of projects implemented by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and find that better institutional quality is associated with more GEF projects implemented in a country-year. We propose to address the lack of institutional capacity with the creation of regional institution, or Climate Change Mitigation Institution (CCMI), that specializes in building local capacity by leveraging external capacity as well as facilitates the integration of African countries into global climate change mitigation efforts by improving capacity, strengthening research and development, forming partnerships, and coordinating the disbursement of financing.

We quantify the size of capital buffers required to reduce system-wide losses using confidential regulatory data for Australian banks from 2002 to 2014 and annual public accounts from 1978 to 2014. We find that a moderate increase in bank capital buffers is sufficient to maintain financial system resilience, even after taking economic downturns into consideration. Furthermore, while banks benefit from paying a lower cost of debt when they have a higher capital buffer, lending volumes are lower indicating that credit supply may be hampered if bank capital levels are too high within a financial system.

The dynamic Nelson Siegel factor model is extended to allow the model dimension and the parameters to change over time, in order to account for both model uncertainty and sudden structural changes in one setting. The proposed specification performs better than several alternatives, since it incorporates additional macro-finance information during hard times, while it allows for more parsimonious models to be relevant during normal periods. A dynamic variance decomposition measure constructed from our model shows that parameter uncertainty and model uncertainty regarding different choices of predictors explain a large proportion of the predictive variance of bond yields.

However, the residential self-selection hypothesis is challenged for a number of reasons including the arguments that that at least in some societies a large percentage of people do not have the privilege to self-select their residence and the built environment may have a significant influence on a person's travel attitude. To shed some light on this debate, this paper makes use of data from a household activity-diary survey conducted in Beijing, China, in 2011-2012 to examine both the hypothesis of residential self-selection and that of residential environment determination. We adopt the natural experimental approach and divide the sample into two groups based on whether or not the respondents had much freedom in regard to choosing where to live: one with the possibility of self-selection and the other one without this possibility. We found reciprocal influences between residential built environment and travel attitude/preference for the first group and influence of residential built environment on travel preferences for the second group. We argue that the complex relationships between the built environment, travel attitude, and travel behavior are featured by both residential self-selection and residential determination. Failing to acknowledge the effects of the built environment on travel attitude may lead to the overestimation of the influence of residential self-selection on the link between the built environment and travel behavior and underestimation of the influence of the built environment on travel behavior.","[Lin, Tao; Wang, Donggen; Guan, Xiaodong] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Geog, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lin, Tao] China Acad Urban Planning & Design Western Branch, Chongqing, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Baptist University,"Wang, DG (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Geog, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",dgwang@hkbu.edu.hk,,,"GRF from the Hong Kong Research Grant Council [HKBU244610, HKBU247813]; NSFC from the National Natural Science Foundation of China [41371181]",GRF from the Hong Kong Research Grant Council; NSFC from the National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),We appreciate Patricia L.

We investigate the roots of this pattern and study whether the relative age position of children at school plays a role in shaping their preference for competition. We run a controlled experiment in high schools across two states in Australia. Our participants are students who are the very oldest or very youngest in their classroom. We elicit their preference for competition using the Niederle and Vesterlund (2007) task and find evidence of an effect of relative age. This effect is concentrated on male students. We find no differences in self-confidence, and risk attitudes between relatively old and young students. These results suggest that the observed pattern may come from pure preference for competition.

This paper shows that such a policy can be optimal for a host country. The government has an incentive to tax inframarginal firms because they are relatively immobile and an incentive to subsidize marginal firms because the economic activity generated by such a subsidy can increase domestic wages in excess of the fiscal cost. These policies improve domestic welfare at the expense of foreigners. Hence, this analysis can explain why tax coordination efforts can simultaneously entail reduced taxes and subsidies.","[Sharma, Rishi R.] Colgate Univ, 13 Oak Dr, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA",Colgate University,"Sharma, RR (通讯作者)，Colgate Univ, 13 Oak Dr, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA.",rsharma1@colgate.edu,,,Rackham One-Term Dissertation Fellowship; William Haber Graduate Fellowship,Rackham One-Term Dissertation Fellowship; William Haber Graduate Fellowship,"Colgate University, 13 Oak Dr., Hamilton NY 13346, USA (rsharma1@colgate.edu).

The price of risk for fluctuations with persistence outside of this range and for the raw series of aggregate uncertainty is insignificant. Also, equity exposures are negative and hence the corresponding risk premia are positive. I quantify macroeconomic uncertainty using the model-free index of Jurado et al.

Using these advances, researchers find not only more evidence of the J-curve effect, but also new evidence of asymmetric effects of exchange rate changes on the trade balance. We contribute to this line of research by using monthly trade flow data from 61 two-digit industries that trade between Malaysia and Thailand, and show that not only does currency depreciation have favorable effects on the trade balance of more industries, but the long-run effects are asymmetric in 26 out of 61 cases.

Extending the CDM recursive system, we include an equation for the allocation of direct support and use quantile regression methods to estimate the productivity equation. We find some differences across manufacturing and service industries. Financing constraints are correlated with obtaining public support in manufacturing and in some services, but in knowledge-intensive services (KIS) barriers associated with regulations are more significant. The introduction of innovations increases mostly the productivity of firms below the median of the productivity distribution, especially in services. Increasing human capital would boost productivity of firms in all industries, providing support to the hypothesis that human capital is indeed a bottleneck for productivity growth across the board in Colombia. We conclude that addressing factors that hinder innovation by low-productivity firms in all service industries could significantly contribute to increasing productivity and reduce its dispersion.

This paper combines a randomized control trial of a citizenship training and facilitation program in rural India, with an in-depth, four-year, ethnography of the intervention to understand the underlying mechanisms of change. The quantitative data show no impact from the intervention. Household and village survey data from 100 treatment and 100 control villages show considerable improvement across a wide variety of governance and participation indicators over time, but the differences in the changes between treatment and control villages are not statistically significant. The detailed qualitative data from a 10% subsample allow us to unpack the reasons why the intervention failed highlighting the role of variations in the quality of facilitation, lack of top-down support, and difficulties with confronting the stubborn challenge of persistent inequality. However, the qualitative investigation also uncovered subtle treatment effects that are difficult to observe in structured surveys. The paper thus demonstrates that a concerted effort to use thick description to uncover process of change using careful and detailed qualitative work can add value to standard impact evaluations.

Specifically, an increase from the 25th to the 75th percentile of the aggregate liquidity risk factor increases the cost of equity by 109 basis points.

We use a quasi-experimental approach combining covariate matching with difference-in-difference estimation as a procedure to assess program effectiveness on reducing deforestation. We find that the PES program contributed additionally saving on average about 0.17 percentage point of the enrolled PES area per year during 2005-12. We also highlight that characteristics such as slope, proximity to roads, and number of households are associated with heterogeneous PES impact.

In particular, the papers highlight the direct participation of elites in violent conflict; the varieties and nuances of wartime primitive accumulation; the complexities of the state's role in wartime agrarian political economy; the gender dimensions of agrarian conflict; the interaction of war and law; and the significance for service provision of farm size.

This paper discusses five programs that can be seen as partial foundations of a possible social security system for India: school meals, child care services, employment guarantee, food subsidies, and social security pensions. The record of these programs varies a great deal between Indian states, but there is growing evidence that they make an important contribution to human well-being, and also that the achievements of the leading states are gradually spreading to other states as well. Much scope remains for extending these efforts: despite the recent expansion, India's social security system is still very limited in international perspective. The paper also discusses some general issues of social policy in India, such as the arguments for universalization versus targeting and the value of a rights approach to social security.

In the policy debate, a potential downside of the arrangement has featured less prominently: the economic environment is unlikely to be stable while the cap is in place. If regulators take this into account, they have to decide under uncertainty and also anticipate how regulated firms will react. In a lab experiment, we manipulate the degree of regulatory uncertainty. We compare a baseline when regulators have the same information as firms about demand with treatments wherein they receive only a noisy signal and another when they know only the distribution from which demand realizations are taken. In the face of uncertainty, regulators impose overly generous price caps, which firms exploit. In the experiment, the social damage is severe, and does not disappear with experience.","[Engel, Christoph] Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, Bonn, Germany; [Heine, Klaus] Erasmus Univ, Sch Law, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Max Planck Society; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Engel, C (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, Bonn, Germany.",engel@coll.mpg.de,,"Engel, Christoph/0000-0001-8513-8532",Max Planck Society; Max Planck Society through regular budget of the Bonn Max Planck Institute,Max Planck Society(Max Planck Society); Max Planck Society through regular budget of the Bonn Max Planck Institute,"Open access funding provided by Max Planck Society.

The 2014 Ebola crisis in Liberia is claimed to have caused major disruptions to a health system not fully recovered after the country's civil war, and is an important and relevant case for studying the resilience of health systems during crises. We use data on the utilization of maternal health care services from two representative surveys, one conducted before the outbreak of Ebola, the 2013 Liberian DHS, and another, smaller survey conducted in Monrovia in December 2014, during the height of the epidemic. We focus exclusively on data for women aged 18-49 residing in urban Monrovia, restricting our samples to 1,073 and 763 respondents from the two surveys respectively. We employ a mixed methods approach, combining a multinomial logit model with in-depth semi-structured interviews. Our regression analyses indicate that deliveries in public facilities declined whereas they increased for private facilities. Furthermore, overall facility delivery rates remained stable through the Ebola epidemic: the proportion of home births did not increase. Drawing on insights from extensive qualitative interviews with medical personnel and focus groups with community members conducted in Monrovia in August September 2015 we attribute these survey findings to a supply side substitution effect whereby private clinics provided an important cushion to the shock leading to lower supply of government services. Furthermore, our interviews suggest that government health care workers continued to work in private facilities in their local communities when public facilities were closed. Our findings indicate that resources to shore up healthcare institutions should be directed toward interventions that support private facilities and health personnel working privately in communities during times of crisis so that these facilities are safe alternatives for women during crisis.

Although usage increased after Lehman's bankruptcy, most commercial banks avoided the DW and TAF. We also find that the programs were more often used by failed European banks than by healthy US banks, likely because these loans are expensive relative to private market funds.

Although the US institutions and scholars have often criticized the EU sui generis GI regime, practice shows that the two systems have much more in common than what emerges superficially. Indeed, in the US several collective marks aimed at protecting indications of geographical origin are managed and funded by public bodies or agencies. Furthermore, the US practice often procedurally recalls the European regime of GI protection and, in general, the overall development of the US system shows that it is heading toward a regime that is at least very compatible with, if not similar to, the EU one. Finally, concepts such as terroir, that is one of the theoretical pillars of the French European GI regime, are increasingly accepted in the US context as well. Therefore, the analysis conducted shows how the practical aspects of the management of GIs in the US contrasts with the traditional narrative according to which GI protection in the US, guaranteed by trademarks, the self-regulated system of private law, and the European administrative-based system are substantively different and irreconcilable.

Evidence generated with aggregated data at the regional level supports this prediction. This paper argues that, using aggregated data at the regional level, entrepreneurship capital could be correlated with regional production even if entrepreneurship capital has no spillover effects on firm production. This will not be the case when data at the firm level are used. This paper provides evidence from a sample of 11,276 Spanish firms during the 2004-2012 period. Positive spillovers are estimated in between effects models, but such spillovers are only found in technological firms when within effects models have been estimated. Thus, the regional entrepreneurship capital spillovers are unclear when data at the firm level are used.

Yet the status of cycling as a quick and easy transport solution available to all is rarely problematised in policy documents. Focussing on cycling policy documents in sub-tropical Brisbane (Australia) we apply interpretive policy analysis to identify the ways policy representations of cycling and cyclists may work to exacerbate the marginality of certain groups by excluding them from representation. Through analysis of these policy documents, and reference to international research on cycling and the right to the city, this article sketches out the figure of the 'Cycling Citizen' constructed within them. The Cycling Citizen is characterised in these policy documents by a combination of actions (such as demonstrations of speed and skill), personal attributes (such as body-type, clothes and gender) and attitudes (particularly around virtue). We argue that the dominance of representations of MAMIL (middle-aged men in lycra) cyclists in the policy documents analysed may work to make cycling less accessible to those less likely to identify as MAMIL such as women, people of colour, people with lower incomes, and fat people, and this may effectively exclude them from cycling policy decisions, and negatively shape personal choices about cycling. We further argue that policy representations of cycling and cyclists matter because they have the potential to influence infrastructure and funding decisions which may have material consequences with respect to cycling mode share, equity and safety.","[Osborne, Natalie] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia; [Grant-Smith, Deanna] Queensland Univ Technol, QUT Business Sch, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus; Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Osborne, N (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Sch Environm, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia.",n.osborne@griffith.edu.au; deanna.grantsmith@qut.edu.au,"Grant-Smith, Deanna/I-3463-2019; Osborne, Natalie/ACF-2278-2022","Grant-Smith, Deanna/0000-0001-5935-2690; Osborne, Natalie/0000-0002-9430-822X",,,,,108,21,22,2,25,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Due to this, a large number of iron ore ports/terminals have been built along the Yangtze River, and the Yangtze River bulk port system has experienced a unique development in its structure. This paper aims to understand the evolution of this bulk port system.(1) along the Yangtze River. To achieve this objective, first the development phases of the Yangtze River bulk port system are reviewed, taking the theoretical (container) port evolution model as a benchmark. Then several hypotheses addressing certain features of bulk port system development are proposed, followed by using panel data analysis to test these hypotheses. Based on this discussion and analysis, the major driving forces that are reshaping bulk port development along the Yangtze River are then summarized. It is found that evolution of the Yangtze River bulk port system in general follows the port development models in previous literature. However, the trend toward regionalization and an offshore hub have not appeared. Besides this, iron ore transshipment is moving outward both for sea ports and river ports, and few iron ore transshipment gateway hubs are occurring. Furthermore, the transshipment function of a bulk port plays a significant role in port traffic changes, but this role is affecting sea ports differently to river ports. The container throughput of transshipment sea ports has a significant negative effect on bulk traffic, whereas that of transshipment river ports has a positive effect. Geographical conditions, institutional factors and national policy, industry agglomeration, changes in market supply and demand, and technology updates are major factors driving changes to the port system structure. These factors are observed to function either individually or collectively at different development stages.","[Yang, Dong] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Logist & Maritime Studies, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Kelly Yujie] Guangxi Univ, China ASEAN Res Inst, Nanning, Peoples R China; [Xu, Hua] China Waterborne Transport Res Inst, Ctr Waterborne Transport Econ Policy & Dev Strate, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhehui] China Waterborne Transport Res Inst, Logist Engn Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Guangxi University,"Wang, KY (通讯作者)，Guangxi Univ, 7 Bldg,East Campus, Nanning 530004, Guangxi, Peoples R China.",dong.yang@polyu.edu.hk; wyj.kelly@connect.polyu.hk,"Xu, Hua/HKV-9926-2023; yang, dong/ABA-1300-2021","yang, dong/0000-0002-9239-0899",Hong Kong Polytechnic University Research Grant [G-UA8Y]; Philosophy and Social Sciences Research of Ministry of Education of China [12JZD038]; Innovation Team Development Plan of Ministry of Education of China [IRT_17R27],Hong Kong Polytechnic University Research Grant(Hong Kong Polytechnic University); Philosophy and Social Sciences Research of Ministry of Education of China; Innovation Team Development Plan of Ministry of Education of China,"This research is supported by The Hong Kong Polytechnic University Research Grant (G-UA8Y), Key Project of Philosophy and Social Sciences Research of Ministry of Education of China (12JZD038), and Innovation Team Development Plan of Ministry of Education of China (IRT_17R27) for China-ASEAN Regional Development.

We address the question of the acceptability of cost-effective climate policy in a real-voting setting. First, we analyze voting behavior in a large ballot on energy taxes, rejected in Switzerland in 2015 by more than 2 million people. Energy taxes were aimed at completely replacing the current value-added tax. We examine the determinants of voting and find that distributional and competitiveness concerns reduced the acceptability of energy taxes, along with the perception of ineffectiveness. Most people would have preferred tax revenues to be allocated for environmental purposes. Second, at the same time of the ballot, we tested the acceptability of alternative designs of a carbon tax with a choice experiment survey on a representative sample of the Swiss population. Survey respondents are informed about environmental, distributional and competitiveness effects of each carbon tax design. These impacts are estimated with a computable general equilibrium model. This original setting generates a series of novel results. Providing information on the expected environmental effectiveness of carbon taxes reduces the demand for environmental earmarking. Making distributional effects salient generates an important demand for progressive designs, e.g. social cushioning or recycling via lump-sum transfers. The case of lump-sum recycling is particularly striking: it is sufficient to show its desirable distributional properties to make it one of the most preferred designs, which corresponds to a completely novel result in the literature. We show that providing detailed information on the functioning of environmental taxes may contribute to close both the gap between acceptability ex ante and ex post and the gap between economists' prescriptions and the preferences of the general public.","[Carattini, Stefano] Yale Univ, Yale Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Carattini, Stefano] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England; [Carattini, Stefano] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, ESRC Ctr Climate Change Econ & Policy, London, England; [Baranzini, Andrea] HES SO Univ Appl Sci Western Switzerland, Haute Ecole Gest Geneve, Carouge, Switzerland; [Thalmann, Philippe; Vohringer, Frank] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Swiss Fed Inst Technol Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Varone, Frederic] Univ Geneva, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Geneva, Switzerland",Yale University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC); University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Applied Sciences & Arts Western Switzerland; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; University of Geneva,"Carattini, S (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Yale Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.;Carattini, S (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England.;Carattini, S (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, ESRC Ctr Climate Change Econ & Policy, London, England.",s.carattini@lse.ac.uk,"Baranzini, Andrea/R-6506-2019; Carattini, Stefano/AAK-5053-2021; Thalmann, Philippe/A-6943-2008; Varone, Frédéric/IXW-4970-2023","Baranzini, Andrea/0000-0002-9438-7730; Thalmann, Philippe/0000-0001-7200-3241; Varone, Frédéric/0000-0002-5620-3291; Carattini, Stefano/0000-0003-1242-2457","Swiss Federal Office of Energy; COST Action Innovations in Climate Governance: Sources, Patterns and Effects (INOGOV) [IS1309]; Swiss National Science Foundation [P2SKP1_165028]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [P2SKP1_165028] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)","Swiss Federal Office of Energy; COST Action Innovations in Climate Governance: Sources, Patterns and Effects (INOGOV); Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF))","The authors thank Sam Fankhauser, Anthony Leiserowitz and Boris Krey as well as the editors of this special issue, Cees Withagen, Gerard van der Meijden, and Rick van der Ploeg, for providing very valuable feedback.

The foreign multinationals strategically interact in both technology transfer and in the product market stage. Taking multinational firm competition into account implies that acquisition will more likely become the preferred mode of entry into the host country. This provides a possible rationale for the surge in the share of FDI taking place through mergers and acquisitions even in developing countries. Furthermore, we find that the level of the cost of technology transfer provides a possible rationale for the often observed pattern of investment liberalization. As the cost of technology transfer decreases, foreign multinational companies are first allowed to compete with local firms and in case of even lower cost of technology transfer, foreign ownership restrictions are also removed. Hence, we show that investment liberalization should go in tandem with host country policies that lower the cost of technology transfer.","[Ghebrihiwet, Nahom] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Tinbergen Inst, Dept Econ, Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute,"Ghebrihiwet, N (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Tinbergen Inst, Dept Econ, Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",n.ghebrihiwet@vu.nl,,,,,,,35,4,4,1,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

Those with high aspirations set ambitious goals for themselves, and those with low aspirations may fall prey to a poverty trap. Do natural disasters negatively impact aspirations? If so, can governments blunt these effects? We consider Pakistan's devastating 2010 floods-and the government's uneven relief efforts-to analyze these questions. We first show that the extreme rainfall generating this disaster significantly reduced aspirations, even when current levels of household expenditure, wealth, and education are taken into account. Individuals experiencing 2010 monsoon season rainfall that was one standard deviation higher than average had aspiration levels 1.5 years later that were 0.15 standard deviations lower than those of similar individuals experiencing just average levels of rainfall. This is the same negative shock to aspirations that one would experience as a result of a 50% reduction in household expenditures. Moreover, the negative effect of natural disasters on aspirations is especially strong among the poor, and among those who are most vulnerable to weather shocks. However, exploiting exogenous variation in flood relief access, we show that government social protection can attenuate these negative impacts. Individuals in villages that received Citizens Damage Compensation (Watan Card) Program flood relief-providing cash equivalent to 9.4% of annual household expenditures in each of the three years following the disaster-saw significantly lower declines in aspirations than did those in similarly affected villages without this relief. This offers a new understanding of social protection; it not only restores livelihoods and replaces damaged assets, but also has an enduring effect by easing mental burdens, and thus raising aspirations for the future. The negative effects of natural disasters and the efficacy of government relief programs may thus be underestimated if aspirations are ignored. (C) 2017 The Authors.

We observe the significant expansion of skilled workers and the increase in overall wage inequality in both countries over the period. Analyses of micro data present that contrasting evolutionary patterns in gender wage gap emerged over the period, showing a widened wage gap in China but a dramatically reduced gap in India. In both countries, female workers' increased skill levels contributed to reducing the gender wage gap. However, increases in observed prices of education and experience worked unfavorably for high-skilled women, counterbalancing their improvement in labor market qualifications. Decomposition of changes in the gender wage gap shows that China's widened gap was attributable to gender-specific factors such as deteriorated observable and unobservable labor market qualifications and increased discrimination, especially against low- and middle skilled female workers. For India, gender-specific factors and relatively high wage gains of low- and middle-skilled workers reduced the male female wage gap.

Policy makers and investors still use the ideas of rural versus urban and increasingly assume that the pace of urbanization in African countries is a measure of positive economic structural change. However most urban definitions do not incorporate economic characteristics. In Africa widely differing urban population thresholds and administrative factors are the most common criteria. The thresholds are often so low that many rural settlements are also defined as urban or they may be included on population density criteria, meaning the apparent pace of urbanization is inflated unrealistically. These issues are exemplified in this paper through detailed examples drawn from Kenya. It uses a range of sources including official census data and urban data published by Africapolis, as well as aerial images of rural and urban settlements in Kenya. It demonstrates how the use of population density criteria has inflated Kenyan urban data by the incorporation of very large numbers of rural people and explains how this can lead to entirely misleading interpretations of local and national urban and migration trends. Errors in urban figures can therefore have serious policy implications. It is argued that such errors can be reduced by not relying on a single criterion to define urban or by triangulating data on rural and urban settlements with other relevant information.

This paper examines a cluster of new practices designed to make visible - and extract value from - those without formal credit scores in contemporary financial markets. Many financial inclusion' projects now attempt to score the credit invisible' by drawing on a range of alternative data - non-financial payment streams, academic records, behavioural signals gleaned from online or social media footprints and results generated via digitized psychometric testing - and by assessing that data in relation to models of risk assessment based on the analysis of big data. I argue in this paper that these experiments in alternative credit scoring constitute the unbanked as an important, and dubious, category of knowledge and intervention. I also argue that attempts to score the unbanked offer a revealing glimpse of many of the social and political limitations associated with projects of inclusion'. Although often imagined as forms of pristine incorporation, inclusion projects often constitute troubling new kinds of social sorting and segmentation.","[Aitken, Rob] Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada",University of Alberta,"Aitken, R (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Polit Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R3, Canada.",raitken@ualberta.ca,,,,,,,118,89,95,1,52,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1024-5294,1477-2221,,COMPET CHANG,Compet.

Bank runs can be triggered by failures of connected banks. Under complete information on interbank linkages, we show that the problem reduces to a combinatorial optimization problem. Subject to budget constraints, the government chooses the set of minimal cost whose survival induces the maximum network stability. Our results demonstrate that the optimal equity infusion might significantly mitigate failure contagion risk and stabilize the system.

We test two competing hypotheses: the cognitive accessibility hypothesis, and the expectation-based hypothesis. The cognitive accessibility hypothesis argues that communication in a particular language will activate the underlying cultural frame and affect behavior. The expectation-based hypothesis argues that different languages will induce different expectations regarding the choices of others and affect behavior. We test these two hypotheses using an extensive range of behaviors in a set of incentivized experiments with bilingual subjects in Chinese and English. We find that the subjects are more prosocial in strategic interaction games (trust games) when the experiments are conducted in Chinese. However, no treatment effects are observed in the individual choice games on social preference. The results are more in line with the expectation-based hypothesis. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Money has been used toward consumption rather than investment. Because migrants from these regions are mostly permanent immigrants who settle in the host countries, we ask if there is a difference for South Asia where migrant workers are flooding for short-term, temporary contracts in the Middle Eastern countries. The permanent income hypothesis states that a permanent increase in income raises current consumption while transitory income increase is saved or smoothed over a life time. We argue that the transitory income remitted by short-term migrants is invested to generate future income when they return. We examine a panel data of five South Asian countries Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri-Lanka for a period from 1975 to 2011. Using panel cointegration and Pooled Mean Group (PMG) estimation of dynamic heterogeneous panels, we show. that there is a long-run significant impact of workers' remittances on income while the impact on consumption is not significant.

Based on the Demographic and Health Surveys, we examine malaria-treatment practices of various health-care providers in sub-Saharan Africa, where more than 90% of malaria-induced deaths occur. We estimate each provider's likelihood (i) to comply with guidelines to administer (effective) antimalarial drugs and (ii) to relieve children of fevera symptom of malariaafter having had a fever episode within the previous two weeks. Our results indicate that, relative to self-medication, seeking treatment at most providers is positively associated with taking an antimalarial drug and negatively associated with using only ineffective chloroquine. Non-traditional healers are also associated with fever relief.","[Paloyo, Alfredo] Univ Wollongong, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Paloyo, Alfredo] Univ Wollongong, Ctr Human & Social Capital Res, Wollongong, NSW, Australia; [Reichert, Arndt] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Impact Evaluat Team, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",University of Wollongong; University of Wollongong; The World Bank,"Paloyo, A (通讯作者)，Univ Wollongong, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",apaloyo@uow.edu.au,,"Paloyo, Alfredo R./0000-0002-7038-6071",,,,,39,1,1,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

The theory takes into account that sexual intercourse is utility enhancing and that the use of modern contraceptives potentially conflicts with prevailing social norms (religious beliefs). The theory motivates the existence of two steady states. At the traditional steady state, the economy stagnates, fertility is high, education is minimal, and the population sustains a norm according to which modern contraceptives are not used. At the modern steady state, the population has abandoned traditional beliefs, modern contraceptives are used, fertility is low and education and economic growth are high. Social dynamics explain why both equilibria are separated by a saddlepoint-equilibrium (a separatrix), i.e. why it is so hard to transit from the traditional regime to the modern regime.","[Strulik, Holger] Univ Goettingen, Dept Econ, Pl Goettinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Prettner, Klaus] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Econ, Schloss, Museumsflugel, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany",University of Gottingen; University Hohenheim,"Strulik, H (通讯作者)，Univ Goettingen, Dept Econ, Pl Goettinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",holger.strulik@wiwi.uni-goettingen.de,,"Prettner, Klaus/0000-0002-8971-8750; Strulik, Holger/0000-0002-5615-2412",,,,,70,14,14,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

To order the financial state of affairs after the merger, the current shareholders must revalue their stake in the merged company. The interest is focused on the valuation of shares and, consequently, on the allocation of the future economic benefits of the merged company to each owner. Despite the apparent relevance of company mergers in practice, the scientific literature deals with this topic only in an unsatisfying manner. After some early simple model-oriented approaches with the aim to define an ideal exchange ratio, the valuation problem of a merger was taken up again not earlier than in Hering (2004). Based on his considerations, the aim of our paper is to extend and generalize the valuation methods for a company merger and foremost to set the algebra for the computation of the critical share by using maximization of wealth as target function on a firm foundation. We assign a certain marginal quota to the shareholders representing the minimum share in the merged company which puts them in a financial position no worse than compared to the going concern basis. For this reason, we introduce the state marginal quota model as an innovative valuation approach that considers both existing market imperfections and individual expectations of a specific shareholder. To pinpoint our key finding: If private financial redistributions are available, our extended and generalized model shows that the marginal quota alpha* in question cannot be trivially obtained as a ratio of utilities. Instead, it is essential to consider the private decision field of a shareholder to allow a restructuring of the dividend payout stream offered by the merged company in order to reach at least a level of utility which is comparable to the state before the merger.","[Toll, Christian; Hering, Thomas] Fern Univ Hagen, Hagen, Germany",Fern University Hagen,"Toll, C (通讯作者)，Fern Univ Hagen, Hagen, Germany.",christian.toll@fernuni-hagen.de,,,,,,,59,3,4,0,15,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,AUG,2017,19.0,46,,,,,836,852,,,,,,17,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FK9UI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413856000016,0

Improving our understanding of the issue therefore remains a pressing concern. This paper responds to this need by proposing a new theoretical framework to explore land reform and providing a fresh analysis of historical and contemporary land struggles in Ecuador. Drawing on the pioneering work of Karl Polanyi, the paper characterizes these struggles as the attempt to increase the social and political control of land in the face of mounting commodification. The movement started in the 1960s and remains evident in Ecuador today. Exploring land reform in Ecuador from this theoretical perspective provides new insight into land struggles in the country and contributes to debates over land reforms of the past and present elsewhere in the Global South.","[Goodwin, Geoff] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Int Dev, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Goodwin, G (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Int Dev, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",g.goodwin@lse.ac.uk,,,FLACSO,FLACSO,"The first phase of research for this paper was undertaken while I was a Research Associate at FLACSO-Quito.

This paper reflects on what society's attitude toward low-probability, high-impact events is, or should be. We first argue that catastrophe risk can be conceived of as a spread in the distribution of losses. Based on this conception, we review studies from decision sciences, psychology, and behavioral economics that explore people's attitudes toward various social risks. Contray to popular belief, we find more evidence against than in favor of catastrophe aversion-the preference for a mean-preserving contraction of the loss distribution-and discuss a number of possible behavioral explanations. Next, we turn to social choice theory and examine how various social welfare functions handle catastrophe risk. We explain why catastrophe aversion may be in conflict with equity concerns and other-regarding preferences. Finally, we discuss current approaches to evaluate and regulate catastrophe risk.","[Rheinberger, Christoph M.] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Treich, Nicolas] Toulouse Sch Econ INRA, Toulouse, France; [Rheinberger, Christoph M.] European Chem Agcy ECHA, Helsinki, Finland",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; INRAE; European Chemicals Agency,"Rheinberger, CM (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France.;Rheinberger, CM (通讯作者)，European Chem Agcy ECHA, Helsinki, Finland.",rheinberger.cm@gmail.com,"Treich, Nicolas/AAX-2608-2020","Treich, Nicolas/0000-0001-5840-4735","Foundation for an Industrial Safety Culture (FonCSI); French Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy in the context of the SAFERA-NET [291812]","Foundation for an Industrial Safety Culture (FonCSI); French Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy in the context of the SAFERA-NET","The research in this paper was funded by the Foundation for an Industrial Safety Culture (FonCSI), and the French Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy in the context of the SAFERA-NET (FP7/2007-2013, grant no. 291812).

We show that the determinants of bond market access in EMs vary with global cyclical conditions and across local and foreign currency markets. We find that the role for institutions and macro fundamentals in creating an enabling environment for markets increased during the post-crisis period for local currency markets. Foreign bank linkages additionally explain why local currency bond markets increasingly substituted for banks in channeling liquidity to EMs. In the case of foreign currency markets, in turn, global cyclical factors accounted for most of the variation. Furthermore, a country's relative sensitivity to global factors appears to vary with the size of its foreign currency bond market rather than local fundamentals. Our results highlight the risk of capital flow reversal in those EMs that benefited from the upturn in the global financial cycle mostly due to the relative size of their bond markets rather than strong fundamentals.

In particular we examine how the sign and size of return innovations affect the expectations of daily changes in volatility. Our empirical findings indicate that the conditional contemporaneous return-volatility relationship varies not only based on the sign of the expected returns but also upon their magnitude, according to recent results from the behavioral finance literature. We find evidence of an asymmetric and reverse return-volatility relationship in many advanced, Asian, LatinAmerican, European and South African markets. We show that the US market displays the highest reaction to price falls, Asian markets present the lowest sensitivity to volatility expectations, while the Euro area is characterized by a homogeneous response both in terms of direction and impact. These results may be safely attributed to cultural and societal characteristics. An extensive quantile regression analysis demonstrates that the detected asymmetric pattern varies particularly across the extreme distribution tails i.e., in the highest/lowest quantile ranges.

Yet it is striking that IRGDs are correlated with income levels, and are generally negative in emerging and developing economies, which contradicts standard economic theory. Negative IRGDs constitute a powerful debt-stabilising force, driving down debt ratios or keeping them stable even in the presence of persistent primary deficits. Motivated by the puzzling facts, this paper examines the IRGDs for a large panel of advanced and non-advanced economies by utilising a newly assembled data set. The evidence shows that large negative IRGDs in emerging and developing economies are largely due to real interest rates well below market equilibrium - stemming from financial repression and captive and distorted markets - whereas the income catch-up process plays a relatively modest role. Therefore, the IRGD in non-advanced economies is likely to rise with financial market development and financial global integration, perhaps even before their GDP per capita converges to advanced-economy levels.","[Escolano, Julio; Shabunina, Anna] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Woo, Jaejoon] Bank Amer Merrill Lynch, New York, NY USA",International Monetary Fund; Bank of America Corporation,"Escolano, J (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",JEscolano@imf.org; AShabunina@imf.org; jaejoon.woo@baml.com,"Woo, Jaejoon/AAJ-5082-2021",,,,,,41,8,11,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

A quantile regression approach,BORSA ISTANBUL REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Intellectual capital; Intense monitoring; Quantile regression,FIRMS MARKET VALUE; CORPORATE GOVERNANCE; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; BOARDS; DETERMINANTS; IMPACT; CEOS,"Corporate governance has become a centre of attention in corporate management at both micro and macro levels due to adverse consequences and repercussion of insufficient accountability. In this study, we include the Malaysian stock market as sample to explore the impact of intense monitoring on the relationship between intellectual capital performance and market valuation. The objectives of the paper are threefold: i) to investigate whether intense monitoring affects the intellectual capital performance of listed companies; ii) to explore the impact of intense monitoring on firm value; iii) to examine the extent to which the directors serving more than two board committees affects the linkage between intellectual capital performance and firms' value. We employ two approaches, namely, the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) and the quantile regression approach. The purpose of the latter is to estimate and generate inference about conditional quantile functions. This method is useful when the conditional distribution does not have a standard shape such as an asymmetric, fat-tailed, or truncated distribution. In terms of variables, the intellectual capital is measured using the value added intellectual coefficient (VAIC), while the market valuation is proxied by firm's market capitalization. The findings of the quantile regression shows that some of the results do not coincide with the results of OLS. We found that intensity of monitoring does not influence the intellectual capital of all firms. It is also evident that intensity of monitoring does not influence the market valuation. However, to some extent, it moderates the relationship between intellectual capital performance and market valuation. This paper contributes to the existing literature as it presents new empirical evidences on the moderating effects of the intensity of monitoring of the board committees on the relationship between performance and intellectual capital.

Using product level data at the SITC 5-digit level for 114 developing countries over the 1962-2009 period, we show that prior export experience obtained in non-OECD markets significantly increases survival of pioneer exports toward the OECD. The experience does not need to last long, as gaining experience for more than two years does not confer any additional benefit. The effect of experience depreciates rapidly with time: a break in export experience prior to entering the OECD reduces the advantage on survival. Finally, the role of prior export experience is particularly relevant for survival in the first two years upon entry into the OECD. The geographic dynamic of export experience reveals that experience is acquired in neighboring, easy to access markets before reaching more distant, richer partners and ultimately serving the OECD with a higher probability of survival.","[Carrere, Celine] Univ Geneva, CEPR, Bd Pont dArve 40, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; [Carrere, Celine] Uni Mail, FERDI, Bd Pont dArve 40, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; [Strauss-Kahn, Vanessa] ESCP Europe, 79 Ave Republ, F-75011 Paris, France; [Strauss-Kahn, Vanessa] CEPII, 79 Ave Republ, F-75011 Paris, France",University of Geneva; heSam Universite; ESCP Business School,"Strauss-Kahn, V (通讯作者)，ESCP Europe, 79 Ave Republ, F-75011 Paris, France.;Strauss-Kahn, V (通讯作者)，CEPII, 79 Ave Republ, F-75011 Paris, France.",Celine.Carrere@unige.ch; vstrauss-kahn@escpeurope.eu,,,,,,,51,20,24,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

It engages the theoretical literature on ethnic diversity and development in general, but also pays special attention to political economy logics unique to authoritarian systems. Focusing on the western part of China over a decade since the launch of China's Western Development Program (xibu da kaifa) in 2000, this paper utilizes the data from two censuses (2000 and 2010) together with nighttime streetlight imagery data to analyze the overall relationship between ethnicity and development provision. It also analyzes changes in such a relationship during this period. The paper finds that ethnic minority concentration negatively correlates with economic development in both the years 2000 and 2010 across the western provinces. It also finds that counties in non-autonomous provinces, which are historically more integrated with the rest of China than autonomous provinces, have a positive and systematic correlation between changes in ethnic minority concentration and changes in development during the 10-year period. The counties in autonomous provinces, on the other hand, show the opposite trend. Using three case studies of Tibet, Inner Mongolia, and Xinjiang, the paper concludes that although there is in general a tendency for ethnic minority concentrated areas to be less developed, ultimately which groups prosper more or less depends upon specific economic development and which political control logics the Chinese state implements.

Allowing for different information and pricing strategies we show that education is unlikely to push banks to full price disclosure, which would be efficient, but instead to a new equilibrium in which banks discriminate between consumer types. Welfare analysis reveals that education, while positive for consumers who learn to make better financial decisions, imposes a negative externality on other consumers when banks respond by setting higher prices. Overall, the welfare effects of consumer education can be negative. Our results identify important pitfalls policy makers should take into account when considering the seemingly harmless intervention of consumer education.","[Kosfeld, Michael] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany; [Kosfeld, Michael] CEPR, New York, NY USA; [Kosfeld, Michael] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Kosfeld, Michael] IZA, Ithaca, NY USA; [Kosfeld, Michael; Schuewer, Ulrich] SAFE, Ithaca, NY USA; [Schuewer, Ulrich] Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Ifo Institut; University of Bonn,"Kosfeld, M (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.;Kosfeld, M (通讯作者)，CEPR, New York, NY USA.;Kosfeld, M (通讯作者)，CESifo, Munich, Germany.;Kosfeld, M (通讯作者)，IZA, Ithaca, NY USA.;Kosfeld, M (通讯作者)，SAFE, Ithaca, NY USA.",,,"Kosfeld, Michael/0000-0003-2427-0825",,,,,32,17,19,2,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

We find evidence consistent with timely loan loss recognition constraining lending corruption because it increases the likelihood of problem loans being uncovered earlier. In further analysis, we find timely loan loss recognition to be less associated with reduced corruption in countries where there is significant government ownership in the banking system and deposit insurance schemes. This evidence is consistent with timely loan loss recognition being less of a deterrent to lending corruption when banks are less disciplined by their capital providers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this circumstance, communities and local governments may prioritize economic recovery over environmental improvement, thereby weakening community and government pressure against polluting plants. In an attempt to explore the concern, this study examines the impact of local economic downturn on nearby chemical plants' toxic release reduction behavior. A total of 351 plants in Upstate New York and their toxic release inventory data were analyzed for 5 years (2006- 2010). The results show plants' toxic release reduction efforts were reduced when unemployment and plant closing rates were high. Therefore, the findings highlight a possible limitation to regulatory approaches that rely on public pressure to motivate better environmental performance.","[Bae, Hyunhoe] Yonsei Univ, Dept Publ Adm, 134 Sinchon Dong,Yonhee Hall 213, Seoul, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Bae, H (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Dept Publ Adm, 134 Sinchon Dong,Yonhee Hall 213, Seoul, South Korea.",hhbae@yonsei.ac.kr,,,,,,,32,8,8,0,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We investigate the cyclicality of SME lending of local banks with versus without a public mandate, controlling for location, size, loan maturity, capitalization, funding structure, liquidity, profitability, and credit demand-side factors. The public mandate is set by local governments and stipulates a sustainable provision of financial services to local customers and a deviation from strict profit maximization. We find that banks with a public mandate are 25% less cyclical than other local banks. The result is credit supply-side driven and especially strong for public mandate banks with high liquidity and stable deposit funding.

In particular, we use an instrumental variables approach to find that the child's chances of obtaining a high school or college degree are increasing in the parent's expectations of the likelihood of these events. We then use differences between the objective likelihood of a. child's educational attainment and the parents' subjective probabilities to consider the hypothesis that lower educational outcomes among certain groups are driven by a culture of despair, where children are low-achieving because they are expected to underachieve. While we do find that children from households with lower levels of income, wealth, and parental education are less likely to attain high school and college degrees, we reject the hypothesis that this is driven by low subjective expectations of educational success. Rather, we find that parents from disadvantaged groups have expectations for the educational outcomes of their children that differ more from the statistical likelihood of these outcomes than do parents of children from advantaged households. That is, we find that parents in more disadvantaged households are more optimistic about the educational outcomes of their children than those from more advantaged households. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Based on the methodologies of Mahutga and Piana, our position analysis arrives at two main conclusions: (i) the countries best positioned in the European regional automotive production network are precisely those that have experienced a greater increase in extra-European Union exports, thus reducing their dependence on regional European demand; (ii) the increase in extra-European Union exports (mainly of final goods) is linked to increased regional fragmentation of production in the automotive industry.

Specifically, we challenge the argument that a careerists' premium''-the tendency for public services run by careerists to receive better performance evaluations than services administered by other types of public managers-necessarily is explained by the superior expertise of career bureaucrats. Evidence that forms the basis of this possibility comes from performance evaluations of Korean state-owned enterprises (SOEs) managed by different types of executives between 2000 and 2015. The results of our analyses provide support for the existence of a careerists' premium. However, we find that the premium is most salient and significant when executives had retired from the governmental agency that oversees the performance-evaluation process. Moreover, the gap between qualitative and quantitative assessment scores increase significantly when the evaluated SOEs are managed by career executives who have retired from the regulating agency. This result suggests that the oft-cited careerists' premium may not necessarily signify careerists' greater expertise; it may also be the product of lobbying and regulatory capture.","[Hong, Sounman; Kim, Taek Kyu] Yonsei Univ, Coll Social Sci, Seoul, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Hong, S (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Coll Social Sci, Seoul, South Korea.",sounman_hong@yonsei.ac.kr,"Kim, Taek Kyu/JSK-0625-2023","Kim, Taek Kyu/0000-0002-8803-2247",National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government [NRF-2014S1A3A2044630],National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government,This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government(NRF-2014S1A3A2044630).,,45,15,16,0,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,APR,2017,171.0,1-2,,,,,167,186,,10.1007/s11127-017-0402-7,0.0,,,20,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,ET4FO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000400234900020,0

It applies the realized stochastic volatility model (Takahashi, Omori, & Watanabe, 2009, and Koopman & Scharth, 2013) to the spot rate model with dynamic drift and level effect setups (RSVL). A jointly approximated maximum likelihood procedure is used to estimate this model. The simulation results show that the RSVL model can be consistently estimated and noise-and-jump-robust realized volatility measures improve the accuracy of the estimation. This study empirically investigates the Chinese interbank repo market with RSVL model, which manifested the advantage of taking the level effect and nonlinear drift into consideration. The noise-and-jump-robust realized volatility measures (e.g. subsample realized volatility and threshold pre-average realized volatility) decrease the volatility fitting error. The nonparametric testing suggests that the RSVL model with noise-and-jump-robust realized volatility measures has more power on forecasting excess kurtosis and fat tails and predicting dynamics of higher order autocorrelations.

However, we also find evidence of diminishing returns to increased sleep. We estimate an academic optimum number of sleep hours of, on average, 8.5hours per night.

In a split-sample approach, a segment of respondents were given time to think (TTT) (24 hours) about their responses, while the remaining respondents had to answer immediately. We found significant differences in the choice behaviour between the subsamples. To validate the stated preferences with actual behaviour, a CCT programme was implemented afterwards. The stated WTA estimates were far below those revealed by actual behaviour for both subsamples. Contrary to our expectations, the TTT group had underestimated their actual WTA values by an even larger margin.

These risk values are then interpreted as trading signals which are tested with automated trading strategies that buy undervalued and sell overvalued CMBS from November 2007 through June 2015. All three signals generate substantial positive trading profits in testing for the reduced form model but not for the structural generalization. The risk signals constructed independently of market pricing provide more profitable automated trading insights than those constructed from interactions between modeled risk measures and market spreads. In my tests of the information content of the risk signals with respect to future macroeconomic indicators, I find statistically significant evidence in keeping with recent studies. While I cannot reject CMBS efficiency, this paper's disclosure of new risk measures, the profitability of automated strategies based on those risk measures, and the statistical significance of their forward guidance capabilities, together contributes to our understanding of CMBS risk and the credit spread puzzle debate.

Since some insured homeowners may attempt to disguise the actual cause of fire as accidental, we also examine how decreases in local house prices are associated with changes in the total number of fires and the probability of determined causes of accidental fires. For the sample period, our results suggest that declines in local house prices coincided with increases in arson, the total number of fires, and the probability that fires were determined to occur due to arson and misuse. We provide further support for the existence of such an effect with empirical evidence that the relation between declines in house prices and arson is stronger in states that allow mortgage lender recourse.","[Eriksen, Michael D.] Texas Tech Univ, Rawls Coll Business, Finance, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Carson, James M.] Univ Georgia, Terry Coll Business, Dept Insurance Legal Studies & Real Estate, Insurance, Athens, GA 30602 USA",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Eriksen, MD (通讯作者)，Texas Tech Univ, Rawls Coll Business, Finance, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",mike.eriksen@ttu.edu; jcarson@uga.edu,,,,,,,38,4,4,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

The factors that explain both entrepreneurial activity and gender gap are: education, risk tolerance; own car as primary means of transportation; work satisfaction; and parent business ownership.

Using electricity price data from 2009 to 2013, we evaluate the RE support mechanisms adopted by some of the largest EU economies. We explain the limitations of various metrics used to inform incentives for RE and propose an alternative metric reflecting investor requirements. Our results show that while the EU schemes were effective in delivering RE capacity, the incentives provided were overly generous and economically inefficient. To assess the indirect costs of RE in liberalized electricity markets we employ real option theory to quantify the costs of hedging and pricing the exposure faced by conventional fossil fuel generators required to accept RE under dispatch priority. We find that the cost of hedging against random RE output under dispatch priority is expensive while increasing RE in liberalized markets, by depressing prices and increasing price volatility, may place greater burden on conventional, dispatchable generators. As support for RE is presented as a public good, we argue that economically efficient RE support mechanisms require recognizing both their direct and indirect costs.","[Haar, Laura N.] Univ Manchester, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Haar, Lawrence] King Abdullah Petr Studies Res Ctr KAPSARC, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",University of Manchester; Alliance Manchester Business School,"Haar, LN (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, Manchester, Lancs, England.",laura.n.haar@manchester.ac.uk,"; Haar, Dr Lawrence/S-3897-2018","Haar, Laura/0000-0001-6800-2801; Haar, Dr Lawrence/0000-0003-2850-1360",,,,,47,10,10,0,6,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

Politicians might thus have an incentive to influence tax revenue forecasts, which are widely regarded as a key element of national budget plans. Looking at the time period from 1996 to 2012, we systematically analyze whether national tax revenue forecasts in 18 OECD countries are biased due to political manipulation. Drawing on theories from the field of political economy, we test three hypotheses using panel estimation techniques. We find support for partisan politics. Left-wing governments seem to produce more optimistic, or less pessimistic, tax revenue forecasts than do right-wing ones. Contrary to the theoretical prediction based on the common pool problem, we find that more fragmented governments and parliaments tend to produce more pessimistic, or less optimistic, tax revenue forecasts. We find no empirical evidence that political business cycles play a role in tax revenue forecasts.","[Jochimsen, Beate] Berlin Sch Econ & Law, Dept Econ & Business, Badensche Str 50-51, D-10825 Berlin, Germany; [Lehmann, Robert] Univ Munich eV, Ifo Inst, Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Ifo Ctr Business Cycle Anal & Surveys, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany",Berlin School of Economics & Law; Ifo Institut; University of Munich,"Lehmann, R (通讯作者)，Univ Munich eV, Ifo Inst, Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Ifo Ctr Business Cycle Anal & Surveys, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany.",beate.jochimsen@hwr-berlin.de; lehmann@ifo.de,"Jochimsen, Beate/K-4876-2019; Lehmann, Robert/AAJ-3727-2020","Jochimsen, Beate/0000-0001-6950-3026; Lehmann, Robert/0000-0001-6684-7536",Research Council of Norway [228495]; E.ON Ruhrgas,Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); E.ON Ruhrgas,"The paper substantially improved during a research stay at the BI Norwegian Business School, Department of Economics.

This development substantially increases the risk of inefficient public spending. In this paper, we examine the ability of finance instruments to effectively and efficiently address market failures related to clean energy investments. We characterise these market imperfections emission externalities, knowledge spillovers and capital market imperfections and identify their negative impacts on the investor-relevant risk-return characteristics. We argue that finance instruments are able to address the effects of these market failures. However, a carbon price is superior in internalising the emission externalities. With respect to the latter two inefficiencies, investment support instruments can effectively compensate the market failures if designed appropriately. We further provide policy recommendations on the choice of finance instruments to address the various market failures and guidance on how to use these instruments avoiding inefficient government spending.","[Kempa, Karol; Moslener, Ulf] FSUNEP Collaborating Ctr Climate & Sustainable En, Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Sonnemannstr 9-11, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany; [Kempa, Karol] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Dept Econ, Giessen, Germany",Frankfurt School Finance & Management; Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Kempa, K (通讯作者)，FSUNEP Collaborating Ctr Climate & Sustainable En, Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Sonnemannstr 9-11, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany.;Kempa, K (通讯作者)，Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Dept Econ, Giessen, Germany.",K.Kempa@fs.de,"Kempa, Karol/JCE-6275-2023","Kempa, Karol/0000-0001-7013-722X","German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB)","German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB)","We thank Christine Gruning, Andreas Loschel, and two anonymous referees for their valuable input and are grateful for comments from the participants of the 12th European Energy Conference of the International Association for Energy Economics, where an early version of this article was presented.

These incentives can be introduced in practice by means of two different (but non-conflicting) approaches in capacity mechanisms. First, performance incentives can be linked to constraints on tradable quantities (the so-called firm capacity or firm energy), which limit the amount of reliability that a given resource may sell in the mechanism, and which may be recalculated penalising potential unfulfilments. Second, they can be implemented as financial penalties for failure to comply with the commitments foreseen in the capacity contract. The first approach has been applied since the outset of capacity markets. The second did not receive much attention in the early stages of the implementation of adequacy mechanisms, but there is a growing trend on implementing it in modern designs. In this paper, after framing the problem conceptually, empirical evidence (particularly from Colombia, ISO New England, PJM, United Kingdom, and France) is compiled to reveal current trends in enhancing short-term performance in capacity mechanisms.","[Mastropietro, Paolo; Rodilla, Pablo; Batlle, Carlos] Comillas Pontif Univ, Inst Res Technol, Madrid, Spain; [Rodilla, Pablo; Batlle, Carlos] MIT Energy Initiat, Cambridge, MA USA; [Rodilla, Pablo; Batlle, Carlos] Florence Sch Regulat, Florence, Italy",Comillas Pontifical University,"Mastropietro, P (通讯作者)，Comillas Pontif Univ, Inst Res Technol, Madrid, Spain.",Paolo.Mastropietro@comillas.edu,"Batlle, Carlos/AAF-1471-2022; Batlle, Carlos/AFG-4923-2022; Rodríguez, Pablo Rodilla/AAB-5309-2021; Mastropietro, Paolo/A-2949-2019","Batlle, Carlos/0000-0001-8451-5295; Batlle, Carlos/0000-0001-8451-5295; Rodríguez, Pablo Rodilla/0000-0002-3906-1957; Mastropietro, Paolo/0000-0002-3088-0243",,,,,30,9,10,0,6,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

We show that a given level of pay-for-performance incentives results in significantly lower firm risk when the economy is in a downturn.

It uses a DSGE model with financial frictions (namely, collateral effects and economies of scope in banking) and a generic formulation of provisioning regimes. Numerical experiments with a parameterized version of the model show that cyclically adjusted (or, more commonly called, dynamic) provisioning can be highly effective in terms of mitigating procyclicality and financial risks, measured in terms of the volatility of the credit-output ratio and real house prices, in response to financial shocks. The optimal combination of simple cyclically adjusted provisioning and countercyclical reserve requirement rules is also studied. The simultaneous use of these instruments does not improve the ability of either one of them to mitigate financial volatility, making them (partial) substitutes rather than complements.

Facing the same set of entry plans, low-leverage incumbents expand physical capacity (by 30%), whereas high-leverage incumbents do not. This difference in investment matters because capacity installations preempt eventual entry. Stock market reactions to withdrawn plans imply that effective preemption increases incumbent firm value by 5%.

Along with direct effects, energy is allowed to influence income growth indirectly by capital accumulation through input substitution. We find that energy use affects economic growth primarily through the capital channel and that this result varies substantially with regard to the country's income level. For middle-income countries including the quintet of large emerging economies - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -an increase in energy use drives capital accumulation, which favors economic growth. On the contrary, for high-income countries, a higher energy input tends to withdraw productive resources from capital accumulation, harming economic growth. Considering these differences, policy measures aiming at restricting energy consumption should be evaluated against the background of a region's stage of economic development.","[Lechthaler, Filippo] Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland; [Lechthaler, Filippo] Univ Basel, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland",University of Basel; Swiss Tropical & Public Health Institute; University of Basel,"Lechthaler, F (通讯作者)，Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.;Lechthaler, F (通讯作者)，Univ Basel, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.",f.lechthaler@unibas.ch,,,,,,,64,7,8,0,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Closer analysis shows that this effect is stronger in the institutional aspects of CSR, such as community and workforce diversity, rather than in the technical aspects of CSR, such as corporate governance and product quality. Our results are robust to different competing explanations, including narcissism, which refers in this context to CEOs who engage in CSR to attract attention and alternative proxies for CSR and CEO confidence.

The estimation method used is that of panel data modelling, based on data from regions from European countries, including countries from Central and Eastern Europe, for which exploratory analysis was conducted on the effects of employment counts, number of companies, and wages per capita, in computer and related activities and research and development industries. Higher employment in both industries have positive effects on total employment and GDP/Capita. No sizable displaced workers effects can be seen, as higher employment and wages/capita in innovation industries are accompanied by higher employment and lower unemployment at regional level. Positive effects can be observed for both young and mature workers, and are stronger for the latter, pointing out to strong potential spillover effects. Number of local companies is not a relevant indicator for assessing the influence of research and development activities. All these effects point to the sustainability of innovation industries, which not only lead to increase of GDP per capita, but also show positive spillover effects, increase employment and reduce unemployment. The results for countries from Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) have been to some extent less significant, due to several objective factors. The results should also be viewed in the framework of the transition and catch-up period that characterizes the evolution of the CEE economies. The positive effects of strong growth are primarily reflected in GDP growth, and it may be that it takes a while for these effects to propagate in the rest of the economy in terms of job creation and sizable reduction of unemployment. While the current analysis revealed some of the first-round impacts of the innovation industries, much work remains to be done in matching these effects with other determinants of employment and unemployment, which can improve existing models with relevant empirical elements.","[Otoiu, Adrian; Bere, Ramona; Silvestru, Catalin] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Otoiu, A (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",otoiu.adrian@gmail.com,"OTOIU, Adrian/GWM-9957-2022; Silvestru (Bere), Ramona/Q-7314-2016; OTOIU, Adrian/HPE-8279-2023; Otoiu, Adrian/J-6348-2013; Catalin Ionut, Silvestru/B-9933-2009","Silvestru (Bere), Ramona/0000-0001-6414-7077; Otoiu, Adrian/0000-0001-5830-5462; Catalin Ionut, Silvestru/0000-0003-0736-343X",,,,,25,7,7,0,12,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2017,19.0,44,,,,,289,301,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EN1CB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000395746900018,0

I argue that index funds fit the profile of nonstrategic traders who, according to theory, are unambiguously more likely than managers and strategic investors to prefer high stock liquidity and thus high disclosure. This suggests that I can use index funds' disclosure preferences to construct an empirical model of voluntary disclosure that abstracts away from managers' strategic disclosure motives. Accordingly, I use an index-fund setting to construct a recursive structural equation model of voluntary disclosure, index fund ownership, and liquidity. I find that when a firm joins the S&P 500 index, voluntary disclosure increases with the level of ownership assumed by index funds, and this increase in disclosure is associated with increased stock liquidity. These results imply that voluntary disclosure increases stock liquidity.","[Schoenfeld, Jordan] Univ Utah, Eccles Sch Business, 1655 Campus Ctr Dr, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Schoenfeld, J (通讯作者)，Univ Utah, Eccles Sch Business, 1655 Campus Ctr Dr, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",j.schoenfeld@utah.edu,"Schoenfeld, Jordan/GZA-9893-2022; Joaquim, Joaquim Carvalho/JEF-2667-2023","Schoenfeld, Jordan/0000-0002-5842-4370",,,,,95,85,106,12,76,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0165-4101,1879-1980,,J ACCOUNT ECON,J.

We find that households residing in relatively more remote areas consume substantially less than households nearer to the market, they are more food insecure, and their school enrollment rates are lower. Although their diets are also less diverse, we find no significant differences in mother and child anthropometric measures. Part of the differences in wellbeing that we do observe can be attributed to lower household agricultural production in remote areas. Nonetheless agricultural production differences alone do not account for all the differences in household consumption levels for remote households. An additional contributing factor is the terms of trade for remote households that negatively affect both the size of the agricultural surplus that these households market and the quantity of food items that they purchase. Reducing transaction costs for remote households and facilitating migration could help equalize well-being among more or less favored locations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This requires better knowledge on how competing interests and actors interact and what determines the practical competition outcomes as demand for land intensifies and international actors get increasingly involved in regulating natural resources. Land use planning in Laos provides a case in point as it aims at strengthening tenure security, intensifying agriculture and sparing forest areas while other policies simultaneously promote agricultural development and agri-business investment that reconfigure land use and land access. Through national, provincial, district, village and household interviews, we examine how different land- and forest-related policies interact, and whether ongoing land use planning processes and land rights formalization increase tenure security. We show how government policies supported by international donors, and introduced to strengthen tenure rights for the rural population actually reduce villagers' legally permitted agricultural areas. Even if district-level land use regulations do not currently exclude local communities from their land, land use plans lay the groundwork for potentially excluding villagers from large land areas. We find that plural, contradictory regulations and policies, combined with existing power inequalities result in a filter mechanism that reduces the practical impact of legal instruments and safeguards aimed at strengthening the least powerful actors' rights. Our results add to other authors' arguments that political and legal changes are mediated by power relations, cultural norms and economic incentives, by highlighting that the duel-edged rights sword may actually end up paving the way for greater state control over future benefits derived from community areas classified as forest lands. This is especially relevant when preparing REDD+, which we show is likely to weaken rather than strengthen tenure security for rural populations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The online platform maximizes resources and time when assisting individuals with disabilities to obtain a college degree through long distance education. In order to provide an effective online educational service, there are certain strategies and components that should be taken into consideration to facilitate the online educational experience for adults with disabilities.

In the model, financial intermediaries or banks borrow from the world market and lend to domestic households. Banks can borrow abroad up to a multiple of their equity; in turn, there is a limit to how much bank equity households can hold. The combination of external and domestic frictions results in an economy-wide credit constraint and an endogenous interest rate spread. It also magnifies the amplitude and persistence of aggregate responses to exogenous shocks. In response to external balance shocks, fixed exchange rates are contractional); and flexible exchange rates expansionary (although less so in the presence of currency mismatches); the opposite is true in response to increases in the world interest rate. Unconventional policies, including central bank direct credit, discount lending, and equity injections to banks, have real effects only if financial constraints bind. Because of bank leverage, central bank discount lending and equity injections are more effective than direct credit. Sterilized foreign exchange intervention is equivalent to lending directly to domestic agents. Unconventional policies are feasible only to the extent that the central bank holds a sufficient amount of international reserves.","[Chang, Roberto] Rutgers State Univ, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Chang, Roberto; Velasco, Andres] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Chang, Roberto] Rutgers State Univ, State Univ New Jersey, Econ, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Chang, Roberto] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Chang, Roberto] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Chang, Roberto] Fed Reserve Bank Atlanta, Atlanta, GA 30309 USA; [Chang, Roberto] Natl Sci Fdn, Econ Panel, 4201 Wilson Blvd, Arlington, VA 22230 USA; [Velasco, Andres] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Velasco, Andres] SIPA, Profess Practice Int Dev, New York, NY USA; [Velasco, Andres] Harvard Kennedy Sch Govt, Int Finance & Dev, Cambridge, MA USA; [Velasco, Andres] NYU, Econ, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Velasco, Andres] NYU, Ctr Latin Amer & Caribbean Studies, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Velasco, Andres] Harvard & MIT, Polit Econ, Cambridge, MA USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; National Bureau of Economic Research; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; National Bureau of Economic Research; New York University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Atlanta; National Science Foundation (NSF); Columbia University; Harvard University; New York University; New York University; Harvard University,"Chang, R (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.;Chang, R (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Chang, R (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, State Univ New Jersey, Econ, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.;Chang, R (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Chang, R (通讯作者)，NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA.;Chang, R (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Atlanta, Atlanta, GA 30309 USA.;Chang, R (通讯作者)，Natl Sci Fdn, Econ Panel, 4201 Wilson Blvd, Arlington, VA 22230 USA.",chang@econ.rutgers.edu,"velasco, andres/HTT-4902-2023",,,,,,26,3,5,0,6,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

The results reveal that the distance of banks' headquarters to these financial centres matters. In particular, banks that are located at a bigger distance from New York and London present a lower technical efficiency than banks that are closer to these financial centres. In addition, the results show that the Global Financial Crisis has magnified the effect of distance and the need for banks to be closer to global financial centres during the 'core' of that period.

Differences in family structure and measures of luck such as income windfalls and inheritances explain even less. Measures of financial decisionmaking, such as the share of housing in total assets and debt ratios, are much more important. Controlling for differences in all of these observable factors simultaneously and adjusting for life-cycle effects, we can explain about 70 percent of the Black-White wealth gap and virtually all of the Hispanic-White and Asian-White wealth gaps, consistent with earlier research. However, this model assumes equal wealth returns to education levels across racial and ethnic groups. Relaxing this assumption, we find significantly different wealth outcomes across racial and ethnic groups within the same education level. This, in turn, weakens the conclusion that racial and ethnic wealth gaps are largely explainable with observable factors. More importantly, the standard approach assumes all families face the same choice and opportunity sets. We investigate an alternative theoretical framework that attributes racial or ethnic group mean differences in education, family structure, financial decisions, and luck not to individual choice or effort in the face of equal opportunities but instead to systemic or structural factors in the past and present. In this model, the share of wealth gaps that can be explained by observables falls below one fifth for Blacks and Hispanics and to about three quarters for Asians. In other words, a structural-determinants framework suggests the vast majority of the Black-White and Hispanic-White wealth gaps may lie beyond the scope of individual actions or marginal policy changes directed at educational attainment, family structure, financial decisionmaking, or even wealth redistribution.

The authors emphasize the time (in days) between announcement and completion. Design/methodology/approach - The empirical setting consists of the cross-border acquisitions (CBAs) of Brazilian firms by multinational corporations announced between 2008 and 2012. Using a sample of 741 acquisitions, the authors examine how institutional (cultural and regulatory) and technological complexity and the predictable mitigating effect of prior acquisition experience in Brazil all impact on the time needed for evaluating the target and negotiating. Findings - The results show that these complexity factors do matter for hastening the process and that recent experience with acquisitions in Brazil shortens the time needed to completion. Originality/value - This study contributes to the literature on the acquisition process and the uncertainty and complexity factors in CBA in an emerging economy.","[Ferreira, Manuel Portugal; Vicente, Simone] Univ Nove Julho, Grad Sch Management, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Ferreira, Manuel Portugal] Inst Politecn Leiria, Leiria, Portugal; [Borini, Felipe] Univ Sao Paulo, Programa Mestrado & Doutorado Gestao Int, Escola Super Propaganda & Mkt, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Borini, Felipe; Almeida, Martinho Ribeiro] Univ Sao Paulo, FEA, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade Nove de Julho; Polytechnic Institute of Leiria; Escola Superior de Propaganda e Marketing (ESPM); Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Ferreira, MP (通讯作者)，Univ Nove Julho, Grad Sch Management, Sao Paulo, Brazil.;Ferreira, MP (通讯作者)，Inst Politecn Leiria, Leiria, Portugal.",manuel.portugal.ferreira@gmail.com,"Ferreira, Manuel Portugal/A-2322-2012; Borini, Felipe/ABE-1048-2020","Ferreira, Manuel Portugal/0000-0002-4642-4605;",,,,,45,8,11,0,15,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

However, premature job exits or earnings losses in the years leading up to retirement may be particularly devastating to retirement savings. The authors analyze the impact of recent business cycles on retirement using multifaceted job transitions of older workers. They focus on local labor markets because older workers are particularly unlikely to move for work. Surprisingly, the biggest effect of a higher local unemployment rate on older workers is to raise the propensity to stay in one's current job. Older workers have fewer voluntary transitions to new jobs when the unemployment rate rises, but they especially have fewer voluntary transitions out of the labor force. Thus, the direct effect of job loss in inducing earlier retirement during recessions is outweighed by retirement delays among those with jobs.","[Friedberg, Leora] Univ Virginia, Econ, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Owyang, Michael T.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO USA; [Sun, Wei] Renmin Univ China, Econ, Hanqing Adv Inst Econ & Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Sun, Wei] Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Webb, Anthony] Schwartz Ctr Econ Policy Anal, New Sch, Retirement Equ Lab, New York, NY USA",University of Virginia; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; Renmin University of China; Renmin University of China; The New School,"Friedberg, L (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Econ, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",,"Owyang, Michael T/I-5750-2016","Owyang, Michael T/0000-0002-2109-3432",U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA),U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA),The research reported herein was performed pursuant to a grant from the U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) funded as part of the Retirement Research Consortium.,,37,0,0,1,5,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

Quantitative and qualitative information affects a company's likelihood of incurring in financial distress and there is a need to study how the peculiarities of family firms affect their probability of financial distress. We address this topic by studying a sample of 1,137 Italian private firms for the period 2004-2013 in order to include the pre and post financial crisis periods. We analyze family firms' financial distress likelihood taking into account some board and CEO characteristics, different measures of risk, some accounting variables and some macroeconomic indicators. We find that these variables have different significance in the family than non-family firms, and we argue that it is due to the main reference point in family firms' behavior, i.e. the preservation of the affective returns that the family derives from the business.","[Gottardo, Pietro; Moisello, Anna Maria] Univ Pavia, 5 Via San Felice, I-27100 Pavia, Italy",University of Pavia,"Gottardo, P (通讯作者)，Univ Pavia, 5 Via San Felice, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.",pietro.gottardo@unipv.it; annamaria.moisello@unipv.it,"maria, moisello anna/AAD-1764-2020",,,,,,54,0,0,1,12,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-269-9,STRATEGICA,,,2017,,,,,,,361,372,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0ZU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431586800028,0

As a small landlocked country, Rwanda sought to develop the capability to produce silk, a high value-to-volume ratio product, as a means to overcome the constraints of high transportation cost of exports. Sericulture was also seen as a handy strategy to boost rural farmer income by putting previously less productive land to use for mulberry plantations. Because sericulture was not introduced randomly, this study relied on observational data and applied propensity score matching to estimate its income and poverty reduction effects in six rural districts. The results indicate that sericulture adoption had beneficial effects both on increasing income and reducing poverty. The strengthening of related skills development and the supporting infrastructure remains crucial for the sericulture to successfully diffuse and yield economic benefits commensurate with its potential.","[Habiyaremye, Alexis] Humans Sci Res Council, Merchant House,116-118 Buitengracht St, ZA-8001 Cape Town, South Africa",,"Habiyaremye, A (通讯作者)，Humans Sci Res Council, Merchant House,116-118 Buitengracht St, ZA-8001 Cape Town, South Africa.",ahabiyaremye@hsrc.ac.za,"Habiyaremye, Alexis/HKO-3239-2023","Habiyaremye, Alexis/0000-0002-8614-2485",,,,,42,3,4,4,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2017,56.0,3,,,,,296,311,,10.1080/03031853.2017.1361853,0.0,,,16,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,FH0YL,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000410866500007,0

Social farming is a method of real integration of socially or physically disadvantaged persons into society through various mechanisms such as social services, employment, leisure activities, education, etc., all in the direct context of agriculture and rural communities. Rural areas have traditionally been conceived as settlements outside cities which usually have a lower population density and are frequently associated with the agricultural sector. The concept of agriculture includes many functions, e.g. production function, cultural function or social function. Social farming is a current topic that relates, inter alia, to the social exclusion of seniors, and to which attention is paid mainly due to its potential for the whole of society and rural areas. Social exclusion of seniors can be understood as a lack of participation of a person in the age of 65+ in the life of the society, accompanied by a higher degree of dependence on the care of another person.

The accompanying phenomenon of these changes in the labour market was growing uncertainty and the level of long-term unemployment. However, the industrial era has been gradually turning into a new era of knowledge. The discourse on the future of work has already begun. The trigger of this discourse was the Industry 4.0 concept, which was first introduced in Germany in 2011 and followed by the Work 4.0 concept, focused on changes in the world of work. The aim of the paper is to outline basic trends in the development of current changes in the Czech labour market in the context of changes in the European labor market, especially in the context of the Industry 4.0 concept. Since the second half of the 20th century many significant changes have occurred in the Czech labour market.

The findings suggest that higher income, higher trading activities, higher stock market trading activities and higher availability of finance credit will enhance the non-life insurance development. Legal stability such as enhancement on the property right and government integrity will improve the non-life insurance development too. Interestingly, when the legal environment in emerging ASEAN countries are more stable, the foreign direct investment and stocks market will become more encouraging and stimulate non-life insurance development.

On the basis of previous theoretical and empirical research, it is found in this paper that except for some important financial indexes, some predictable characteristics of small and medium enterprises and enterprise owners may also relate to risk factors. In addition, it is also found in this paper that the political identity or political relations of enterprise owners may have the negative relations with the credit risks of enterprises, demonstrating that non-efficiency distribution led by non-official relations may exist in the loan distribution process. This factor is not beneficial to establishing the benign bank-enterprise relations and solving the loaning problem of small and medium enterprises.

The impact of market segmentation and depreciation of old product on decision making and supply chain efficiency are analyzed. It is found that product price and supply chain efficiencies are affected by the old customer proportion, the old product loss degree and offset price by returning old goods. The offset price in the trade-in model can attract more old customers for the retailer, but retailer's profit is reduced as the old customer proportion of the market increases. When the old customer proportion increases, in order to win the market, retailer will reduce the price to attract more old customers. When the depreciation of old product increases, retailer will raise price to take more profit.

The public has always paid close attention to public health expenditure. In order to study the quantitative relation between public health expenditure and social economic development, this paper investigates prefecture-level cities in Shandong Province, due to the unique characteristics of Shandong Province. Making theoretical and empirical contribution, this paper augments Cobb-Douglas production function with public health expenditure and empirically analyzes economic development of prefecture-level cities in Shandong Province. A panel data set is set up, followed by multivariate regression analysis. Empirical results find that public health expenditure per capita and coverage of medical insurance can significantly promote the development of social economy. At the same time, expansion of the scale of health institutions and growth of the number of health institutions cannot promote economic development. Instead, it may even hold back economic development by causing personnel redundancy and waste of resources. If the government transfers its investment focus from the scale and the speed of development of medical services to the fairness and the efficiency of medical services, public health expenditure may bring greater benefits to the improvement of both social public health condition and economic development.","[Li, Lin; Wu, Maoguo; Wu, Zhenyu] Shanghai Univ, SHU UTS SILC Business Sch, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Shanghai University,"Wu, MG (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ, SHU UTS SILC Business Sch, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",,"Lu, Xiaomei/IUQ-2139-2023",,,,,,25,0,0,1,3,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-405-7,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,37.0,,,,,,783,795,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ9PC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000429699600061,0

So far, there are nearly 30 shared bicycle brands. For instance, Mobike has launched in more than 30 cities, invested more than 3 million bicycles, reached tens of millions of registered users. At the same time, OFO has reached 25 million people of registered users and invested more than 1 million bicycles. With the rapid expansion of the scales of the users and capitals, bicycle-sharing enterprises face a variety of bike sharing operation risks. Insurance is a conventional, standard, convenient means of risk management. The risks of sharing bicycles should have direct corresponding insurance products. Due to this point of view, in this paper, after an overview of the market situation, we use the method of environment analysis to recognize the risks of current mainstream bicycle-sharing enterprises. Nowadays, the bicycle-sharing enterprises and insurance cooperation is mainly on the users' accidental injury and medical costs, which implies a broad space for cooperation. Bear the brunt of blank field is to share the risk of property damage. So far, the reported failure ratio of Mobike and OFO bicycles were 26.2% and 39.3%, while the maintenance inputs are shared by the bicycle enterprises. If these enterprises profits cannot cover the cost of depreciation expense and related operations, they will quit the market sooner or later. In the era of sharing economy, all kinds of industry are actively cultivating the big data. This paper mainly discusses the necessity and value of bicycle-sharing property insurance development, challenges and difficulties (SWOT analysis), assumption of product pricing and the upgrade of insurance industry chain. Among them, the product pricing should have great difference with the traditional property damage coverage. This article focuses on the Internet attribute of bicycle-sharing with the analysis of Entropy weight-AHP method. This point of view innovates the idea of using built-in bicycle GPS or the access of terminal APP to gather all the dynamic data of bicycles in different regions of the same city, in order to recognize, classify and assess the risks. Eventually, after the program reaches the maturity, the insurance will realize the multi-level products pricing and realize the match of personalized risks and personalized pricing. Therefore, the ideal pricing of bicycle-sharing property insurance is not simply in accordance with the actual price of bicycle. It is also necessary to consider multi-dimensional social efficacy such asregion, the historical path features and average function etc. This will bring great challenges to the insurance company in both data-digging technology and actuarial technology innovation. However, it is inevitably that vehicle insurance has dominated the property insurance market for many years. Consequently, the market has lost the inherent power of deep innovation. As the bicycle-sharing program has gradually opened the curtain of sharingcity traffic, whether the insurance cooperationcan start a new round of product innovation, return to the nature of the insurance industry, promote industrial ecosystem integration by deep innovation, is a big challenge in the process of industrial upgrading.","[Li Mingzi; Li Bing] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Postgrad Sch Insurance, Beijing, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Li, B (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Postgrad Sch Insurance, Beijing, Peoples R China.",limingzireal@126.com; 18810493060@163.com,,,,,,,10,2,2,0,11,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,,,,,2017,,,,,,,372,393,,,,,,22,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK8HD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000442810700026,0

Since IT governance (like other aspect of banking business) can be influenced by regulatory environment, therefore, we examine whether any differences in supervisor attitude to IT concern will induce differences in IT governance across countries. IT is an intrinsic component of banks' operational functioning; it is a key resource in developing and supporting banking services, enabling institutions' strategies, and it is essential for almost all banking processes and distribution channels. IT and data architectures are also becoming even more necessary to improve banks' risk management process, and support the broad management of financial risks. Due to this increasing relevance of IT, it is necessary to pay more attention on IT governance as integral part of banking corporate governance, being sure that IT processes are fully integrated into the life cycle of business process, and used as an enhancer of organizational strategy and goals. Recurring to IT governance transparency, as a key mechanism of corporate governance, we: i) elaborate an original IT governance framework; ii) perform a content analysis on banks public disclosure and a selected number of Supervisors' official documents (2008-2015) to build up IT governance indices; iii) run a multidimensional analysis to detect causal relationships between variables. Our analysis indicates that differences in the level of IT governance disclosure are bank specific and not related to country's institutional settings; we also observed an increasing consistent attention of both Supervisors and banks on IT issues starting from 2013.","[Panetta, Ida Claudia; Leo, Sabrina; Santoboni, Fabrizio] Sapienza Univ Rome, Rome, Italy; [Vento, Gianfranco] Regents Univ London, London, England",Sapienza University Rome,"Panetta, IC (通讯作者)，Sapienza Univ Rome, Rome, Italy.",ida.panetta@uniroma1.it; sabrina.leo@uniroma1.it; fabrizio.santoboni@uniroma1.it; ventog@regents.ac.uk,"PANETTA, IDA CLAUDIA/A-5513-2010; LEO, SABRINA/K-5466-2019","PANETTA, IDA CLAUDIA/0000-0001-7019-3993; LEO, SABRINA/0000-0002-5157-2135",,,,,50,2,3,0,2,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2017,,,,,,,25,47,,,,,,23,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7PJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455302900001,0

However, previous experience with application of the law shows that this objective has not been fulfilled. The main cause of this situation is often seen in the fact that the social-service financing system is inefficient. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to analyse the latest research carried out in this area in the Czech Republic and to evaluate on that basis whether liberalisation of the financing system would remove the main causes of the current situation. It turns out that one of the key problems of the current situation is the fact that health insurance companies contribute to the financing of the nursing and rehabilitation care in residential social-care facilities in a minimum extent only, and therefore these facilities are dependent on subsidies from public resources. It is thus necessary to search for another method of financing the nursing and rehabilitation care so that the care indicated by a physician and provided by paramedical staff could be paid from the public health-insurance system in accordance with legal regulations.","[Prusa, Ladislav] Univ Finance & Adm, Estonska 500, Prague 10000 10, Czech Republic",University of Finance & Administration - Czech Republic,"Prusa, L (通讯作者)，Univ Finance & Adm, Estonska 500, Prague 10000 10, Czech Republic.",ladislav.prusa@vsfs.cz,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,0,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

Present day crops such as coffee may not be enough to secure agricultural subsistence levels, therefore, the first stages of crop diversification are being observed in countries such as Nicaragua. Implementation of new crops such as cocoa may lead to new impacts over the environmental structure of the Mesoamerican ecosystem. These impacts may be of different, nature, but being diversification an already undergoing process attention must be paid to the underlying motivation and decision-making processes involved. This study analyses subjacent motivations and contexts that lead to the potential incorporation of cocoa crops in present-day Nicaraguan coffee farms. In order to achieve that, three main motivations were identified: climatic, economic and governmental. An econometric analyse was performed over the variables that affect farmers' motivations and decisions, in order first to analyse this decision-making process, and second, to understand how social and climatic evolution over the next decades will impact the context under which agricultural output is shaped. It was found that climatic perspectives are most closely affecting the smallholders' decision of incorporating cocoa plantations into their farms. Therefore, climate change will most certainly have a major role in the reshaping of agricultural structure in most of Nicaraguan geography. Moreover, results show a lower impact of market conditions and public subsidies over farmers' choices and decisions. These results favour the intuition that risk-reduction is a preferred strategy among Nicaraguan smallholders.","[Quiroga, Sonia; Suarez, Cristina; Martinez-Juarez, Pablo] Univ Alcala, Alcala De Henares, Spain; [Diego Solis, Juan] Univ Nacl Autonoma Nicaragua Leon, Leon, Nicaragua",Universidad de Alcala; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Nicaragua - Leon,"Quiroga, S (通讯作者)，Univ Alcala, Alcala De Henares, Spain.",,"Suarez, Cristina/O-1688-2017; Alvarez, Juan Diego Solis/AAW-3320-2020; Quiroga, Sonia/ABH-6577-2020","Alvarez, Juan Diego Solis/0000-0003-0251-0701;",,,,,24,0,0,0,4,INTL INST SOCIAL & ECONOMIC SCI,PRAGUE,"TREBESOVSKA 2038/14, PRAGUE, 193 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87927-32-8,,,,2017,,,,,,,311,326,,10.20472/EFC.2017.007.020,0.0,,,16,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6MP,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426854900020,0

Drawing on the model with essential heterogeneity, it offers a list of scenarios describing the behavioural patterns which informal workers follow. The list nests not only classical patterns of a rationed formal sector versus an integrated labour market, but also different patterns of rationing. Using non-parametric techniques and data from a few African economies with different levels of development, the paper proposes empirical case studies fitting various informality schemes. Developing economies show disparate patterns of allocation of workers and various patterns of rationing.","[Radchenko, Natalia] Amer Univ, Dept Econ, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW,Kreeger 104, Washington, DC 20016 USA",American University,"Radchenko, N (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, Dept Econ, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW,Kreeger 104, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",nataliar@american.edu,,,National Science Foundation [BCS-1039497],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Computing resources used for this work are provided by the American University High Performance Computing System, which is funded in part by the National Science Foundation (BCS-1039497); see www.american.edu/cas/hpc for information on the system and its uses.",,31,12,15,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

At present, countries are gradually returning to the pre-crisis performance. Research on economic growth and country productivity has been one of the most popular topic in economics for decades. Indeed, many researchers analysed empirically the patterns of the economic growth in the world. The purpose of this survey is to find out if it is true that our three CEE countries (Slovakia, Slovenia and the Czech Republic) have achieved their economic growth in the same way - in the sense that economic growth has the character of extensive growth or intensive growth. Reason for such an argument is a fact that selected countries have many common characteristics that predetermines them to resemble in the characteristic of economic growth. To verify this, we chose the growth accounting: dual approach. Verification was carried out in two periods, for each country: the pre-crisis (1994-2007) and the crisis and the post-crisis period (2008-2016). We conclude that only in one country (CR) it is possible to talk about the predominantly intense nature of economic growth throughout the whole period. The nature of the economic growth of the remaining two countries was mixed, with periods of rather extensive growth and periods of rather intense growth.","[Raisova, Manuela; Kolvekova, Gabriela] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Econ Theories, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Raisová, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Econ Theories, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia.",gabriela.kolvekova@tuke.sk; gabriela.kolvekova@tuke.sk,"Raisova, Manuela/AAG-1414-2019; Kolvekova, Gabriela/C-3881-2018","Raisova, Manuela/0000-0003-3393-7492;","VEGA [1/0994/15, 1/0961/16]; Ministry of Education",VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)); Ministry of Education,This paper was written in connection with scientific project VEGA no. 1/0994/15 and VEGA no. 1/0961/16.

This paper adds to recent literature analyzing the effects of input subsidy programs and gender on crop diversification in Sub-Saharan Africa. We investigate the effect of Zambia's input subsidy program on crop allocation patterns by gender. In relatively land abundant Zambia, we test both single-equation crop diversification index models and multivariate regression models of cropland allocation. Our study finds that input subsidies reduce crop diversification more in male-headed households than in female-headed households. Further, multivariate regression results confirm that this occurs because female-headed households expand maize acreage less in response to the input subsidy. These findings suggest that greater cropland diversification will be maintained if input subsidy programs are accompanied by loan programs and other assistance which support leadership roles for women in farm households.

States not paying actuarially required contributions for reasons other than fiscal stress explains an additional quarter of underfunding.

Thus the company should use various channels and tools to demonstrate attractiveness and benefits to prospective employees'. It should show the uniqueness of the firm and distinguish from competitors and draw employees to that company. Employer branding is very often divided into external branding and internal branding.

Using a household fixed-effects estimation, I test whether parental education spending is affected by child mathematics test scores. I find that parents are more sensitive to the human capital of younger children, who are penalised for having lower skills than their older siblings. Differences in investment by child gender or birth order are evident in 2000 but not in 1997. This suggests that parents may have an efficiency investment strategy only when resource-constrained, and that education of younger children may be a luxury good.

Perbedaan dalam investasi berdasarkan jenis kelamin atau urutan kelahiran nampak terbukti di tahun 2000 namun tidak di tahun 1997.

Findings indicate the valid inter-relation among components of brand equity, namely brand association, perceived quality and brand loyalty.

It also defined a new legal form of NGOs - institutions that are together with public benefit corporations suitable for the provision of welfare services. The content of this paper includes a characterization of the institutions under the Civil Code and the definition of their duties in relation to the disclosure of mandatory information required by the legislation. For the purposes of this paper, a database of 50 institutions which were newly formed in 2014 or transformed from other legal forms was created. Based on the analysis of the database, this papers aims to evaluate the degree of transparency of the institutions towards the public from the point of disclosing information about the organization's mission, access to current data on organization and organizational documents (founding legal proceedings, statute), providing information about its economic state and other donors on their website. According to the Civil Code and the law on public registers of natural and legal persons, the institutions have an obligation to file some of the above mentioned documents in the collection of documents of the public register; the non-fulfillment of this obligation can be sanctioned.","[Urbancova, Alzbeta; Kryskova, Sarka] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Urbancová, A (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",alzbeta.urbancova@vsb.cz; sarka.kryskova@vsb.cz,"Kryšková, Šárka/G-3391-2018; Urbancová, Alžběta/G-3570-2018","Kryšková, Šárka/0000-0001-5138-9253; Urbancová, Alžběta/0000-0001-9614-2991",,,,,6,0,0,0,3,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",2336-1239,,978-80-210-8448-3,CURR TREND PUB SECT,,,2017,,,,,,,130,137,,,,,,8,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BH7FG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402427100016,0

In response to modern economic, geographic and political challenges, the study of entrepreneurship has become an urgent issue due to the possible use of its feature: flexibility with regard to market changes and innovations. The efficient performance of entrepreneurship depends on combination of the following factors: climatic, geographical, cultural, historical, administrative, and technological. Thus, on the one hand, the entrepreneurial potential at the regional level is the sum of all opportunities and measures available in a specific region at a certain period of time. On the other hand, the growth of entrepreneurial potential in the regions relies on the quantitative and qualitative development of the small and medium enterprises. Therefore, the entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial potential of the region are interdependent categories that determine the existence of each other. The opportunities available in the region for the activities of small and medium businesses promote its efficiency, which in turn forms the entrepreneurial potential of the region. There is an increasing trend in the number of small and medium enterprises in the servile sector of economy in Russia nowadays, which impedes the development of the real sector. The reasons of this trend include the methodology used to assess the entrepreneurial potential in the regions. Thus, this study considers that the entrepreneurial potential should be assessed from the perspective of the possibilities of small and medium enterprises in the real sector of economy. The subject of research is the entrepreneurship as a socio-economic phenomenon and the entrepreneurial potential in the territories. The objective of work is to apply the developed grouping of statistical indicators that allow describing the subject of research at the most informative level. The methodological tools of the work rely on the application of methods of statistical and cause-effect analysis.

The equity division reform can eliminate some difference of circulation advantage between the two shares in the stock market, so as to make the stock market more internationalized. At the same time, reform can affect the interests of investors and bring benefits to them, so that more people will have confidence in the market and be more willing to participate in the market.

This paper evaluates macroeconomic stability in a new Keynesian open economy in which agents experience both cognitive limitations and asset market volatility. The (im)perfect credibility of various monetary policies (e.g., a Taylor-type rule with-or without asset price targeting, strict domestic inflation targeting, strict CPI inflation targeting, and exchange rate peg) may lead agents to react according to their expectation rules, and thus create various degrees of booms and busts in output and inflation. Simulations confirm that a Taylor type CPI inflation targeting including an asset price target is the best choice. In contrast, the business cycles induced by Keynesian animal spirits are enhanced by strict inflation targeting. Furthermore, a credible exchange rate pegging system with an international reserve pooling arrangement can improve social welfare and stability in an open economy, even though its absolute value of the loss function is slightly lower than a Taylor-type CPI inflation targeting including an asset price target.

In recent years, the growing population aging increases the risk of pension payment in China. The Chinese government needs to use financial resources to subsidize it every year. But the problem of insufficient pension insurance has not been properly resolved. Then, more and more provinces'pension insurance appear to be unbalance, and the gap between the pension payment capacity of each province is expanding. This kind of regional disparity has hindered the improvement of the overall level of pension in China. Based on this, the paper makes a quantitative analysis to comprehensively show the difference of pension payment ability at the provincial level, and explores the factors that affect the unbalanced development of the pension in each region, which is of great significance for the sustainable development of the national pension. This paper selects urban workers' pension insurance fund as the research object, which include 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities except for Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, and analyses the differences of pension insurance affordability in different province through empirical research. The paper combine the quantitative analysis with the actual situation in China to put forward the policy recommendations of sustainable development of the basic pension insurance. First of all, using the provincial panel data of 2011-2015 in China, then establish threshold regression model of pension gap in China. It proved that the population structure have double threshold effects on the payment capacity of China's pension insurance. In areas with poor and good economic development, population aging has a negative impact on the sustainable development of basic pensions. On the contrary, in the middle economic development area, population aging is positively related to the balance of basic pensions, but this effect is not significant. Next, Through the estimation of the coefficient of control variables in the model, it is found that the wages of the workers in the town are raised, the replacement rate of the old - age insurance is increased, and the system support rate is not conducive to the sustainable development of the basic pension. The increase in the capital ratio of state-owned enterprises compared to foreign and Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan enterprises and private enterprises, and the increase in wages of state-owned enterprises will help the basic pension to achieve sustainable development. Finally, the paper puts forward some policy suggestions about how to slove the shortage of China's pension and the unblanced pension payment capacity between provinces. The innovation of this paper: Threshold regression model is established based on Provincial Panel Data, the paper divide the provinces of China into different levels, it analyses the impact of different factors on the ability of sustainable payment of pension insurance in different regions by specific way. and it also give clear direction for the province's reasonable management of pension income and expenditure.","[Zhang Yiwen] Beijing Technol & Bussiness Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China",Beijing Technology & Business University,"Zhang, YW (通讯作者)，Beijing Technol & Bussiness Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China.",m18636053935@163.com,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,7,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,,,,,2017,,,,,,,834,851,,,,,,18,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK8HD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000442810700057,0

Identified by researchers anomalies are manifested by excessive or delayed reaction of investors to the price changes and provided information. Understanding the schemes and motives that are used by individual investors on the capital market allow researchers to better characterize the decision-making process and it's determinants. Knowledge about the behavioral inclinations can be used to predict and simulate the behavior of investors on the capital market in the future. The aim of this chapter is to determine the strength and direction of the impact of the behavioral factors on the investors decision-making process on the capital market. The main hypothesis assumes that psychological factors, like behavioral inclinations in preferences and opinion area, have a significant impact on the investor behavior on the capital market, changing their risk tolerance and acceptable rate of return. The first part of chapter presents the principles of construction structural equation models (SEM) and methods of their verification. The second section includes a detailed description of the questionnaire used in the survey and analysis of the results. In the last part behavioral factors characterizing the investors in the Polish capital market, like risk tolerance, inclinations in the opinions and preferences area have been identified. Additionally to verify hypotheses one structural equation model have been specified, estimated, analyzed in subgroup and interpreted.","[Zurek, Miroslawa] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Strzegowska 7, PL-85373 Bydgoszcz, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Zurek, M (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Strzegowska 7, PL-85373 Bydgoszcz, Poland.",mirka.zurek@gmail.com,,,,,,,36,0,0,2,6,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-62938-4; 978-3-319-62937-7,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,131,157,,10.1007/978-3-319-62938-4_9,0.0,,,27,"Economics; Psychology, Multidisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Psychology,BK3HF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000435015000009,0

Consistent with expectations, behaviours appeared related to preference for change, the costs of regulatory change relative to those of lobbying, and the need for reputational capital. Industry participants, and those from the Representative and Professional bodies emerge as key opponents. Industry presented in a conciliatory manner during the first phase, revealing a preference for the status quo, but then directly targeted specific recommendations of concern, notably the 'two strike' and 'no vacancy' rules in the second phase. Respondents from the Representative and Professional Bodies were broadly and consistently supportive of change and the Inquiry's final recommendations. We also find that these recommendations largely align with the views of the Representative Bodies, but conflict with those expressed by Industry in their second phase submissions.

As a result, concerned commentators suggested that the rising international demand for quinoa, which tripled prices, might have substantially harmed Peruvian quinoa consumers. We study the impacts of rising quinoa prices on the welfare of Peruvian households. Our analysis suggests these fears are unwarranted. A descriptive analysis shows that quinoa is a small part (<1%) of the average household's budget share for the roughly 30% of households that consume quinoa. Our econometric analysis generally finds that as quinoa prices rose, welfare increased in regions with higher concentrations of quinoa consumers. Specifically, we use 11 years of a large-scale, nationally representative household survey to construct pseudo-panels at three geographic (district, province, and department) levels to look at the relationship between the international price of quinoa and the value of real household consumption, our proxy for household welfare. We find for the two smaller geographic regions (i.e., districts and provinces) higher concentrations of quinoa consumption or production are associated with a small and statistically significant increase in household welfare in response to quinoa price increases; in the largest regions (i.e., departments), higher concentrations of quinoa consumption or production are associated with small declines in welfare of less than 1% of total household consumption. Our findings that the international trade of quinoa has not been harmful to household welfare in Peru thus run counter to some of the myths surrounding quinoa. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Prior work shows that competition increases the costs of debt and equity, which reduce the economic profit from investment. Capital constraints, however, may prevent firms from exploiting all positive NPV projects. Using unique survey data and several econometric techniques, we address endogeneity problems that affect both capital constraints and rivals' competitive activities. We find that rivals' competitive activities are positively associated with firms' capital constraints and are more strongly correlated with capital constraints than banking sector competition. We also show that quantity-of-capital constraints are negatively related to firm growth, incremental to the cost of capital. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Using hand-collected data on business microcredits from a Microfinance Institution (MFI), we provide an indirect measure of entrepreneurial success through loan repayment performance. Controlling for the endogeneity of entrepreneurial motivation in a bivariate probit model, we find that necessity entrepreneurs are more likely to have difficulty repaying their microcredits than opportunity entrepreneurs. However, type of motivation does not appear to make a difference to business survival. We test for the robustness of our results using parametric duration models and show that necessity entrepreneurs experience difficulties in loan repayment earlier than their opportunity counterparts, corroborating our initial findings. Our results are also robust to a sharper analysis of motivation, focusing on unemployment (on the necessity side) and non-pecuniary benefits from success (on the opportunity side).","[Bourles, Renaud] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, EHESS, Cent Marseille,AMSE, 38 Rue Frederic Joliot Curie, F-13451 Marseille 20, France; [Cozarenco, Anastasia] Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier Res Management, 2300 Ave Moulins, F-34185 Montpellier 4, France; [Cozarenco, Anastasia] CERMi, 2300 Ave Moulins, F-34185 Montpellier 4, France",Aix-Marseille Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Montpellier Business School,"Bourlès, R (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, EHESS, Cent Marseille,AMSE, 38 Rue Frederic Joliot Curie, F-13451 Marseille 20, France.",renaud.bourles@centrale-marseille.fr; a.cozarenco@montpellier-bs.com,"Bourlès, Renaud/AAJ-3766-2020","Bourlès, Renaud/0000-0001-9537-1258","LabEx Entrepreneurship (University of Montpellier, France); French government","LabEx Entrepreneurship (University of Montpellier, France); French government","Anastasia Cozarenco benefited from LabEx Entrepreneurship (University of Montpellier, France) funding.

The Sustainable Development Goals now offer an opportunity to re-examine this complex relationship in a globalized world. Drawing on major research evidence and key debates, this review article proposes a framework of mobility equity as part of SDG 10, which foresees the reduction of inequalities within and among countries by 2030. The main question addressed is how forms of social, human and digital mobility, including migration, can contribute to reduced inequalities and positive development outcomes. The reviewed research underpins the need for an approach that prioritizes equality of opportunity over equality of outcomes. Mobility equity offers such an approach and rests on two main foundations: people's equal capacity and freedom to be mobile in empowering ways, and the equal and inclusive regulation of mobility in all its forms, including human, social and digital mobility. The approach goes beyond income inequality and migrants' remittances to incorporate the differential mobility capacities among people in different contexts. This includes categorically excluded groups such as refugees, racialized minorities, and lower castes, but also tens of millions of workers in the global digital economy. As part of a special issue on new SDG Perspectives, the article provides new ideas for thinking about research and policy-making within the wider inequality-mobility nexus of global development.

The likely solutions to these challenges-such as the transition to clean energy systems-will require yet more innovation. This article presents five policy proposals that would support more innovation of the environmentally beneficial kind and less innovation of the environmentally harmful kind. We argue that the appropriate portfolio of innovation policies for protecting global environmental systems should include pricing natural capital; providing and targeting research and development (R&D) support towards environmentally beneficial innovations, based on the evidence acquired through more rigorous experimental designs; providing early-stage deployment subsidies for environmentally friendly technologies in particular circumstances; supporting collaborative R&D to leverage complementary capabilities in various types of organizations; and reducing barriers to private sector environmental finance. Policies in these five areas could help redirect innovation towards environmentally friendly economic activities.","[Hepburn, Cameron] Univ Oxford, Smith Sch Enterprise & Environm, Eagle House,Walton Well Rd, Oxford OX2 6ED, England; [Hepburn, Cameron; Pless, Jacquelyn] Univ Oxford, Oxford Martin Sch, Inst New Econ Thinking, Eagle House,Walton Well Rd, Oxford OX2 6ED, England; [Hepburn, Cameron] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst UK, London, England; [Pless, Jacquelyn] Syracuse Univ, Maxwell Sch, Ctr Policy Res, 426 Eggers Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Popp, David] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Syracuse University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Hepburn, C (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Smith Sch Enterprise & Environm, Eagle House,Walton Well Rd, Oxford OX2 6ED, England.;Hepburn, C (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford Martin Sch, Inst New Econ Thinking, Eagle House,Walton Well Rd, Oxford OX2 6ED, England.;Hepburn, C (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst UK, London, England.",cameron.hepburn@new.ox.ac.uk; jacquelyn.pless@inet.ox.ac.uk; dcpopp@maxwell.syr.edu,,"Hepburn, Cameron/0000-0003-0467-7441",Partners for a New Economy (P4NE); Oxford Martin School,Partners for a New Economy (P4NE); Oxford Martin School,We express our gratitude to Frank Convery for encouraging us to pursue this paper and to Suzanne Leonard for her patience.

I construct a hedonic time dummy price index and track changes over short time periods in order to inspect interruptions and turning-points. To control for seasonal effects, I compare price differences in 2008 with differences in years before and after. The evidence shows the existence of a pronounced house price index turn-around immediately after the monetary policy reversal was initiated. Plausible transmission mechanisms are established. Alternative exogenous causal factors are ruled out or appear implausible. An endogenous explanation is shown to be unlikely.

Rents could induce firms to lobby or bribe governments to preserve the status quo; on the other hand, rents may promote growth by giving firms the needed funds to make investments in fixed capital or research and development. To test this question empirically, we use a panel of manufacturing data at the industry-country-year level, and measure rents by the mark-up ratio. We find that the relationship between rents and growth is strongly negative, with the results being primarily driven by the poorer countries (or those with worse institutions) in the sample. This result holds when we instrument for mark-up using the average mark-up in other industries in the country. Even in industries with high external financing needs and countries with less developed financial sectors, precisely the places where excess profits could be used to drive growth, we find that rents are especially harmful. Consistent with the rent-seeking mechanism we highlight, we find that high rents are associated with a slower reduction in tariffs. We also test for the most likely alternative mechanism, that higher rents cause slower growth through the channel of allowing managerial slack. We find that controlling for management has little impact on our estimate of the impact of mark-up on productivity growth. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we challenge this view. We set up a life-cycle model of human aging and longevity in which individuals discount the future hyperbolically and make time-consistent decisions. This allows us to disentangle the role of discounting from the time consistency issue. We show that hyperbolically discounting individuals, under a reasonable normalization, invest more in their health than they would if they had a constant rate of time preference. Using a calibrated life-cycle model of human aging, we predict that the average U.S. American lives about 4 years longer with hyperbolic discounting than he would if he had applied a constant discount rate. The reason is that, under hyperbolic discounting, experiences in old age receive a relatively high weight in life time utility. In an extension we show that the introduction of health-dependent survival probability motivates an increasing discount rate for the elderly and, in the aggregate, a u-shaped pattern of the discount rate with respect to age.","[Strulik, Holger] Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Trimborn, Timo] Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Stat & Math Methods Econ, Wiedner Hauptstr 8-105-3, A-1040 Vienna, Austria",University of Gottingen; Technische Universitat Wien,"Strulik, H (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",holger.strulik@wiwi.uni-goettingen.de; timo.trimborn@tuwien.ac.at,,"Trimborn, Timo/0000-0001-8749-7176; Strulik, Holger/0000-0002-5615-2412",,,,,67,12,12,0,11,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0167-4870,1872-7719,,J ECON PSYCHOL,J.

One frequent comparison has been between metropolitan regions in Canada and the United States given their similar contexts but differing modal shares. However, past studies have produced inconsistent findings with respect to how Canadian and American metropolitan regions can be distinguished with respect to population densities and freeways. In response to methodological concerns with past research, this paper measures population densities and freeways in the 57 North American metropolitan regions with at least one million residents. Two spatial scales (metropolitan region and central core) are used to measure overall density, population-weighted average census tract density, and density of the top 5% of the population. These same spatial scales are also used to measure the absolute and per capita quantities of freeway lanes. The paper provides methodological explanations using Los Angeles and Vancouver as examples. While Canada's metropolitan regions are commonly portrayed as denser and less auto-oriented than their US counterparts, the six largest of Canada's metropolitan regions do not have population higher densities and fewer freeways than all of the 51 largest US metropolitan regions. Indeed, this generalization holds only when individual results are combined to produce national averages, as there are numerous US metropolitan regions that have density and freeways in the same range as Canada's metropolitan regions. The paper discusses some of the differences and recommends approaches for future comparative research into the causes of variation in transport and land use.","[Townsend, Craig; Ellis-Young, Margaret] Concordia Univ, Dept Geog Planning & Environm, 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd W,H1255-35, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada",Concordia University - Canada,"Townsend, C (通讯作者)，Concordia Univ, Dept Geog Planning & Environm, 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd W,H1255-35, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada.",craig.townsend@concordia.ca,,"Townsend, Craig/0000-0002-1411-5197",,,,,27,2,3,0,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

And yet, constitutional restrictions are often perceived to be in tension with democratic commitments. I argue that the constitutional political economy approach developed by Nobel Laureate James Buchanan resolves the tension between constitutionalism and the values of democratic governance by shifting the analysis from a system-attributes perspective that focuses on the particular institutional properties of a political order to a system-legitimacy perspective that focuses on the manner in which political institutions gain democratic legitimacy. In so doing, the approach reveals that constitutionalism can be understood as a natural expression of democratic values.","[Vanberg, Georg] Duke Univ, Polit Sci & Law, Durham, NC 27710 USA",,"Vanberg, G (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Polit Sci & Law, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",georg.vanberg@duke.edu,,,,,,,39,10,10,0,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,DEC,2018,177.0,3-4,,,SI,,199,216,,10.1007/s11127-018-0570-0,0.0,,,18,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,GW2IX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000446708000002,0

Understanding the nature, trend and impact of these factors on government revenue is one of the questions that still remain unsolved. The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of global oil prices, militancy and terrorism on government revenue in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach The study focusses on the state-failure and frustration-aggression hypotheses to explain the nature and trend of armed conflicts in Nigeria. The autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model is used to examine the effect of global oil prices, militancy and terrorism on government revenue. Findings The study reveals that crude oil price, terrorism and militancy have significant negative effect on government revenue in short- and long-run Nigeria. Evidence from the study therefore supports the theory that macroeconomic fluctuation is largely determined by endogenous and exogenous factors in Nigeria. Research limitations/implications In view of this review, future studies should empirically analyse the interactive impact of militancy, terrorism and global oil prices on government expenditure or a combination of government revenue and expenditure. Originality/value The study provides evidence on the role of internal and external factors on macroeconomic fluctuation, and recommended appropriate suite of policies that could mitigate external and internal vulnerabilities, especially during upsurge in armed conflicts.","[Afangideh, Udoma Johnson; Ujunwa, Augustine] Cent Bank Nigeria, Dept Monetary Policy, Abuja, Nigeria; [Ukemenam, Angela Ifeanyi] Univ Nigeria, Dept Banking & Finance, Enugu, Nigeria",Central Bank of Nigeria; University of Nigeria,"Ujunwa, A (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Nigeria, Dept Monetary Policy, Abuja, Nigeria.",udomaj@yahoo.com; austinesilver@yahoo.com; angela.ukemenam@gmail.com,"Ukemenam, Angela/AAL-9689-2020",,,,,,42,6,7,1,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Findings The study finds support for the assertion that listed firms face less severe corporate control problems and lower financing constraints, and thus, have lower investment cash flow sensitivities. The study also finds that a significant positive sensitivity of investment to internal funds is associated with firms that have high debt holdings. Practical implications An implication of this study is that firms with high debt holdings face greater challenges in accessing external finance. These firms are likely to experience under-investment which at a macro level would translate into lower investments and economic growth for the country. Originality/value Empirical literature document that in the presence of market imperfections, investments of financially constrained firms become sensitive to the availability of internal finance. There are also contradictory evidences regarding the pattern of the observed investment cash flow sensitivity.

J,"Akolaa, AA",,,,"Akolaa, Andrews Adugudaa",,,Foreign market entry through acquisition and firm financial performance Empirical evidence from Ghana,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING MARKETS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Market entry; Firm performance,ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; DIRECT-INVESTMENT; IMPACT; PRODUCTIVITY; OWNERSHIP; LIABILITY; SURVIVAL; BENEFIT; GROWTH; WATER,"Purpose The international market entry strategy by acquisition is one of the critical options for success in international business. The decision to acquire a local firm is expected to impact the post-entry financial performance of the local firm as the acquirers come with proprietary advantages to improve the overall performance of the acquired company. The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the post-acquisition financial performance of acquired foreign subsidiaries and comparable unacquired local firms in Ghana to determine the effect of foreign acquisition on the financial performance of the local subsidiaries. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative approach was adopted in this study. A sample of 100 locally acquired and non-acquired firms were studied using purposive and convenience sampling method. The research adopted the propensity score matching and the differences in difference methodologies to determine the returns on assets (ROA) of non-acquired local firms and acquired foreign subsidiaries are compared one year pre-acquisition t(1) to two years post-acquisition t(2). Findings The results demonstrate a higher post-acquisition financial performance of locally acquired foreign subsidiaries in relation to their local counterparts in Ghana. Firms with pre-acquisition modernized ownership structures performed better than state-owned firms and firms with high pre-acquisition absorptive capacity outperformed firms with lower pre-acquisition absorptive capacity. The results also indicate that ROA for acquired local firms in the year of acquisition drops in relation to the year prior to acquisition Research limitations/implications A major limitation of this research is that the relative capability of the parent companies and experience in the transfer of knowledge to the acquired local subsidiaries was not considered. The real impact of the various multinationals would have revealed how the capability and competencies of the different parent companies whose subsidiaries this study considered in the paper make a difference in their performance. The study did not also consider the value of parent company participation in the local management of the acquired subsidiaries. Whereas some acquired firms had parent company staff participating in the local management, others did not have same, thus challenging the performance results without any control of this variable. The other limitation of this research is the fact that it did not also consider the experience of the parent company as a factor that can influence the performance of the subsidiary. The more experienced the parent company is in engaging foreign markets, the more likely the support for the subsidiary will result in higher performance as parent company brings previous learnings. Another limitation of this study is that it measures the financials only (ROA) and hence does not provide a 360 degrees assessment of the subsidiary performance, which includes the operational and overall subsidiary effectiveness. This research has not empirically examined all aspects of foreign acquisitions in Ghana and thus has many aspects for future exploration that other researchers may focus on. The paper has not considered the experience and capability of the parent company to transfer technology, innovation and all the advantages of multinationals to the post-acquisition performance of subsidiaries. More experienced multinationals are most likely to transfer knowledge faster to subsidiaries than less experienced ones, thus likely to show better performance post-acquisition than the less experienced ones. The effect of this phenomenon has not been considered in this study. Parent company participation in the local management of the subsidiary can also make a difference in the post-acquisition performance equation but this has not been considered in this research. Some parent companies actively participate in the local subsidiary management as management support for the subsidiary. This might have some effect on the subsidiary post-acquisition performance but this study does consider this. Other researchers may want to look into this factor. Future researchers may also assess the differences in performance of subsidiaries that are wholly owned and partial owned in Ghana. The performance of Greenfield joint ventures and local firm acquisitions can also be studied. Practical implications Findings of this research has implications for firms using acquisition as foreign market entry strategy to inform the choice of local partners to select for acquisitions as pre-acquisition ownership structure and absorptive capacity of local Ghanaian firms impact post-acquisitions performance. Ghanaian firms also seeking to attract foreign investments into their businesses will also find the results useful as they organize to meet prospective acquirers' expectations, for example, building their human capacity and ownership structures, developing export and ensuring debt rations to attract potential acquirers. Originality/value Acquisitions as an international market entry strategy continue to gain grounds with lots of research in the area. However, there is scanty research on post-acquisition financial performance, especially in the developing country context, and this paper fills that yawning knowledge gap by comparing acquired and non-acquired local firms in Ghana to determine if foreign acquisitions lead to better ROA.","[Akolaa, Andrews Adugudaa] Univ Profess Studies Accra, Dept Mkt, Accra, Ghana",,"Akolaa, AA (通讯作者)，Univ Profess Studies Accra, Dept Mkt, Accra, Ghana.",andrews.akolaa@upsamail.edu.gh,,,,,,,49,10,10,2,26,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

In India, the corporate ownership model is Promoter-dominated shareholder model wherein companies have global operations. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the EM practices of corporate enterprises in India about multi-nationality, reputation and related determinants. Design/methodology/approach The present study employs DeAngelo model for calculating discretionary accruals for detecting EM. Multi-nationality, reputation and related determinants are measured as accounting indices. The statistical tools applied for testing the accuracy of results include correlation and regression analysis, t-test and descriptive statistics, like arithmetic mean, median and standard deviation. Findings The results show that multi-nationality is the driving force for EM and significantly affects the accounting choices of management in the sample units. The firm's reputation and other related determinants, except size, vary with accruals. The earnings behavior of the corporate is influenced by other factors, like growth and leverage as well. Research limitations/implications A total of 12 units out of top 25 units, taken for the study, met the sampling requirements. So, the present study is confined to 12 profit-making private listed companies in India. These companies constitute a significant size of BSE's market capitalization for completeness of data; still the size and diversity of units can be extended for further study. The period in the study is of five years (2003-2004 to 2007-2008) to find the effects of global recession on EM practices in India. Researchers may like to select a different time-period based on their objective. Practical implications The study draws new dimensions about the quality of financial reporting in case of global firms and with high-perceived reputation. The findings are of significance to standard setters and regulators, particularly for emerging economies, like India where companies have international operations. They are equally important for other companies that are based in economies with relatively mature corporate governance mechanisms because of common regulatory focal points. Social implications It brings out the importance of financial reporting process of global corporations for shareholders' value creation. It is likely to enrich the knowledge and understanding of the EM phenomenon in developing economies like India. Originality/value It is an original paper, which highlights the EM motivation about multi-nationality, reputation and related variables in Indian corporate.","[Goel, Sandeep] Management Dev Inst, Dept Accounting & Finance, Gurugram, India",Management Development Institute (MDI),"Goel, S (通讯作者)，Management Dev Inst, Dept Accounting & Finance, Gurugram, India.",sandeepgoel18@rediffmail.com,"Goel, Sandeep/JYQ-5017-2024","Goel, Sandeep/0000-0002-0911-8975",,,,,56,8,8,1,18,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Design/methodology/approach Utilizing samples of 208 USA and 194 Indian consumers, hypotheses examining the underlying beliefs, attitudes, social norms and purchasing intentions regarding pioneer brands are developed and tested using structural equation modeling. Findings Insights from the study suggest the TRA provides a means for assessing behaviorally-based FMAs across cultures, even as manifestations of purchase intentions differ significantly. According to the TRA and findings of this study, intentions are a function of overall attitudes and social norms. In the USA, individual attitudes were found to play a more significant role than social norms in formulating purchase intention. In India, social norms played a more dominant role in intention formation. Originality/value The study represents one of the first empirical attempts to shed light on the extent of behaviorally-based FMAs in an EM and how manifestations of intention to purchase the pioneer differ from mature markets. The study expands the behavioral paradigm of analysis to include one of the most sought-after EMs today (India) and provides one of the first empirical studies to utilize the TRA in addressing behaviorally-based FMAs.","[Mady, Tarek] Univ Prince Edward Isl, Sch Business, Charlottetown, PE, Canada",University of Prince Edward Island,"Mady, T (通讯作者)，Univ Prince Edward Isl, Sch Business, Charlottetown, PE, Canada.",tmady@upei.ca,,,,,,,145,4,4,0,19,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Design/methodology/approach Using the BankScope Database as well as bank-level balance sheet and financial statements data, the authors use one-step system GMM dynamic model to examine and compare the association between oil and gas prices changes with bank deposits in Qatar. The authors also test hypotheses of direct and indirect impacts of oil and gas prices changes on bank deposits. Findings The results indicate that oil and gas prices changes have a direct impact on deposits of banks at the aggregate level in Qatar. However, the authors find that oil and gas price changes significantly affect deposits of Qatari commercial banks directly prompting enhanced lending by banks and the consequent business activities in the economy, while their impact on the deposits of Qatari Islamic banks is indirect, i.e. the impact is permeated through the macroeconomic and institutional characteristics of the country that are reinforced by the growing expectations and commercial sentiment of the country. The authors find that significant association between oil price changes and deposit growth during the global financial crisis 2008 has been distorted. However, the authors find that there was a sharp rise in the deposits of Islamic banks during the period of global financial crisis. Practical implications The results of this study necessitate policy measures that can counter the effects of changes in oil and gas prices on the effectiveness of bank deposits. Originality/value It is widely recognized that oil and gas prices and the level of production are of great importance to the economic development of oil and gas exporting countries. So far, however, no econometric study has been reported in the literature which analyses and compares the impact of oil and gas prices changes on bank deposits of commercial and Islamic banks and also at the aggregate level in any of the oil-exporting economies. Thus, this study provides the first empirical evidence on distinct direct and indirect channels through which oil and gas prices changes may affect bank deposits.","[Saif-Alyousfi, Abdulazeez Y.

Design/methodology/approach This paper examines the effectiveness of bank lending channel using generalized method of moments GMM model during the period from 1996 to 2014. Also, it uses stochastic frontier approach (SFA) to examine the bank efficiency in Egypt. Findings This study supports the relevance of the BLC using panel data. Moreover, applying SFA, this paper computes cost efficiency taking account of both time and country effects directly. The finding suggests that banks with low inflation and high GDP tend to perform more efficiently. Research limitations/implications The limitation of the study is examining one country only. Practical implications The finding signals that the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) should adjust interest rate in order to stabilize the bank loan supply. Social implications It is important for the CBE and Egyptian banks because it highlights the importance of BLC. Originality/value It examines one channel of monetary policy and bank efficiency in Egypt.","[Shokr, Mohamed Aseel] Tanta Univ, Sch Econ, Fac Commerce, Tanta, Egypt; [Al-Gasaymeh, Anwar] Appl Sci Private Univ, Amman, Jordan",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Tanta University,"Shokr, MA (通讯作者)，Tanta Univ, Sch Econ, Fac Commerce, Tanta, Egypt.",m_aseel1975@yahoo.com; gasaymeh@yahoo.com,,,,,,,86,9,9,1,9,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

However, there is very limited literature examining how economic growth impacts tourism, an impact which is usually tacitly accepted, without being analytically investigated. In this paper we examine the impact of the economic growth on the number of international tourism arrivals and also on the international tourism receipts during 1995-2015, in Central and Eastern European economies, by using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model. The bounds F-statistics for cointegration test provide evidence of a long-term relationship between the international tourism number of arrivals and GDP per capita only for Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Romania and Slovakia. Between international tourism receipts and GDP per capita we find a long-term relationship only for Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovakia, Latvia, Estonia, Poland, Romania and Czech Republic. We also explore causal relationship between the variables by using an error-correction-based Granger causality model (short-run and long-run), finding different unidirectional / bidirectional short/long-term relationships between international tourism demand (measured by two proxies: international tourist arrivals and international tourism receipts) and economic growth (measured by GDP per capita), in different countries. The paper contributes to better understanding the nature and the direction of the relationship between tourism sector and economic growth, aiming not only to enrich the literature in the field, but also to design specific economic growth policies with an impact on tourism sector.","[Badulescu, Alina; Badulescu, Daniel; Simut, Ramona] Univ Oradea, Oradea, Romania",University of Oradea,"Badulescu, A (通讯作者)，Univ Oradea, Oradea, Romania.",abadulescu@uoradea.ro,"Badulescu, Daniel/O-4877-2017; Badulescu, Alina/AAC-4228-2020; Badulescu, Alina/B-6477-2015; Simut, Ramona/AAN-4689-2020","Badulescu, Daniel/0000-0001-8653-0149; Badulescu, Alina/0000-0002-0090-9340; Simut, Ramona/0000-0003-1673-3586",,,,,42,10,10,1,27,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2018,20.0,,,,12,,935,950,,10.24818/EA/2018/S12/935,0.0,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GY5HR,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448604700008,0

We find that the probability of paying dividend and dividend payout ratio is lower for firms in the highest-emitting industries (polluters) relative to non-polluters, subsequent to ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. While the post-Kyoto reduction in the likelihood of paying dividend is not significantly different, the reduction in payout ratio is smaller in the imputation environment than classical tax system, highlighting the significance of imputation tax environment only on the impact of carbon risk on dividend payout rather than decision to pay. We further document that the post-Kyoto reduction in dividend payout of polluters is driven by their relative increase in earnings uncertainty. The evidence suggests a causal influence of carbon risk on firm dividend policy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Firms appointing a disciplinary director subsequently exhibit lower idiosyncratic risk, leverage, and R&D expense, make fewer acquisitions, and are more likely to replace poorly performing CEOs.

This paper seeks to identify the possible sources of the decline using a simple search-and-matching model with two types of workers, experienced and inexperienced, where the former type faces a risk of skill loss during unemployment. The calibrated model suggests that a higher risk of skill loss during unemployment results in a lower job separation rate, because workers accept lower wages in exchange for job security.

Drawing on data from the World Health Organization for 62 countries, covering the period 2000-2014, we explore whether economic (risk of expropriation) and health (complete cause of death registries) institutions explain mortality rates and access to healthcare. To identify this relationship, we use settler mortality and the distance of the capital from the nearest major port - factors associated with institutional arrangements - to explain cross-national variation in health outcomes and the universality of health systems. We find that inclusive institutions arrangements - that protect and acknowledge the rights of citizens - are associated with better health outcomes (e.g. lower infant mortality and lower maternal mortality) as well as with better health systems (e.g. more skilled birth attendance and greater immunization). Inclusive institutions not only foster economic growth but improve health and well-being too. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Under plausible conditions, capital accumulation raises the marginal product of labor and hence the female wage rate. Unless the economy is trapped in a lower equilibrium, the fertility rate starts to decline at a certain level of the female wage rate and then turns upward at a higher wage level, presenting a fertility rebound. For such fertility rebounds to appear without policy intervention, the availability of external child care at high female wage rates is crucially important. The external child-care price must be lower at high female wage rates. Otherwise the fertility rate might continue to decline.","[Yakita, Akira] Nanzan Univ, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan",,"Yakita, A (通讯作者)，Nanzan Univ, Fac Econ, Showa Ku, 18 Yamasato Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4668673, Japan.",yakita@nanzan-u.ac.jp,,,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI [16H03635]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16H03635] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI, Grant/Award Number: 16H03635",,24,14,15,4,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

What is less understood is the role of fertilizer in industry at this time. This paper details superphosphate fertilizer, part of a class of chemical fertilizers that emerged in the metropoles from the 1870s, and its role in the transformations in world agriculture as well as in industry. Superphosphate fertilizer was not just for the soil. The manufacture of superphosphates also provided a base for the growth of chemical industries. This growth was constitutive of industrial transformations in imperial statesthe second industrial revolutionin which mass production units became integrated through a handful of chemicals. One of these chemicals is sulphuric acid, of which superphosphates require large amounts in their manufacture. As the main market for sulphuric acid through the interwar period, superphosphate manufacturing created synergies with other industries and thus made sulphuric acid cheaper. By connecting the manufacturing centres of fertilizer to the multiple farming regions undergoing accelerated commodity production, this study shows that the first food regime and the second industrial revolution were mutually constitutive moments to explain transformations in agriculture and the state system in the long 19th century.","[Dixon, Marion W.] Amer Univ, Sch Int Serv, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA",American University,"Dixon, MW (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, Sch Int Serv, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",mdixon@american.edu,,,,,,,86,12,16,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

At the same time, numerous theoretical arguments suggest that small-scale farmers are politically weak. Smallholders are commonly believed to comprise a particularly vulnerable group, which has only little influence on the pace and the direction of the ongoing restructuring. One may wonder, however, whether smallholders are able to affect the paths of agrarian development once they solve collective action problem and attain political office. In this paper, we try to improve our understanding in this respect by analysing smallholders in Poland. Our findings suggest that in municipalities in which smallholders had access to political offices, the rate of smallholders' exits from farming was significantly lower than elsewhere.","[Falkowski, Jan] Univ Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Falkowski, J (通讯作者)，Uniwersytet Warszawski, Wydzial Nauk Ekon, Dluga 44-50, PL-00241 Warsaw, Poland.",jfalkowski@wne.uw.edu.pl,"Fałkowski, Jan/ABE-9726-2020","Fałkowski, Jan/0000-0001-6921-6342",Narodowe Centrum Nauki (Polish National Science Centre) [2013/09/D/HS4/01038],Narodowe Centrum Nauki (Polish National Science Centre),"Narodowe Centrum Nauki (Polish National Science Centre), Grant/Award Number: 2013/09/D/HS4/01038",,59,10,10,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Scholars have investigated this aid-migration nexus, but results have been mixed and questions remain. This paper contributes to the literature by comparing the effects of rural and urban development aid on international migration. Specifically, we hypothesize that while increases in rural development aid to developing countries reduce emigration from those countries, greater urban aid produces the opposite effect - higher rates of emigration. These hypotheses are informed by two theoretical mechanisms. The first mechanism focuses on the divergent preferences of rural and urban populations regarding emigration. Aid targeting these respective populations provides each with resources to follow through on their migratory ambitions, or lack thereof. The second mechanism focuses on contrasting impacts of rural and urban aid on agricultural sector development and the effects of this sort of development on emigration. We analyze cross-national time series data to test our hypotheses regarding rural and urban development aid, finding that countries that receive larger amounts of rural development aid have lower emigration rates. Then we turn to survey data from the Arab Barometer to assess whether the attitudes of survey respondents match our theorized mechanisms. Results from survey data suggest that investments in agricultural sector capacity building will lead to reductions in emigration from developing countries; however, these findings do not indicate that rural and urban populations differ in terms of their desire to emigrate.

Differences in skill drive this performance gap: Antiherding funds make superior investment decisions even on stocks not heavily traded by institutions, and can anticipate the trades of the crowd; furthermore, the herding-antiherding performance gap is persistent, wider when skill is more valuable, and larger among managers with stronger career concerns.","[Jiang, Hao] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Verardo, Michela] London Sch Econ, London, England",Michigan State University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Jiang, H (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",,,,Paul Woolley Centre at the London School of Economics,Paul Woolley Centre at the London School of Economics,"We are grateful for comments from Amil Dasgupta; Dong Lou; Christopher Polk; Lukasz Pomorski; Rene Stulz; Sheridan Titman; Dimitri Vayanos; Paul Woolley; and Kathy Yuan as well as from conference participants at the 2011 IDC Summer Conference, 2012 WFA, and 2015 CFA UK Society; and seminar participants at the Universities of Aarhus, Amsterdam, Arizona, BI Oslo, Cattolica Milan, Cologne, Drexel, Erasmus Rotterdam, ESSEC, IESE Barcelona, Kent, London School of Economics, Lugano, Mannheim, Michigan State, Nottingham, Reading, and Vienna.

Generalized method of moments estimates of conditional multifactor models are provided. The real estate risk is proxied by the return of an investment strategy that is short on low-leverage real estate investment trust (REIT) assets and long on high-leverage REIT assets. We group banks into portfolios based on their market capitalization, real estate loans as a proportion of total assets, and book-to-market ratios. The results suggest that the real estate premium is a relevant risk factor in bank stocks returns. For instance, we find that a 100-basis-point increase to the real estate premium increases returns by 15.8 to 20.1 basis points for portfolios grouped by market capitalization. This conclusion remains when other oft-cited bank risk factors are considered, including small-minus-big, high-minus-low and the return on equity of the financial sector. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

To do this, we employ the convex time budget experimental approach with cash payments over a 20 year time horizon. To date, there are few experimental studies that explore discount rates beyond a 1 year time horizon. Previous experimental studies that focus on short time horizons find high discount rates, which may not be applicable to decisions that affect outcomes in the distant future. Our findings are quite similar to the average rate of 4.9% found by Grijalva et al. (Environ Resour Econ 59:39-63, 2014), who similarly use a 20 year time horizon, but use the multiple price list elicitation method along with payment via government savings bonds. We find annual discounts rates in the range of 1.9-5.5%, depending on the specific model used. We also find evidence for declining discount rates, and that this hyperbolic pattern of behavior is related to the confidence subjects have in receiving distant-future payments.","[Grijalva, Therese C.] Weber State Univ, 3807 Univ Circle, Ogden, UT 84408 USA; [Lusk, Jayson L.] Oklahoma State Univ, 411 Agr Hall, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Rong, Rong] Univ Massachusetts, Stockbridge Hall, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Shaw, W.

This is evidenced by establishing a specific accession process for these countries, including an option of granting the status of potential candidate. The progress, particularly concerning the economic preparedness and competitiveness of the Western Balkan countries, is uneven. This paper compares the readiness of particular Western Balkan countries for EU membership on the basis of accession progress assessment, as well as on the basis of international economic position assessment. Taking into account official progress reports published by the European Commission providing a comprehensive assessment of the EU membership criteria, we broaden the perspective of the economic progress assessment by employing the assessment of the international economic positions of the Western Balkan countries based on multifactor indicators. For this purpose, we developed our own composite index of international involvement. We then compared the assessment based on our own index with assessments based on both the Global Competitiveness Index and the Index of Economic Freedom. Based on our findings, the best international economic positions among the Western Balkan countries belong to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) and Montenegro. Therefore, it may be concluded that accession progress is accompanied by an adequate fit of these economies represented by their international economic position. Contrary to that, Serbia belongs among the worst assessed Western Balkan countries despite its advanced accession progress.","[Kittova, Zuzana; Steinhauser, Dusan] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Commerce, Dept Int Trade, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Kittova, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Commerce, Dept Int Trade, Bratislava, Slovakia.",zuzana.kittova@euba.sk; dusan.steinbauser@euba.sk,"Steinhauser, Dušan/ABC-5539-2020; Kittová, Zuzana/JED-2991-2023","Steinhauser, Dušan/0000-0003-0708-9020;",VEGA project [1/0897/17],VEGA project(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),"This paper is a result of scientific research conducted at the Faculty of Commerce, University of Economics in Bratislava, within the framework of the VEGA project No. 1/0897/17 (responsible researcher: prof.

This continuing disagreement can be explained in significant part by problems associated with low-quality government revenue data: it has undermined the robustness of many existing findings, while leading other researchers to rely on alternative measures of resource income as their primary explanatory variable - a highly imperfect measures of the underlying relationship of interest. We re-examine the relationship between taxation, non-tax revenue and democracy by employing dramatically improved data developed specifically for this research. We find the strongest evidence to date of a political resource curse, and provide evidence about the specific details of the underlying relationship: (i) natural resource wealth is anti-democratic, rather than merely stabilizing; (ii) it is driven primarily by changes in the composition of government revenue; (iii) it is best understood as a long-term relationship, rather than short-term changes in resource wealth being quickly translated into major political changes; and (iv) it is driven primarily by oil wealth, rather than mineral wealth, because governments are comparatively effective at translating oil wealth into the government revenues that drive the political resource curse.

General scientific methods of scientific knowledge and research of economic phenomena are used for the scientific solution. The theoretical and methodological bases of the research are the works of scientists and practitioners involved in researching the market of agricultural insurance services in general and the issues of developing an effective system of agrarian insurance, in particular. The main method of research is the method of mathematical statistics, namely, a multivariate analysis of variance. This article presents research on the application of index insurance schemes while using weather index products. The advantages and disadvantages of these products are considered and the mechanism of the index insurance is described in general. The article considers the possibility of applying a rainfall index with a temperature threshold, and the thermal-hydraulic index (Ith) that takes into account and simultaneously combines several parameters is calculated.

We elicit perceptions of baseline cancer risk and control efficacy and combine these with subject-specific cancer risks predicted by the Harvard Cancer Risk Index to develop measures of baseline and control optimism. Following Fang, Keane, and Silverman (), we hypothesize that a variable may lead to advantageous selection if it is positively correlated with both prevention effort and demand for insurance. We find evidence of selection from both baseline and control optimism, but little evidence of selection from cognitive ability and risk aversion. We then estimate a model that allows us to classify subjects according to their excess risk-reducing effort and excess insurance uptake that occurs solely because of baseline and control optimism. We find subjects who overinsure relative to a subject with accurate risk beliefs are likely to have lower expected treatment costs, ceteris paribus.

I study the effect of introducing two idealist candidates to the model who are non-strategic (i.e., fixed to their policy platforms), while allowing for an unlimited number of strategic candidates. Doing so, I show that equilibrium is restored for a non-degenerate set of unimodal distributions. In addition, the equilibria have the following features: (1) the left-most and right-most candidates (i.e., extremists) are idealists; (2) strategic candidates never share their policy platforms, which instead are spread out across the policy space; and (3) if more than one strategic candidate enters, the distribution of voter preferences must be asymmetric.

In accordance to this, we test whether: (i) domain specific CSR portfolios present pricing anomalies that could be captured by the introduction of risk factors accounting for exposition to stakeholder risk, (ii) this risk source is priced in the cross-section of stock returns. In doing so we are particularly cautious in disentangling the contributions of different CSR domains in generating the pricing anomalies. Our findings show the existence of pricing anomalies related to CSR, which vary in numbers across all the domains under analysis.

Additionally, our results show that the stakeholder risk is priced in the cross-section of returns, and that such additional risk source presents different premiums for each domain.

Along Ghana's Offin River, recent mining activities have irreversibly transformed the landscape and lives of local people. Cocoa farms, subsistence crops, forest, and other land-uses have been cleared, with significant implications for livelihoods and food security. Rivers and streams were rerouted into mining sites to wash sediment, impacting hydrology, including water quality. Abandoned pits now stretch for kilometers and pose everyday hazards to community members. While minerals law reserves small-scale mining as a right for Ghanaian citizens, both foreigners and Ghanaians control and mine concessions, reflecting complicated land-grabbing processes in the sector. Combining geospatial, ethnographic and quantitative methodological approaches with long-term international collaboration, this article examines the spatial and socio-environmental dimensions of small-scale gold mining. We employed remote sensing techniques, underutilized in land-grabbing research, to assess mining-mediated land-use changes along a portion of the Offin River. The total extent of mining increased 2,772.6 percent to 998.23 hectares between 2008 and 2013; mine water increased by 13,000 percent to cover 200 hectares. We argue these extensive land-use conversions are enabled through Ghana's contradictory and gendered land tenure systems. While scholars often characterize land deals as occurring through theft and dispossession, we found miners' access land through ad hoc negotiations before mining, compensation following crop destruction and outright dispossession. We detail the diverse actors and practices mediating informal land markets, and the uneven implications for people positioned within social and structural hierarchies, particularly women and strangers. Our research troubles small-scale categorizations and discursive representations of mining, and urges land-grabbing researchers to examine prolific smaller deals alongside transactions involving thousands of hectares.

This paper builds on the longer experience in the United States to offer lessons for Asia. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services has introduced several pay-for-performance programs since 2012 to encourage hospitals to improve quality of care and reduce costs. Some state Medicaid programs have also introduced pay-for-performance for nursing homes. Long-term care providers play an important role in hospital pay-for-performance programs because they can affect the readmission rate and also total episode payments. A good pay-for-performance program will focus on improving quality of care that affects health outcomes. In addition, that quality must vary across providers and be measurable. Furthermore, it is important that the measures be reported in a timely way, that both demand and supply respond to the measures, and that the measures be risk adjusted. Empirical data from Medicare beneficiaries in the state of Michigan show that mean episode payments and readmission rates in skilled nursing facilities vary widely and are sensitive to the number of observations. These practical matters create challenges for implementing pay-for-performance in practice. There is an extensive literature review of pay-for-performance in long-term care in the United States and in Asia.","[Norton, Edward C.] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Norton, Edward C.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Norton, EC (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Dept Hlth Management & Policy, M3108 SPH 2,1415 Washington Hts, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;Norton, EC (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, M3108 SPH 2,1415 Washington Hts, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",ecnorton@umich.edu,"Norton, Edward C/B-2211-2009; , Edward/AAQ-1719-2021",", Edward/0000-0003-4555-0631",Michigan Value Collaborative; Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan,Michigan Value Collaborative; Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan,Michigan Value Collaborative; Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan,,29,3,3,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Called the Strengthening Civic Participation, the program supported civil society organizations advocating for local issues and trained district government officials to increase responsiveness to citizens. Our evaluation uses a stratified random assignment design, whereby districts were matched on baseline characteristics and randomly assigned to either a treatment or a control group. Using nationally representative household-level survey data, we find a pattern of small negative effects on citizens' perceived access to government information, perceived personal influence on government officials, and satisfaction with government services. There were no discernible impacts on citizens' awareness of government meetings, familiarity with government officials, or knowledge of local government affairs. We investigate the underlying mechanisms that produced these impacts using qualitative interviews and find that the program succeeded in encouraging citizens to question local government policies more openly in some circumstances.

We find that the Mexican program's costs are substantial: up to US$130 per vehicle per year, which represents 1%-2% of drivers' annual income and implies total costs of US$617 million per year.

It provides a theoretical and empirical analysis of the role of agricultural productivity in structural transformation in the labor market in small towns and the surrounding rural areas. The empirical work is based on a general equilibrium model that formalizes the demand and labor market linkages: the small-town draws labor away from the rural areas to produce goods and services whose demand may depend largely on rural income. The theory clarifies the role played by the income elasticity of demand and the elasticity of wage with respect to productivity increase in agriculture. For productivity growth to lead to a demand effect, the wage elasticity has to be lower than a threshold. When the demand for goods and services produced in small towns comes mainly from the adjacent rural areas, the demand effect can outweigh the negative wage effect and lead to higher employment in the town-goods sector. The empirical analysis finds a significant positive effect of higher rainfall on rice yield and wages. Using rainfall shocks as a source of exogenous variation, we provide instrumental variables estimates of the effects of agricultural productivity on agricultural wages. The increase in wages is larger in the rural sample compared with the small town economy sample, but structural change in employment is more pronounced in the small town economy. In the rural sample, the positive employment effect is observed only in small-scale manufacturing and services. In contrast, a positive productivity shock in small towns sample has large and positive effect on employment in large scale manufacturing and services (construction, transport, education, and health). Agricultural productivity growth induces structural transformation within the services sector in small towns, with employment in skilled services growing at a faster pace than that in low skilled services.

We ask whether there exists an optimal firm size for which leverage is not negatively related to firm performance. Accordingly, with a panel data of 101 listed firms in Nigeria between 2003 and 2007, we explore whether the ultimate effect of leverage on firm performance is contingent on firm size, that is, whether the type of impact that leverage has on the performance of a firm is dependent on the size of the firm. Our results show that the negative effect of leverage on firm performance is most eminent and significant for small-sized firms and that the evidence of a negative effect diminishes as a firm grows, eventually vanishing when firm size exceeds its estimated threshold level. We find that this result continues to hold, irrespective of the debt ratios utilized In line with earlier studies, our results show that the effect of leverage on Tobin's Q is positive for Nigeria's listed firms However, our new finding is the evidence that the strength of the positive relationship depends on the size of the firm and is mostly higher for small-sized firms.","[Ibhagui, Oyakhilome W.] Univ Kent, Keynes Coll, Sch Econ, Canterbury, Kent, England; [Olokoyo, Felicia O.] Covenant Univ, Dept Finance, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria",University of Kent; Covenant University,"Ibhagui, OW (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Keynes Coll, Sch Econ, Canterbury, Kent, England.",wallace@aims.ac.za; felicia.olokoyo@covenantuniversity.edu.ng,"Olokoyo, Felicia O./M-8193-2013",,,,,,28,112,115,6,60,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1062-9408,1879-0860,,N AM J ECON FINANC,N.

The production cost is funded by tolls charged by each country to those citizens who are using the public good. The bilateral agreement can be based on two alternatives: (i) a non-cooperative agreement and (ii) a cooperative agreement. Both alternatives have the same constraint of the status-quo i.e. at least half of the citizens must be satisfied with the agreement so that ruling party can ensure that it can be re-elected under the pair wise voting rule. In this setup, we find that the non-cooperative agreement is dominant over the cooperative agreement in terms of welfare. Later, we drop the status quo constraint from the cooperative agreement and find that (a) under symmetric benefit case (i.e. where both countries have the same level of benefit from a public good), the non-cooperative agreement is weakly dominant over the cooperative agreement in terms of welfare; and (b) under the asymmetric benefit case the complete cooperation is not possible. Finally, we show that, under certain conditions, the welfare of the Nash Bargaining Solution (NBS) is equivalent to the welfare of non-cooperative agreement with the status-quo. Furthermore, although the welfare of NBS is higher under asymmetric expected benefits, it is possible that one ruling party loses its majority votes as the majority are not satisfied with the bilateral agreement. Therefore, ex-post, it is possible that one country will renege on such a cooperative agreement.","[Nabin, Munirul H.; Sgro, Pasquale M.] Deakin Univ, Deakin Business Sch, Dept Econ, Geelong, Vic, Australia",Deakin University,"Sgro, PM (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Deakin Business Sch, Dept Econ, Geelong, Vic, Australia.",sgro@deakin.edu.au,"Sgro, Pasquale M/C-7629-2013",,Hong Kong RGC-IDS project [UGC/IDS13/16],Hong Kong RGC-IDS project,"This paper was presented at the Chu Hai Conference, Recent Advances in International Trade and Finance, on December 14-15, 2017 at Hong Kong.

The problem is embedded in a continuous-time model with both hidden action and hidden information, where the principal must induce the agent to exert effort to facilitate her learning process. The value of committing to a deadline is examined in this environment, and factors which make the deadline more profitable are identified. Our framework generates a unique recursive equilibrium structure under no commitment which can be exploited to obtain a full characterization of the unique pure-strategy equilibrium. The analysis allows us to evaluate the exact value of commitment for any given set of parameters and provides insight into when it is beneficial to commit to an evaluation deadline at the outset of a relationship.","[Chen, Chia-Hui] Kyoto Univ, Inst Econ Res, Kyoto, Japan; [Ishida, Junichiro] Osaka Univ, Inst Social & Econ Res, Osaka, Japan",Kyoto University; Osaka University,"Chen, CH (通讯作者)，Kyoto Univ, Inst Econ Res, Kyoto, Japan.",chchen@kier.kyoto-u.ac.jp; jishida@iser.osaka-u.ac.jp,,"Ishida, Junichiro/0000-0002-0674-0216","JSPS KAKENHI [16H03615, 17K13699, 15H05728, 20245031, 24530196]; Joint Usage/Research Center for Behavioral Economics at ISER, Osaka University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24530196, 20245031, 16H03615, 17K13699] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Joint Usage/Research Center for Behavioral Economics at ISER, Osaka University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We thank the Editor and two anonymous referees for many helpful comments which vastly improve our manuscript.

We develop a novel market-based metric to analyse the impact of divestitures on financial conglomerate excess value, and our findings point to divestitures having a significant impact on financial conglomerate valuation, contributing to a reduced conglomerate discount. Our results are driven by sales of financial service assets. Selling assets unrelated to the financial sector has no significant effect on conglomerate excess value. These results are robust with the inclusion of multiple control variables and alternative econometric model specifications. Altogether these results cast doubts on the existence of large benefits for financial conglomerates from combining financial service activities.

We aim to examine the relationship between a customer's brand experience and loyalty to the brand, its image and willingness to recommend the brand to others. The paper examines the sample of 476 respondents questioned through the CAWI method - computer assisted web interviewing. A random sampling method was used. All of them are active users of social media tools. Data collection took place during the first half of 2016. We came to interesting findings concerning the existence of presented relationships. It appeared that a customer's brand experience is a crucial factor for the success of a company in the environment of social media. All the relationships presented in this study proved to be significant with a strong. coefficient in all cases of branding experience relation to loyalty, image and willingness to recommend the brand. The findings are subsequently transformed into a set of recommendations that help in setting the right marketing activities of companies in the online environment. There are also implications for the development of strong social media presence.","[Gavurova, Beata] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia; [Bacik, Radovan; Fedorko, Richard; Nastisin, Ludovit] Univ Presov, Fac Management, Konstantinova 16, Presov 08001, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice; University of Presov,"Gavurova, B (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia.",beata.gavurova@tuke.sk; radovan.bacik@unipo.sk; richard.fedorko@unipo.sk; ludovit.nastisin@unipo.sk,"Nastišin, Ľudovít/D-1331-2018; Fedorko, Richard/C-9553-2018; Bacik, Radovan/C-7920-2018; Gavurová, Beáta/N-9159-2018","Nastišin, Ľudovít/0000-0002-4403-7580; Fedorko, Richard/0000-0003-3520-1921; Bacik, Radovan/0000-0002-5780-3838; Gavurová, Beáta/0000-0002-0606-879X","VEGA [1/0806/16, 1/0789/17]",VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This article is a partial output from the scientific research grant VEGA 1/0806/16 Research on issues of consumer behaviour of a new generation of customers with emphasis on identifying preferences and usability of mobile platforms in the process of e-commerce of the subjects localized predominantly on the Central European Market and VEGA 1/0789/17 Research of e-commerce with relation to dominant marketing practices and important characteristics of consumer behaviour while using mobile device platforms.,,21,39,41,1,22,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

Therefore, it is commonly believed that stock markets are expected to have a significant effect on CO2 emissions. However, it is not known whether these stock markets can contribute to more or less CO2 emissions. Hence, the goal of this study is to examine the impact of stock market indicators on CO2 emissions across a global panel of both developed and emerging market economies. The results establish that stock market indicators have a significant negative and positive impact on carbon emissions in developed and emerging market economies, respectively. Furthermore, the findings illustrate the presence of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis, implying that stronger stock markets lead to a further decline in carbon emissions. Given these findings, the study argues that the role of stock markets in the abatement of CO2 emissions significantly varies across both developed and emerging market economies. Significant implications have to do with the fact that developed markets might have initiated effective policies on listed firms to minimize carbon emissions, while emerging markets are yet to achieve this.

Exploiting the case of a German water withdrawal regulation that is managed on the state level, we analyze firms' reactions to an increase in the water tax using a regression-adjusted difference-in-differences approach. We analyze the individual firm's response to a change in environmental regulation, distinguishing between add-on and integrated environmental investments. This allows us to include innovation diffusion into our analysis, which is likely to be of importance for increasing resource-efficiency. Our results show that the regulation in question shows no sign of affecting firms' overall competitiveness. The results imply that the predicted negative impact of the regulation on firms' economic performance that was brought up before the introduction of the tax, does not seem to weigh heavily in this case. Nevertheless, when placed into a sustainable competitiveness context, the regulation considered does not qualify as an appropriate policy tool for fostering green growth.","[Stoever, Jana] Hamburg Inst Int Econ, Heimhuder Str 71, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany; [Stoever, Jana] Hamburg Univ, Hamburg, Germany; [Weche, John P.] Monopolies Commiss, Heilsbachstr 16, D-53123 Bonn, Germany; [Weche, John P.] Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Luneburg, Germany",University of Hamburg; Leuphana University Luneburg,"Stoever, J (通讯作者)，Hamburg Inst Int Econ, Heimhuder Str 71, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany.;Stoever, J (通讯作者)，Hamburg Univ, Hamburg, Germany.",stoever@hwwi.org; john.weche@monopolkommission.bund.de,,,Kompetenzzentrum Nachhaltige Universitat at Hamburg University,Kompetenzzentrum Nachhaltige Universitat at Hamburg University,"The authors would like to thank Joachim Wagner, Uwe Rentmeister, Klaus Thoms, Wolfgang Ast, Sarah Weche and staff of the Research Data Center Berlin-Brandenburg for processing the do-files and ensuring no violation of secrecy.

During both periods, the USD-BTC exchange rate rose by an average of four percent on days when suspicious trades took place, compared to a slight decline on days without suspicious activity. Based on rigorous analysis with extensive robustness checks, the paper demonstrates that the suspicious trading activity likely caused the unprecedented spike in the USD-BTC exchange rate in late 2013, when the rate jumped from around $150 to more than $1,000 in two months.

(2014). To study an emerging market such as the Taiwan options market, whose major players are retail investors, we take into consideration the retail participation rate and the trading distribution across moneyness, in addition to factors such as option market depth, liquidity, and investors' trading purposes, as discussed in Holowczak et al. (2014). Retail investors, who are generally less well-informed, have traded mainly nearby TXO options with expirations of less than one month. Therefore, the weights of nearby contracts should be reduced. Furthermore, both institutions and retail investors have traded more at near the-money TXO options, and consequently the weights of in-the-money options and out-of-the-money options should be discounted to accommodate the uneven option trading across moneyness. In addition, we find that there is a dichotomy in the information roles of out-of-the-money options: the information content of their trades is higher (lower) when market volatility increases (decreases). Based on this finding, we establish a VDC-adjusted put-call ratio which increases (decreases) the weight of out-of-the-money options when the market VIX is larger (smaller) than its previous average level. Our model, as revised for an emerging market such as the Taiwan options market, has outperformed in explaining contemporaneous price changes and has shown very good predictive ability for large downside market moves.","[Lin, William T.] Shandong Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, 40 Shungeng Rd, Jinan 250014, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Tsai, Shih-Chuan] Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Coll Management, Grad Inst Management, 162,Sect 1,Heping East Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Zheng, Zhenlong] Xiamen Univ, Sch Management, 422 Siming South Rd, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Qiao, Shuai] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ, 1037 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Lin, William T.] Tamkang Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, 151 Yingzhuan Rd, New Taipei 25137, Taiwan",Shandong University of Finance & Economics; National Taiwan Normal University; Xiamen University; Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Tamkang University,"Tsai, SC (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Coll Management, Grad Inst Management, 162,Sect 1,Heping East Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",yungshuncn@hotmail.com; chuant@ntnu.edu.tw; zlzheng@xmu.edu.cn; qiaoshuaiwelcomeyou@hotmail.com,"ZHENG, Zhenlong/AAA-4014-2019","ZHENG, Zhenlong/0000-0001-6415-092X","Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan [MOST102-2410-H-003-025]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71371161, 71471155]","Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))",Shih-Chuan Tsai would like to acknowledge the financial support from the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan (grant # MOST102-2410-H-003-025).

To be specific, we use a random matching within sample technique to collect data on social networks and to elicit details of the relationships and information exchange between network members. We find that shared kinship or membership in certain groups, informal forms of mutual insurance, and having frequent meetings with network members are all associated with a higher probability of forming an information link with a network member. Furthermore, we find evidence for a statistically significant and positive relationship between networks and the adoption of row-planting as well as yields for both male and female networks. However, the evidence for an inverse U-shaped relationship of social learning, that is, between the number of adopters in the network and the adoption of row-planting, is strongest for female networks. Our results, thus, suggest that extension services and other programs that promote agricultural innovations and seek yield improvement can benefit from social networks but that their success depends on identifying the right networks, such as those of female household members in the case of row-planting.

We document a secular decrease in the speed of adjustment (SOA) in cash holdings, particularly for financially constrained firms with cash deficits, suggesting that capital market frictions can account for the trend in the value of cash holdings.","[Bates, Thomas W.] Arizona State Univ, Carey Sch Business, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Chang, Ching-Hung] Natl Taiwan Univ, Coll Management, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chi, Jianxin Daniel] Univ Nevada, Las Vegas Lee Business School, Reno, NV 89557 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; National Taiwan University; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno,"Chi, JD (通讯作者)，Univ Nevada, Las Vegas Lee Business School, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",thomas.bates@asu.edu; chinghungc@ntu.edu.tw; daniel.chi@unlv.edu,"Bates, Thomas/GZG-5460-2022",,Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China [71731003],Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Chang gratefully acknowledges financial support from Minister of Science and Technology of Taiwan.

In societies where the norm is to not expect future support from daughters, parents may invest even less in the health and human capital of girls. In India, as in other patriarchal societies, the eldest son occupies a special position as the potential head of the extended family and is expected to assume responsibility for parents' welfare in their old age. In this paper, I explore intra-household differences in educational expenditure and enrollment for children by gender and birth order. Using child level data from the nationally representative India Human Development Survey-II (2011-12), I confirm the presence of a pro-male bias and an additional preference for the eldest son. In families with more children and greater competition for resources within the household, the pro-male bias falls and the bias in favor of the eldest son is greater. Parents in the higher income bracket, who are also less likely to be dependent on their children, discriminate less in favor of the eldest son. As expected, pro-male bias is highest in the north, central and eastern zones of the country. The north-eastern zone exhibits the lowest levels of intra household discrimination based on gender. Finally, I find evidence suggesting reverse discrimination, i.e. discrimination against sons, in the state of Meghalaya which follows a rare matrilineal system where the youngest daughter takes over as the head of the household.

Our analytical framework considers that a super-spreader simultaneously excels at borrowing and lending central bank's liquidity for the whole network, as measured by financial institutions' hub centrality and authority centrality, respectively. Evidence suggests that the Colombian interbank funds market exhibits an inhomogeneous and hierarchical network structure, akin to a core periphery organization, in which a few financial institutions fulfill the role of central bank's liquidity super spreaders. Our results concur with evidence from other interbank markets and other financial networks regarding the flaws of traditional direct financial contagion models based on homogeneous and non-hierarchical networks. Also, concurrent with literature on lending relationships in interbank markets, we confirm that the probability of being a super-spreader is mainly determined by financial institutions' size, but leverage and lending concentration as well.

Theory suggests that renegotiation trades off the benefits of enhanced monitoring with the costs of creditor intervention. Consistent with this tradeoff, I show that monitoring demand proxies bear a positive association with renegotiation intensity. In contrast, the costs of creditor intervention are associated with less frequent renegotiations. I also find that contractual monitoring mechanisms, such as covenants and concentrated syndicate structures, are positively related to renegotiation intensity. Furthermore, renegotiations transmit new information to the market, in line with private creditors discovering information during renegotiations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

From November 2010 to September 2011, a one standard deviation increase in the cheapness of a Treasury bond (how much the market price of the bond is below a model-implied value) increases the Fed's purchase quantity of that bond by 276 million and increases the auction costs on that bond by 2.6 cents per $100 par value, controlling for standard covariates.

One crucial condition for monetary aggregates to be a sound instrument is the stability of income velocity. Recently, inflation targeting has been adopted as an alternative monetary policy framework in various developing countries. This study attempts to examine how inflation targeting relates to the variability of income velocity and its components across 84 developing countries during the period from 1990 to 2013. The results suggest that inflation targeting would help stabilize income velocity in developing countries. In addition, a decomposition analysis of income velocity generally shows that inflation targeting would reduce the volatilities of inflation, real output growth, and money growth. Our results provide empirical support for the argument that stable income velocity associated with inflation targeting could improve the effectiveness of monetarism, such that monetary aggregates can serve as an appropriate instrument under inflation targeting regime in developing countries.","[Than Than Soe; Kakinaka, Makoto] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Int Dev & Cooperat, 1-5-1 Kagamiyama, Higashihiroshima, Hiroshima 7398529, Japan",Hiroshima University,"Soe, TT (通讯作者)，Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Int Dev & Cooperat, 1-5-1 Kagamiyama, Higashihiroshima, Hiroshima 7398529, Japan.",thanthansoe@hiroshima-u.ac.jp; kakinaka@hiroshima-u.ac.jp,"Kakinaka, Makoto/O-2150-2015","Kakinaka, Makoto/0000-0003-2349-1976",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K03366] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,49,1,1,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1062-9408,1879-0860,,N AM J ECON FINANC,N.

Critics argue that community has become a buzzword devoid of content or a mechanism of neoliberal governmentality. This article revisits these approaches to community mobilization, using ethnographic data from a context in which community mobilization has met with wide acclaim: HIV prevention programs in India. Focusing on how the concept of community is used in everyday practice reveals its multivalence and flexibility. I show that, for many planners and administrators of HIV prevention programs, community mobilization is a strategy for placing responsibility for HIV prevention onto groups at risk, but, for those groups, it also has two alternative usages: as the basis for making collective demands, and as a code word for membership in a subversive sexual category. These latter two uses undergird the formation of communities that make new demands on the state. While scholars tend to characterize community mobilization programs in terms of their intent, as either mostly empowering or mostly a mechanism of domination, this article shifts the focus to how the concept of community is used, demonstrating its multiple usages within the same program. I show that groups bring to bear on the concept of community not only abstracted NGO concepts, but also a history of using community in India as a political category of membership. Rather than rejecting or celebrating the concept of community, this article uses ethnography to show how community is put to use and given meaning through everyday struggles for control and survival.

One-stop shopping preferences create demand complementarities' among otherwise independent products which lead to two opposing effects on upstream merger incentives: first a standard double mark-up problem and second a bargaining effect. The former creates merger incentives while the later induces suppliers to bargain separately. When buyer power becomes large enough, then suppliers stay separated which raises final good prices. We also show that our result can be obtained when wholesale prices are determined in a non-cooperative game and under two-part tariffs.","[Baye, Irina; Wey, Christian] Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, DICE, Univ Str 1, Dusseldorf, Germany; [von Schlippenbach, Vanessa] DIW, Mohrenstr 58, Berlin, Germany",Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Baye, I (通讯作者)，Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, DICE, Univ Str 1, Dusseldorf, Germany.",baye@dice.hhu.de; vschlippenbach@diw.de; wey@dice.hhu.de,"Wey, Christian/GNP-5568-2022",,German Science Foundation; German Science Foundation [FOR 986],German Science Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); German Science Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We thank Pio Baake, Stehane Caprice, Claude Crampes, Paul Heidhues, and Patrick Rey, as well as participants at EEA (Milan, 2008), EARIE (Toulouse, 2008), IDEI-INRA Conference on Industrial Organization and the Food Processing Industry (Toulouse, 2010), and Royal Economic Society (London, 2011) for their very helpful comments.

In particular, the model predicts that corruption negatively affects the stock of international investment in the host country. In addition, the model predicts that growth should be impaired by the uncertainty caused by corruption. Bribes, unlike taxes, involve unpredictable distortion in the discretionary and uncertain use of the government power. This results in additional costs to businesses and alongside with resources allocated to unproductive activities impose an extra burden on the economy. We test empirically the predictions of the theory using a sample of 142 countries for the period 1994-2014 and GMM methods. Using indicators of control of corruption from the World Bank, the lack of corruption is found to have a positive and statistically significant effect on the growth rate of real per capital GDP and increased the investment ratio. Hence, the empirical results suggest that corruption directly hinders economic growth by hampering investment. The estimated effects are robust to changes in specifications and estimation methods. Thus, it can be concluded that richer countries with better access to international financing should be growing faster and be less prone to the adverse effects of corruption than the emerging economies.

In recursive estimation, we find that all the developed markets obey the Cubic Law of the Stock Returns, while most of the emerging countries exhibit heavier tail with a tail index lower than 3 at 95% significance level. In rolling estimation, the tail index in the developed markets does not stabilise around 3, and after 2008 financial crisis, all the developed markets and most emerging ones suffer a drop in the tail index. For individual stocks, the tail distributions of stock returns, trading volume, and the number of trades in each emerging country behave quite differently from the theoretical model by Gabaix et al.

With the increasing use of performance-based compensation packages and tax law favoring such compensation design, a natural question arises as to whether workers do indeed perform for pay. We examine this question in a setting that is not fraught with the typical measurement and identification problems found in many pay performance settings. Specifically, we examine changes in a NFL player's Win Probability Added (WPA) and Expected Points Added (EPA) in response to his compensation-contract design. Overall, our paper provides evidence that players do indeed perform for (properly designed) pay, and has important implications for future work on compensation and incentive-based contract design.

This new testing procedure is particularly suitable when the number of assets N is much larger than the number of observations T, and outperforms the existing methods by admitting the covariance matrix of the idiosyncratic term to be non-sparse. Under some mild conditions, we show theoretically that the test statistic is asymptotically normal as long as min {N, T} goes to infinity. The finite sample performance is investigated by extensive Monte Carlo experiments. The practical utility of the new testing procedure is further justified by treating the U.S. stock market. Employing this new testing procedure, we found that the Fama-French (FF) three-factor model (Fama and French, 1993) is better than the capital asset pricing model (Sharpe, 1964) in explaining the mean-variance efficiency of the U.S. stock market.","[Lan, Wei] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Stat Sch, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Feng, Long] Nankai Univ, Stat Sch, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Luo, Ronghua] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Nankai University; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Luo, RH (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",ronghua@swufe.edu.cn,,,,,,,27,3,4,3,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1479-8409,1479-8417,,J FINANC ECONOMET,J.

Preferential procurement programs, which include government set-asides and commercial supplier diversity initiatives, are intended to aid these entrepreneurs in overcoming this barrier. Although the first programs resulted in minimal improvements due to design flaws and poor oversight, some recent initiatives have been redesigned to address these inadequacies. Using a qualitative approach, we examine the impact of these programs on product market access and present a conceptual model of their effect on the opportunity identification, evaluation, and exploitation of Black and Hispanic entrepreneurs. Our analysis suggests that preferential procurement programs may expand product market access by improving the information available to entrepreneurs and by altering the incentives of key resource providers. As a result, these programs may actually enable some minority entrepreneurs to achieve rapid expansion (high-growth entrepreneurs) and others to overcome personal limitations and establish viable enterprises (lower growth entrepreneurs) by leveraging their minority status.","[Shelton, Lois M.] Calif State Univ Northridge, David Nazarian Coll Business & Econ, Northridge, CA 91330 USA; [Minniti, Maria] Syracuse Univ, Whitman Sch Management, Syracuse, NY USA; [Minniti, Maria] Aalto Univ, Aalto Dept Management Studies, Helsinki, Finland",California State University System; California State University Northridge; Syracuse University; Aalto University,"Shelton, LM (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Northridge, David Nazarian Coll Business & Econ, Northridge, CA 91330 USA.",lois.shelton@csun.edu,"Lund, Marianne B/JDW-4293-2023",,,,,,48,25,32,2,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

In this paper, we focus on young firms doing business in industries that compete for customers in geographically dispersed markets (traded industries). We examine whether regional concentrations (localization) of related industrial firms moderate the effects of founder team industry and start-up experience on firm survival. The study draws on firm-level data from the Kauffman Firm Survey and on county business patterns data from the US Census Bureau. We found that localization negatively moderates the positive effects of founder team prior industry experience on firm survival. We did not find significant moderating effects of localization on founder team prior start-up experience. Our findings highlight the importance of accounting for location decisions and cluster effects when evaluating the human capital inputs of founder teams.","[Shu, Cheng; Simmons, Sharon A.] Univ Missouri, Henry W Bloch Sch Management, 5110 Cherry St, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Kansas City,"Shu, C (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Henry W Bloch Sch Management, 5110 Cherry St, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA.",cs833@umkc.edu; simmonsshar@umkc.edu,,,,,,,63,13,17,1,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The yield curve and macro-economic variables were jointly modelled in the dynamic Nelson Siegel model framework and are fitted in the vector auto regressive (VAR) process in a state space framework. The results indicate the existence of a bi-directional relationship between the yield curve and macro factors in the Asian economies. The study found that both the policy rate and the inflation rate influence the short end of the yield curve, reflecting an effective management of the monetary policy. While output growth strongly leads the long term rates in the region, steepening of the yield curve causes increase in Inflation. The depreciation of exchange rates led to increase the level factor in emerging economies and the increase in slope factor appreciated the exchange rates in developed Asian markets.","[Sowmya, Subramaniam] Indian Inst Management, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Prasanna, Krishna] Indian Inst Technol Madras, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Lucknow; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Madras,"Prasanna, K (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol Madras, Dept Management Studies, Madras 600036, Tamil Nadu, India.",pkp@iitm.ac.in,"Prasanna, Krishna/B-2721-2018","Prasanna, Krishna/0000-0002-8678-9617; Subramaniam, Sowmya/0000-0001-5044-3983",,,,,33,2,2,0,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

It is found that although RMB appreciation decreases firm exports, it improves firm profitability. We address several possible channels to explain this counter-intuitive finding, including productivity enhancement, import costs reduction and export structure upgrading. We find that the import costs reduction and export structure upgrading are reasons that RMB appreciation leads to higher firm profitability, but there is no evidence to support the productivity channel. Furthermore, export structure upgrading is primarily based on improving technology in new products rather than changing the export structure of continued products.","[Zhang, Teng] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Secur & Futures, 55 Guanghuacun St, Chengdu 610074, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Ouyang, Puman] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Econ & Management, 55 Guanghuacun St, Chengdu 610074, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Ouyang, PM (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Econ & Management, 55 Guanghuacun St, Chengdu 610074, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",zhangteng@swufe.edu.cn; ouyangpm@swufe.edu.cn,,"OUYANG, PUMAN/0000-0001-8446-7684",,,,,56,11,11,6,36,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

Estimates of the value of water clarity are derived from separate hedonic property value analyses of 14 counties bordering the Bay. The meta-analysis allows us to: (1) estimate the average effect of water clarity in the Chesapeake Bay, (2) investigate heterogeneity of effects across counties based on socioeconomic and ecological factors, (3) evaluate different measures of water clarity used in the original hedonic equations, and (4) transfer the values to Bayfront counties in nearby jurisdictions to estimate the property value impacts of the total maximum daily load (TMDL), a policy to reduce nutrient and sediment pollution entering the Bay that is expected to improve water clarity and ecological health. We also investigate the in-sample and out-of-sample predictive power of different transfer strategies and find that a simpler unit value transfer can outperform more complex function transfers. We estimate that aggregate near-waterfront property values could increase by roughly $400-$700 million in response to water clarity improvements from the TMDL.","[Klemick, Heather; Griffiths, Charles; Guignet, Dennis] US EPA, Natl Ctr Environm Econ, 1200 Penn Ave NW 1809T, Washington, DC 20460 USA; [Walsh, Patrick] Landcare Res, 231 Morrin Rd, Auckland 1072, New Zealand",United States Environmental Protection Agency; Landcare Research - New Zealand,"Klemick, H (通讯作者)，US EPA, Natl Ctr Environm Econ, 1200 Penn Ave NW 1809T, Washington, DC 20460 USA.",klemick.heather@epa.gov,,"Walsh, Patrick/0000-0001-9390-6538; Klemick, Heather/0000-0003-2141-2023",,,,,54,19,21,0,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Empirical evidence from Cambodia,REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"In recent years, an increasing number of regional and bilateral trade agreements have emerged that include provisions on labor standards. The claimed purpose of these labor provisions is to improve working conditions in developing and emerging economies. However, little is known about whether such provisions actually do impact working conditions. This paper conducts an econometric study on the effectiveness of labor provisions in trade agreements. In particular, we evaluate the impact of the 1999 Bilateral Textile Agreement between Cambodia and the United States (CUSBTA) on both the gender wage gap and discrimination. The agreement combined the incentive of higher exports with the obligation of textile manufacturers to comply with international core labor standards, which include the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Using data from the Cambodia Socioeconomic Survey and applying a difference-in-difference estimation, we find a statistically significant reduction of the gender wage gap in the textile sector that can be attributed to the CUSBTA.","[Mourelo, Elva Lopez; Samaan, Daniel] Int Labor Org, Geneva, Switzerland",,"Samaan, D (通讯作者)，ILO, Res Dept, Route Morillons 4, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.",samaan@ilo.org,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Furthermore, the negative association becomes larger in magnitude with higher levels of uncertainty. At extremely high levels of uncertainty a relatively small increase in corruption, equivalent to moving from Sweden to the United States for example, is associated with economically large decreases in economic growth.","[Pavlik, Jamie Bologna] Texas Tech Univ, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Pavlik, JB (通讯作者)，Texas Tech Univ, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Lubbock, TX 79410 USA.",Jamie.Bologna@ttu.edu,,"Bologna Pavlik, Jamie/0000-0003-3888-1758",,,,,51,12,13,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

The goal is to see what can be learned about the drivers of regional political support for and opposition to such measures. Whether at the state, regional or national levels, carbon taxes are one option for reducing greenhouse gas emissions; several state and regional programs are already under way and lowering emissions. This analysis uses a U.S. regional version of the DIEM computable general equilibrium model to explore relationships between carbon taxes, emissions, and economic growth. One area of emphasis is how the distribution of impacts may be affected by differences in regional household spending patterns, the types of industries and electricity generation situated in those regions, and the locations of energy production and energy-intensive manufacturing. The modeling also explores how carbon tax revenues can be used to offset impacts on regional factor earnings.","[Ross, Martin T.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Inst Environm Policy Solut, Durham, NC 27706 USA",Duke University,"Ross, MT (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Nicholas Inst Environm Policy Solut, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",martin.ross@duke.edu,,,Energy Foundation,Energy Foundation,"The work reported here has benefitted from input and feedback from participants in the Stanford Energy Modeling Forum and colleagues at the Nicholas Institute, including Brian Murray and Billy Pizer.

It might be expected that the cooperative preferences exhibited by some agents, which gives rise to cooperation in the finitely repeated SPD, also give rise to turn taking in the finitely repeated MPD. We consider this question theoretically and experimentally. We find experimentally that 50% of participant pairs undertake turn-taking in the finitely repeated MPD. Turn taking continues to the final round for 37.5% of participant pairs, indicating that at least 18% of participant pairs exhibit cooperative preferences. Further, the prevalence of turn taking in the MPD is less than cooperation in the SPD, a finding that is consistent with theoretical predictions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We analyse the way urban social movements (USMs), which play a crucial role in shaping the right to the city, frame their struggles in relation to mobility. We argue that their use of the concept of the 'right to mobility' has two meanings. First, the concept gives USMs a framing discourse to advocate and shape transport policy changes. Second, it enables USMs to bring together different actors with different urban agendas. We base this argument on a study of Rio de Janeiro, a paradigmatic case of mobility-based claims of the right to the city. Looking at the practice of a protest-oriented and a knowledge-oriented USMs that contest the Rio de Janeiro's mobility crisis, we outline an agenda for academics and practitioners willing to work towards the construction of sustainable and just mobilities.","[Verlinghieri, Ersilia] Univ Oxford, Transport Studies Unit, Oxford, England; [Venturini, Federico] Via Viotta 17, I-33100 Udine, Italy",University of Oxford,"Verlinghieri, E (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Transport Studies Unit, Oxford, England.",ersilia.verlinghieri@ouce.ox.ac.uk,"Venturini, Federico/ABG-6708-2021","Venturini, Federico/0000-0002-7625-2218; Verlinghieri, Ersilia/0000-0003-1388-2623",Contested Cities network,Contested Cities network,"We would like to thank the Contested Cities network for financial support during this study.

I study how gender inequality differs across formal and informal wage-earners in urban Brazil. The raw gender wage gap is about the same on average in informal jobs (5%) as in formal jobs (7%), but I show that this difference is the result of different male and female selection processes. First, female employees have better observable characteristics than male employees, for example in terms of educational attainment. After controlling for observable characteristics, the adjusted gender wage gap is on average about 24% among formal employees and about 20% among informal employees. Second, men and women entering formal and informal jobs have different unobservable characteristics. Controlling for endogenous selection into formal vs. informal jobs, I find that the gender gap in wage offers is high and increases with education in formal jobs. In informal jobs, however, estimated wage offers are the same for men and women. I discuss the potential implications of these findings regarding the effect of labor market regulation on gender wage gaps. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Its goal is to assess comparability or congruence of efficiency scores yielded by these two competitive approaches in a framework of data envelopment analysis (DEA), which is undertaken empirically in a case study of Slovak commercial banks for a period of 11 years from 2005 until 2015. The study finds that the main point of departure between the approaches that rests in treatment of deposits is an insuperable obstacle to comparability of their results, and that it does matter whether deposits are placed upon the input or output side of banking production. It is therefore safer to reconcile both approaches in a two-stage manner and to avoid black-box descriptions of banking production.","[Bod'a, Martin; Piklova, Zuzana] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia",Matej Bel University,"Bod'a, M (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia.",martin.boda@umb.sk,"Boďa, Martin/J-3602-2016","Boďa, Martin/0000-0002-7503-6898",VEGA [1/0757/15],VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),The paper originated in partial fulfillment of the obligations concerning the grant scheme VEGA # 1/0757/15.,,22,1,2,0,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-76228-9; 978-3-319-76227-2,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,111,120,,10.1007/978-3-319-76228-9_11,0.0,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1UI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448435600011,0

We find that variation in the quantity of emissions displaced by wind, solar, and efficiency resources is significant across regions but limited across resources within a region.

The negative effect of financialization on TFP is getting weaker, but the promotion of financialization on TFP is unstable. 2) From the perspective of temporal and space dimensions, marketization plays a catalytic role in TFP, and its promotion to the east is relatively greater than that in the central and western regions.

This paper is based on a spatially explicit ethnography of land rights conducted in the Samlaut district of north-west Cambodia - a former Khmer Rouge resistance stronghold - in a context where the enclosures are both incomplete and entangled with post-war, socially embedded land tenure systems. We discuss how this new pattern of fragmentation affects the prevailing dynamics of agrarian change. We argue that it has introduced new forms of exclusion and a generalized perception of land tenure uncertainty that is managed by peasants through the actualization of hybrid land tenure arrangements borrowing from state rules and local consensus.

We then estimate migration's impact on conflict using bilateral panel data between 1960-2000.

Using the Health Belief Model as a framework, the survey measured the constructs of perceived susceptibility, severity, benefits, barriers, self-efficacy and cues to action. In addition to the framework, levels of previous cyber-crime victimization and technology implementation were measured. The results of this survey demonstrated that perceived susceptibility to cyber-attacks and the perceived benefits of protective technology are related to an individual's choice to implement cyber security technology. Over half of the respondents had been victims of a computer security incident, demonstrating that even individuals working in agriculture can be impacted by computer crime incidents.

Potential output, however, is an unobserved variable whose definition can vary. For example, some view potential output as the level of output that can be produced when employment is at the natural rate. Others use trend measures of output to measure potential. We survey some of these measures using both full-sample data (all of the data that would be available through June 2017) and real-time data (the actual data that would have been available at different points in the sample). We construct six different measures of potential: a linear trend, a quadratic trend, the Congressional Budget Office measure, and three filtered trends. We compare these measures across methods and across time. We also use the measures to compute the monetary policy prescription in a standard interest rate rule and find very little difference across methods.","[Guisinger, Amy Y.] Lafayette Coll, Econ, Easton, PA 18042 USA; [Owyang, Michael T.; Shell, Hannah G.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Res Div, St Louis, MO USA",Lafayette College; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Guisinger, AY (通讯作者)，Lafayette Coll, Econ, Easton, PA 18042 USA.",,"Owyang, Michael T/I-5750-2016","Owyang, Michael T/0000-0002-2109-3432",,,,,23,5,7,0,5,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

Although traps, and the dynamics that lead to traps, are defined and used differently in different disciplines, the concept of a poverty trap has been most powerfully shaped by work in development economics. This perspective is often constraining because, as many studies show, poverty arises from complex interactions between social and environmental factors that are rarely considered in development economics. A more integrated understanding of poverty traps can help to understand the interrelations between persistent poverty and key social and ecological factors, facilitating more effective development interventions. The aim of this paper is to provide a critical appraisal of existing trap conceptualizations in different disciplines, and to assess the characteristics and mechanisms that are used to explain poverty traps in rural contexts, thereby broadening the traps concept to better account for social-ecological interactions. Complementarities and tensions among different disciplinary, perspectives on traps are identified, and our results demonstrate that different definitions of traps share a set of common characteristics: persistence, undesirability, and self-reinforcement. Yet these minimum conditions are not sufficient to understand how trap dynamics arise from complex social-ecological interactions. To broaden the utility of the concept we propose a more social-ecologically integrated definition of traps that includes four additional considerations: cross-scale interactions, path dependencies, the role of external drivers, and social-ecological diversity. Including these wider dimensions of trap dynamics would help to better account for the diverse social-ecological feedbacks that produce and maintain poverty traps, and could strengthen strategies to alleviate poverty in a more integrated way.

One of these conditions is that bidders must be risk neutral; this condition, however, often fails in reality. An experiment was carried out with farmers to investigate how the bid amount is influenced by the individual risk attitude. In the experiment, farmers were able to buy a good with a private value in four different auctions types. Results indicate that the revenues in auctions are affected by the risk attitude of the bidders.

Global dependence refers to the correlation of changes in sentiment and stock returns over the whole range of these 2 variables, and extreme dependence refers to the local correlation of high (i.e. asymptotic) changes in sentiment and high stock returns. Using copula models and a bootstrap procedure, 6 statistical tests are performed for this purpose. Among the results of the tests, the authors highlight those that provide evidence of contemporaneous lower extreme dependence and contemporaneous upper extreme independence between sentiment and returns. As policy implications, these results suggest that financial stability can be promoted if regulators consider the impact of their decisions on investor sentiment. Also, the results seem to support the arguments in favor of short selling ban during turmoil periods. Finally, overall, the results are relevant for both investors and regulators and reinforce the importance of considering investor sentiment to better understand the behavior of financial markets.","[Horta, Paulo] Portuguese Secur Market Commiss, Lisbon, Portugal; [Lobao, Julio] Univ Porto, Porto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto,"Horta, P (通讯作者)，Portuguese Secur Market Commiss, Market Supervis Dept, Rua Laura Alves 4, P-1050138 Lisbon, Portugal.",paulohorta@cmvm.pt,"Lobão, Júlio/AAF-4837-2019","Lobão, Júlio/0000-0001-5896-9648",,,,,38,7,7,2,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

Voting has been an accepted means for electing candidates, receiving public approval for referendums and budgets, and for many other tasks where the will of the people, whether a broad population or a select group, can be recorded and measured in a tangible way. Because of advances in technology, together with problems inherent in manual forms of voting, the concepts and issues relating to electronic voting (e-voting) and various other technology-based forms, are been proposed, discussed, and examined. The goal of all such systems is the casting and recording of the votes from eligible voters as they intended to be cast, with adequate security. This security requires that there be no identifiable connection between the voter and the vote that is cast, while providing an audit trail that can be used to validate that every vote was counted and tallied, as cast. Current research has shown that such systems form the majority of the nascent e-voting technologies, primarily because they have come closest to solving the usability and security issues inherent in technology-based voting systems.","[Hsu, Jeffrey; Bronson, Gary] Fairleigh Dickinson Univ, Silberman Coll Business, Informat Syst & Decis Sci Dept, Madison, NJ 07940 USA",Fairleigh Dickinson University,"Hsu, J (通讯作者)，Fairleigh Dickinson Univ, Silberman Coll Business, Informat Syst & Decis Sci Dept, Madison, NJ 07940 USA.",jeff@fdu.edu; grbronso@fdu.edu,,,,,,,32,2,2,0,9,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-58589-5; 978-3-319-58588-8,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,61,78,,10.1007/978-3-319-58589-5_5,0.0,,,18,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL0QR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000446372200005,0

Under discount cash flow model, firm value changes are caused by either cash flow news or discount rate news. Simply using the sign of stock returns to define good (bad) news can be problematic. Following the classic return decomposition method, this paper decomposes return news into cash flow news and discount rate news. We find that cash flow news component demonstrates consistent results with previous findings. However, with respect to discount rate news, positive return news turns out to be recognized more quickly in earnings. The conventional timeliness asymmetry even disappears in the highest quintile of discount rate news shock magnitude. In additional tests, we also document weakened timeliness asymmetry conditional on a battery of proxy variables for discount rate news. Our findings suggest that we should use stock return sign with caution in conditional conservatism tests, especially when discount rate news shock is large.","[Hung, Shengmin] Soochow Univ, Sch Business, Dept Accounting, Taipei, Taiwan; [Qiao, Zheng] Xiamen Univ, Sch Management, Dept Finance, Xiamen, Peoples R China",Soochow University; Xiamen University,"Qiao, Z (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Sch Management, Dept Finance, Xiamen, Peoples R China.",zqiao@xmu.edu.cn,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 102-2410-H-031-022]; Ministry of Education in China (MOE) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences [16YJC790082]; Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities [20720151130]","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); Ministry of Education in China (MOE) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences; Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)","This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [Project number MOST 102-2410-H-031-022]; Ministry of Education in China (MOE) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences [grant number 16YJC790082]; and the Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities [grant number 20720151130].",,30,0,0,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

In response to fiscal spending shocks, real appreciations occur, followed by deteriorations in the trade account balance with the pre-2000 sample period, while real depreciations occur leading to an improvement in the trade account balance with the post-2000 sample period. We explain this structural break in relation to Korea's transition from a tightly managed exchange rate regime to a more market-oriented floating system after Korea's foreign exchange crisis in 1997-98. Furthermore, such fiscal policy effects from our post 2000 sub-sample imply that expansionary fiscal policy can be effective in stimulating private sector economy in Korea.","[Kim, Hyeongwoo] Auburn Univ, Dept Econ, 217 Miller Hall, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Lee, Daeyup] Bank Korea, Econ Res Inst, Seoul, South Korea",Auburn University System; Auburn University; Bank of Korea,"Kim, H (通讯作者)，Auburn Univ, Dept Econ, 217 Miller Hall, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",gmmkim@gmail.com; dylee484@bok.or.kr,"Kim, Hyeongwoo/GNH-5819-2022","Kim, Hyeongwoo/0000-0002-9685-2579",,,,,22,3,3,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

The aim of the study was to identify the possibility of using financial instruments under the CAP. The analyses concerned mainly Poland. The considerations, illustrated with theoretical and empirical materials, were focused around the following thesis: the permanent domination of the subsidies under CAP and its first pillar radically narrows down the space for using financial instruments. An eclectic approach was applied, using elements of the theory of economics of the public sector, public finances, financial economics and institutional economics. Some justifications of financial instruments do not seem well-founded in theory and probably would not pass the rigorous empirical verification. In order to avoid over-reimbursement and re-promotion of agriculture, it is not advisable to start identifying development barriers to this sector with financial issues. Financial instruments are adjusted mainly to achieve allocation and stabilisation objectives under thr CAP and national agricultural policies.

Enterprises should judge their own capabilities based on relevant risk factors, and then more rationally choose the mode of space utilization for building renovation.","[Li, Yong; Wu, Qian; Hu, Xin] Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Sch Civil Engn, Xian 710055, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Li, Yong; Wu, Qian; Hu, Xin] Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Xian 710055, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Xi'an University of Architecture & Technology; Xi'an University of Architecture & Technology,"Li, Y (通讯作者)，Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Sch Civil Engn, Xian 710055, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.;Li, Y (通讯作者)，Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Xian 710055, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [51678479],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This study was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51678479).,,1,0,0,0,5,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-574-0,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,66.0,,,,,,610,615,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1SI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448284700096,0

But the capital market of our country is imperfect, and the stock price of each commercial bank is lower than the actual value, which causes inappropriate decisions made by investors, not only losing good investment income, but also restricting the development of the banking industry. Based on the above background, this paper takes China Construction Bank as the empirical analysis object, and selects discounted stock cash flow model to analyze its value. The evaluation results confirm that the stock price of China Construction Bank is underestimated, and revealed that China should strengthen the construction of financial market, and the banking industry is one of the more valuable investment objects of all stakeholders.","[Liu, Jiana; Huang, Yuting] Nanchang Inst Sci & Technol, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",,"Liu, JN (通讯作者)，Nanchang Inst Sci & Technol, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,4,FRANCIS ACAD PRESS,LONDON,"35 IVOR PL, LOWER GROUND, LONDON, NW1 6EA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-912407-05-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,446,451,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL4HW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450396400098,0

We further find that after the implementation of the economic stimulus package, bank lending became less responsive to firm profitability, and firm investments became less responsive to investment opportunities for SOEs, non-SOEs from favoured industries and regions, and non-SOEs with political connections. Overall, our findings support the view that the stimulus package and the associated increase in bank loan supply in China resulted in more resources being allocated to SOEs.

The sample data of 21 cities (states) in Sichuan Province are taken as the example. Expert opinion method and entropy evaluation approach are employed to calculate the comprehensive scores of five aspects, namely economic level, urbanization level, basic public service, infrastructure, as well as resources and environment. Then the 21 cities and states are ranked according to scores they got. It is concluded that the overall urbanization level of Sichuan is not high with low development quality. Due to differences in regional positions, natural resources, industrial bases, economic and social policies as well as other factors, the urbanization development levels of 21 cities (states) are uneven; each city and state has its advantages and disadvantages in the process of urbanization construction. According to the comprehensive scores, the 21 cities (states) could be divided into four development patterns: high development level, medium development level, mid-and-low development level and low development level. On the road of new urbanization development, cities with different development patterns must make innovations combined their own characteristics, and actively explore sustainable development path. This paper puts forward countermeasures and suggestions for the development of new urbanization for cities with different development levels.","[Liu, Yun] Sichuan Univ, Sch Econ, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Sichuan University,"Liu, Y (通讯作者)，Sichuan Univ, Sch Econ, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,1,FRANCIS ACAD PRESS,LONDON,"35 IVOR PL, LOWER GROUND, LONDON, NW1 6EA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-912407-05-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,39,45,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL4HW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450396400008,0

Modelling techniques take account of potential endogeneity in the relationship. The two indicators are aligned in the same direction implying more accurate targeting. However, there is a lack of one-to-one correspondence between the two measures and the drivers of calorie deprivation and food insecurity also differ, suggesting a one-size-fits-all policy cannot address both concerns simultaneously.","[Maitra, Chandana; Rao, D.

The penalty is smallest in management and professional occupations, which involve a high level of worker independence. It is largest in service occupations, which include a lower level of independence. This distribution of earnings penalties is consistent with discrimination being the source of the gay wage penalty. The results support the conjecture that higher levels of independence allow gay men to more successfully manage the disclosure of sexual orientation and mediate the negative effects of discrimination.

Labor market frictions make financing labor different than financing capital. Unlike capital, labor cannot be owned and can act strategically. Workers face unemployment costs, can negotiate for higher wages, are protected by employment regulations, and face retirement risk. I propose using these frictions as a framework for understanding the unique impact of a firm's workforce on its capital structure. For instance, high leverage often makes managing labor more difficult by undermining employees' job security and increasing the need for costly workforce reductions. But firms can also use leverage to their advantage, such as in labor negotiations and defined benefit pensions. This research can help firms account for the needs and management of their workforce when making financing decisions.","[Matsa, David A.] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Matsa, David A.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Northwestern University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Matsa, DA (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.;Matsa, DA (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",dmatsa@kellogg.northwestern.edu,,,,,,,152,34,38,3,34,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4810-6,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

Many studies conclude that parties do matter in the United States. Democratic presidents generate, for example, higher rates of economic growth than Republican presidents, but these studies using data for the national level do not identify causal effects. Ideology-induced policies are prevalent at the state level: Democratic governors implement somewhat more expansionary and liberal policies than Republican governors. At the local level, government ideology hardly influences economic policy-making at all.

The most notable among these investments are directed toward accelerating port development in Brazil's Northern-Arc, thereby increasing fertilizer supply to new markets opening throughout the country's expanding agricultural frontier, particularly in northern Mato Grosso state, while increasing supply to existing markets. Results from model runs show that the anticipated port infrastructure investments should ensure nationwide fertilizer logistics savings of US$ 845 million over the 2017 through 2025 period. Although these estimated benefits are outstanding, the study indicates that further expansion of Brazil's port system, particularly in the Northern-Arc, presents additional opportunities. Model projections were that in 2025, after all planned infrastructure improvements are operational, port terminals will be near full capacity, which should make planning for future projects a current priority.","[Simoes, Debora da Costa] Agroconsult, Rua Conego Vicente Miguel Marino 275,234 C, BR-01135020 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Caixeta-Filho, Jose Vicente] Univ Sao Paulo, Luiz de Queiroz Agr Coll ESALQ, Av Padua Dias 11, BR-13418900 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; [Palekar, Udatta S.] Univ Illinois, Coll Business, 4016 BIF,515 East Gregory Dr, Champaign, IL 61820 USA",Universidade de Sao Paulo; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Simoes, DD (通讯作者)，Agroconsult, Rua Conego Vicente Miguel Marino 275,234 C, BR-01135020 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.",deborasimoes@gmail.com,"Caixeta-Filho, José Vicente/H-5576-2012","Caixeta-Filho, José Vicente/0000-0001-8289-9731",Agroconsult; ESALQ-LOG; PECEGE; ADM Institute for the Prevention of Post-Harvest Loss,Agroconsult; ESALQ-LOG; PECEGE; ADM Institute for the Prevention of Post-Harvest Loss,"The authors would like to acknowledge the support from the following entities when developing this article: Agroconsult, ESALQ-LOG, PECEGE and the ADM Institute for the Prevention of Post-Harvest Loss.",,30,10,12,3,25,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

First, manufacturing listed companies with sufficient cash do not increase investment in basic and applied research and development. However, state-owned enterprises are less financing constrained so their characteristics of investment in basic and applied research and development are relatively positive compared with that of non-state-owned enterprises, which are more financing constrained and generally do not invest in basic and applied research and development even with sufficient cash. Second, no matter whether their cash is sufficient or not, they'll prepare cash in advance for the smoothing liquidity risk impact in development phase, and that motivation is more obvious for non-state-owned enterprises since they face more financing constraints.","[Zhang Donghui; Cheng Liwei] Dalian Univ Technol, Fac Management & Econ, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China",Dalian University of Technology,"Zhang, DH (通讯作者)，Dalian Univ Technol, Fac Management & Econ, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China.",,"Zhang, Donghui/GOV-4345-2022",,,,,,10,0,0,0,2,DALIAN UNIV TECHNICAL ELECTRONIC & AUDIO-VISUAL PRESS,DALIAN CITY,"NO.80 SOFTWARE PARK ROAD, HI-TECH ZONE, DALIAN CITY, LIAONING PROVINCE 116024, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89437-202-4,,,,2018,,,,,,,404,409,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7UP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455659900058,0

Serious study of the efficiency of the monetary policy transmission operating mechanism for China's economic changes will stabilize the macro-economic with positive and practical significance. Based on the empirical analysis for the central bank balance sheet, we can find that since 2000, foreign exchange inflow had lead the base money delivery for a long time. After 2012, with the changes in control tools and foreign exchange reduction, the base money delivery is gradually shifted from passive to active. Commercial banks on monetary policy tightening will usually take measures to circumvent, thus weakening the central bank monetary control efficiency. There is an asymmetric phenomenon in the existence of monetary policy, which means that rational investment in financial markets can weaken the monetary control efficiency.

Our study found that the contribution rate of personal account will produce multiplier effect on economic growth, but the contribution rate of pooling account depends on parameters in the model. The results of numerical simulation show that the higher rate of economic growth is with the lower rate of pooling account payment and the higher rate of personal account payment. We also find that the proportion of employment payment transferring to personal account is relevant to economic growth. The empirical results also verify the positive impact of social medical insurance on economic growth.

What is less evident is the way in which this approach can be used to quantitatively analyse the structure, connectivity and dynamics of commuting behaviour. This paper employs a complex network approach to spatially disaggregated JTW data in order to examine commuting behaviour for six different modes of transport (car, car passengers, train, bus, cycling and walking) within three of the most populous metropolitan areas in Australia. A set of network measures (degree, strength, clustering coefficient, maximum cliques, average shortest path length and betweenness) are computed from both the unweighted and weighted graphs corresponding to JTW data for the Sydney, Melbourne and the South East Queensland regions from the time periods: 2001, 2006 and 2011. Results reveal a number of interesting dynamics, one being that Melbourne exhibits shorter (and presumed to be faster) alternate commuting paths than either Sydney or South East Queensland given its lower betweenness and shortest path values allied with higher clustering coefficients. The interpretation of these metrics demonstrates that complex networks have the capacity to reveal new insights from JTW data, by enabling a more comprehensive, systematic, empirical and fine-grained analysis of changes in commuting behaviour over time.","[Zhu, Guohun; Shyy, Paul; Pileggi, Salvatore Flavio; Hunter, Jane] Univ Queensland, Sch Informat Technol & Elect Engn, eRes Grp, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Corcoran, Jonathan] Univ Queensland, Sch Earth Environm Sci, Queensland Ctr Populat Res, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland; University of Queensland,"Zhu, GH (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Informat Technol & Elect Engn, eRes Grp, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",g.zhu@uq.edu.au; jj.corcoran@uq.edu.au; t.shyy@tpg.com.au; s.pileggi@uq.edu.au; j.hunter@uq.edu.au,"Zhu, Guohun/AAO-2307-2020; Corcoran, Jonathan/A-4631-2010; Pileggi, Salvatore Flavio/A-3129-2017","Zhu, Guohun/0000-0003-3356-8236; Corcoran, Jonathan/0000-0003-3565-6061; Pileggi, Salvatore Flavio/0000-0001-9722-2205",Australian Government through the Australian Research Council Discovery project scheme [LE160100174]; Australian Research Council [LE160100174] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Government through the Australian Research Council Discovery project scheme; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"This research was funded by the Australian Government through the Australian Research Council Discovery project scheme, LE160100174.",,51,12,12,0,24,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Our results show that the factor has a significant power in explaining both time-series and cross-sectional variation in the size-B/M portfolio returns. The addition of the factor to the two models considerably increases their overall performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

What is the impact of high-speed rail (HSR) on regional economic disparity? The question is investigated from three perspectives. First, the influence of HSR on regional economic disparity is discussed theoretically from the perspective of New Economic Geography. Second, the variation in economic disparity at both the national and regional levels is investigated using three indexes: the weighted coefficient of variation, the Theil index and the Gini index. Third, the linkages between regional economic growth and HSR is measured empirically from a quantitative and qualitative perspective using an endogenous growth modelling framework with a panel data covering the period 2000-2014. The rail network density is adopted as a proxy to reflect the quantity change in rail investment. Three accessibility indicators (weighted average travel time, potential accessibility and daily accessibility) are introduced to capture the improvement of HSR transport quality. Our findings confirm that regional economic disparity has been decreased since the development of HSR. HSR has promoted regional economic convergence in China. Specifically, the positive effect of rail network density on regional economic growth is found to be significant in the East and North, whereas the positive effect of accessibility change is found to be more significant in the Middle Reaches of Yangtze River, the Southwest and the South China.","[Chen, Zhenhua] Ohio State Univ, City & Reg Planning, Austin E Knowlton Sch Architecture, 295 Knowlton Hall,275 West Woodruff Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Haynes, Kingsley E.] George Mason Univ, Schar Sch Policy & Govt, 3351 Fairfax Dr,MS 3B1, Arlington, VA 22201 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; George Mason University,"Chen, ZH (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, City & Reg Planning, Austin E Knowlton Sch Architecture, 295 Knowlton Hall,275 West Woodruff Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",chen.7172@osu.edu,,,,,,,48,229,251,44,344,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Results point out that intensive commuting is to be understood both considering its relation with daily travel time and its territorial context. Qualitative analysis shows how these suburban commuters are concerned for time, and presents strategies at different spatial and temporal scales.

Because the EITC is structurally tied to earnings, it is to be expected that a period of widespread job loss will impact eligibility. However; the direction of this impact is not obvious. Families who experience complete job loss for an entire tax year lose eligibility, while those experiencing underemployment (part-year employment, a reduction in hours, or spousal unemployment in married households) may become eligible. Determining the direction and magnitude of the impact is important for a number of reasons. The EITC has become the largest cash-transfer program in the United States, and many low earning families rely on it as a means of support in tough times. The program has been considered a replacement for welfare, enticing former welfare recipients into the labor force. Recent research has begun to focus on the effectiveness of the EITC during a time when jobs are scarce; however, due to data limitations, the mechanism of EITC eligibility loss has not been addressed. To answer this question, I use the 2006 Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement matched to tax data from 2005 through 2011 to examine changes in eligibility experienced by individuals over time. In assessing three competing causes of eligibility loss, I find that less-educated, unmarried women experienced a greater hazard of loss due a year-long lack of earnings compared with other labor-market groups. Meanwhile, this same group was less likely than other groups to gain eligibility through underemployment. Not only did many families headed by unmarried, low-skilled women appear to lose all earnings income during the recession, but they also lost credit dollars that averaged approximately $2,000 per tax year I discuss the implications of these findings for the general dynamics of EITC eligibility spells and the saliency of the EITC as a safety-net program.","[Jones, Maggie R.] US Census Bur, Ctr Adm Records Res & Applicat, Washington, DC 20233 USA",,"Jones, MR (通讯作者)，US Census Bur, Ctr Adm Records Res & Applicat, Washington, DC 20233 USA.",margaret.r.jones@census.gov,,,,,,,26,3,7,0,9,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

In this paper, I analyze the setting of tariffs in a two-country model taking account of adjustment processes with special emphasis on the effects of nominal price rigidity and monetary policy. I show that nominal price rigidity induces policymakers with a short planning horizon to set lower tariffs because it enhances the short-run drop in consumption following an increase in tariffs. Monetary policy that aggressively fights deviations from its inflation target implies even lower optimal tariffs.","[Lechthaler, Wolfgang] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Lechthaler, W (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany.",wolfgang.lechthaler@ifw-kiel.de,"Lechthaler, Wolfgang/AAN-6248-2020","Lechthaler, Wolfgang/0000-0001-9845-2555",,,,,43,1,1,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Bundling networks require cooperation between multiple partners in the multimodal transport chain. In this context, the question rises how benefits may be allocated fairly among the spatially distributed participants in the cooperation. A great deal of scientific literature reports on the behavior of allocation methods in collaborations between shippers or carriers making use of unimodal road transport. However, research on cost or savings allocation methods in multimodal transport is scarce. The main contribution of this paper is thus to provide a first insight in the complexity of sharing cost savings fairly among shippers who bundle freight flows in order to reach economies of scale in multimodal barge transport. By applying four different allocation methods to two realistic case studies, a comparison is made between simple and straightforward allocation mechanisms and more advanced techniques based on cooperative game theory. Special attention is paid to the savings division among coalition partners and collaborative stability. Results demonstrate the influence of cooperation characteristics on allocation outcomes and underline the value of carefully selecting appropriate allocation mechanisms when long-term stability of the multimodal barge collaboration is aspired.","[Ramaekers, Katrien; Verdonck, Lotte; Caris, An] Univ Hasselt, Agoralaan,Bldg D, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium; [Verdonck, Lotte] Res Fdn Flanders FWO, Egmontstr 5, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Meers, Dries; Macharis, Cathy] Vrije Univ Brussel, Res Grp MOBI, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",Hasselt University; Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Ramaekers, K (通讯作者)，Univ Hasselt, Agoralaan,Bldg D, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium.",katrien.ramaekers@uhasselt.be; lotte.verdonck@uhasselt.be; an.caris@uhasselt.be; Dries.Meers@vub.ac.be; Cathy.Macharis@vub.ac.be,"Caris, An/AAI-2120-2020; Ramaekers, Katrien/AFT-1279-2022","Caris, An/0000-0001-6004-8776; Ramaekers, Katrien/0000-0001-5661-304X",,,,,47,10,11,2,36,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Recently, the potential benefits of using survey data instead of claims data to control for the different dimensions of private information when testing for evidence of asymmetric information have been explored in the insurance literature. This article extends that approach to present two tests for ex ante moral hazard in a market for automobile insurance. In this article we specify (1) a recursive model and (2) an instrumental variables model to address endogeneity with respect to policy selection in cross-sectional road traffic crash (RTC) survey data. We report a statistically significant ex ante moral hazard effect with both models. This result is then subjected to a falsification test, whereby the analysis is repeated in subsamples of at-fault and not-at-fault RTCs. Our antitest produces no evidence of ex ante moral hazard in the sub-sample of not-at-fault RTCs, in which the true moral hazard may reasonably be assumed to be zero, thus supporting the interpretation of the results of our two models. Our extension of the existing literature via these two specifications may have useful analogs in other insurance markets for which survey data are available.","[Rowell, David] Univ Queensland, Queensland Brain Inst, Asia Pacific Ctr Neuromodulat, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Nghiem, Son] Queensland Univ Technol, Inst Hlth & Biomed Innovat, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Connelly, Luke B.] Univ Queensland, Fac Hlth & Behav Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Connelly, Luke B.] Univ Queensland, Ctr Business & Econ Hlth, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",University of Queensland; Queensland University of Technology (QUT); University of Queensland; University of Queensland,"Rowell, D (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Queensland Brain Inst, Asia Pacific Ctr Neuromodulat, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",d.rowell@uq.edu.au; son.nghiem@qut.edu.au; l.connelly@uq.edu.au,"Connelly, Luke B/F-6578-2010; Nghiem, Hong Son/F-6263-2010","Nghiem, Hong Son/0000-0002-2451-5290; Connelly, Luke/0000-0002-1734-4809",Brian Gray scholarship program; Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA); Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA),Brian Gray scholarship program; Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA); Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA),"Rowell acknowledges financial support from the Brian Gray scholarship program, which is jointly funded by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA).",,40,5,5,1,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

We show that an increase in either the complementarity of differentiated goods or the share of intermediate inputs in gross output, significantly increases the negative effect of entry costs on total factor productivity (TFP) and output per worker. We also find that the effect of complementarity is quantitatively stronger. If we assume an empirically plausible value for the elasticity of substitution between differentiated goods, then the model considerably improves its ability to reproduce the observed negative relationship between entry costs and TFP or output per worker.","[del Rio, Fernando; Sampayo, Antonio] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ, Santiago De Compostela, Spain",Universidade de Santiago de Compostela,"Sampayo, A (通讯作者)，Fac CC Econ & Empresariais, Avda Burgo Nacions S-N, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain.",ar.sampayo@usc.es,"del Río, Fernando/AAD-1065-2022; Rodriguez Sampayo, Antonio/L-7672-2014","del Río, Fernando/0000-0001-7448-5045; Rodriguez Sampayo, Antonio/0000-0002-8667-4940",Xunta de Galicia research program [GPC2013-045]; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness research program [ECO2013 48884 C3 1 P],Xunta de Galicia research program; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)(European Union (EU)); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness research program,"The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from Xunta de Galicia research program GPC2013-045 partly funded the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), as well as from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness research program ECO2013 48884 C3 1 P.",,38,2,2,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

In this paper we estimate a gravity model of FDI flows from a sample of OECD countries to a broader sample of developing economies, examining the impact of BITs on these flows. BITs are signed between highly heterogeneous country-pairs, with important differences found in terms of the institutional and economic distance between BIT signatories. These differences may help explain the mixed results on the effects of BITs on FDI flows in the existing literature, with our exploration of non-linearities in this relationship suggesting that the effects of BITs are increasing in the difference in GDP and GDP per capita between source and host. BITs appear to have no impact upon FDI flows for country-pairs that are too dissimilar in terms of the strength of their political institutions.","[Falvey, Rod] Bond Univ, Bond Business Sch, Robina, Qld 4229, Australia; [Foster-McGregor, Neil] UNU MERIT, Boschstr 24, Maastricht, Netherlands",Bond University; Maastricht University,"Foster-McGregor, N (通讯作者)，UNU MERIT, Boschstr 24, Maastricht, Netherlands.",rfalvey@bond.edu.au; foster@merit.unu.edu,"Falvey, Rodney/F-6944-2013",,,,,,38,9,11,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

We provide supporting evidence from the U.S. stock market and find that, not only is systematic skewness negatively priced, an extra return premium is also required for accepting high systematic risk associated with a rise in risk aversion. Our findings suggest that considering both skewness preference and intertemporal hedging demands improves the estimated risk-return trade-off, and that cross-sectional anomalies such as value, momentum, and failure probability puzzles can be partially explained by our model.

Evidence from 1960-2016 Data,REVUE D ECONOMIE POLITIQUE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Algeria; oil revenues; dutch disease; real exchange rate; manufacturing sector; time series,,"The Algerian economy is strongly dependent on oil exports. Following the 1986 oil counter-shock, Algeria has experienced a persistent decline of its manufacturing sector. Although it has benefited from high oil prices over the last decades and implemented a myriad of economic reforms, this country has failed to develop its manufacturing sector and diversify its economy. One of the main mechanisms through which fluctuations in oil prices can constitute an impediment to the development of the manufacturing sector, and hence to long-term growth, in an economy that heavily relies on a natural resource exports is referred to in the literature as the Dutch disease. This paper aims to test whether or not Algeria's economy has suffered from the main symptoms of this syndrome by analyzing data covering more than half-a-century. More specifically, we use a 1960-2016 annual database to investigate two important implications of this phenomenon that occur following an oil boom, namely, the spending effect and the resource movement effect. We perform some simple tests of these signs of the Dutch disease using the Autoregressive-Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach while controlling for some other factors that could have led to similar economic symptoms. The results do not allow us to unambiguously claim that the Algerian economy has suffered from the Dutch disease over the period spanned by our data, which suggests further inquiry about the causes of the low degree of diversification of the Algerian economy.","[Gasmi, Farid] Univ Toulouse Capitole, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Laourari, Imene] MDI Algiers Business Sch, Cheraga, Algeria",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Laourari, I (通讯作者)，MDI Algiers Business Sch, Cheraga, Algeria.",i.laourari@ndi-alger.com,,,,,,,42,3,3,0,2,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

A rational learning framework indicates the diversification discount is related to economic activity. Building on this framework, we test and find support for the hypothesis that investor sentiment explains the diversification discount. Investor sentiment favors riskier firms when sentiment is high, thereby increasing returns and relative valuations. As a result, diversified firms imputed value based on these multiples leads to a larger diversification discount and reverses when sentiment falls. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.
