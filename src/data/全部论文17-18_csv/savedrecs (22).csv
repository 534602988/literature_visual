Of course, this theoretically targeted approach by us is to be based on relatively more familiar aspects of management theory, namely organizational culture and formal social groups. Regardless of the angle from which the existing climate in a company is being analyzed at a certain point in time, it is clear that this climate differs from one organization to another and that itself, through its content and nature, directly influences the daily relations between employees and departments in the organizational chart. However, it is relatively difficult to capture, define and direct the climate that exists in organizations, since the roots of its constitution derive from official norms / reports, but also from informal networks / networks. Our analysis aims to emphasize the importance of formal relationships, especially informal relationships in a business organization as a distinct part of its organizational culture. We understand intuitively that there is a strong link between the quality of human resources available to a company and the nature of formal / informal relationships that develop over time; implicitly, these relationships can more or less support the accumulation of knowledge and the innovative capacity of the organization. However, there are no clear rules / principles in management theory, according to which the formal / informal relationships of an enterprise should be characterized and managed.","[Buta, Simona] Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Suceava, Romania",Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava,"Buta, S (通讯作者)，Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Suceava, Romania.",simonab@seap.usv.ro,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,4192,4199,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553205022,0

This paper attempts to construct a theory to justify and find an appropriate solution to balance the different interests by implementing the DNT mechanism in the real-world marketing industry. The research method involves deduction in legal reasoning. This paper argues that digital footprint information privacy, which has high commercial value, should at least be awarded the status of a semi-fundamental human right. Additionally, when to adopt a DNT opt-out or default mechanism depends on the type of personal information involved. The practical implications suggest a compromise between digital footprint privacy protection and commercial applications in the marketing industry, to be achieved through technology. Since this important topic is relatively new in the area of marketing applications and no primary academic research has established a complete theoretical legal foundation, this article is among the first to do so. Beside its originality, this article also contributes to the literature by proposing a theoretically practical mechanism for both digital footprint privacy protection and marketing profits.","[Cheng, Fa-Chang] Natl Kaohsiung Univ Sci & Technol, Grad Inst Sci & Technol Law, 2 Juo Yue Rd, Kahosiung 81164, Taiwan; [Wang, Yu Shan] Natl Kaohsiung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Money & Banking, 2 Juo Yue Rd, Kahosiung 81164, Taiwan",National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology; National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology,"Wang, YS (通讯作者)，Natl Kaohsiung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Money & Banking, 2 Juo Yue Rd, Kahosiung 81164, Taiwan.",yushan@nkust.edu.tw,,,,,,,29,7,7,2,19,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

This article is motivated by the fact that most approaches to project planning are deterministic. In reality, the problem is accompanied by uncertainty and risk associated with dealing with imprecise data. Taking this uncertainty into account when performing analyses and calculations not only helps to better project planning, but also to expand the applicability of project scheduling methods under real-life or uncertain conditions. The major contribution of this paper is the development of a novel approach to critical path analysis in the presence of uncertainty. Extended Critical Path Method has been developed as a new method with approach based on ordered fuzzy numbers, preserving its basic concept. An example was solved by the algorithm considering imprecise activity times. Our results indicate that ordered fuzzy numbers may be used to represent imprecise information about projects. OFNs offer a clear, simultaneous representation of several pieces of information. Interpretation of OFNs can be compatible with the general idea of standard fuzzy numbers but by using OFNs we can additionally describe a trend of imprecise value of the real-life processes. Additionally, well-defined arithmetic operations on ordered fuzzy numbers make it easy to perform even complex calculations connected.","[Chwastyk, Anna] Opole Univ Technol, Opole, Poland; [Pisz, Iwona] Opole Univ, Opole, Poland",Opole University of Technology; University of Opole,"Chwastyk, A (通讯作者)，Opole Univ Technol, Opole, Poland.",a.chwastyk@po.opole.pl; ipisz@uni.opole.pl,"Pisz, Iwona/AAE-7352-2019","Pisz, Iwona/0000-0001-6079-3178",,,,,22,1,1,0,6,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,2004,2013,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553203008,0

This study examines an analysis of the smartness diversity of European cities on the basis of the International Organization for Standardization 37120 norm dealing with sustainable development of communities. Cities with a higher level of certification exhibit more effective management and their residents show greater commitment to civic life. The assessment of the level of smartness was based on statistics collected by the World Council on City Data using Multidimensional Comparative Analysis. Hellwig's (1968) synthetic indicators were used to create a ranking gauging the level of smartness of European cities which were classified into four groups. The investigation shows large disparities in the smartness of selected European cities.,"[Hajduk, Slawomira] Bialystok Tech Univ, Fac Engn Management, Bialystok, Poland",Bialystok University of Technology,"Hajduk, S (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Fac Engn Management, Bialystok, Poland.",s.hajduk@pb.edu.pl,"Hajduk, Sławomira/N-2088-2019; Hajduk, Sławomira/F-2451-2016","Hajduk, Sławomira/0000-0003-0314-1661",Ministry of Science and Higher Education funds [S/WZ/5/2015],Ministry of Science and Higher Education funds,The consideration presented in this article are the result of the research project S/WZ/5/2015 financed from Ministry of Science and Higher Education funds.,,61,9,9,2,9,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Most people are buying private labels at least in some product categories, but not all consumers are equally inclined to buy private labels regularly or in most product categories. Regarding the fact that consumers of different lifestyles also have different attitudes toward products and brands, the aim of this paper is isolation of consumer segments according to food consumption lifestyle, identification of their demographic characteristics and to determine how different segments perceive private label food products (perception of price, quality, value, country of origin, satisfaction with offer, loyalty, recommendation). Food Related Lifestyle instrument, constituted of 69 statements, was used to measure five dimensions ( ways of shopping, quality aspects, cooking methods, consumption situations, purchasing motives). Methods used for analysing of collected data are descriptive statistics, cluster analysis and Kruskal Wallis test. Three different segments of consumers regarding food lifestyle are identified by cluster analysis and these are: Traditionalists (2%), Experimentalists (60,5%) and Relaxed (37,6%). Results show that retailers should focus on the Experimentalists when developing private labels. Special focus should be directed towards improving private label quality, offer consumers as much information as possible (on product characteristics and usage possibilities) and adjust the sales area to make the shopping more relaxed.","[Horvat, Sandra] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia; [Zalac, Nikolina] Calzedonia Croatia Doo, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Horvat, S (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia.",shorvat@efzg.hr; nikolina.zalac@calzedonia.hr,"Horvat, Sandra/I-2130-2018",,,,,,26,0,0,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,2124,2133,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553203021,0

From original data of a number of living and a number of deaths, we do not get a smooth mortality rate curve. Our contribution offers a new smoothing method based on so-called mixture functions. Mixture functions represent a special class of weighted averaging functions where weights are determined by continuous, input values dependent, weighting functions. If they are increasing, they form an important class of aggregation functions. Such mixture functions are more flexible than the standard weighted arithmetic mean, and their weighting functions allow one to penalise or reinforce inputs based on their magnitude. This contribution recalls sufficient conditions of the standard monotonicity of mixture functions with selected weighting functions. Based on the mentioned properties, we present an application of the mixture function in smoothing of mortality rates curves.","[Hudec, Samuel] Matej Bel Univ, Fac Nat Sci, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia; [Spirkova, Jana] Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia",Matej Bel University; Matej Bel University,"Hudec, S (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ, Fac Nat Sci, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia.",samuel.hudec@umb.sk; jana.spirkova@umb.sk,"Špirková, Jana/ACA-8522-2022","Špirková, Jana/0000-0001-5864-9353",Slovak Scientific Grant Agency VEGA [1/0093/17],Slovak Scientific Grant Agency VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),The paper was supported by the Slovak Scientific Grant Agency VEGA no. 1/0093/17 Identification of risk factors and their impact on products of the insurance and savings schemes.,,12,0,0,0,0,OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE,PRAGUE 3,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2238-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,155,164,,,,,,10,Demography; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BO2QE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000507522000014,0

A simple aggregation of the observed values for individual indicators is used to produce sub-indices for the domains, and consequently to aggregate the sub-indices to the AAI and determine the ranking of the countries. The aim of this contribution is to present and discuss alternative approaches to the construction of a composite index based on the same indicators, but using different methods to set the weights for the aggregation.

The purpose of this study was to establish the impacts of the CPEC project on human resources development, with emphasis on the challenges and prospects that said project may generate. A quantitative research approach was used in the present study. Quantitative descriptive studies rely on the use of primary sources, at least for the most part. Data were collected from a sample of 250 participants. The sample pool was divided into two groups. Each of the two groups was composed of 125 participants-i.e. equal distribution. The sample population was divided based on their location, of which there were two, China and Pakistan. A customer questionnaire was used to quantitatively analyze the impacts of CPEC on human resources development, based on the respondents' perceptions. The study showed mixed results regarding the challenges and prospects of Human Resources development under CPEC. So far, it can be seen that the CPEC would have a positive impact on Human Resources Management Efficiency, Employee Satisfaction, 360 Degree Feedback and Employee Evaluation, Inclusion and Belongingness, Human Capital Development, Skills Development, Knowledge Acquisition, Knowledge Transfer, Manager Effectiveness, Employee Productivity and Employee Benefits (based on a high mean score, which means that the respondents have a positive perception about these variables' potential). CPEC, according to the participants' responses, are going to have a negative impact on Employee Retention, Career Development, Job Satisfaction, and Work-Life Balance, as evidenced by the low mean score that we were able to compute for these variables.","[Mahmood, Nasir; Cai Jianfeng] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Management, Xian 710072, Shannxi, Peoples R China; [Jamil, Farhan] Higher Educ Commiss, Res & Dev Div, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan; [Yasir, Nosheena] Northwestern Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Xian 710069, Shannxi, Peoples R China",Northwestern Polytechnical University; Northwest University Xi'an,"Mahmood, N (通讯作者)，Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Management, Xian 710072, Shannxi, Peoples R China.",nasirmahmood@mail.nwpu.edu.cn,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,6196,6206,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553207017,0

The selected type of research is a qualitative method that paradigm the interpretive phenomenology. Based on this research, the executor manages village funds based on the incidence of failure in the village timely disburse in May 2016. They have a perception that reporting is mandatory in order for them to get the village fund. The executor does not want to experience the disappointment 2016 to reoccur. Thus, they avoid the same incident as the result of learning from experience in managing the village funds in the previous year. At each experience, there is the environment that plays a role in the process of intersubjectivity. First, through skepticism among the executor based on the stereotype that the educational background determines capability. Second, the behavior of financial managers of the village where they are always obedient to the commands of the village head, this is a repetitive action that is considered reasonable. Both forms of intersubjectivity by the work environment caused executor system to justify a different form of the duties and functions or Tugas Pokok dan Fungsi (Tupoksi). Because of this, the executor has difficulties to integrate the village fund management responsibilities to be accountable. Executor defines accountability as the responsibility of reporting vertically, while horizontal reporting is only done as a formality. The greatest thrust of executors in action is the fear of sanctions from those who are considered to have a higher position in the bureaucratic corridor. Thus, the perception of accountability, in this case, is that the necessity in the management of village funds containing different levels of urgency differs based on the focus or concern of the work environment on the management of village funds.","[Maritafitri, Dyah; Achadiyah, Bety Nur] State Univ Malang, Malang, Indonesia",Universitas Negeri Malang,"Maritafitri, D (通讯作者)，State Univ Malang, Malang, Indonesia.",Dyah.maritafitri@gmail.com,"Achadiyah, Bety Nur/AGA-9046-2022","Achadiyah, Bety Nur/0000-0002-5910-1047",,,,,22,1,1,1,1,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2518-668X,,,KNE SOC SCI,,,2018,,,,,,,51,70,,10.18502/kss.v3i3.1873,0.0,,,20,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM5LX,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000465229600004,0

Firms support volunteering, especially for developing social competencies of employees, promoting corporate image, employee motivation, corporate loyalty and teamwork because look for qualified workers with moral and ethical attributes that correspond to corporate identity. In addition, volunteering has an economic benefit because it improves the physical and mental health of employees, which has a positive impact on productivity gains in the workplace. On the other hand, corporate volunteering is an important factor also for potential job seekers. Currently, many potential job seekers consider not only wage conditions, but they also decide based on the company's publicly beneficial activities. The aim of this paper is to summarize the theoretical and empirical knowledge of corporate volunteering as a support tool for personnel marketing, by which companies acquire and develop employees' abilities. Moreover, we conduct survey of corporate volunteerism. The survey sample consist of 130 respondents. The results show corporate volunteerism develop professional and personnel skills. In addition, some respondents think that corporate volunteerism is good form of teambuilding. The reason is that teambuilding is associated with relaxing and helping people in need.","[Mazanec, Jaroslav; Bartosova, Viera] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1-8215, Zilina, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Mazanec, J (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1-8215, Zilina, Slovakia.",jaroslav.mazanec@fpedas.uniza.sk; viera.bartosova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Mazanec, Jaroslav/O-9476-2016; Bartosova, Viera/P-6636-2015","Mazanec, Jaroslav/0000-0003-4723-7075; Bartosova, Viera/0000-0001-7960-4429",[VEGA 1/0244/16],,This contribution was undertaken as parts of the research project VEGA 1/0244/16 Personnel marketing as a new approach of the ensuring and maintaining the skilled workforce in Slovak companies.,,33,1,1,0,6,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,7963,7971,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553208105,0

The resurgent research interest in DSSs is linked to recent developments in Big Data & Analytics (BDA), the sharing economy, and increasingly, application of DSSs outside management scenarios that were relatively stable. Thus, over time, there has emerged a 'design-reality' mismatch, in which DSSs design archetype recognizes the complexity of decision making environments; while praxis has largely assumed complicated, but more stable, structured and semi-structured decision making contexts. Prior research also confirms that there has been a perfunctory engagement of the implications of such a mismatch to didactic concerns related to the content, methods or expected outcomes of contemporary DSSs education. The central concern of this conceptual elaboration is to unpack the 'black box' of contemporary DSSs didactic concerns by applying the Theory of Synergetics, which reifies complexity and self-organization as core concepts. A proposition is made that DSS education should be approached as a self-organized process; an approach that offers new insights and provides explanatory concepts relevant for advancing DSSs education. Notably, the insights that are likely to influence developments in DSSs are linked to the sharing economy, Singerian paradigm, data-driven developments and a decision making context that augments the utility based perspective towards cognitive decision-based processes.","[Odhiambo, Nancy A.; Ochara, Nixon M.] Univ Venda, ZA-0950 Thohoyandou, Limpopo, South Africa",University of Venda,"Odhiambo, NA (通讯作者)，Univ Venda, ZA-0950 Thohoyandou, Limpopo, South Africa.",odhiambonancy01@gmail.com; muganda.ochara@univen.ac.za,"Ochara, Nixon Muganda/AAX-4432-2020","Ochara, Nixon Muganda/0000-0001-5736-7901",,,,,67,0,0,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,922,933,,,,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553201037,0

Although legal scholars have generally assumed that algorithmic collusion is not only possible but also exceptionally easy, computer scientists examining cooperation between algorithms as well as economists investigating collusion in experimental oligopolies have countered that coordinated, tacitly collusive behavior is not as rapid, easy, or even inevitable as often suggested. Research in experimental economics has shown that the exchange of information is vital to collusion when more than two firms operate within a given market. Communication between algorithms is also a topic in research on artificial intelligence, in which some scholars have recently indicated that algorithms can learn to communicate, albeit in somewhat limited ways. Taken together, algorithmic collusion currently seems far more difficult to achieve than legal scholars have often assumed and is thus not a particularly relevant competitive concern at present. Moreover, there are several legal problems associated with algorithmic collusion, including questions of liability, of auditing and monitoring algorithms, and of enforcing competition law.","[Schwalbe, Ulrich] Univ Hohenheim, Dept Econ, Stuttgart, Germany",University Hohenheim,"Schwalbe, U (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Dept Econ, Stuttgart, Germany.",ulrich.schwalbe@uni-hohenheim.de,,,,,,,114,45,46,5,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

The competition is not only among the private universities themselves but also between them and the public ones. The main cause of this competition is that prospective students are now becoming much more selective in choosing universities. In fact, public universities are the first choice of the prospective students. Consequently, private universities must equip themselves with strong competitiveness. Otherwise, they will lose the competition. One of the strategies to gain the competitiveness is to develop the lecturers. According to research findings, lecturer professionalism is one of the elements that prospective students highly demand. This paper discusses about how to develop university lecturers.

It argues that corporations and Chicago law and economics had a mutually beneficial relationship, especially after the birth of Chicago neoliberalism in 1950. Corporations made possible the rise of Chicago law and economics through funding and advice. Chicago law and economics in return provided scholarly research that corporations sought to challenge the status quo antitrust positions of government. The relationship between Chicago law and economics and corporations in this period gave rise to critical institutions that would inspire the institutions of Chicago law in economics during its ascendency from the 1960s to the present, and the ideas about antitrust law that emerged in these formative years would later shape antitrust law in the United States.","[Van Horn, Robert] Univ Rhode Isl, Econ Dept, 10 Flagg Rd, Kingston, RI 02881 USA",University of Rhode Island,"Van Horn, R (通讯作者)，Univ Rhode Isl, Econ Dept, 10 Flagg Rd, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",rvanhorn@uri.edu,,,,,,,52,7,8,1,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

A higher commitment implies greater loyalty. The cost of terminating the relationship plays an important role in determining the linkage between relationship commitment and intention to stay. Commitment can sometimes be deceptive as seemingly loyal students may be actually less committed, i.e. they do not leave not because they are loyal but because of high relationship termination costs. Thus, relationship termination costs moderate the impact of relationship commitment on intention to stay. The research model developed in this study has two features. First, it examines the effects that relationship commitment and relationship termination costs have on intention to stay. Second, the moderating effect of relationship termination costs on the correlation between relationship commitment and intention to stay is also examined. The collected data is of associate degree or higher diploma students of ten self-financed tertiary education institutions in Hong Kong. The results support that relationship commitment and relationship termination costs have significant effects on intention to stay.

We find that human capital investment I has a significant positive effect on export performance, while human capital investment II shows a positive U-shaped relationship with export performance. Considering the heterogeneity of enterprise, the positive effect of human capital investment I is more significant than that of human capital investment II in enterprises with high R&D intensity. Moreover, with the improvement of technology intensity, both the promotion of human capital investment I and human capital investment II would generate greater influence on export performance.","[Jiang, Yonghong] Jinan Univ, Inst Finance, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yongliang; Ruan, Weihua; Rao, Junnan] Jinan Univ, Coll Econ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Jinan University; Jinan University,"Jiang, YH (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Inst Finance, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",ojyh@jnu.edu.cn,,,Education Department of Henan Province [2018-ZZJH-457]; Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China [15XJC790006],"Education Department of Henan Province; Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China(Ministry of Education, China)",This work was supported by The Education Department of Henan Province under Grant (No. 2018-ZZJH-457) and Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China under Grant (No. 15XJC790006).,,57,2,2,3,22,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Traditionally relying on Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) they are dependent on correct and up-to-date input data. So far, little success has been reached in estimating the effects of disturbances for freight. This paper aims to contribute to the understanding of disturbances in freight transport by reviewing and classifying the effects occurring due to transport time variability (TTV) and to suggest a calculation model to estimate the value of transport time variability (VTTV). In order to validate the model and its usability it was successfully tested in a case study for a large Swedish retail company. The effects of delays can be divided into four main types: System Killers, Catastrophic Events, Expected Risks, and Contingencies, of which the last two are relevant for VTTV. The model applies these in a two-step cost function with a fixed and variable part, building on previous studies of VTW for passenger transport based on the scheduling utility approach. A main theoretical result is that the estimation of VTTV is derived mathematically independently of which measure that is chosen for the quantification of TTV. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The article raises concerns that the RR model may incentivise port capital expenditure (investments), operating expenditure and port prices at levels that are not in the best interests of the country's economic and developmental objectives. Specifically, the RR method does not provide appropriate incentives to reduce costs and to improve productivity in the ports. TNPA and the Ports Regulator agree that the RR method is not designed for ports but, in the absence of a better method, it is used. For 2016/17, TNPA applied for a 5.91% tariff increase, the Ports Regulator decided on an average of 0% increase in tariffs. If the RR method continues to be used, then the value of the components in the RR model need to be reviewed, including the adoption of an asset beta lower than the present 0.5, and the inclusion of a debt beta. This article recalculated the TNPA 2016/17 tariff application and shows that if an asset beta of 0.4 is applied, and a debt beta is included, then there should be a tariff reduction of 2.83%.

In recent years, the Chinese government has allocated considerable funding and taken a number of legislative and regulatory steps for promoting the deployment of EVs. However, the increasing trend of EV adoption is not satisfying. In this paper, we investigate the factors that influence the diffusion of EVs in China from a multi-stakeholder perspective. Considering that decision makers' evaluation information is often imprecise and there can be significant dependence and feedback among influencing factors, a three-phase framework based on 2-tuple linguistic method and decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) is proposed. First, a set of specific influencing factors is identified through a literature review and expert interviews. Second, direct relations of the influencing factors are evaluated using the 2-tuple linguistic method. Third, the critical factors influencing the diffusion of EVs in China are determined via the DEMATEL technique. According to the results of an empirical case study, 'technological level', 'policies and regulations', 'consumer acceptance and expectation', 'price and models', and 'market structure and competition' are critical factors influencing the diffusion of EVs in the Chinese market, which should be emphasized by the government and automakers for the benefits of EV development.

This article takes an interdisciplinary law and economics approach to examine a dataset consisting of Swedish and Danish judgments and verdicts concerning the concept of an abnormally low tender. The purpose is to determine how the concept has developed in practice in two Scandinavian countries with similar legal traditions, and whether the national solutions are economically efficient. The data indicate that economic operators use various pricing strategies which may result in tenders being rejected as abnormally low or the awards of contracts to such tenders being contested. The pricing strategies will (over time) result in the contracting authorities paying too high a price and they are, therefore, economically inefficient. It is concluded that diverse solutions to the handling of abnormally low tenders have developed in the two countries and, notably, that the approaches differ with regard to how they treat different pricing strategies. Thus, the solutions are also different in terms of economic efficiency.","[Olykke, Grith Skovgaard] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Law, Solbjerg Plads 3,C5, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Olykke, Grith Skovgaard] Danish Complaints Board Publ Procurement, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Nystrom, Johan] Swedish Natl Rd & Transport Res Inst VTI, Linkoping, Sweden",Copenhagen Business School; VTI,"Olykke, GS (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Law, Solbjerg Plads 3,C5, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",goe.jur@cbs.dk,,,Konkurrensverket (the Swedish Competition Authority),Konkurrensverket (the Swedish Competition Authority),"Johan Nystrom is a senior research leader at The Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute (VTI).

What are the key future challenges? It makes clear that a variety of approaches are required to do justice to the complex and multi-faceted nature of poverty. The essential elements of the definition of poverty underpinning the research at the ESRI has been that poverty is something rooted in a lack of resources that results in exclusion from the customary standard of living. In pursuing such understanding over the last thirty years, the ESRI research programme has sought to develop measures exhibiting satisfactory levels of reliability and validity which are subject to re-evaluation in changing circumstances. The paper demonstrates that, viewed from a broader sociological perspective on social stratification, the fact that the complexities of poverty and social exclusion are far from being adequately captured by a single indicator relating to current disposable income is not surprising. Measurement of poverty must be viewed within a broader framework relating to the socially structured nature of disadvantage and social inequality. As a consequence poverty targets need to be framed in a manner which focuses attention on long-term structural issues.","[Watson, Dorothy; Maitre, Bertrand; Williams, James] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland; [Watson, Dorothy; Maitre, Bertrand; Williams, James] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; [Whelan, Christopher T.] Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin; University College Dublin,"Watson, D (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland.;Watson, D (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.",Dorothy.Watson@esri.ie,,,,,,,79,4,4,0,12,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

Accounting firms' managers must be prepared to effectively manage the increasing diversity of the profession. Aim: The purpose of the study was to identify the managerial competencies required by accounting firms managers to effectively manage diversity in KwaZulu-Natal. Setting: The setting for this study is accounting firms in KwaZulu-Natal. Methods: A prospective, descriptive and analytical, cross-sectional design using systematic sampling was employed. The responses of 45 accounting firms' managers and 114 trainees were analysed. Results: Both managers and trainees perceived the six managerial competencies important in managing diversity, but the ranking order of perceived importance indicated that there are variations in ratings. Teamwork and self-management competencies were highly rated by managers, while communication and teamwork competencies were highly rated by trainees. Conclusion: The managerial competencies are vital for the accounting firms' managers. The study suggests that the accounting firms' managers should consider the importance given by trainees and by themselves in prioritising the most important competencies they require in managing diversity. Accounting firms are encouraged to incorporate the six managerial competencies into the job descriptions or job advertisements and in the firms' management development programme or training and development programme as the managerial competencies will assist managers in managing the diverse workforce effectively.","[Mkhize, Msizi V.] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Coll Law & Management Studies, Durban, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal,"Mkhize, MV (通讯作者)，Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Coll Law & Management Studies, Durban, South Africa.",mkhizem4@ukzn.ac.za,,"Msizi, Mkhize/0000-0001-8499-9445",South African Institute of Chartered Accountants (SAICA),South African Institute of Chartered Accountants (SAICA),The study was funded by the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants (SAICA).,,31,2,2,1,5,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The expectation that smart cities may promote the adoption of scalable solutions that take advantage of information and communication technologies (ICT) to increase their effectiveness, reduce costs and to improve the quality of life is great among academia, business and governmental stakeholders. Traffic management systems in its multiple applications (including re-routing) are an example of ICT solutions that can expectably lead to the purpose pursued by 'smart cities'. This paper develops a performance evaluation of re-routing for passenger and commercial vehicles with a case study in the city of Lisbon, Portugal. The paper examines how the provision of guidance information to drivers affects traffic performance, operational costs and environmental conditions at different spatial references, namely route level and urban network level. The simulation results indicate that the re-routing can not only reduce travel times, but also enhance the efficiency of roads in the city network and as well the traffic performance at the route level of analysis. The improvement at local route levels (such as corridor/route) is more significant than at the city network level. For the urban network level, simulation results suggest that re-routing can bring variations in travel and delays that may reach 2% and 6%, respectively, when a 10% drivers' compliance rate is considered. Individual drivers are more likely to comply to deviate than urban logistics drivers and bus drivers.

It first considers approaches at European and national levels to SMSTs arguing in recent years there has been limited recognition that SMSTs have a significant role to play in the European territory. The paper provides an illustrative selection of towns from the ten case study countries. The research shows that the category SMSTs contains a varied and often dissimilar group of towns in a wide variety of regional contexts. This is true not only between countries but within them. The results indicate that while there are actions to support SMSTs that can be done at European level a prescriptive one-size fits all' approach should be avoided.

However, due to the dearth of available data, not much empirical evidence has been provided. This article empirically assesses the economic impact of Uber service on taxi drivers' business performance using a case study in Taiwan as an illustration. A difference-in-difference model is estimated using a population-based dataset of 29,434 taxi drivers. The results indicate that Uber reduced regular taxi drivers' service revenue by approximately 12 percent in the initial year and 18 percent in the third year of entry of Uber. This result may suggest a substitution relationship between Uber service and taxi operation. Moreover, the negative impact of Uber is more pronounced among taxi motorcade members, which may indicate that Uber competes with taxi passengers who usually use an electronic device to call for ride service. By further looking at the capacity utilization and operating miles, it is evident that the negative impacts of Uber on taxi drivers' service revenue are more likely associated with the reduction in operating miles of taxi drivers. To cope with competition from Uber, taxi drivers are more likely to have advertisements in or on the taxicab and to provide better ride service.","[Chang, Hung-Hao] Natl Taiwan Univ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chang, Hung-Hao] Taiwan Fair Trade Commiss TFTC, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Chang, HH (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Taipei, Taiwan.;Chang, HH (通讯作者)，Taiwan Fair Trade Commiss TFTC, Taipei, Taiwan.",hunghaochang@ntu.edu.tw,,,,,,,21,19,21,0,46,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Along with providing information on households often overlooked in other data sets, HIA has a wide array of questions. We find, in comparison to food secure households, that food insecure households are more likely to have challenges paying their bills and are more likely to use coping mechanisms. These effects are large, especially when compared to the standard set of explanatory variables. We also find that the impact of the standard set of covariates change dramatically when we include variables that are often unobserved, suggesting that there may be biases in some of the central findings on the determinants of the food insecurity.","[Gundersen, Craig] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Agr Strategy, Chicago, IL 60680 USA; [Engelhard, Emily] Feeding Amer, Res & Evaluat, Chicago, IL USA; [Hake, Monica] Feeding Amer, Social Policy Res & Anal, Chicago, IL USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Gundersen, C (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Agr Strategy, Chicago, IL 60680 USA.",cggunder@illinois.edu; eengelhard@feedingamerica.org; mhake@feedingamerica.org,,,,,,,24,28,49,1,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

Then, an experiment is conducted to search for these underlying causes. We do not replicate the finding that human advice is generally utilized more than automated advice. However, after receiving bad advice, utilization of automated advice decreased significantly more than advice from humans. We also find that decision makers describe themselves as having much more in common with human than automated advisors despite there being no interpersonal relationship in our study.

The paper examines the problem of a principal contracting with multiple agents whose activities are subject to common shocks. The presence of common shocks invites the use of relative performance evaluation to minimize the costs of moral hazard. But, in the additional presence of adverse selection, the analysis shows that there may be no need for ex ante screening through menus of offers. This is so because the principal becomes better informed ex post about agent types, via the realization of common uncertainty, and can effectively penalize or reward the agents ex post. Thus, unlike the standard adverse selection problem without common uncertainty where the principal always benefits from ex ante screening, it is shown that ex post sorting through relative performance evaluation reduces the scope for ex ante screening through menus, and can eliminate it completely if agents are known to not be very heterogeneous. This is consistent with observed practice in industries where the primary compensation mechanism is a cardinal tournament which is uniform among employees. The analysis connotes that by using relative instead of absolute performance measures, firms with employees who are not substantially heterogeneous not only can alleviate the agency problem, but there is also no need to extract the agents' ex ante private information about their innate abilities via a screening menu.","[Tsoulouhas, Theofanis] Univ Calif, Sch Social Sci Humanities & Arts, Ernest & Julio Gallo Management Program, Merced, CA 95340 USA",University of California System; University of California Merced,"Tsoulouhas, T (通讯作者)，Univ Calif, Sch Social Sci Humanities & Arts, Ernest & Julio Gallo Management Program, Merced, CA 95340 USA.",ftsoulouhas@ucmerced.edu,"Tsoulouhas, Theofanis/P-9601-2019",,,,,,40,2,3,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

This paper examines whether these reforms also affect incentives to develop new technologies. We develop a theoretical model that predicts that the impact of reducing liability risks for physicians on innovation may be positive or negative, depending on the characteristics of the technology. Empirically, we find that, on average, laws that limit the liability exposure of health care providers are associated with a significant reduction in medical device patenting. Tort reforms have the strongest impact in medical fields in which the probability of facing a malpractice claim is the largest, and they do not seem to affect the number of new technologies of the highest and lowest quality.

As regional impacts, the paper considers population and employment at the municipality level. The results demonstrate a positive but not significant effect on population and employment. The point estimates indicate that the population in municipalities near the constructed airports increased by 5% from 1970 to 1980, but the overall imprecision of the estimates makes it impossible to reject the hypothesis that the airports had no regional impacts.

As the program was streamlined to fit the different agro-climatic condition of the country, the extension approach practiced in the Tigray region (research area) was called Integrated Household Extension Program. Aim: This article reports on research aimed at measuring the technical efficiency levels of extension participants and non-participants; measuring the impact extension service on technical efficiency. Setting: The research was conducted in the northern part of the country, where agriculture is the main sources of livelihoods. Moisture is the most critical factor in the production system. The land holding size averages 0.5 ha per household compared to above three ha 30 years ago; indicating the high population pressure in the area. Methods: A sample of 362 agricultural extension service participants and 369 non-participant farm households from the northern part of Ethiopia, participated in the study. The stochastic production frontier technique was used to analyse the survey data and to compute farm-level technical efficiency. Results: The results showed an average level of technical efficiency of 48%. It is suggested that substantial gains in output and/or decrease in cost can be attained with the existing technology. All the variables included in the model to explain efficiency were found significant and with the expected sign, except education and number of dependants. Conclusion: The research tried to assess the impact of a new extension service (participatory in nature) on farmers' productivity in a semi-arid zone, as compared with the conventional extension service and found in the literature areas with relatively better climatic conditions. Hence, if extension administrators could work to uplift the average and below average farmers into better performing farmers level, the overall production and living condition could improve substantially in the research area, and more or less in the rest part of the country.","[Gebrehiwot, Kidanemariam G.] Univ South Africa, Coll Econ & Management Sci, Pretoria, South Africa; [Gebrehiwot, Kidanemariam G.] Mekelle Univ, Dept Econ, Mekelle, Ethiopia",University of South Africa; Mekelle University,"Gebrehiwot, KG (通讯作者)，Univ South Africa, Coll Econ & Management Sci, Pretoria, South Africa.;Gebrehiwot, KG (通讯作者)，Mekelle Univ, Dept Econ, Mekelle, Ethiopia.",kg9676@gmail.com,,,VLIR-UOS (Belgium) through the MU-IUC programme,VLIR-UOS (Belgium) through the MU-IUC programme,"The author wishes to express his profound gratitude to VLIR-UOS (Belgium) for the full and generous financial support of his PhD study through the MU-IUC programme.

The incidence of acid mine drainage and the high number of ownerless and abandoned mines in South Africa have brought the consequences of insufficient mine closure obligations in the mining sector into the spotlight. Aim: The aim of this study is to establish the extent to which platinum mines listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) comply with a recommended disclosure framework. Setting: South Africa is the largest producer of platinum in the world. The study covers all platinum mines listed on the JSE. Methods: Using a framework, a census of the annual financial statements, integrated annual reports and sustainability reports or websites was conducted to determine the level of compliance of disclosure relating to mine closure obligations to the recommended disclosure framework. Results: The results show disclosure relating to mine closure obligations of platinum mines listed on the JSE is inconsistent and not sufficient for stakeholders to understand the scope, key assumptions, parameters or reliability of the assessment and calculation of mine closure obligations. Conclusion: The assumptions used to determine mine closure obligations are specialised and multi-disciplinary. The accuracy and reliability of mine closure obligations will improve dramatically through greater transparency and access to information. It is recommended that the JSE listings for mining companies should require a competent person's report to provide disclosure on assumptions, key values and processes applied to determine the mine closure obligations. Furthermore, it is recommended that the Department of Mineral Resources implements a mechanism of independent assessment of mine closure obligations by experts on an ongoing basis.","[Sturdy, Joline; Cronje, Christo J.] Univ South Africa, Sch Appl Accountancy, Dept Financial Governance, Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa,"Sturdy, J (通讯作者)，Univ South Africa, Sch Appl Accountancy, Dept Financial Governance, Pretoria, South Africa.",sturdj@unisa.ac.za,,,,,,,37,2,2,0,6,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Social capital is a multidimensional concept that concerns consumers' ability to obtain benefits from their engagement in social activities and social networks. To test the hypotheses, we rely on data from the European Social Survey. The results indicate that the four indicators of social capital (bonding capital, bridging capital, trust in people, and trust in institutions) are negatively associated with perceived borrowing constraints, and that some of these associations are moderated by income. The relationship of bonding capital with perceived borrowing constraints appears to be stronger than that of bridging capital, and trust in people reveals a stronger association with the outcome variable than trust in institutions.

The downstream duopolists produce quality-differentiated products at different marginal costs. We show that the equilibrium input prices are closely related to the downstream quality gap and cost difference. When the monopolist simply charges a unit wholesale price for its input product, discriminatory pricing could be socially desirable even though the aggregate output remains unchanged.

Examining insider-trading civil cases filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from 2003 to 2011, we find that the price impact on insider-trading days is much smaller than the effect documented for the 1980s, consistent with increased fear of prosecution. Moreover, we find that preannouncement anticipatory run-up in comprehensive samples of takeover bids and earnings announcements is negatively related to resource-based measures of public enforcement intensity, which suggests that aggressive SEC enforcement deters illegal activity. In addition, we find that quoted bid-ask spreads are negatively related to the SEC's enforcement intensity, which suggests that greater enforcement improves liquidity. Moreover, the negative and significant relation between run-up and the SEC's enforcement intensity persists after controlling for quoted spreads.","[Del Guercio, Diane] Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Odders-White, Elizabeth R.; Ready, Mark J.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI USA",University of Oregon; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Del Guercio, D (通讯作者)，Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",,"Del Guercio, Diane G/E-5345-2011",,,,,,71,26,29,4,26,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

We then use this data to empirically investigate several important questions about the ideologies of clerks. First, we examine whether clerks tend to share the liberal ideology of other lawyers or the more conservative ideology associated with federal judges and find that clerks tend to be disproportionately liberal. Second, we investigate how the ideologies of clerks compares to the ideologies of lawyers and find that liberal lawyers are more likely to have clerked than conservatives. Third, we assess whether the ideologies of clerks differs based on the level of clerkship and find that the liberal skew becomes less pronounced as the prestige of the clerkship increases. Fourth, we analyze the relationship between ideology and the hiring of clerks and find that the ideology of judges is strongly correlated with the ideology of their clerks.","[Bonica, Adam] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Chilton, Adam S.] Univ Chicago, Sch Law, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Goldin, Jacob] Stanford Law Sch, Stanford, CA USA; [Rozema, Kyle] Northwestern Univ, Pritzker Sch Law, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Sen, Maya] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Stanford University; University of Chicago; Stanford University; Northwestern University; Harvard University,"Chilton, AS (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Sch Law, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",adamchilton@uchicago.edu,"Bonica, Adam/AAQ-1776-2021","Bonica, Adam/0000-0002-3004-9441",,,,,43,17,26,1,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1465-7252,1465-7260,,AM LAW ECON REV,Am.

Toys R Us, Inc., 2009) was the first to explore the economic consequences of resale price maintenance after the Supreme Court's Leegin decision. Previously, litigation concerned the presence or absence of an agreement; but that changed with the new jurisprudence which instead emphasized the restraint's direct anti-competitive effects. While the district court's decision in the Babies R Us case rested on the factual circumstances of the case, it did not have before it an economic model through which those facts could be integrated. This paper offers such a model, the predicates of which are drawn from the case.

This is particularly relevant in countries with high gasoline taxes like the EU or countries that introduce gasoline taxes like China. One of the major barriers in the reform is the allocation of revenues: when the goal of the federal government is to keep the gasoline tax revenue constant, a vertical tax conflict reduces the efficiency gains of the new instruments. Another barrier is the presence of spillovers: it elicits tax-exporting behavior by regional governments and the high taxes overly discourage traffic. We find the efficiency loss of the first barrier to be small and spillover inefficiency to be larger. When infrastructure capacity is flexible, the spillover inefficiency tends to be larger if pricing and capacity decisions are decentralized and smaller if only pricing or capacity decisions are decentralized.","[Fung, Chau Man; Proost, Stef] Univ Leuven, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Naamse Str 69, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Fung, CM (通讯作者)，Univ Leuven, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Naamse Str 69, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",chauman.fung@kuleuven.be; stef.proost@kuleuven.be,,"Proost, Stefaan/0000-0003-3731-4532",EIBurs program of European Investment Bank [EIBURS_100113],EIBurs program of European Investment Bank,We thank the editor and two referees for very useful comments and suggestions.

J,"Mantello, P",,,,"Mantello, Peter",,,Military Shooter Video Games and the Ontopolitics of Derivative Wars and Arms Culture,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND SOCIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The military shooter (MS) video game is the latest in a long line of video games that immerse the player in a fantasy world. Although the MS video game was once regarded as excessively violent, it has now become socially acceptable, as the virtues of military life have become incorporated in popular culture. That transition has taken place in part because the military has begun to work closely with the producers of MS video games, such as the Call of Duty series, to imagine and prepare for future military threats, both on virtual battlefields and on actual terrain. The increasing use of highly paid corporate mercenaries in actual war zones has also influenced game play by introducing players to the potential for large financial rewards by becoming experts in virtual combat. Thus, MS video games incorporate players not only into the technological domain of modern warfare but also into the economic domain of fighting war for profit. In the post 9/11 era, warfare has increasingly become a strategy of risk management, in which the battlefield is less a physical space than a semiotic landscape of conflicting loyalties and financial incentives. The MS shooter game is conditioning the soldiers of the future to fight in this shadowy world that lies between the virtual and the real. All of these changes have political ramifications. In the long run, constant exposure to these games is creating a subculture that is not only immersed in an armament culture but also increasingly allied with current patterns of geopolitical domination and subordination.","[Mantello, Peter] Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific Univ, Beppu, Oita, Japan",Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University,"Mantello, P (通讯作者)，Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific Univ, Beppu, Oita, Japan.",,"Mantello, Peter Andrew/AAJ-5270-2021","Mantello, Peter Andrew/0000-0001-7421-5088",,,,,52,4,5,1,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Novels and films in the West have portrayed the Soviet army as brutal and genocidal and the mujahideen who resisted the invaders as freedom fighters. Russian movies have also portrayed the soldiers in a somewhat negative light and the mujahideen as evil terrorists. No fictional treatment has provided enough background to the conflict to reveal that the Russians entered Afghanistan only to provide support to a communist regime that had gained power on its own, and none have revealed the extent of aid from the United States, the United Kingdom, Iran, Pakistan, and China to the mujahideen. The CIA sponsored Charlie Wilson's War, the movie that comes closest to capturing the larger context of the war, but even in that case, crucial elements were removed from early drafts of the script that presented a more complex and accurate picture of the war. In particular, movies have failed to explore the possible links between U.S. support for mujahideen in the 1980s and violent attacks by Islamic extremists since 2001. The one exception is Charlie Wilson's War, where changes to the script had the result of downplaying and trivializing those links.",,,,,,,,,,,19,1,1,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

The approach uses a single stochastic model to capture such interdependence. However, it may be inappropriate to assume a single coherence structure at all time t. In this paper, we propose the use of a mixture of stochastic covariance models to generalize the approach and offer greater flexibility in real data applications. Parameter estimation is performed by Bayesian analysis with Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling schemes. We conduct a simulation study on three different model setups and evaluate the performance of estimation and model selection. We also apply our modeling methods to high-frequency stock data from Hong Kong. Model selection favors a mixture rather than non-mixture model. In a real data study, we demonstrate that the mixture model is able to identify structural changes in market risk, as evidenced by a drastic change in mixture proportions over time.

I introduce a two-stage strategic model in which complementary-input monopolists offer supply schedules to producers and then engage in bilateral bargaining with producers. The main result is that there is a unique weakly dominant strategy equilibrium, the equilibrium attains the joint-profit-maximizing outcome, and output equals that of a bundling monopoly. The result holds with perfect competition in the downstream market with both unit capacity and multiunit capacity. The result also holds with oligopoly competition in the downstream market. The result contrasts with the Cournot effect, which states that complementary-input monopolists choose total prices that are greater than the bundled-monopoly level. The analysis shows that consumers' surplus and total producers' surplus are greater with supply schedules and bargaining than with posted-price competition. The analysis has implications for antitrust policy toward vertical and conglomerate mergers.","[Spulber, Daniel F.] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Spulber, DF (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",,"Spulber, Daniel F/A-8722-2009","Spulber, Daniel F/0000-0003-2697-6522",Qualcomm; Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation; Kellogg School of Management,Qualcomm; Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation; Kellogg School of Management,"I gratefully acknowledge research grant support from Qualcomm, the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, and the Kellogg School of Management.

The results showed that PV affected positively by customer image (CI), customer expectation (CE), perceived quality of hardware and software. In addition, PV influences CS. On the other hand, CS affects CL positively. Based on the results, CS is the most important factor in determining CL. Therefore, organizations should go beyond customers' initial needs, meet customers' expectations and focus on creating loyalty and faithfulness by building a long-term, profitable and mutual relationship rather than concentrating on customer satisfaction solely.

Using experts in a demand forecasting framework, this work aims to compare the accuracy improvements and forecasting performances of three judgmental integration methods. To do this, a field study was conducted with 31 experts from four companies. The methods compared were the judgmental adjustment, the 50-50 combination, and the divide-and-conquer. Forecaster expertise, the credibility of system forecasts and the need to rectify system forecasts were also assessed, and mechanisms for performing this assessment were considered. When (a) a forecaster's relative expertise was high, (b) the relative credibility of the system forecasts was low, and (c) the system forecasts had a strong need of correction, judgmental adjustment improved the accuracy relative to both the other integration methods and the system forecasts. Experts with higher levels of expertise showed higher adjustment frequencies. Our results suggest that judgmental adjustment promises to be valuable in the long term if adequate conditions of forecaster expertise and the credibility of system forecasts are met.

This Index was developed by Balassa and has evolved through several studies. With the use of analysis, we consider whether Austria is a rival for these two countries. Austria's competitiveness lies in traditional, yet globally declining sectors such as travel, transport, other business services, financial services and construction, while the country is weak in telecommunications, computer and information services, insurance, royalties and licence fees, personal, cultural and recreational services.","[Beno, Michal; Saxunova, Darina] Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Odbojarov 10,POB 95, Bratislava 82005, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Beno, M (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Odbojarov 10,POB 95, Bratislava 82005, Slovakia.",michal.beno@fm.uniba.sk; darina.saxunova@fm.uniba.sk,"Saxunova, Darina/AAI-3403-2020; Beno, Michal/AAE-5028-2021","Beno, Michal/0000-0003-2869-2646",,,,,15,2,2,0,1,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-499-5,,,,2017,,,,,,,106,114,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ7IS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427306200012,0

Many authors document that the process has stopped, that it is a myth associated with human development. Other authors regard this issue as pressing and are looking for ways to solve it. The present authors consider the problem very closely linked to the quality of life and standard of living of the local inhabitants. The standard of living derives from the extent to which human needs are met. This is not just a case of material needs but of overall living conditions, formed by the quality of housing, the environment, how to spend leisure time, educational attainment, health care availability, etc. The standard of living is often expressed in terms of money spent, in the form of prices for goods and services. This way of measuring the standard of living is especially suitable when making living standards comparisons (between countries, regions, etc.). The aim of this paper is to compare the standard of living of countryside and city dwellers, (in municipalities, towns and the metropolitan capital city of Prague). This comparison is done by expenditure on each of the items comprising the COICOP, corresponding to the factors significantly implicated in the standards of living (housing, education, recreation, availability of medical care, etc). To allow the time factor to be considered, the findings of the 2007-2014 surveys were analyzed. The evaluation of the findings was done by testing for significant differences and using cluster analysis.","[Birciakova, Nad'a; Stavkova, Jana; Turcinkova, Jana] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Birciaková, N (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",nada.birciakova@mendelu.cz; jana.stavkova@mendelu.cz; jana.turcinkova@mendelu.cz,"Hazuchova, Nada/V-6354-2018; Stávková, Jana/T-8950-2017; Turcinkova, Jana/C-3071-2013","Stávková, Jana/0000-0002-0889-0218; Turcinkova, Jana/0000-0001-9574-9337",,,,,11,0,0,2,7,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-499-5,,,,2017,,,,,,,140,150,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ7IS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427306200015,0

Furthermore, we find that start-ups that are primarily active in business-to-consumer markets instead of business-to-business markets are more likely to file trademarks. Finally, the involvement of a venture capitalist (VC) affects the initial IP application. VC-backed start-ups are more likely than other start-ups to file initial IP in the form of trademarks rather than patents.

Main research methods are comparative analysis and historical case studies used to present role of government in studied countries. The analysis shows a clear gap between market economies and state capitalism. China is being classified as efficient-driven economy, as opposed to the USA, Germany and Japan, which are classified under innovation-driven economies. China records good score for economic performance, but government and business efficiency are assessed poorly. The greatest challenges for the Chinese economy are: limited access to financing, inflation, policy instability, inefficient government bureaucracy and corruption.

The objective of the current paper is to investigate the impact of crisis on public transport users' satisfaction, and demand. Data from two user satisfaction surveys that took place in Athens in 2008 and 2013 are used for the analysis. A hybrid choice and latent variable model is developed, to model the increase of public transport demand within the last five years. As exploratory variables are used demographic characteristics and travel attributes. The satisfaction of the users about the quality of public transport service is included as latent variable into the model. The results show that overall people use public transport in 2013 more than in 2008. More specifically, the improved satisfaction about the quality of service has led to increase of public transport demand. Environmental consciousness, public transport service improvement, and high car use and maintenance costs have turned people towards public transport; on the other hand, increased ticket prices, as well as increased preference to use other modes (car, bike and walk) have turned others to use it less. The demonstrated increase of public transport market share comes in contrast with studies that support the opposite, not taking into consideration the general decrease of commuting activities due to the increase of unemployment.","[Efthymiou, Dimitrios; Antoniou, Constantinos] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Rural & Surveying Engn, Lab Transportat Engn, 9 Iroon Polytech St Zografou Campus, Athens 15780, Greece",National Technical University of Athens,"Efthymiou, D (通讯作者)，Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Rural & Surveying Engn, Lab Transportat Engn, 9 Iroon Polytech St Zografou Campus, Athens 15780, Greece.",defthym@mail.ntua.gr; antoniou@central.ntua.gr,"Antoniou, Constantinos/K-4980-2019","Antoniou, Constantinos/0000-0003-0203-9542; Efthymiou, Dimitrios/0000-0003-0979-4188",,,,,41,42,47,0,34,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

Existing simulation evidence supports the use of a fixed-effects approach when forecasting but it is not based on a truly micro panel set-up. In this study, we exploit the linkage of a representative survey of more than 250,000 Australians aged 45 and over to 4years of hospital, medical and pharmaceutical records. The availability of panel health cost data allows the use of predictors based on fixed-effects estimates designed to guard against possible omitted variable biases associated with unobservable individual specific effects. We demonstrate the preference towards fixed-effects-based predictors is unlikely to hold in many practical situations, including our models of health care costs. Simulation evidence with a micro panel set-up adds support and additional insights to the results obtained in the application. These results are supportive of the use of the ordinary least squares predictor in a wide range of circumstances.

BCM is a nascent disaster preparedness and recovery strategy that seeks to protect vital business operations from disruptions. The paper traces contemporary BCM back to Cold War continuity of government planning, and shows how BCM came to comprehend security as continuity of processes rather than integrity of goods. BCM is prominent in finance because it promises to mitigate operational risks, and it focuses on risks stemming from interdependencies in financial infrastructures. By engaging with two events that triggered continuity management in banks, Hurricane Sandy in New York City and the Blockupy' demonstrations in Frankfurt, the paper highlights how BCM is challenged by large-scale disasters as well as acts of public criticism.","[Folkers, Andreas] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Social Sci, Inst Sociol, Theodor W Adorno Pl 6,PEG Bldg,Post Box 31, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Folkers, A (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Social Sci, Inst Sociol, Theodor W Adorno Pl 6,PEG Bldg,Post Box 31, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany.",folkers@em.uni-frankfurt.de,,,,,,,97,12,13,4,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

The authors build and empirically utilise the measure of systemic risk, which is based on the traditional CoVaR approach, as proposed by Adrian and Brunenmeier (CoVaR. Staff Report No. 348, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 2008 [revised September 2014]; CoVaR. NBER Working Paper No. 17454, National Bureau of Economic Research, 2011; Am Econ Rev 106: 1705-1741, 2016), but uses market-based data (instead of the book values) for calculation. The assumptions of this method, among all else are that 1) the aspects of systemic risk which closely relate to financial system stability, for relatively small financial systems, where the banking sector is the main provided of funding and liquidity, may be modelled with banking-sector-based methods; and 2) the stock market is efficient enough to price the risk related to those financial institutions, whose stocks are quoted on the relevant stock exchange. The empirical research is carried on the example of Poland, as in the authors opinion, also following the literature, the two mentioned assumptions hold for this particular country. The paper concludes with ideas for future research, including further development of the proposed method to include institutions other than banks, and a range of other central European countries for which this method is applicable.","[Karas, Marta; Szczepaniak, Witold] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Financial Investment & Risk Management, Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Karas, M (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Financial Investment & Risk Management, Wroclaw, Poland.",marta.karas@ue.wroc.pl; witold.szczepaniak@ue.wroc.pl,"Karaś, Marta/ABA-5742-2021","Karaś, Marta/0000-0003-2589-8147",,,,,5,4,4,0,5,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,,978-3-319-54885-2; 978-3-319-54884-5,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,135,143,,10.1007/978-3-319-54885-2_13,0.0,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI5UA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412819500013,0

In the global diffusion of ideas and practices, the decoupling of global policies and domestic practice is endemic, a process that this paper argues results from competing domestic interests and orientations. I examine this process of 'lateral decoupling' in a case study of the reception of the United Nations Global Compact among corporate responsibility practitioners in the city-state of Singapore. Differences in ceremonial, pragmatic and non-adversarial orientations towards global corporate responsibility generated significant uncertainty for businesses around how to apply corporate responsibility principles. In response, businesses constructed distinct narratives: large transnational and domestic companies emphasized values, community and tradition, while small businesses focused on the competitive advantages of corporate responsibility. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of domestic institutions for mediating global principles and local outcomes.","[Lim, Alwyn] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Social Sci, Level 4,04-047,90 Stamford Rd, Singapore 178903, Singapore",Singapore Management University,"Lim, A (通讯作者)，Singapore Management Univ, Sch Social Sci, Level 4,04-047,90 Stamford Rd, Singapore 178903, Singapore.",alwynlim@smu.edu.sg,,,"National Science Foundation [1003182]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1003182] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1003182] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",Field research for this paper was partially funded by the National Science Foundation [award number 1003182].,,84,5,6,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

To advance the economization programme and other materialist frameworks, I argue that the existing literature does not pay enough attention to the diverse modes of carbon accounting and, in particular, carbon measurement- the most basic step- is overlooked and undertheorized. Drawing from the critical metrology' approach, I suggest that we need to take carbon's diverse materialities seriously in the study of marketization processes. Some carbons are more cooperative than others. I, therefore, argue that it is important to conceptualize pacification' as a dynamic process that is mediated through materials of varying capacities as well as standards and technologies. The empirical case examined here concerns carbon measurement standards at coal-fired power plants- an extreme case' in the sense that coal is well-understood and relatively easy to measure. My findings indicate that, even for one of the most cooperative' carbons, measurement uncertainties are significant and pose challenges for the marketization of carbon emissions. While human actors work to cope with these uncertainties, the contours of the market are ultimately constrained by carbon's materiality.","[Liu, John Chung-En] Occidental Coll, Dept Sociol, 1600 Campus Rd, Los Angeles, CA 90041 USA",Occidental College,"Liu, JCE (通讯作者)，Occidental Coll, Dept Sociol, 1600 Campus Rd, Los Angeles, CA 90041 USA.",chungenliu@oxy.edu,"Liu, John Chung-En/AHA-5988-2022","Liu, John Chung-En/0000-0001-8073-1425",Social Science Research Council (SSRC) through the International Dissertation Research Fellowship (IDRF); Vilas Research Travel Award; EU Center of Excellence Research Travel Grant; Crowe Scholarship from the University of Wisconsin-Madison,Social Science Research Council (SSRC) through the International Dissertation Research Fellowship (IDRF); Vilas Research Travel Award; EU Center of Excellence Research Travel Grant; Crowe Scholarship from the University of Wisconsin-Madison,"This research is supported by the Social Science Research Council (SSRC) through the International Dissertation Research Fellowship (IDRF), as well as the Vilas Research Travel Award, EU Center of Excellence Research Travel Grant, and the Crowe Scholarship from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.",,68,11,12,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Focusing on technological aspects of the firm as well as investigating internal and external factors, we suggest that the internal technological diversity of the focal firm, as well as the technological uncertainty of the industry, affects the technological diversity of the alliance portfolio. The hypotheses are tested on a sample of U.S.-listed semiconductor firms' global R&D alliances from 1990 to 2010. We find that the internal technological diversity of a firm has a negative influence on its technological alliance portfolio diversity. However, technological alliance portfolio diversity seems unaffected by the uncertainty of the firm's environment.

The results of the analysis showed that there are two factors had a main effect on product damage, as well as five bilateral interactions and five triple interactions that had a clear effect on the dairy product damage.","[Mohammed, Bahr Kadhim; Odah, Meshal Harbi; Bager, Ali Sadig Mohommed] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Mohammed, Bahr Kadhim] Univ AL Qadisiyah, Al Diwaniyah, Iraq; [Odah, Meshal Harbi; Bager, Ali Sadig Mohommed] Muthanna Univ, Samawah, Iraq",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; University of Al-Qadisiyah; Al-Muthanna University,"Mohammed, BK (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.;Mohammed, BK (通讯作者)，Univ AL Qadisiyah, Al Diwaniyah, Iraq.",baherm@yahoo.com; m.algelidh@gmail.com; nader.ali62@yahoo.com,"Odah, Meshal Harbi/E-1557-2019; Bager, Ali Sadig Mohommed/D-8999-2019","Odah, Meshal Harbi/0000-0001-8144-6095;",,,,,10,1,1,0,0,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",2286-1440,,,INT MANAGE CONF,,,2017,,,,,,,26,34,,,,,,9,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM6KT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000466917100004,0

We develop an identification framework based on the intra-household allocation and cultural transmission literatures that shows how different assumptions about parental response to time-varying unobserved changes in children's prosocial values can be combined with the child fixed effects estimate and the difference between siblings' over-time-differences estimate to infer a bound on the causal effect of parental action to socialize their children. Under the identifying assumption we think is most reasonable for socializing the willingness to give to charity, that parents treat the socialization actions of others as cultural substitutes, our estimates imply that talking to children about giving raises the probability of children's giving by at least .13. We find no evidence that parental role-modeling affects children's giving, except among non-African-American girls. The identification framework and substantive results have implications for those with a general interest in using data from naturalistic settings to estimate causal effects of parental socialization actions, those interested in the external validity of laboratory findings, and those interested in the socialization of warm glow.","[Ottoni-Wilhelm, Mark] Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Econ, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Ottoni-Wilhelm, Mark] Indiana Univ, Lilly Family Sch Philanthropy, Indianapolis, IN 46204 USA; [Zhang, Ye] IMPAQ Int LLC, Columbia, MD USA; [Estell, David B.] Indiana Univ, Dept Counseling & Educ Psychol, Bloomington, IN USA; [Perdue, Neil H.] Univ Indianapolis, Sch Psychol Sci, Indianapolis, IN 46227 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis; Indiana University System; Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis; American Institutes for Research; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University of Indianapolis,"Ottoni-Wilhelm, M (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Econ, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA.;Ottoni-Wilhelm, M (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Lilly Family Sch Philanthropy, Indianapolis, IN 46204 USA.",mowilhel@iupui.edu; yzhang2@impaqint.com,,,"Notre Dame Science of Generosity project; Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy Research Fund; Atlantic Philanthropies; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; Charles Stewart Mott Foundation; John Templeton Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Notre Dame Science of Generosity project; Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy Research Fund; Atlantic Philanthropies; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates FoundationBill & Melinda Gates Foundation Grand Challenges Explorations InitiativeCGIAR); Charles Stewart Mott Foundation; John Templeton Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","This work was funded by the Notre Dame Science of Generosity project.

In the year 2004 Poland accessed the European Union, which was a significant development impulse for the economy. The year 2012 is the last year where the data was available. The major objective of the article is to analyse the convergence process at the regional level in Poland with the application of two spatial regimes that allowed grouping the regions to two homogenous groups: the western area, consisting of the regions with high levels of socio-economic development, and a much weaker economically eastern area. In connection with the proposed objective, club convergence was analysed, where additionally a spatial autoregression of independent process was assumed. For both spatial regimes, the conditional beta-convergence was analysed, where the average investment level for regions was taken as an independent variable determining the steady state. Estimation of the parameters of a spatial switching regression model allowed the identification of spatial interrelations of the GDP per capita and its growth rate for the sub-regions in Poland. The study also allowed the identification of differences in the convergence process for the two assumed spatial regimes. In the case of the western sub-region, the convergence process was confirmed, whereas in the case of the eastern one, a lack of convergence process was noted. This means that in Poland there is a phenomenon of economic polarization in the case of the two assumed spatial regimes. Poland's accession to the EU gave an impulse for a stronger development of western regions with a good socio-economic situation. On the other hand, a much slower development of the eastern area in the years 2004-2012 was observed, which in the long term may contribute to the preservation of low level of economic development of the eastern area. Additionally, there is a tendency to drain the most valuable resources from the eastern to the western area. It means that in the case of lack of more effective regional policy than the one implemented in the analysed period, the eastern sub-region can suffer further economic deterioration, which will contribute to the problem of unsustainable growth in the country.","[Pietrzak, Michal Bernard] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Econometr & Stat, Torun, Poland; [Balcerzak, Adam P.] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Econ, Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University; Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Balcerzak, AP (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Econ, Torun, Poland.",michal.pietrzak@umk.pl; adam.balcerzak@umk.pl,"Balcerzak, Adam/D-7224-2016; Pietrzak, Michal Bernard/I-4919-2014","Balcerzak, Adam/0000-0003-0352-1373; Pietrzak, Michal Bernard/0000-0002-9263-4478",,,,,47,6,6,1,2,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-54112-9; 978-3-319-54111-2,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2017,7,,,,,,257,268,,10.1007/978-3-319-54112-9_16,0.0,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ4CE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000424822700016,0

Denunciatory technologies are mechanisms that allow citizens to report one another to the state for a wide range of wrongdoing, such as welfare fraud. The scarce literature on such initiatives relies heavily on concepts of neoliberalism to explain their emergence and operation. I first argue that a focus on neoliberalism fails to recognize these technologies as a sophisticated type of statecraft that promotes public sensibilities. I then offer a more robust account of denunciatory technologies. Rather than relying on an analysis of neoliberalism, I argue that these technologies fuse the policing of political criminals like the welfare cheat' to the very notion of public good', and refract vertical populist energies back onto the population. I conclude that, through such technologies, publics become an integral tool in their own governance.","[Sanscartier, Matthew D.] Carleton Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, B750 Loeb Bldg,1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada",Carleton University,"Sanscartier, MD (通讯作者)，Carleton Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, B750 Loeb Bldg,1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",matthew.sanscartier@carleton.ca,,,,,,,70,6,6,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

The start was made with very famous impossible trinity, which nurtured generation of economists. After that came the so-called blessed and unblessed trinities, the peso and the dollarization trinity. With the appearance of the crises occurred diverse financial trinities, new trilemmas, monetary union trilemmas, and last but not least political economic and international trilemmas. Trinities have been used in the field of the monetary policy and exchange rate arrangements, in the international financial sector, in the Euro zone crisis, in the European banking union discussion, and in the field of the political economy. There are many trinities which entail many important trilemmas which make our life difficult. We believe, it is time to look at those triangles or trinities as a single unity, as a single methodology. We would like to understand their meaning, to investigate them systematically, to see if they are related together, last but not least we would like to discover the real message they are trying to convey. In order to do that, we classified the trilemmas in four groups, the first, second, and third generation trilemmas and as fourth group the political economy trilemmas. Our classification is not based on econometrics or other statistical methods. It is based on intuition and simple experience on how the financial sector was developed in the last decades. We must note that we will not consider all the possible trinities which have appeared occasionally but the most important. Therefore, after the introduction, in the first part of the paper we discuss the first generation of the trinities, those from the field of the international monetary and exchange rate theory, where we start with the classical impossible trinity, which seems to be the first one used in this kind of methodology and we continue with the blessed and unblessed, peso and dollarization trinities. In the second part we discuss the second generation of the trinities, those of the field of the international financial market, where we discuss the international financial trinity and holy trinity. In the third part of the paper, we investigate the third generation trinities, those that have been used to discuss the situation in the Euro zone after the crisis and we start with triangle with a new impossible trinity, the financial/fiscal trinity and the monetary trinity for EMU. In the fourth part of our paper, we discuss the triangles which are used in the field of the political economy and the international relation where we discuss a number of political trinities. Using this simple methodology we do not discover a hidden theory. No they don't carry a new theory but they carry some strong message. From the theoretical point of view all the trinities are not very dissimilar to each other and nearly every one carry the same message, i.e., the importance of the monetary and financial sector and the problem the trilemmas express always has to do with the way the monetary and financial sector is combined with the others sectors in the economy. From the praxis point of view we discovered that the trinities should not be interpreted strictly because politicians and the authorities use the degree of freedom they have to choose the degree of capital transactions openness, the degree of exchange rate flexibility and that of the monetary independence?","[Siskou, Thomas] Technol Inst Western Macedonian, Dept Int Trade, Fourka Area 52100, Kastoria, Greece",,"Siskou, T (通讯作者)，Technol Inst Western Macedonian, Dept Int Trade, Fourka Area 52100, Kastoria, Greece.",t.siskou@kastoria.teikoz.gr,,,,,,,45,0,0,0,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-48454-9; 978-3-319-48453-2,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,433,463,,10.1007/978-3-319-48454-9_30,0.0,,,31,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1MX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447881400030,0

The concern was generated by increasing market concentration in dairy industry, which could result in lower milk prices for farmers due to increasing market power. Estimation of market power was based on the New Empirical Industrial Organisation (NEIO) models. Empirical research results showed that there was an oligopsony market power in the Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian raw milk market. Multicriteria complex comparison of dairy farm performance showed that Lithuanian farmers were in relatively better situation, but Estonian farmers showed the best growth rate.

The teachers were those from two public schools under the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration and in-service teachers taking a course leading to a graduate diploma in teaching profession. Results showed that the majority of Thai teachers rated their English performance as being low, but their need to use English was at an average level. Teachers with BAs and those with MAs did not significantly differ in their English language competence and use. It was also revealed that their English language competence affected their ability to integrate English in other subjects.

Pick-up points are one of the main alternatives to tackle last-mile issues within e-commerce deliveries. Nevertheless, a lack of strategic planning and understanding of the spatial interactions between pick-up points and the customers can be limiting their potential. The purpose of this paper is to shed light on the current state of the pick-up point networks in the Belgian city of Antwerp and from there and inspired on the concepts of urban logistics construct indicators to assess such networks in other places in the world. The collection of data for this paper came via a sample survey from the main carriers currently performing home deliveries in the city. By using the current demand for e-commerce, we analysed the main performance indicators of the networks based on the principles of urban logistics. Firstly, we calculated the catchment area of each pick-up point by measuring the number of customers that fall within a 5-minute walking range. Secondly, we analysed the type of establishment where the point is located. Thirdly, we checked to which extent the points are clustered via a Clark an Evans test. Finally, we assessed the availability of the points in terms of opening hours and closing days. The analysis showed that the networks under analysis still not fully address the expectations of sustainability. The results showed that the availability and accessibility of those networks do not encourage the use of non-motorized vehicles or the chaining of pick-up trips with other activities. The results suggest that a more strategic planning is needed to harmonise the objectives of the private stakeholders with the public ones. In this paper, a novel analysis of pick-up points networks is proposed. In the literature similar analysis can be found in other countries. However, in this analysis, not only traditional indicators as the distance and the type of shop are assessed. Because in the literature review we found that the consumer trip behaviour is affected by the availability and the potential to combine the trip with other shopping activities, we include indicators as the specific type of shop that is in charge of providing the services, the opening and closing hours, as well as spatial indicators. This analysis can help to contribute to a better and more suitable planning of pick-up point networks. In the analysis, we show how the selected location of the network can impact the sustainable use of the points and how to aim for a better configuration.","[Cardenas, Ivan Dario; Beckers, Joris] Univ Antwerp, Dept Transport & Reg Econ, Antwerp, Belgium",University of Antwerp,"Cardenas, ID (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Dept Transport & Reg Econ, Antwerp, Belgium.",ivandario.cardenasbarbosa@uantwerpen.be,"Cardenas, Ivan/JHU-7453-2023","Cardenas, Ivan Dario/0000-0003-1204-373X; Beckers, Joris/0000-0003-1900-7037",,,,,19,6,6,4,38,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

However, there is much more nuance to Beccaria's writings that economists can learn from, including a unique psychological point of view that predates behavioral law-and-economics, as well as aspects of his prescriptions regarding criminal penalties that resemble retributivism, a theory of punishment often contrasted with deterrence. A deeper appreciation of Beccaria's work may result in a richer and more humanistic economic approach to crime.","[White, Mark D.] CUNY Coll Staten Isl, Staten Isl, NY 10314 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; College of Staten Island (CUNY),"White, MD (通讯作者)，CUNY Coll Staten Isl, Staten Isl, NY 10314 USA.",profmdwhite@hotmail.com,,,,,,,52,5,6,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Whereas the time-space compression brought by this new technology can have significant impacts in residents' travel behaviour and household mobility, similar to those documented for high-speed rail, this paper investigates how the proposed California Hyperloop could expand airline passengers' choice of airports for long-distance domestic trips. Using an established method to determine airport catchment areas based on flight frequencies, access times, and travel costs, we provide an exploratory analysis of how airport competition could change if a Hyperloop service was introduced. Our results clearly show that the California airport network will move towards a single airport system, with significant short-term leakage effects between major airports. These effects should be taken into consideration in the economic assessment of potential Hyperloop routes connecting major cities.","[Voltes-Dorta, Augusto; Becker, Eliad] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Business, Edinburgh EH8 9JS, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Voltes-Dorta, A (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Sch Business, Edinburgh EH8 9JS, Midlothian, Scotland.",avoltes@becarios.ulpgc.es,,,,,,,44,15,15,1,44,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

Despite her dedication to the women's movement and contributions to feminist literature, her novel Herland (1915) features problematic undertones of racism, elitism, and masculine degradation. Within recent years, feminism has become a term that is synonymous with inclusivity, with a focus on intersectionality and the rights of not only women but others who have been disenfranchised by race, religious affiliation, sexuality, socioeconomic status, or gender identification. Given modern feminism's focus on diversity, the racist undertones and focus on gender separatism in Herland places Gilman outside the feminist literary genre, particularly as it has been defined in recent decades.","[Bowers, Elinor] Univ York, Victorian Literature & Culture, York, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Bowers, E (通讯作者)，Univ York, Victorian Literature & Culture, York, N Yorkshire, England.",elinorbowers@hotmail.co.uk,,,,,,,17,1,1,3,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Our analysis shows that, among the women studied, those whose own mothers are retirement eligible have a 11% higher probability of being in the labor force than those whose mothers are ineligible. The pension eligibility of maternal grandfathers and paternal grandparents, however, has no significant effect on the women's labor force participation. We also demonstrate that the eligibility of maternal grandmothers mainly captures the effect of their availability for childcare. Hence, pension reforms, by potentially robbing households of an important source of flexible, low-cost childcare, could have unintended negative consequences for the employment rates of women with young children.","[Bratti, Massimiliano] European Commiss, JRC, Via E Fermi 2749,TP 361, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy; [Bratti, Massimiliano; Frattini, Tommaso] Univ Milan, DEMM, Via Conservatorio 7, I-20122 Milan, Italy; [Bratti, Massimiliano; Frattini, Tommaso] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Bratti, Massimiliano; Frattini, Tommaso] LdA, Milan, Italy; [Frattini, Tommaso] CReAM, London, England; [Frattini, Tommaso] Dondena Ctr Res Social Dynam & Publ Policy, Milan, Italy; [Frattini, Tommaso] CEPR, London, England; [Scervini, Francesco] Univ Pavia, DSPS, Corso Str Nuova 65, I-27100 Pavia, Italy",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; University of Milan; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of Pavia,"Bratti, M (通讯作者)，European Commiss, JRC, Via E Fermi 2749,TP 361, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy.;Bratti, M (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, DEMM, Via Conservatorio 7, I-20122 Milan, Italy.;Bratti, M (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.;Bratti, M (通讯作者)，LdA, Milan, Italy.",massimiliano.bratti@unimi.it; tommaso.frattini@unimi.it; francesco.scervini@unipv.it,"; Bratti, Massimiliano/J-6811-2012","SCERVINI, Francesco/0000-0001-6403-5876; Bratti, Massimiliano/0000-0002-4565-6260; FRATTINI, TOMMASO/0000-0002-9844-881X",,,,,40,29,33,4,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Due to demand uncertainty, capacity is decided before demand is known but tolls can be adjusted after demand is known. Policy implications can differ from those under deterministic demand. For instance, for serial links, the toll in the second-best zero-profit case is no longer equal to the marginal external congestion cost. In the first-best scenario, the capacity under uncertain demand is higher than that under deterministic demand of the same expected value, though self-financing still holds in expected terms. Regulation by perfect competitive auction cannot replicate the second-best zero-profit result and thus leads to a lower welfare, whereas without uncertainty, various forms of competitive auctions can attain this second-best optimum. For more complex networks, when private firms add capacity in turn, contrary to the case without demand uncertainty, some forms of auction perform better than others with demand uncertainty.","[Fu, Xinying; van den Berg, Vincent A.

Understanding the inherent risks of this sector is vital from a portfolio risk management perspective, as such insights can aid in protecting against capital loss in the event of exposure to risk factors in this sector. Aim: The study aims to identify and explain the principal risk factors over time inherent to the financial stock sector of the locally listed equity market, accompanied by explaining the volatility of such principal risk factors. Setting: The study looks at financial sector stocks within the South African listed equity space from June 2007 to March 2017. Methods: The methods used to perform such an investigation were twofold, namely, factor analysis to statistically identify risk factors latent in a basket of financial sector firms and generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) analysis to examine the volatility of the principal risk factors. Results: The findings suggest that the heterogeneity of risk factors within the financial sector has burgeoned in the past five years, explaining a large proportion of risk during this period. However, over the long-term, banks appeared to have been the main factor driving risk within the financial sector, explaining around 55% of risk. The volatility of banks was most noticeable during business cycle falls that were underpinned by known economic or political instability. Conclusion: Banks have been the riskiest factor within financial sector firms over the past decade, explaining more than 50% of risk in recent years and notably susceptible to economic and political uncertainty.","[Madaree, Sudhir] Financial Serv Inst Australasia FINSIA, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",,"Madaree, S (通讯作者)，Financial Serv Inst Australasia FINSIA, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",sudhirmadaree@yahoo.co.uk,,"Madaree, Sudhir/0000-0002-7498-5485",,,,,21,1,3,0,0,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The impacts of precarious work differ among countries depending on their labour market and welfare system institutions, laws and policies, and cultural factors. This article examines how people in six advanced industrial countries representing different welfare and employment regimes Denmark, Germany, Japan, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States differ both in their experience of precarious work and in outcomes of precarious work such as job and economic insecurity, entry into the labour force, and subjective well-being. It also suggests a new social and political contract needed to address precarious work and its consequences.","[Kalleberg, Arne L.] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Kalleberg, AL (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA.",Arnekal@email.unc.edu,,,,,,,31,37,41,0,17,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

This workshop discussed the growing importance of market initiative regimes in public transport focussing on the market and regulatory developments in three sectors: local and regional bus, long-distance coach and passenger train services. The comparison of these sectors illustrated impressive but also very substantial differences between countries in terms of market potentials, success of market initiative, regulatory paths taken and resulting performance. Various observations were made. The size and stratification of passenger transports markets in most countries or regions studied seemed to leave little room for direct intramodal competition, while there was more trust in the viability of intermodal competition. The lack of data was perceived to be a major issue, not only for research but also for market transparency and well-functioning. The development of new intermediaries for information and ticketing purposes seems to point at a possible gradual replacement of the 'old' public transport integration dogma with some new paradigm. There is still a lack of academic studies focussing on the process leading to demand and supply of regulation of market initiative regimes and of studies looking subsequently at the factors leading to the uptake of such regulatory tools or at the practical requirements for such specific regulations to function.","[van de Velde, Didier] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Sect Org & Governance, Delft, Netherlands; [van de Velde, Didier] Inno V, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Karl, Astrid] KCW GmbH, Berlin, Germany",Delft University of Technology,"van de Velde, D (通讯作者)，Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Sect Org & Governance, Delft, Netherlands.",d.m.vandevelde@tudelft.nl; Karl@kcw-online.de,"van de Velde, Didier/Q-4850-2019","van de Velde, Didier/0000-0002-6053-0228",,,,,27,1,1,0,3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

This paper advances this basic idea by testing the hypothesis that the extent of social influence is conditional on external context factors such as commute characteristics. Through an online survey of students at the University of California, Davis, we collected information about students' transportation decisions for campus travel and their social networks. For each participant as an ego, we gathered information about their ego-network including up to five social contacts or alters. A series of complementary statistical models find the strength of social influence is lower for those with longer commute distances where biking is more costly than driving or taking the bus, and is also lower at distances where walking has higher utility than biking. Social influence is most important when the external commute characteristics entail relatively equal travel costs for different modes. As social influence and other social processes are evaluated as potential policy instruments, these and other heterogeneous effects should be taken into account.","[Pike, Susan] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Environm Policy & Behav, Inst Transportat Studies, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Lubell, Mark] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Environm Policy & Behav, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Pike, S (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Environm Policy & Behav, Inst Transportat Studies, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",scpike@ucdavis.edu; mnlubell@ucdavis.edu,,"Pike, Susan/0000-0001-6558-3479; Lubell, Mark/0000-0001-5757-7116",,,,,41,20,24,5,41,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

To validate our scale, we used three approaches: first, an exploratory factor analysis; second, an examination of psychometric proprieties of all dimensions; and third, a confirmatory factor analysis.

In a two-period model, media are allowed to condition subscription prices on the past behavior of users. Within-group price discrimination intensifies media competition on the firms' side, as some firms advertise only on one media outlet (single-home), where they can meet early users and switchers. As a consequence, advertising revenues are reduced and this puts an upward pressure on subscription prices. However, price discrimination also induces stronger within-group competition to poach the rival's users. Depending on the balance between these two forces, conditioning subscription prices on past behavior might be beneficial or detrimental to users, whereas it is always detrimental to platforms. In relation to within-group uniform pricing, total welfare might increase or decrease, as the lower advertising intensity may entail either underprovision or a mitigation of overprovision of advertisements.","[Carroni, Elias] Alma Mater Studiorum Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Sci Econ, 2 Piazza Antonino Scaravilli, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Carroni, E (通讯作者)，Alma Mater Studiorum Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Sci Econ, 2 Piazza Antonino Scaravilli, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",elias.carroni@unibo.it,"CARRONI, ELIAS/A-1177-2019","CARRONI, ELIAS/0000-0002-6809-5339",project Labex MME-DII [ANR11-LBX-0023-01]; Programma Master & Back - Regione Autonoma della Sardegna,project Labex MME-DII; Programma Master & Back - Regione Autonoma della Sardegna,"I am grateful to the editor Ramon Casadesus-Masanell and three anonymous referees for helpful reviews on the paper.

In contrast to Britain, there is no formal regulatory mechanism assuring cost-effectiveness in the United States. Instead, questions of cost effectiveness are left to market processes.

If inattentive jurors are as likely to be wrong as right, I find that small jury panels work better as long as identical jurors behave symmetrically. If not paying attention makes error more likely than not, jurors may coordinate on two different symmetric outcomes: a high attention one or a low attention one, If social norms stigmatize shirking, jurors coordinate on the high attention equilibrium, and a smaller jury yields better outcomes. However, increasing the jury up to a finite bound works better if norms are tolerant of shirking, in which case coordination on the low attention outcome results. If jurors always act as if they are pivotal, a larger jury may work better. Allowing deliberations is efficient if the jury panel is relatively large, and if the police and prosecution are effective. However, barring deliberations is better at smaller jury sizes, specially if the police and prosecution are not too efficient. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In order to prevail, plaintiffs must establish not only that a misstatement was wrongly conveyed, but also that they were exposed to the information, acted upon it, and suffered harm as a consequence. A mere potential for deception is not enough; plaintiffs must show that they were actually deceived. Yet, despite the reliance requirement's intuitive appeal, this paper argues that it should be abandoned. It shows that conditioning recovery on reliance leads to inadequate deterrence of misrepresentations, which in turn results in a host of inefficient effects: from allocative inefficiency to wasteful investments and rent-seeking activities. Instead of reliance, recovery should depend on a showing of a 'price impact', namely that the statement triggered an increase in market price. Once an effect on price is established, liability should extend to all representees relying and non-relying alike. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Jury pools with higher proportions of white men are more likely to convict black male defendants relative to white male defendants. Jury pools with a higher proportion of black men are more likely to acquit all defendants, especially black men. Attorneys use peremptory challenges strategically in accordance with these results, which are robust to a wide set of controls, including county and judge fixed effects.

The psychological resources which meet the criteria for positive organisational behaviour best are hope, self-efficacy, optimism and resilience. Aim: The purpose of this study was to investigate the construct validity of the Psychological Capital Questionnaire (PCQ), with specific reference to its psychometric properties. Setting: The sample included a total of 1749 respondents, 60 each from 30 organisations in South Africa. Methods: A multi-factorial model was statistically explored and confirmed (with exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis, respectively). Results: The results support the original conceptualisation and empirically-confirmed factorial composition of Psychological Capital (PsyCap) by four elements, namely Hope, Optimism, Resilience and Self-efficacy. However, the study yielded a three-factor solution, with Hope and Optimism as a combined factor and Resilience and Self-efficacy made up of a reconfigured set of substantively justifiable items (three of the original 24 items were found not to be suitable). The three reconfigured factors showed good psychometric properties, good fit (in support of construct validity) and acceptable levels of convergent and discriminant validity. Recommendations were made for further studies. Conclusion: Based on the results obtained, it seems that the PCQ is a suitable (valid and reliable) instrument for measuring PsyCap. This study could thus serve as a reference for the accurate measurement of PsyCap.","[Grobler, Anton] Univ South Africa, Grad Sch Business Leadership, Pretoria, South Africa; [Joubert, Yvonne T.] Univ South Africa, Dept Human Resource Management, Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa; University of South Africa,"Joubert, YT (通讯作者)，Univ South Africa, Dept Human Resource Management, Pretoria, South Africa.",joubeyt@unisa.ac.za,"Grobler, Anton/M-7636-2016; Joubert, Yvonne Trijntje/J-6008-2015","Joubert, Yvonne Trijntje/0000-0003-4709-6188",,,,,56,9,15,2,19,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,2222-3436,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

J,"Turyakira, PK",,,,"Turyakira, Peter K.",,,Ethical practices of small and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries: Literature analysis,SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY,"Background: There is increasing pressure on business organisations to behave ethically, in addition to running their operations in the most economical, efficient and effective manner possible to increase performance. Customers have also become increasingly mindful of the reputation of the businesses they patronise. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have become the worst affected since they lack the funds, strategic information and relevant alliances to implement ethical practices. Aim: This article aims at evaluating the aspects of business ethics, significance of business ethics to SMEs, ethical dilemmas and challenges of SMEs, particularly in developing countries, and suggests strategies to address ethical dilemmas and challenges. Methods: The background literature review on ethical practices in SMEs in the context of developing countries was conducted on several journal articles. Peer-reviewed articles in recent journals were analysed to identify the aspects of business ethics, significance of business ethics to SMEs, ethical dilemmas and challenges of SMEs and the proposed strategies to address ethical dilemmas and challenges thereof. Results and conclusion: It is clear that business enterprises can no longer afford to disregard business ethics. There are continuous business failures as a result of unethical practices, especially those associated with employees and top executives. This article has added to the body of existing literature on ethical practices of SMEs in developing countries. As such, SME owners and managers can use the findings of this article to design ethical policy frameworks and guidelines to improve their reputations and competitiveness.","[Turyakira, Peter K.] Makerere Univ, Sch Business, Dept Mkt & Management, Kampala, Uganda",Makerere University,"Turyakira, PK (通讯作者)，Makerere Univ, Sch Business, Dept Mkt & Management, Kampala, Uganda.",pturyakira@yahoo.com,,,,,,,52,12,18,0,19,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

However, few studies have been conducted by analysing the references of publications with a visual pattern. Moreover, this subject has reached a certain degree of maturity; hence, a review that analyses the trends of organisational culture is urgent. Aim: The aim of this study was to provide broad information on organisational culture, including authors, journals, countries and references. In addition, the evolution of organisational culture is depicted and potential future research focuses are predicted. Setting: Using the Web of Science as a data source, we captured 1479 publications in science citation index (SCI) and social science citation index (SSCI) from 2005 to 2016 with 63 682 corresponding references for analysis. Methods: A bibliometric approach using CiteSpace software was applied to quantitatively and visually analyse organisational culture. Results: (1) The USA is the most productive country followed by the UK and then Australia in terms of publication; (2) scholars are mainly focused on 'performance', 'innovation' and 'knowledge management' aspects; (3) most fundamental theories and frameworks were created from the 1980s to the 1990s; (4) the Journal of Business Ethics is the most appropriate journal for contributions, whereas the Academy of Management Review is suitable for scholars to do a literature review, construct a theoretical framework and develop a research design; and (5) future research on this field has been justified accordingly. Conclusion: These findings not only provide basic background knowledge about organisational culture for new researchers but also provide a framework for visual and quantitative research to management scholars and fill the gap between organisational culture and bibliometric analysis.","[Cui, Yi; Liu, Yanping; Mou, Jian] Xidian Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Xidian University,"Mou, J (通讯作者)，Xidian Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",jian.mou@xidian.edu.cn,"Liu, Yiming/ISU-3780-2023; liu, yan/HGV-1365-2022; liu, yan/HCI-5542-2022","cui, yi/0000-0001-6109-0968",,,,,83,21,22,18,193,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,2222-3436,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The model that we propose describes the transitions between the regimes using a hidden Markov chain with time varying transition probabilities that depend on calendar variables. We model the demand during the production regime using an autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) process with seasonal patterns, whereas we use a much simpler model for the standby regime in order to reduce the complexity. The maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters is implemented using a differential evolution algorithm. Using the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) to evaluate the goodness-of-fit of our model for probabilistic forecasting, it is shown that this model often outperforms classical additive time series models, as well as homogeneous Markov switching models. We also propose a simple procedure for classifying load profiles into those with and without regime-switching behaviors. (C) 2017 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We examine which components are captured by professional forecasters by regressing their forecasts on the estimated components extracted from both the spectral analysis and the state space model. For both decomposition methods, we find that, in the short run, the Survey of Professional Forecasters can predict almost all of the variation in the time series due to the trend and the business cycle, but that the forecasts contain little or no significant information about the variation in the irregular component.

Since the 1990s, one important method of continuing that legacy has been the use of secretive legal proceedings known as investor-state dispute settlements (ISDS). Through this innocuous-sounding practice, transnational corporations (TNCs) are able to blame foreign governments for their failure to extract as large a profit as they anticipated from their operations abroad. Asserting that changes in fiscal, environmental, or social policies have harmed them, TNCs have claimed that foreign governments should compensate them for the loss of potential revenues. ISDS tribunals have awarded billions of dollars as a result of such claims, mostly made under the auspices of bilateral investment treaties. Not only must governments spend millions of dollars defending themselves against assaults and tens or hundreds of millions if they lose their cases, but the ISDS system also has a chilling effect on the adoption of legislation designed to protect the health and safety of citizens. As a result of all the lawsuits in which corporations collect damages from governments under investment treaties, an array of groups in the legal industry have profited substantially: law firms representing corporate interests, arbitrators and other specialists in corporate arbitration, and litigation funders. The arbitration industry is, as a practical matter, the glue that holds the system together. The law firms involved in this industry do not wait passively for cases to arise. Instead, they actively pursue corporations to seek arbitration with governments, proselytize for the legitimacy of the current international investment regime, and block reforms that would limit arbitration opportunities. By creating methods of insulating TNCs from normal business risks and forcing host governments to bear the burden of liabilities, the arbitration system has effectively reinstituted a neo-colonial regime through the judicial system.","[Olivet, Cecilia] Transnatl Inst TNI, Amsterdam, Netherlands",,,,,,,,,,77,9,10,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

In this paper, we develop a model of infrastructure policy in which politicians overdo things that have hidden costs and underperform tasks whose costs voters readily perceive. Consequently, national funding of transportation leads to overspending, since voters more readily perceive the upside of new projects than the future taxes that will be paid for distant highways. Yet when local voters are well-informed, the highly salient nuisances of local construction, including land taking and noise, lead to under-building. This framework explains the decline of urban mega-projects in the US (Altshuler and Luberoff, 2003) as the result of increasingly educated and organized urban voters. Our framework also predicts more per capita transportation spending in low-density and less educated areas, which seems to be empirically correct.","[Glaeser, Edward L.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ponzetto, Giacomo A.

Such a dependence is the reason for the emergence of a set of destructive economic phenomena known as Dutch Disease. The most destructive effect of the Dutch Disease is the dependence between the exchange rate level and the crude oil price. The aim of the article is to describe the impact of oil price on the Rubel - US dollar exchange rate. The analysis was based of time series data of Brent oil prices in USD per barrel and USD/RUB exchange rate. The data frequency was weekly, covering the period from July 2015 to December 2017. The time series length was 651 observations. The period subjected to the analysis was divided into three sub-periods: 01.07.2005 - 30.06.2008, 01.02.2009 - 30.06.2014 and 01.01.2015 - 15.12. 2017. The analysis used econometric model (VAR) built in accordance with the Enle-Granger methodology. The analysis has shown that the USD/RUB exchange rate was affected by the changes in oil price in all the sub-periods defined above. The analysis has shown that the influence of oil price on the USD/RUB exchange rate was stronger after the 2008 world financial crisis. This confirms the hypothesis that the Russian Economy shows symptoms of the Dutch Disease.","[Bilan, Yuriy] Rzeszow Univ Technol, Dept Finance Banking & Accountancy, Fac Management, Al Powstancow Warszawy 10, PL-35959 Rzeszow, Poland; [Gedek, Stanislaw] Rzeszow Univ Technol, Dept Econ, Fac Management, Al Powstancow Warszawy 10, PL-35959 Rzeszow, Poland; [Mentel, Grzegorz] Rzeszow Univ Technol, Dept Quantitat Methods, Fac Management, Al Powstancow Warszawy 10, PL-35959 Rzeszow, Poland",Rzeszow University of Technology; Rzeszow University of Technology; Rzeszow University of Technology,"Bilan, Y (通讯作者)，Rzeszow Univ Technol, Dept Finance Banking & Accountancy, Fac Management, Al Powstancow Warszawy 10, PL-35959 Rzeszow, Poland.",yuriy_bilan@yahoo.co.uk; gedeks@prz.edu.pl; gmentel@prz.edu.pl,"Bilan, Yuriy/B-3119-2012; Bilan, Yuriy/ABC-6948-2021; Mentel, Grzegorz/T-1850-2018","Bilan, Yuriy/0000-0003-0268-009X; Mentel, Grzegorz/0000-0002-6371-1219",,,,,24,6,6,0,2,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The model builds on the methodology of Data Envelopment Analysis [DEA] since it estimates the production possibility set in a traditional manner as a conical or convex hull of observed production activities. Unlike DEA, the model seeks simultaneously to deflate only deposits and inflate loans to a greatest extent possible so that the production activity of a financial intermediary (typically a bank) remains feasible and stays in the estimated production possibility set. The model translates the identified slacks in deposits and loans into a metric that measures by which factor it is feasible to increase multiplicatively the actually observed loan-to-deposit ratio of a financial intermediary. The metric is computable for individual banks on a yearly basis, but is equally aggregable for a bank over the entire period. In contrast to traditional usage of DEA for efficiency measurement, the proposed model is associated more with the notion of productivity in financial intermediation rather than with the concept of efficiency. The model is presented and demonstrated in a case study of Slovak commercial banks for the period from 2008 to 2016. It is found that only smaller organizational units (smaller banks and branch offices of foreign banks) were in the past few years capable of financial intermediation at the best utilization of their resources, which is an observation relevant from a regulatory point of view.","[Bod'a, Martin] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Quantitat Methods & Informat Syst Dept, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia; [Zimkova, Emilia] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Finance & Accounting Dept, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia",Matej Bel University; Matej Bel University,"Bod'a, M (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Quantitat Methods & Informat Syst Dept, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia.",martin.boda@umb.sk; emilia.zimkova@umb.sk,"Zimková, Emília/ABA-2577-2022; Boďa, Martin/J-3602-2016","Zimková, Emília/0000-0003-1648-8103; Boďa, Martin/0000-0002-7503-6898","Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic [VEGA 1/0859/16]","Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic","The paper was supported by the grant scheme VEGA 1/0859/16 Dynamics of nonlinear economic processes of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic.",,31,4,4,2,10,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The authors show that Slovenia has executed austerity measures over short time periods only, and argue that one cannot find convincing evidence that the enacted austerity policy created the theoretically and empirically expected effects. The authors show that the revival of economic growth was independent of enacted austerity policies.

This research aims to contribute to the theme of innovation networks in the Textile and Clothing Industry (TCI) of Portuguese companies by exploring who are the different partners of the existing innovation networks in the Portuguese TCI. A survey with 86 companies suggests that Portuguese TCI companies are preferentially focused on product innovations and process innovations, with customers and suppliers as preferred partners.

Economic agents have become more and more interested in structuring a high-performance activity and optimizing their information system as efficiently as possible. The focus of this new area is to strengthen the internal control, which is defined as an important function of management, being the carrier of significant weightiness and utility, regardless of the level at which it operates. This paper explores methods of increasing efficacy and effectiveness (and, therefore, efficiency and performance) within a multinational entity through the use of modern and useful internal control and internal audit techniques within the organization.

Correspondingly, some scholars expected trade unions to serve as a major contribution to the development of a democratic civil society that would serve as a Polanyian double movement to these disruptive reforms. However, Russia's steelworkers have stood out as particularly weak and unwilling to strike due to their dependence on their employer for almost all aspects of their livelihoods. But is this lack of large, legally sanctioned and disruptive strikes truly evidence of worker quiescence and weak trade unions? Using an analysis of local newspaper accounts and archival documents to process-trace the interactions of workers, trade unions and management, this paper offers a counter-argument to the generalizations of past studies. Specifically, protests tend to be more frequent and extreme when there is union competition within a company and when foreign owners violate labour laws. Unions tend to engage in non-protest bargaining strategies when companies face bankruptcy or closure under domestic ownership. Because Russia was an early case of the rapid liberalization reforms that have been broadly recommended to developing and post-communist countries, a closer reading of on-the-ground conditions and protest aids in a broader understanding of the variation in backlash to global capitalism.","[Evans, Allison D.] Univ Nevada, Dept Polit Sci, 1664 N Virginia St, Reno, NV 89557 USA",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno,"Evans, AD (通讯作者)，Univ Nevada, Dept Polit Sci, 1664 N Virginia St, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",allisonevans@unr.edu,,"Evans, Allison D./0000-0002-6443-3062",IREX (International Research and Exchanges Board); United States Department of State through the Title VIII Program,IREX (International Research and Exchanges Board); United States Department of State through the Title VIII Program,"Research for this paper was supported, in part, by a fellowship from IREX (International Research and Exchanges Board) with funds provided by the United States Department of State through the Title VIII Program.

This growth of individual home ownership occurred, however, within a particular demographic, economic, social and political context. This distinctive set of conditions include the atomized, nuclear family; suburbanization; high growth; the conventional mortgage market and a young, working population. These conditions have changed and coalesce in the constitution of what we refer to as late home ownership'. The paper conceives of contrasts between real estate families' or accumulating families' which maintain or further accumulate valuable multiple property assets over generations; dissipating families' which are forced to deploy and diminish their property assets accumulated in the exceptional era; and propertyless perpetual renter families'. It is argued that these emergent divisions are pivotal in understanding new forms of social re-stratification in which the patterns of ownership of residential property, the income flows from residential property investment, a changed demographics and intergenerational dynamics are key drivers.","[Forrest, Ray] Lingnan Univ, Ctr Social Policy & Social Change, 8 Castle Peak Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Forrest, Ray] Lingnan Univ, Dept Sociol & Social Policy, 8 Castle Peak Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Hirayama, Yosuke] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Human Dev & Environm, Nada Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan",Lingnan University; Lingnan University; Kobe University,"Forrest, R (通讯作者)，Lingnan Univ, Ctr Social Policy & Social Change, 8 Castle Peak Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Forrest, R (通讯作者)，Lingnan Univ, Dept Sociol & Social Policy, 8 Castle Peak Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",rayforrest@ln.edu.hk; yosukeh@kobe-u.ac.jp,,"FORREST, Ray/0000-0001-5480-7289",,,,,75,48,50,4,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Treating such political distinctions as constitutive of capitalist society and as correlated with the color line, I demonstrate that the racialized subjection of those whom capital expropriates is a condition of possibility for the freedom of those whom it exploits. After developing this proposition systematically, I historicize it, distinguishing four regimes of racialized accumulation according to how exploitation and expropriation are distinguished, sited, and intertwined in each.

Drawing upon market orientation theory, this study conceptualizes business model ambidexterity as a high-order construct consisting of market-driven and driving-market business models. Premised on the resource-based view, this study explores how innovation ambidexterity affects business model ambidexterity and, in turn, firm performance. Different influences of diverse business models that act upon firm performances are also probed. Survey data collected from 201 Chinese high-tech firms demonstrate that business model ambidexterity is viable and has a much more positive impact on firm performance compared with the single dimensional approach. In this study, business model ambidexterity has partially mediated the relationship between technological innovation ambidexterity and firm performance.","[Liao, Suqin; Liu, Zhiying] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Management, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Shanshan] City Univ Hongkong, Coll Business, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS","Liu, ZY (通讯作者)，Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Management, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China.",liuzhiyustc@163.com,"Zhang, Shuo/IUO-8909-2023; Zhang, shanshan/HLP-6320-2023; li, yao/IYJ-1364-2023","Zhang, Shanshan/0000-0002-6802-8769",National Natural Science Foundation of China,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China.,,70,14,17,16,124,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

Therefore, they require special approaches when justifying methods and instruments for investment analysis. In this context, the paper addresses the issue of public companies' assessment and diagnostics revealing advantages and limitations of public status, challenges of market value assessment and controversial issues of corporate financial health evaluating. Obtaining and maintaining the public status provide various benefits for a company increasing its opportunities to attract financing and diversify risks. Negative consequences of public status contain corresponding costs, lack of confidentiality, and raised external risks. For emerging markets, the last two become quite significant. We also argue that emerging markets challenge business assessment due to the actual lack of an open, competitive and transparent market. In this regard, it should be more reasonable to apply the standard of investment value even when it comes to public companies. As for financial diagnostics, we suggest that it should efficiently combine relevant micro and macro approaches. Such synthesis allows revealing major controversial issues related to public companies on the emerging markets. Therefore, we propose to develop the financial diagnostics methodology in the frame of financial crises and financial stability conceptions.","[Lvova, Nadezhda A.; Abramishvili, Neli R.; Darushin, Ivan A.; Voronova, Natalya S.] St Petersburg State Univ, 7-9 Univ Skaya Nab, St Petersburg 199034, Russia",Saint Petersburg State University,"Lvova, NA (通讯作者)，St Petersburg State Univ, 7-9 Univ Skaya Nab, St Petersburg 199034, Russia.",n.lvova@spbu.ru; n.lvova@spbu.ru; n.lvova@spbu.ru; n.voronova@spbu.ru,"Darushin, Ivan A./M-9767-2013; Abramishvili, Neli/N-9999-2013; Voronova, Natalia S/N-2432-2013; Lvova, Nadezhda/N-1698-2013","Lvova, Nadezhda/0000-0002-9467-2785",Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) [18-010-00085],Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)),"The research was performed with the financial support of the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (the RFBR), the research project No. 18-010-00085.",,28,5,5,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,7499,7510,,,,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553208049,0

The author proposes a solution to this conflict, by introducing amendments to the Federal Law On the Basics of Public Control in the Russian Federation with respect to the expansion of the list of public controllers.","[Murzanov, Ivan A.; Ivanov, Vitalii A.; Petrenko, Nikolai I.; Timofeeva, Luydmila I.; Sushentsova, Valentina G.] Mari State Univ, Yoshkar Ola, Russia",Mari State University,"Murzanov, IA (通讯作者)，Mari State Univ, Yoshkar Ola, Russia.",ivanmurzanov@mail.ru; ivanovvita12013@vandex.ru; pr.petrenko@mail.ru; ludimila_tim52@mail.ru; valsu.63@mail.ru,"Murzanov, Ivan/AAI-4830-2020","Murzanov, Ivan/0000-0002-1654-4251",,,,,4,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,1883,1885,,,,,,3,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553202101,0

EVIDENCE FROM POLISH FIRM-LEVEL DATA,E & M EKONOMIE A MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Special Economic Zones; exports; Poland; treatment effects; counterfactual analysis; firm heterogeneity,ECONOMETRIC EVALUATION ESTIMATOR; PROCESSING ZONES,"Special economic zones play an important role in the global economy and in the economies of particular countries, including Poland. Given the whole body of literature on SEZs-led export activity, the vast majority of papers, restrict the research methods used to the descriptive analyses or the case studies of specific zones, only describing the impact thereof on the national economy. The existing empirical evidence (econometric) in the vast majority of papers associated to zonal operation does not account for the endogeneity bias, which can have a distorting effect on the results. Nevertheless, little is known about the real (based on solid evidence) SEZ influence on the firm-level characteristics, with regard to the creation of exports. The role of SEZs in relation to firm-level export probability/scale/intensity/volume has been investigated using a unique dataset for 155 firms operating in special economic zones (SEZs) in Poland, accompanied by the data for 155 non-SEZs economic entities (matched sample). With the use of different estimation techniques, conditioned by the uneven nature of the tested dependent variables, a positive role of SEZs was found in relation to certain aspects of the firm-level exports. The possible endogeneity problem in the SEZ variable was properly addressed by utilising a kernel-based propensity score matching difference-in-difference estimator and by calculating the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT), accompanied by a series of robustness/sensitivity tests (changes in kernel type, bandwidth, dataset trimming). The results provide consistent evidence on the effect of the SEZs on export probability in firms operating within the zones, as compared to the control group. The positive impact of the SEZs on the scale of exports, export intensity and the volume of exports was however sensitive to dataset trimming. Hence, the impact of the SEZs operation in this regard could not be full acknowledged.","[Nazarczuk, Jaroslaw Michal] Univ Warmia & Mazury, Fac Econ Sci, Olsztyn, Poland; [Uminski, Stanislaw] Univ Gdansk, Fac Econ, Gdansk, Poland",University of Warmia & Mazury; Fahrenheit Universities; University of Gdansk,"Nazarczuk, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Warmia & Mazury, Fac Econ Sci, Olsztyn, Poland.",jaroslaw.nazarczuk@uwm.edu.pl; uminski@univ.gda.pl,"Nazarczuk, Jarosław M/E-6148-2013","Nazarczuk, Jarosław M/0000-0002-2318-6333; Uminski, Stanislaw/0000-0002-4445-0893",National Science Center (Poland) [DEC-2013/11/D/HS4/04007],National Science Center (Poland),"The paper was elaborated within the research project entitled 'Foreign Trade in Special Economic Zones in Poland', financed by the National Science Center (Poland) within the grant decision no.

It is mostly cultivated in even-aged monoculture stands in the Landes forest. These plantations are exposed to multiple biotic and abiotic risks: most importantly the cyclical outbreaks of a defoliator, the Pine Processionary Moth (PPM, Thaumetopoea pityocampa), and storms causing large windthrown. This study aims to compute the optimal rotation age and land expectation value (LEV) for maritime pine plantations in order to assess the impact of these disturbances. Using stochastic simulation methods, we simulate multiple scenarios combining different disturbance intensities. Our results show that both disturbances reduce LEV individually. When combined together, the two disturbances generate sub-additive losses (i.e. combined damages are smaller than the sum of the damages from each disturbance individually). The impact on the optimal rotation length, however, is different for the two analysed risks: While storms tend to reduce the optimal harvest age, PPM tends to increase it. Overall, the impact of PPM on the rotation length prevails and, here, risks increase rather than decrease the optimal rotation length. Thinnings play an important role. They do not only increase profitability but also constitute an effective hedging strategy against both risks since they mitigate the negative impacts of PPM and storm disturbances for all the tested scenarios.

Issues of parties' legal capacity have been resolved in traditional contracts but they are still debatable in electronic commerce transactions. Under UK law, contracts formed by minors for things other than necessities are unenforceable against the minor but enforceable against the merchant (seller) while according to US uniform commercial code in online contracts capacity is not recognized as a legal excuse to nullify a contract. At the mean time, contracts made by incapacitate person is considered null under Iranian law. In spite of technical developments such as digital signatures and smart cards used in verifying the identity and capacity of parties in electronic commerce transactions, the legal certainty on capacity of parties is still questionable. The article also examines the application of traditional contract general rules on parties' legal capacity in Iran to electronic commerce with reference to EU law.

Therefore, Turkey's exports by road transport to selected European countries are analyzed in a panel-data framework for the period 2005-2014. We estimate the aggregate effect of different quota types on trade between Turkey and European countries by using an approach that integrates the max-flow and gravity models. In the gravity model, for each country, a single value representing the aggregate restricting effect of different quota types is needed. The single values are obtained by solving multiple max-flow problems, where constraining effects of different quota types are modeled as arc capacities. The results of the gravity model suggest a loss in Turkish exports by road transport because of the quotas imposed by other countries. Most of the negative impact results from bilateral quotas rather than from transit quotas, whose effect is rather marginal. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This is a question central to a court's class certification decision. To answer this question, a methodology-known as sub-regressions-is being increasingly employed, particularly by defendants' expert witnesses. A key step of a sub-regression type analysis is to partition the data into various subgroups and then to examine data poolability. In this article, I focus on three areas of interest pertaining to sub-regressions. First, I review the related law and economics literature related to this methodology. I then analyze courts' recent class certification decisions in cases where parties introduced sub-regression analysis. I then discuss several methodological challenges, many of which have not been previously acknowledged, and present potential ways to address these challenges. I emphasize that a disciplined and rigorous implementation is crucial for the reliability of sub-regressions.","[Deng, Ai] Bates White LLC, Washington, DC 20005 USA; [Deng, Ai] Johns Hopkins Univ, Adv Acad Program, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",Johns Hopkins University,"Deng, A (通讯作者)，Bates White LLC, Washington, DC 20005 USA.;Deng, A (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Adv Acad Program, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",ai.deng@bateswhite.com,"Deng, PhD, Ai/GSJ-0709-2022",,,,,,33,0,0,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

We propose a decision-making model in which patent holders allocate resources to either expanding the number of related patents or investing in higher value of patents in the portfolio. We estimate the derived value equation using portfolio value data from an inventor survey at the level of individual inventions rather than the firm as a whole. We find that investments in individual inventions exhibit diminishing returns, and that a good part of the value of a portfolio depends on adding new patented inventions. Also, while diminishing returns to individual inventions are stable across subsamples, the returns to portfolio size vary between complex and discrete industries, and between inventions that are science-based or driven by customer information. When firms seek to strengthen appropriability, the returns to an increase of portfolio size are not different from the sample average. Thus, a higher number of inventions in a portfolio may reflect both stronger appropriability via patents and genuine creation of value.","[Gambardella, Alfonso] Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy; [Gambardella, Alfonso] ICRIOS, Milan, Italy; [Harhoff, Dietmar] Max Planck Inst Innovat & Competit, Munich, Germany; [Verspagen, Bart] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands",Bocconi University; Maastricht University,"Gambardella, A (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy.;Gambardella, A (通讯作者)，ICRIOS, Milan, Italy.",alfonso.gambardella@unibocconi.it; dietmar.harhoff@ip.mpg.de; b.verspagen@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"Verspagen, Bart/ABE-6732-2020; 胡, 巧爱/GXZ-8730-2022; Gambardella, Alfonso/K-2641-2012","Verspagen, Bart/0000-0001-6975-8141; Gambardella, Alfonso/0000-0002-8714-5813",,,,,32,14,15,5,53,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

Old regions have picked up momentum while novel forms of municipal co-operation and multi-level governance have generated new regions. This paper examines the extent to which some new regions in the Netherlands have become familiar to the population, based on evidence from an analysis of newspaper articles. The study focused on the reports about several old and new regions within the borders of the traditional region of Noord-Brabant, a Dutch province with a well-established identity. In the dynamic constellation of Noord-Brabant, news reports hinted at the institutionalisation of some of the new regions that have become meaningful places outside the administrative context in which they were originally created. The institutionalisation of some new regions did not result in a de-institutionalisation of older regions in the same area but in a more complex layering of the identities of these regions with respect to each other.","[van Gorp, Bouke; Terlouw, Kees] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Dept Human Geog & Planning, Heidelberglaan 2,POB 80115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"van Gorp, B (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Dept Human Geog & Planning, Heidelberglaan 2,POB 80115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",b.vangorp@uu.nl; k.terlouw@uu.nl,"Terlouw, Kees/AGI-1783-2022; Terlouw, Kees/M-4604-2019","Terlouw, Kees/0000-0001-8665-1207",,,,,50,3,3,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

We consider 10 leading source countries, both Asian and European, of highly skilled migration to the USA and test whether foreign inventors' patents are disproportionately cited by (i) co-ethnic migrants ('diaspora' effect), and (ii) inventors residing in their country of origin ('brain gain' effect). We find evidence of the diaspora effect for the Asian but not the European countries, with the exception of Russia. A diaspora effect does not necessarily translate into a brain gain effect, most notably for India where no such effect is detected. Neither does a brain gain effect occur solely in conjunction with a diaspora effect.

These extracted factors are then used to construct a factor-augmented qualitative vector autoregressive (FA-Qual VAR) model to forecast industrial production growth, inflation, the Federal funds rate, and the term spread based on a pseudo out-of-sample recursive forecasting exercise over an out-of-sample period of 1980:1 to 2014:12, using an in-sample period of 1960:1 to 1979:12. Short-, medium-, and long-run horizons of 1, 6, 12, and 24months ahead are considered. The forecast from the FA-Qual VAR is compared with that of a standard VAR model, a Qual VAR model, and a factor-augmented VAR (FAVAR). In general, we observe that the FA-Qual VAR tends to perform significantly better than the VAR, Qual VAR and FAVAR (barring some exceptions relative to the latter). In addition, we find that the Qual VARs are also well equipped in forecasting probability of recessions when compared to probit models.","[Gupta, Rangan] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Olson, Eric] West Virginia Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Morgantown, WV USA; [Wohar, Mark E.] Univ Nebraska, Coll Business Adm, Omaha, NE 68182 USA; [Wohar, Mark E.] Loughborough Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough, Leics, England",University of Pretoria; West Virginia University; University of Nebraska System; Loughborough University,"Gupta, R (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",rangan.gupta@up.ac.za,"Olson, Eric/N-9896-2013","Olson, Eric/0000-0002-8716-9532",,,,,43,2,2,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0277-6693,1099-131X,,J FORECASTING,J.

The two payment methods evaluated were scale (also called pay-as-cut and consumer scale) where the buyer only pays for timber harvested and lump sum (also called sold-on-appraised-volume or SOAV) where a buyer pays for the entire tract's estimated volume, regardless of the amount of timber actually harvested. The analysis found no significant difference in gross timber sale revenue collected by the SLCMLD under the two payment methods Scaled timber sales incurred an additional $323 in administrative costs per timber sale compared to lump sum timber sales. This increase in administrative costs represents less than 1% of the timber value contained in the average SLCMLD timber sale. Differences in the standards agencies use to estimate merchantable stand volume of a timber sale and the administrative time spent processing timber sales can impact the financial costs associated with each timber payment method.

This renewable wood-pellet supply requires nonrenewable-energy inputs in its manufacturing and logistics, which suggests possible price-volatility spillovers between renewable and nonrenewable markets. A BEKK-MGARCH model is employed for investigating these possible price volatility spillovers. Overall, results suggest a limited negative effect of past volatile nonrenewable-energy prices influencing current wood-pellet price volatility. Specifically, high volatilities in nonrenewable energy prices do not affect the volatility of wood-pellet prices. Thus, any stability concerns in terms of nonrenewable-input prices affecting the wood-pellet market are not warranted.

We hypothesize that the availability of assisted reproductive technology increases the expected benefits of a professional degree by allowing women to delay childbearing in their 20s and 30s while establishing their careers, thereby reaping greater financial benefit from human capital investment. State-level timing differences in the enactment of laws which mandated infertility treatment coverage in employer-sponsored health plans allow us to exploit state, year, and cohort variation in women's ages at the time the laws are passed. These insurance mandates dramatically increase access to assisted reproductive technology. Using a triple difference strategy, we find that a mandate to cover assisted reproductive technology does increase the probability that a woman chooses to invest in a professional degree and to work in a professional career.","[Kroeger, Sarah] Univ Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [La Mattina, Giulia] Univ S Florida, Tampa, FL USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida,"Kroeger, S (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",kroegers@uwm.edu; glamattina@usf.edu,,,,,,,34,7,10,2,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Consumers only detect prices with some probability before deciding which firm to purchase from, and each firm only detects the other firm's price with some probability. Increasing transparency on the producer side facilitates collusion, while increasing transparency on the consumer side makes collusion more difficult. Conditions are given under which increases in a common factor that affects transparency positively on both sides are pro-competitive. With two standard information technologies, this holds when firms are easier to inform than are consumers.","[Schultz, Christian] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, Oester Farimagsgade 5, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Schultz, C (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, Oester Farimagsgade 5, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",cs@econ.ku.dk,,"Schultz, Christian/0000-0003-1972-9929",,,,,22,4,4,2,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

This paper aims to reveal patterns and mechanisms of networking practices and relates them to China's transitional context based on empirical data from a firm survey in the Pearl River Delta. It addresses the localisation effect as the primary factor in explaining the selection of networking partners. The results of this paper suggest a strong tendency towards networking with local government agencies vis-a-vis weak linkages with business partners. Furthermore, it reveals that the intent of bonding with local authorities through interpersonal relationships increases with the localisation of customers. Meanwhile, firms are more likely to pursue learning-oriented networks with competitors as the number of suppliers in the same city increases. The findings add to the understanding of network relations in China, in particular to the rationales behind relations to local government officials.","[Fu, Wenying] South China Normal Univ, Sch Geog, Zhongshan West Ave 55, Guangzhou 510631, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Diez, Javier Revilla] Univ Cologne, Inst Geog, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany; [Schiller, Daniel] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Inst Geog & Geol, Makarenkostr 22, D-17487 Greifswald, Germany",South China Normal University; University of Cologne; Universitat Greifswald,"Fu, WY (通讯作者)，South China Normal Univ, Sch Geog, Zhongshan West Ave 55, Guangzhou 510631, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",fuwenying@m.scnu.edu.cn; j.revilladiez@uni-koeln.de; daniel.schiller@uni-greifswald.de,"Revilla Diez, Javier/J-2392-2019; Schiller, Daniel/A-1553-2019","Revilla Diez, Javier/0000-0003-2065-1380; Fu, Wenying/0000-0002-5617-4718","German Research Foundation (DFG) [SPP 1233, RE1720/11-1]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41301109]",German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The research has received funding from the German Research Foundation (DFG) within Priority Programme SPP 1233 'Megacities-Megachallenge: the Informal Dynamics of Global Change' under grant RE1720/11-1 and the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant No. 41301109.,,51,1,2,2,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

In this context, the EU neighbouring countries (ENC) are the main countries of origin and transit of legal and irregular migration towards Europe. Their economic, cultural, and historical links also make them an important potential source of labour. The objective of this paper is to analyse past and future trends in ENC-EU bilateral migration relationships. With this aim, we specify and estimate a gravity model for nearly 200 countries between 1960 and 2010. Next, we use the model to obtain medium-run migration forecasts.

All patients had been operated during 24 hours after admission to the hospital. The surgical procedure lasted between 35 to 60 minutes. The postoperative course has resulted with no infection, no implant breaks and no migration of the implant. The day after surgery, the patient gets up with the help of equipment and assistance of physiotherapists, on the 71' day the patients were released from the institution and continued the rehabilitation at the spa. Fracture healed six months later. According to DRG, the CIHI reallocates HRK 18,525.00 for a single case of PFNA insertion, and ultimately it amounted to HRK 685,425.00 for 2015.

Among the costs of disclosure are the costs of information production and dissemination; for example, the costs of adopting an information system to collect, process data and report information about the company and the costs of hiring accountants and audits, etc. In this study, a framework for empirical tests of the relation between disclosure and the cost of equity capital is determined. This study extends research into whether disclosure of corporate and financial information is associated with firms' costs of equity capital. Using cost of equity capital estimates derived from capital asset pricing model, we find that firms with higher levels of financial transparency are associated with significantly lower costs of equity capital. Economic theory assumes that by increasing the level of corporate reporting, firms not only increase their stock market liquidity, but also decrease the investors' estimation risk, arising from uncertainty about future returns and payout distributions. The results show that firms on the Kazakhstan market can reduce their cost of equity capital by increasing the level of their voluntary corporate disclosures. Based on the analysis of existing empirical research, the disclosure index for a sample of 37 Kazakh companies has been constructed and regression analysis of the influence of the disclosure index on the cost of equity capital has been conducted. The obtained results show that the received findings correlate with foreign empirical studies, and the disclosure index in this sample has a negative impact on the cost of equity capital.","[Baimukhamedova, Aizhan] Baskent Univ, Fac Commercial Sci, Ankara, Turkey; [Baimukhamedova, Gulzada; Aimurzinov, Murata; Luchaninova, Albina] Kostanay Social Tech Univ Z Aldamzhar, Dept Econ & Management, Kostanay, Kazakhstan",Baskent University,"Baimukhamedova, A (通讯作者)，Baskent Univ, Fac Commercial Sci, Ankara, Turkey.",djanin50@mail.ru; gulzada48@mail.ru,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,0,KODISA,SEONGNAM,"HANSHIN OFFICETEL STE 1030, 2463-4 SHINHEUNG-DONG SUJEONG-GU, SEONGNAM, GYEONGGI-DO 461-720, SOUTH KOREA",2287-478X,,,INT CONF KOREA DISTR,,,2017,,,,,,,71,73,,,,,,3,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ1UR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418104000010,0

Access to finance problems in these countries are potentially harmful to development of entrepreneurship, innovation performance and overall growth, leading to further lagging behind more advanced market economies. In this paper we analyse perceptions on access to finance in post-transition EU member countries. Special focus in the paper has been put on the differences between innovative and non-innovative firms. Furthermore, we seek to identify the characteristics of the firms that contribute to the gap formation. Empirical analysis in this paper relies on the latest available Business Environment Survey (BEEPS V), covering the 2012-2013 period. The sample in this study consists of 3,393 firms from eleven central and eastern European countries - EU members (Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovak Republic and Slovenia). The analysis expectedly revealed that innovative firms perceive financing constraints to be more important for their business, but somewhat unexpectedly the differences across countries are present. Although access to finance is more likely to be perceived as a problem by innovative firms, the firms that are either a segment of larger enterprise or established as joint venture, in general have less problems in financing their activities. When exploring the contributors to the perceptions in access to finance gap, only one variable proved to be important - female top management. It seems that if female top managers were more equally distributed between innovative and non-innovative firms, the perceptions on access to finance gap would be smaller.","[Botric, Valerija] Inst Econ, Dept Current Econ Trends Short Term Forecasts & F, Zagreb, Croatia; [Bozic, Ljiljana] Inst Econ, Dept Ind Econ Innovat & Entrepreneurship, Zagreb, Croatia",Institute of Economics Zagreb (EIZ); University of Zagreb; University of Zagreb; Institute of Economics Zagreb (EIZ),"Botric, V (通讯作者)，Inst Econ, Dept Current Econ Trends Short Term Forecasts & F, Zagreb, Croatia.",vbotric@eizg.hr; ljbozic@eizg.hr,"Božić, Ljiljana/I-6327-2019","Bozic, Ljiljana/0000-0001-5104-7501; Botric, Valerija/0000-0001-5482-7490",,,,,33,4,4,1,16,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The change between the three generations of management accounting in Romania [1st generation (1940-1947), 2nd generation (1948-1993), 3rd generation (1994 present)]is analysed differently depending on the development stage of management accounting and on the possibility accountants had to exercise their professional judgment. The analysis of the change during the first two periods is done in this article based only on literature investigation given that during the 1st generation the only issue raised was that of presenting concepts and exemplifying certain practices regarding cost calculation, and that during the 2nd generation it was not possible to make any volunteer changes (by initiative of the accountants, based on applying professional judgment). For the 3rd generation, where the change in management accounting may occur voluntarily, several drivers of change are taken into account, the research being focused on the following directions: 0 analysis of the existing trend at international level in terms of changes taking place in management accounting; (ii) analysis of the changes occurred in the national accounting legislation aimed at the organisation and role of management accounting; (iii) analysis of the typology of accountants in Romania correlated with their perception on management accounting with respect to interpreting the factors that led to change, and (iv) empirical study on the analysis of the attitude shown by the accountants in Romania with respect to the information provided by management accounting in two different moments in time (2009 and 2014). The results of the empirical study have shown that there is a voluntary change in the attitude of accountants in Romania concerning the information provided by management accounting.","[Calu, Daniela Artemisa; Dumitru, Madalina; Jinga, Gabriel] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Accounting & Management Informat Syst, Dept Accounting & Auditing, 41 Dacia Blvd,Dist 1, Bucharest, Romania; [Dumitru, Valentin-Florentin] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Accounting & Management Informat Syst, Dept Management Informat Syst, 41 Dacia Blvd,Dist 1, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Calu, DA (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Accounting & Management Informat Syst, Dept Accounting & Auditing, 41 Dacia Blvd,Dist 1, Bucharest, Romania.",daniela.calu@ase.ro; madalina.dumitru@cig.ase.ro; valentin.dumitru@cig.ase.ro; gabriel.jinga@cig.ase.ro,"CALU, Daniela Artemisa/C-3786-2011; Dumitru, Madalina/C-3885-2011","CALU, Daniela Artemisa/0000-0002-2306-5275; Dumitru, Madalina/0000-0001-9159-6302",,,,,25,3,3,0,17,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The results of this empirical study suggest that factors influencing high-end disruptive innovation include government support, external knowledge sources, strategic support, and dominant position of R & D; while the factors influencing low-end disruptive innovation are cooperation with venture capitalists, external knowledge sources, dominant position of R&D, and entrepreneurs' innovation willingness.

The paper presents a qualitative study of non-professional investors in Taiwan, where levels of participation in the stock market are very high. It shows that investors are embedded in complex networks of social relations, cultural norms and economic projects. We use Zelizer's notions of relational work' and earmarking' to explore how economic relations construct and reinforce social relations: investing is productive of, as well as derived from, social structures. Stock market participation secures access to social groupings and reproduces hierarchical relations in families and social networks. Our study seeks to highlight the relational content of financial markets, and calls for further investigation of the relational work performed by the material-calculative architectures of high finance.","[Chen, Yu-Hsiang] Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Sociol, 151 Univ Rd, New Taipei 23741, Taiwan; [Roscoe, Philip] Univ St Andrews, Sch Management, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland",National Taipei University; University of St Andrews,"Roscoe, P (通讯作者)，Univ St Andrews, Sch Management, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland.",yhchen12@mail.ntpu.edu.tw; pjr10@st-andrews.ac.uk,,"Chen, Yu-Hsiang/0000-0001-8810-0716",,,,,67,2,4,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

A critical Meta-Analysis of a primary data yield by questionnaires, as well as an investigative and comparative search and presentation of secondary data from a multitude of sources, along with the Socratic questioning method, led to a rather surprising conclusion. The hypothesis of the awareness, knowledge and willingness to use the new rules by consumers wanting to and/or taking consumer mortgage credits are confirmed, as well as the hypothesis that these new rules will lead to an increase of complications and administrative burdens, and costs. A cursory comparison shows that the Czech critical perception of the MCD, CCA and their impacts has parallels in EU member states. Indeed, the EU drive to create and support the effective and competitive Single European Mortgage Market in the name of the (alleged) consumer protection has several highly controversial features.","[Cvik, Eva Danile] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Law, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500 6, Czech Republic; [Pelikanova, Radka MacGregor] Metropolitan Univ Prague, Dept Int Business, Dubecska 900-10, Prague 10031 10, Strasnice, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Metropolitan University Prague,"Cvik, ED (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Law, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500 6, Czech Republic.",cvik@pef.czu.cz; radkamacgregor@yahoo.com,"MacGregor Pelikanova, Radka/G-2601-2018; Vrana, Ivan/H-1768-2018; MacGregor, Robert/E-9858-2019; Cvik, Eva Daniela/H-1768-2018","MacGregor Pelikanova, Radka/0000-0001-9628-7146; Vrana, Ivan/0000-0001-5920-5631; MacGregor, Robert/0000-0003-2888-3880; Cvik, Eva Daniela/0000-0002-8873-8039",,,,,12,1,1,1,3,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-499-5,,,,2017,,,,,,,184,194,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ7IS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427306200020,0

The process of their creation is strongly based on individual and team commitment to create improvements in every organizational area. This commitment is triggered by innovation climate including employee positive relationships (PRW) and supporting internal communication facets. The aim of the paper is to define causal relations among the aforementioned variables. We hypothesize that positive relationships at work are a prerequisite of the innovation creation process, i.e. they stimulate employee commitment to innovation creation regardless of the employee position in an organization as well as influence internal communication facets that support innovativeness. Notably, among internal communication elements we analyze open communication of both good and bad information and employee informal meetings. The analyses are based on the quantitative survey conducted on the sample of 200 Polish companies representing various sectors and selected from rankings of the most dynamically developing organizations in Central Europe. In each company we obtained information from a person involved in leading a team creating innovations, i.e. representing different functional departments. In the course of data analyses we used the hierarchical regression and the linear regression analysis. The results support the hypotheses of PRW key role in the innovativeness process, and the effect appeared to be linear.

The results of the research revealed that Kaunas Old Town includes a developing international art gallery service cluster that is oriented towards local market and encompasses 14 different types of organisations. Cooperation among these organisations manifests through spread of information, discounts, various kinds of help, premise leasing and organisation of common projects. The depth of the cluster should be growing in the future due to the possibility to include snore companies in the industrial sector. The depth of the cluster and international cooperation reveals the open structure of the cluster, i. e., it crosses over not only Kaunas city (where the cluster is mostly concentrated) but also the borders of the country.

Previous research has drawn mainly on data concerning manufacturing companies one year before bankruptcy. Our research examines financial ratios that are suitable bankruptcy indicators in two different industries (the construction and manufacturing industries) over a period of five years prior to bankruptcy. Our main objective is to verify whether bankruptcy predictors are industry-specific. Another objective was to determine which indicators can detect signs of bankruptcy earlier than one period before bankruptcy. We presume that the application of industry-specific indicators can help increase the predictive accuracy of bankruptcy models when applied to a particular industry. Per analogiam, we assume that the inclusion of indicators capable of detecting signs of bankruptcy more than a year before its occurrence will increase their predictive capacity. Significant predictors were first identified on a linear basis using the parametric t-test or F-test; for the sake of comparison, a non-linear non-parametric Boosted Trees method was also applied. Data for a total of 34,229 active companies and 304 companies that went bankrupt during the relevant period was analyzed. The research confirmed our presumption that bankruptcy predictors are both industry and time specific. Four years before bankruptcy, the indicators return on assets, inventory turnover and asset structure are important predictors in both the manufacturing and construction industries. The net working capital to total assets ratio is a specific predictor for manufacturing companies in the third year before bankruptcy, as is the short-term indebtedness indicator. In the construction industry, specific predictors are the net working capital to sales ratio in the third and first years before bankruptcy, and the interest coverage indicator in all four years preceding bankruptcy. Were these indicators to be included in a model for an alternative industry, they would be likely to reduce its accuracy.","[Karas, Michal; Reznakova, Maria] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Inst Finances, Brno, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,"Karas, M (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Inst Finances, Brno, Czech Republic.",karas@fbm.vutb.cz; reznakova@fbm.vutbr.cz,"Karas, Michal/C-1261-2018; Reznakova, Maria/AAQ-6282-2020; Karas, Michal/HDN-2653-2022","Karas, Michal/0000-0001-8824-1594; Reznakova, Maria/0000-0002-7261-607X; Karas, Michal/0000-0001-8824-1594",Internal Grant Agency of Brno University of Technology [FP-S-15-2877],Internal Grant Agency of Brno University of Technology,"This paper is the output of the specific research project 'Selected Questions of Financial Management of Companies in the International Environment' of the Internal Grant Agency of Brno University of Technology, with Registration Number FP-S-15-2877.",,43,16,16,2,25,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The publicly traded retail firms listed in the KOSPI and KOSDAQ markets are analyzed from 2000 to 2016. Our empirical analysis finds infrequent capital structure adjustments for the Korean retail firms, which is in line with the U.S. evidence. However, our duration analysis argues that the role of fixed adjustment cost is important in the determination of capital structure adjustments, unlike the existing studies emphasizing both of fixed and convex cost components. This paper confirms the existence of capital structure adjustment costs for the Korean retail firms.

This study proposes an approach for dynamic Data Envelopment Analysis to measure intertemporal innovation efficiency performance of China's high-tech industry during 2001-2015. The significant difference from existing studies is that the accumulated patent stock measured by Perpetual Inventory Method is regarded as a carry-over variable to link regional innovation activities over multi-periods. Furthermore, this model can deal with the overall efficiency score from a long-term and systematic perspective, and thus the overall efficiency score is decomposed into period scores with endogenous weights. The empirical results indicate that neglecting the carry-over variable may overestimate the efficiency of innovation system in China's high-tech industry; R&D efficiency of high-tech industry has almost improved monotonically throughout the study period; The eastern area has the highest average efficiency score, followed by the western area, and then by the central area; There is no statistical significant relationship between R&D personnel and R&D efficiency, and government grants have negative effects on improving efficiency.

Although the idea of reusing cultural heritage is not new, the emerging concept of adaptive reuse stresses even more the importance of a holistic approach for addressing successful interventions. Selecting among the potential uses the one that could ensure the preservation of physical characters as well as intangible values, fueling economic development, is a challenging policy and design issue.

The application of a systematic approach in HW/OS cargo transportation processes allows reducing costs of delivery of such a cargo several times, which leads to a dramatic change of economic development and investment attraction conditions. Thus creating a system of criteria for the selection and assessment of HW/OS routes, which would allow selecting the most appropriate route of transportation in terms of cost and time, is expedient for this reason. The algorithm for the assessment of HW/OS cargo transportation routes will be drawn up in this article.

The reason for this growing interest is mainly due to the increasing relevance of real estate within the global economy and the need for assessment tools that can support asset management and enhancement strategies at a decision-making level. Many owners have expressed a need for such valuation tools: lending institutions, real estate funds, insurance companies, and managers of public assets (municipalities, etc.). Because of those new valuation needs and the difficulty involved in applying existing models, a new appraisal model is proposed here; a pluri-parametric one that would allow rapid assessment of a large real-estate portfolio in various real-estate market segments. The model was tested on three large real-estate portfolios: TQP property assets (Pension benefits of the staff of Bank of Italy): the Bank of Italy's district in L'Aquila (Italy); and a portion of Piedmont's ASL/ASO's assets.","[Sdino, Leopoldo; Magoni, Sara] Politecn Milan, Dept Bldg Environm Sci & Technol, Milan, Italy; [Zorzi, Ferruccio] Politecn Torino, Interuniv Dept Sci Design & Land Policies, Turin, Italy; [Rosasco, Paolo] Univ Genoa, Dept Architectural Sci, Genoa, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan; Polytechnic University of Turin; University of Genoa,"Sdino, L (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, Dept Bldg Environm Sci & Technol, Milan, Italy.",leo.sdino@polimi.it; ferruccio.zorzi@polito.it; rosasco@arch.unige.it; estimo.abc@polimi.it,"PAOLO, ROSASCO/AAC-4590-2020; Sdino, Leopoldo/X-8572-2019; Sdino, Leopoldo/F-6813-2014","PAOLO, ROSASCO/0000-0002-8814-9090; SDINO, LEOPOLDO/0000-0002-2933-7817",,,,,56,5,5,0,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1865-3529,,978-3-319-49676-4; 978-3-319-49675-7,GREEN ENERGY TECHNOL,,,2017,,,,,,,39,52,,10.1007/978-3-319-49676-4_4,0.0,,,14,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI6HB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413289600004,0

In the context of formal or informal R&D, Dynic and Kyokko own R&D centres, while Maeda does not, which is due to the size of firms. This study analyses their R&D and HRD organizational structures and implementations and identifies factors which determine the nature of their R&D and HRD. The factors promoting innovation extracted based on the in-depth interviews are (1) the size of firm, (2) types of product and production, (3) seeds of innovation, (4) attitude toward risk and (5) learning process. The common factor acting as the basis for the firms' R&D structure was identified as ISO9001 which three firms commonly introduced and applied.

Paper presents results of research conducted on sample file of Slovak production enterprises. The main aim of this paper is to explore the extent of optimization methods utilization in production practice in Slovakia and to analyze possible relationship between enterprise's size and used optimizing method. Representativeness of the sample file was confirmed by application of Pearson's chi-squared test (chi(2)-test) due to criterion of enterprise's size. The results of this research have an implication for business practice and may serve managers in their decision-making process. In managerial practice enterprises have to deal with many different problems concerning their production. The majority of them can be resolved using mathematical programming. Achieved results provide an insight of current applications with stress on types of mathematical programming modifications used in optimization.,"[Veselovska, Lenka] Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Inst Managerial Syst, Francisciho 910-8, Poprad 05801, Slovakia",Matej Bel University,"Veselovská, L (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Inst Managerial Syst, Francisciho 910-8, Poprad 05801, Slovakia.",lenka.veselovska@umb.sk,"Veselovská, Lenka/F-8379-2018",,,,,,28,0,0,0,2,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-499-5,,,,2017,,,,,,,894,901,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ7IS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427306200092,0

The aim of this paper is therefore to determine the maximum volume of deposits that can be withdrawn from individual banks operating in the Visegrad countries and to identify the determinants of their sensitivity to a bank run. The data cover the period from 2000 to 2014. Although bank liquidity, measured by the liquid asset ratio, decreased in all countries during the analyzed period, the level of liquidity differs among countries. We have simulated a bank run as a sudden withdrawal of 20% of client deposits. The ability of individual banks to survive this crisis scenario significantly differs. Nevertheless, as Czech and Hungarian banks were more liquid, they are better prepared for a potential bank run than Polish and Slovak banks. After that, using the panel data regression analysis, we tested seven bank-specific factors and seven macroeconomic factors. The sensitivity of commercial banks from the Visegrad countries to a possible bank run is determined mainly by different aspects of bank liquidity ( not only the level of bank liquidity, but also connection to bank lending activity, the way of its financing and also activity on the interbank market). Among the other bank specific factors, profitability, capital adequacy and size of the banks are relevant in some countries. When it comes to macroeconomic factors, interest rate and unemployment rate are important. However, we can conclude that the most important factor is the level of bank liquidity: banks with a sufficient buffer of liquid assets are safer than other banks, particular during periods of financial distress.","[Vodova, Pavla Klepkova; Stavarek, Daniel] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Finance & Accounting, Opava, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Vodová, PK (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Finance & Accounting, Opava, Czech Republic.",klepkova@opf.slu.cz; stavarek@opf.slu.cz,"Stavárek, Daniel/A-7134-2010; Vodova, Pavla Klepkova/ABG-2948-2020","Stavárek, Daniel/0000-0001-5061-1721; Vodova, Pavla Klepkova/0000-0003-0382-5174",Czech Science Foundation [GACR 16-17796S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"Publication of this paper was supported by the Czech Science Foundation (Project GACR 16-17796S, Affiliation with financial conglomerate as a determinant of performance and risk of banks).

Not every person with STEM qualifications, however, finds employment in a STEM job. This article analyzes the geography of this matching between STEM degree holders and certain types of STEM occupations across large metropolitan labor markets in theUnited States. We find that although labor-market size has no effect, living in denser STEM labor markets elevates the probabilities of matching; having an advanced degree enhances this effect. Women are also far less likely to be matched than men; being black or Latino additionally lowers the chances of matching. Combining spatial effects with individual attributes increases probabilities of matching in places with high concentrations of STEM jobs for women, racial minorities, and the foreign born, but these advantages are often the same for white, native-born men. In denser STEM labor markets the job-matching advantage spans the labor pool, conferring no differential benefit for different population subgroups.","[Wright, Richard] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Geog, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Ellis, Mark; Townley, Matthew] Univ Washington, Dept Geog, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Dartmouth College; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Wright, R (通讯作者)，Dartmouth Coll, Dept Geog, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",richard.a.wright@dart-mouth.edu; ellism@uw.edu; townleym@uw.edu,"Ellis, Mark/H-5271-2012","Wright, Richard/0000-0002-9884-7343; Ellis, Mark/0000-0002-0435-1348",NICHD NIH HHS [P2C HD042828] Funding Source: Medline,NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,41,21,33,3,32,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

We show that high aftermarket power prompts firms to engage in inefficiently aggressive below-cost pricing in the foremarket. This inefficiency is driven by the presence of consumers with valuations below marginal cost. While for intermediate aftermarket power their presence leads to a competition-softening effect, for high aftermarket power firms attract increasing numbers of unprofitable consumers by aggressively pricing below cost. For high aftermarket power, firms' equilibrium profits can therefore be decreasing in aftermarket power but are always higher than for low aftermarket power. If firms engage in price discrimination by bundling the foremarket and aftermarket goods or by reducing their aftermarket power, they avoid selling to unprofitable consumers but also reduce the competition-softening effect.

The ocean containers are built for continuous transportation with cargo. However, due to the imbalance in world trade and other inherent characteristics of shipping the import volumes and export volumes of laden containers in a port are not equal. This variation leads carriers reposition empty containers from excess ports to elsewhere that the empty containers are in demand. If carriers retain containers in a port pending exports demands the sole purpose of containers cannot be met. Thus, it may add storage cost and wear and tear that makes the container shipping uneconomical. This paper appraises the potential of the container exchange and its practical aspects using real container data. Further, it focuses on several factors that may influence container exchange among carriers. Finally, it concludes that the organizational factors play the key role in container exchange thus recommends for further research based on statistical analysis of this paper.","[Edirisinghe, Lalith] CINEC, Fac Management Humanities & Social Sci, Maritime Campus,IT Pk,Millennium Dr, Malabe, Sri Lanka; [Edirisinghe, Lalith] Dalian Maritime Univ, Coll Transportat Management, 1 Linghai Rd, Dalian, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Jin, Zhihong] Dalian Maritime Univ, 1 Linghai Rd, Dalian, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Wijeratne, A.

But while financial decisions often trigger strong emotional responses, little is known about the relation between taxpayers' emotions and their compliance choices. We hypothesize that emotions mediate the relationship between the perception of tax authorities and intended tax compliance. In a scenario-based experiment with 411 self-employed Turkish taxpayers, we find that highlighting authorities' enforcement capacity (i.e. high power) induces negative emotions while elevating enforced compliance and the readiness to evade. Trust, on the other hand, reduces negative emotions and raises positive feelings, which are associated with intentions to comply voluntarily. Moreover, a combination of high power and high trust reduces negative feelings and increases intentions to comply while undermining the readiness to evade. Our findings suggest that emotions matter in shaping compliance. Specifically, enforcement efforts that induce negative emotions might have negative compliance implications. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Policies aimed at stimulating green freight transport should mitigate the CO(2 )emissions that the transport sector produces. Fostering consumer's green behavior is fundamental to reduce the impact transportation has on the environment. One can pursue this goal by stimulating consumer's intention to purchase goods that are delivered in an eco-friendly fashion. This paper investigates consumer's choices and estimates how much youngers are willing to pay for green urban freight distribution. A questionnaire-based web survey among a group of 350 Italian university students was conducted using a stated preference approach to estimate their willingness to pay for green urban distribution. The results obtained are relevant for retailers and/or transport providers who are interested in knowing if consumers' willingness is sufficient to compensate for the additional costs they have to incur to reduce polluting emissions. The results show that: 1) students, in general, are quite concerned about the environmental impact freight transport produces, responsive to pro-environmental issues and attentive to opinion makers; 2) females and public transport users are more responsive to green freight deployment. These findings have interesting policy implications, suggesting to channel specific government-sponsored information campaigns toward these population groups to stimulate their green logistic responsive behavior thus inducing a demand for cleaner shipment of goods in cities.","[Polinori, Paolo; Bigerna, Simona; Bollino, Carlo Andrea; Micheli, Silvia] Univ Perugia, Dept Econ, Perugia, Italy; [Marcucci, Edoardo] Molde Univ Coll, Dept Logist, Molde, Norway; [Gatta, Valerio] Roma Tre Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Rome, Italy",University of Perugia; Molde University College; Roma Tre University,"Marcucci, E (通讯作者)，Molde Univ Coll, Dept Logist, Molde, Norway.",edoardo.marcucci@uniroma3.it,"marcucci, edoardo/AAJ-6539-2020; Polinori, Paolo/K-1281-2019; MArcucci, Edoardo/AAP-5143-2021","marcucci, edoardo/0000-0002-9813-3973; Polinori, Paolo/0000-0003-3477-965X; Gatta, Valerio/0000-0003-1631-1797; Micheli, Silvia/0000-0001-5777-5462",,,,,110,13,13,4,80,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"VIA SANTA BIBBIANA 28, PISA, I-56127, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

Yet the international evidence on the relationship between municipal output or size (in population terms) and costs as measured by expenditure per capita is unconvincing, with doubts over whether size matters at all for the efficient provision of local public services. Given the 2014 structural reforms aimed at local government territorial consolidation in Ireland, we use pre- and post-merger data to investigate whether there is any evidence of scale economies in the Irish local government system. The econometric study finds empirical evidence of U-shaped cost curves for Irish local councils in 2011 and 2016. In both years the range of turning points are near the median council size, suggesting that many local authorities were operating in the diseconomies region before and after the 2014 territorial reforms and amalgamations. With more territorial changes currently planned, policymakers should look at further amalgamations only on a case-by-case basis but also at other mechanisms to deliver efficiencies, either through strategic alliances and more shared services arrangements or other ways of inter-municipal cooperation as is common in many continental European countries.","[Turley, Gerard; McDonagh, John; McNena, Stephen] Natl Univ Ireland, Galway, Ireland; [Grzedzinski, Arkadiusz] Berlin Sch Econ & Law, Berlin, Germany",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; Berlin School of Economics & Law,"Turley, G (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland, Galway, Ireland.",gerard.turley@nuigalway.ie,,"Turley, Gerard/0000-0001-8059-7123","College of Business, Public Policy and Law at NUI Galway","College of Business, Public Policy and Law at NUI Galway","The authors wish to thank the College of Business, Public Policy and Law at NUI Galway for funding this research project.

Our aim is to grasp the competing discourses on the public management of Dutch waterway renewal in order to understand the different interpretations and how these influence waterway planning. The analysis demonstrates that a technical discourse, in which renewal is framed as sustaining the waterway network, currently prevails in the Netherlands. However, this discourse is increasingly complemented by a financial and functional discourse. These new discourses emphasise co-financing arrangements between public governments and the incorporation of new functionalities and trends into the outmoded waterways. As recent practices are altered by the new discourses, the established technical discourse decreases in importance, as does the central role for infrastructure operators. Instead, renewal becomes a strategic, political matter for transport policymakers, in which new waterway configurations are discussed. For producing legitimate future renewal practices, this article recommends that the connection between strategic policymakers and apolitical operators could be improved.","[Willems, Jannes J.] Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, Dept Spatial Planning & Environm, Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Willems, JJ (通讯作者)，POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",willems@essb.eur.nl,,"Willems, Jannes/0000-0002-3318-9706",research program Sustainable Networks of the University of Groningen; Dutch public agency Rijkswaterstaat,research program Sustainable Networks of the University of Groningen; Dutch public agency Rijkswaterstaat,This work was financed by the research program Sustainable Networks of the University of Groningen and the Dutch public agency Rijkswaterstaat.

To help answer those questions, this study explores travel time and fare differences between UberPool and traditional transit service on 50 paired trips, between 3 and 11 miles long, in Chicago, Illinois. UberPool is found to reduce trip times by an average of 67.6% between neighborhoods, compared to just 13.7% to and from the central business district. Multiple regression analysis shows travel times on CTA and UberPool are similar for trips in which transit riders do not need to make transfers or walk long distances. Consumers save $1.29/minute when using UberPool on trips originating or terminating in the downtown district, compared to just $.38/minute on trips between neighborhoods. In both cases, the amount spent per minute saved exceeds the level the U.S. Department of Transportation recommends using when conducting analysis about the value transit users place on saving time.","[Schwieterman, Joseph; Smith, C.

These assessments differ from personal footprints in that to produce credible and transparent calculations, companies follow established reporting guidelines. This article investigates how the corporate carbon footprint structures the business response to climate change across space. Two key tasks are undertaken. First, in referencing the rules and standards for calculation, how the footprint tool makes sense of atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs) for companies, helping them establish ownership and responsibility for certain emission sources is described. This is accomplished through an emission ranking system where GHG sources are categorized as either owned (scope 1 or 2) or value chain (scope 3). Second, the spatial implications to using this governing device as a climate management tool are documented. To do this, the emission performance of twenty-one large US-based corporations over a six-year period (2010-15) are tracked. The data reveal that over time, corporations reduce their owned emissions, while their value chain emissions grow. The article argues that the footprint tool as a means to govern GHG emissions contributes to the spatializing of a corporate response climate change. Specifically, it works to enclose climate responsibility, locating it in particular spaces and not in others. Importantly, this represents a limit to what the private sector can accomplish with regard to climate change action and should be considered in light of recent widespread calls for private-sector leadership on climate change.","[Walenta, Jayme] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Geog & Environm, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Walenta, J (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Dept Geog & Environm, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",jwalenta@utexas.edu,,"Walenta, Jayme/0000-0002-4986-7532",,,,,66,14,15,5,68,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

At the same time, telecommuting might also lead to a blurring of boundaries between work and family life which may increase work-family conflict. Using individual-level data from 15,035 German employees, this paper analyses the opportunity of employees for telecommuting and its role in work-family conflicts. The analysis is based on a probit model.

To measure the performance of countries in terms of logistics, in 2007 the World Bank created the Logistics Performance Index (LPI), which uses six core indicators to rank countries with regard to their overall logistics performance. In the past decade, the LPI has been widely used by policymakers and researchers to formulate measures on logistics and freight transportation. At the moment, however, the different indicators are all regarded as being equally important when the overall index score is calculated, which seems highly unlikely within the complex system of logistics. This research assigns weights to the six components using the Best Worst Method (BWM), a multi-criteria decision-analysis method. A questionnaire among 107 experts from different countries found significant differences with the equal weights used in the current LPI. Infrastructure is considered the most important component for logistics performance, with a weight of 0.24, more than twice as important as tracking and tracing, which is considered to be the least important factor, with a weight of 0.10. The findings are relevant for policymakers in transportation and logistics. Although the weights now have only a mild effect on rankings due to the correlation between the LPI indicators, they may point towards different policy priorities compared to the current LPI. Our results also point out some possible weaknesses in the LPI methodology.","[Rezaei, Jafar; van Roekel, Wilco S.; Tavasszy, Lori] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Sect Transport & Logist, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology,"Rezaei, J (通讯作者)，Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Sect Transport & Logist, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands.",j.rezaei@tudelft.nl; W.S.vanRoekel@student.tudelft.nl; l.a.tavasszy@tudelft.nl,"Rezaei, Jafar/K-1914-2012","Rezaei, Jafar/0000-0002-7407-9255; Tavasszy, Lorant/0000-0002-5164-2164",,,,,41,166,172,15,172,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

As women shift their hours from the home sector to the market sector, goods that were previously produced in the home may be replaced by market services. This paper uses the Panel Study for Income Dynamics, Consumer Expenditure Survey, and the American Time Use Survey to analyze the extent to which households replace home production with purchased market services, and how the relationship between men's and women's labor supplies affects these decisions. We show that women who are employed spend less time on home production activities that have close market alternatives than women who are not employed. Additionally, expenditures on market services that can replace home production are higher for married households in which the woman is employed compared to those with nonworking women.","[Forrester, Kellie] Calif State Polytech Univ Pomona, 3801 West Temple Ave, Pomona, CA 91768 USA; [Klein, Jennifer] Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",California State University System; California State Polytechnic University Pomona; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Forrester, K (通讯作者)，Calif State Polytech Univ Pomona, 3801 West Temple Ave, Pomona, CA 91768 USA.",kforrester@cpp.edu,,"Klein, Jennifer/0000-0001-8332-4147",,,,,24,1,1,2,18,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",2054-0892,2054-0906,,J DEMOGR ECON,J.Demogr.

This regime allows for market-initiated services as well as contracted public services initiated by competent authorities. The legal regime prioritises market-initiated services. In 2012 the legal framework was amended, but the general setting of a hybrid regime was kept together with the priority of market initiatives. The new law came into force in 2013. It was expected that conflicting initiatives might possibly concern regional services but not city networks, because of the high level of subsidies that are typically necessary for the operation of such networks. Surprisingly, in 2015 a market initiative competed successfully against the authority's intention to tender the urban bus network in Pforzheim. As of December 2016 a daughter company of Deutsche Bahn operates these services without any contractual compensation. The company formerly operating the services in Pforzheim had to be shut down. The paper gives an overview of the regulation of the German road-based local public transport and describes the procedure by which commercial operators may gain access to the market. It provides a closer look at the Pforzheim case and concludes with an outlook on the (political) consequences.","[Karl, Astrid] KCW GmbH, Bernburger Str 27, D-10963 Berlin, Germany",,"Karl, A (通讯作者)，KCW GmbH, Bernburger Str 27, D-10963 Berlin, Germany.",karl@kcw-online.de,,,,,,,5,2,2,0,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

Accordingly, based on input from 19 interviews with MaaS actors active in West Sweden, this paper explores how MaaS could develop and how PT might be affected. Three predictive scenarios are identified market-driven, public-controlled and public-private and the implications for future PT, in terms of the scope, usage, access, business model, competence structure and brand value, are discussed in relation to these.

The purpose of the workshop was to consider recent advances in identifying, understanding, and measuring the wider impacts of public transport, defined as those not typically included in assessments of direct user and system costs and benefits. While not all impacts are as yet well understood, progress is being made both conceptually and methodologically. A promising methodological convergence is apparent between disciplines dealing with different aspects of the social value of transport - for instance psychology and geography and between different possibly overlapping definitions of wider impacts - such as accessibility, option value, and agglomeration benefits. The workshop also delved more deeply into the role of Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) and wider impact assessment in decision making. Case studies show that CBA does not inform decisions around project implementation as deeply as it might, and that assessments of wider benefits may open up space for manipulation of outcomes by vested interests. The workshop concluded that more work is needed on appraisal frameworks that are sufficiently transparent and rigorous to avoid abuse, and called for more case studies on the interaction between impact assessment and the political economy of institutions and decision makers.","[Venter, Christo] Univ Pretoria, Dept Civil Engn, Pretoria, South Africa; [Venter, Christo] Univ Pretoria, Ctr Transport Dev, Pretoria, South Africa; [Leong, Wai Yan] Land Transport Author, Singapore, Singapore",University of Pretoria; University of Pretoria,"Venter, C (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Civil Engn, Pretoria, South Africa.;Venter, C (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Ctr Transport Dev, Pretoria, South Africa.",christo.venter@up.ac.za; leong_wai_yan@lta.gov.sg,"Venter, Christo/E-6884-2011","Venter, Christo/0000-0002-2666-4812; leong, wai yie/0000-0002-5389-1121",,,,,25,6,6,1,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

The SARB uses a variety of models to aid them, with the core model being the most significant. Aim: The primary aim of this research is to determine whether the reverse yield gap (RYG) contains information that could be useful to the SARB when making monetary policy decisions. Setting: The authors found no evidence that similar studies on the RYG have previously been done in the South African context. Since the yield curve has been found to be significant in South Africa at forecasting economic growth, yet insignificant in Europe, the results for this research may too be different to the global experience. Methods: The authors tested for linear relationships between the RYG and economic growth and inflation over the period 1960-2014. Results: The results indicate that a slight linear relationship may exist in the case of economic growth, with the RYG based on earnings yields showing better out-of-sample forecasting abilities. Further investigation indicates that the linear relationship is stronger during times of economic upturn. The results for inflation forecasting, however, show no signs of a reasonable linear relationship. Conclusion: There is evidence for the SARB to consider whether the RYG can replace other economic variables in its core model without loss of predictive ability. Interestingly, this study found evidence to suggest that the RYG has an inverse relationship to future economic growth in South Africa, which is not what was expected.","[Gossman, Keren A.] Univ Witwatersrand, Fac Sci, Sch Stat & Actuarial Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Hayes, Mark G.] Curtin Univ, Fac Sci & Engn, Dept Math & Stat, Perth, WA, Australia",University of Witwatersrand; Curtin University,"Hayes, MG (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ, Fac Sci & Engn, Dept Math & Stat, Perth, WA, Australia.",mark.hayes@curtin.edu.au,,"Gossman, Keren/0000-0002-3797-2001",,,,,22,0,0,0,1,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

However, South Africa's exports to sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are typically smaller and more short-lived than its exports to its traditional markets. This is despite South African policymakers considering trade with SSA to be a priority. Aim: The aim of the article is to evaluate South Africa's utilisation of sustained export potential in SSA with a view to providing practical insights that will inform future policymaking and planning. Setting: Despite the priority attention given to SSA in the country's trade policy, South Africa is yet to make meaningful inroads into SSA's largest and fastest-growing economies. Method: The research method applied comprised three steps. The first step involved the identification, over a five-year period from 2010 to 2014, of consistently large and/or growing import demand in SSA for all products at the Harmonised System (HS) six-digit level, as well as the identification of products South Africa consistently exported competitively (sustainable exports). The second step entailed matching SSA markets with consistently large and/or growing import demand to South Africa's sustainable exports. The third step involved evaluating South Africa's utilisation of sustained export potential in SSA. Results: The results reveal that South Africa is utilising just over half (54%) of its sustained export potential in SSA. Conclusion: South Africa is, therefore, underutilising or not utilising close to 50% of its sustained export potential in SSA. Most of the export potential that South Africa is utilising is in Eastern Africa while most of the export potential that the country is underutilising and not utilising at all is in Central and Western Africa.","[Mhonyera, Gabriel; Steenkamp, Ermie; Matthee, Marianne] North West Univ, Sch Econ, Potchefstroom, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"Matthee, M (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Sch Econ, Potchefstroom, South Africa.",marianne.matthee@nwu.ac.za,"Mhonyera, Gabriel/AAR-2588-2021; Matthee, Marianne/AAU-6454-2021","Mhonyera, Gabriel/0000-0003-2957-000X; Matthee, Marianne/0000-0002-4679-9757",World Trade Organization (WTO); National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Africa [90709],World Trade Organization (WTO); National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Africa(National Research Foundation - South Africa),"Gabriel Mhonyera acknowledges the financial assistance of the World Trade Organization (WTO) towards this research.

D.",,,The influence of a 360-degree performance appraisal on labour productivity in an automotive manufacturing organisation,SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Background: South Africa's (SAs) decline in labour productivity in the manufacturing sector is a cause for concern. The sector turns to employees for innovative productivity improvement initiatives. Employees need to know what activities they are currently performing that need to improve. This is where a 360-degree performance appraisal system plays a growing role. The 360-degree performance appraisal is a valuable tool that provides an opportunity for employees to work together to identify strengths and areas that need improvement. Aim: This study investigates the influence of a 360-degree performance appraisal system for the improvement of labour productivity in the automotive parts manufacturing sector in SA. Settings: The study investigated the production and related experiences of an automotive parts manufacturing company that has adopted a 360-degree strategy. The company operates in the eThekwini district Municipality in KwaZulu-Natal. It assessed if 360-degree performance appraisal is responsible for the company's labour productivity improvements. Methods: The investigation was achieved by collecting pre- and post-360-degree quarterly data for spoilage, absenteeism, capital investment and labour productivity. Results: The 360-degree performance appraisal has no influence on labour productivity improvement. However, past capital investment plays a significant role in labour productivity increase. Results also showed a relationship between spoilage rate and labour productivity improvement. Conclusion: In order to maximise performance, a comprehensive performance policy must be developed, which aligns employee appraisal to performance. The study uncovered the strengths and weaknesses of a 360-degree performance appraisal system for labour productivity improvement in SA.","[Zondo, Robert W.

A standard approach is the ensemble model output statistics (EMOS) method, which results in a predictive distribution that is given by a single parametric law, with parameters that depend on the ensemble members. This article assesses the merits of combining multiple EMOS models based on different parametric families. In four case studies with wind speed and precipitation forecasts from two ensemble prediction systems, we investigate the performances of state of the art forecast combination methods and propose a computationally efficient approach for determining linear pool combination weights. We study the performance of forecast combination compared to that of the theoretically superior but cumbersome estimation of a full mixture model, and assess which degree of flexibility of the forecast combination approach yields the best practical results for post-processing applications.

We consider the performances of lasso-type methods when the true DGP is a factor model, contradicting the sparsity assumptionthat underlies penalized regression methods. We also investigate how the methods handle unit roots and cointegration in the data. In an extensive simulation study we find that penalized regression methods are more robust to mis-specification than factor models, even if the underlying DGP possesses a factor structure. Furthermore, the penalized regression methods can be demonstrated to deliver forecast improvements over traditional approaches when applied to non-stationary data that contain cointegrated variables, despite a deterioration in their selective capabilities. Finally, we also consider an empirical applicationto a large macroeconomic U.S. dataset and demonstrate the competitive performance of penalized regression methods.

The aim of the study is to determine whether individuals respond to incentives when deciding to engage in crime and whether this decision is dependent on the type of crime an individual engages in. The results of the paper support the economic theory of crime which indicates that criminals respond to incentives, particularly for property crimes. Higher rates of crime detection are associated with a fall in crime rates across all property crimes. Higher detection rates have been found to reduce crime rates for property crimes while the impact on violent crimes is found to be insignificant.

J,"Wood, AL",,,,"Wood, Amy Louise",,,The Spectacle of Lynching: Rituals of White Supremacy in the Jim Crow South,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND SOCIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,BLACK,"From 1890s to the 1930s, white mobs tortured and killed thousands of African Americans across the South. These lynchings, even those committed by the smallest of mobs, were ritualistic and performative, enacting and reinforcing the core beliefs of white supremacy. The narratives and photographs produced after lynchings likewise created and circulated representations of white domination and black subordination. Lynching was thus more than a social or political form of violence; it was a cultural spectacle that conveyed meaning to its white participants and spectators. This article, adapted from the author's 2009 book, examines the forces that gave rise to lynching spectacles and the cultural work those spectacles performed. It argues that, although the spectacle was reinforced through modern technologies, such as photography, lynching ultimately arose as a reaction against the transformations that modern life had brought to the South. Industrialization and urbanization had destabilized the racial hierarchy and fueled white fears of a black crime wave. Lynching was a violent means to assert order in the face of potential disorder. As such, it was rooted in traditional practices, such as notions of popular justice and public executions, and white southerners interpreted lynching spectacles through local customs and beliefs. Over time, the dissemination of lynching spectacle nationally through modern media by anti-lynching activists contributed to the decline of mob violence.","[Wood, Amy Louise] Illinois State Univ, Hist, Normal, IL 61761 USA",Illinois State University,"Wood, AL (通讯作者)，Illinois State Univ, Hist, Normal, IL 61761 USA.",alwood@ilstu.edu,,,,,,,69,9,19,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

We adopt a cross-country analysis of the determinants of recovery rates isolating three types of creditors (junior, senior, and new money claims). We investigate the structure of recoveries on a unique hand-collected sample of bankrupt firms in France, Germany, and the UK. We initially question value maximization, and study to which extent the legal provisions prevailing after insolvency filing can influence creditors' overall recoveries. Three procedures differ significantly from our benchmark (UK liquidations). French continuation and UK receivership exert a positive influence onto total repayments, while such influence becomes negative under French liquidation. We relate this finding to the ability of the two former procedures to improve coordination among the creditors, monitoring of the debtor, and/or incentives to file early. We then analyze value distribution by examining competition between the categories of creditors. We show that the insolvency systems do not converge. Junior and senior creditors are better served under the German and the French continuation procedures than in any other bankruptcy path. At the opposite, the UK liquidation procedures fail to satisfactorily serve the junior/senior creditors. Still, nearly all the insolvency procedures support fresh financing by protecting quite well new money claims. Overall, we do not confirm any superiority of one family of insolvency system over another, but rather stress the importance of an appropriate design of the procedures, especially regarding the incentives they create before and after insolvency filing.","[Blazy, Regis] IEP Strasbourg, LARGE, EM Strasbourg Business Sch, Strasbourg, France; [Petey, Joel; Weill, Laurent] Univ Strasbourg, EM Strasbourg Business Sch, LARGE, Strasbourg, France",Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg,"Weill, L (通讯作者)，Univ Strasbourg, EM Strasbourg Business Sch, LARGE, Strasbourg, France.",laurent.weill@unistra.fr,,"Weill, Laurent/0000-0002-8630-1351","ANR (Agence Nationale de la Recherche, EURODEF program); OSEO (BPIfrance)","ANR (Agence Nationale de la Recherche, EURODEF program)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); OSEO (BPIfrance)","ANR (Agence Nationale de la Recherche, EURODEF program) and OSEO (BPIfrance) provided this research with financial support.

The hypothetical monopolist test (also known as the Small but Significant Non-transitory Increase in Price test) is a clever, intuitive way of thinking the relevant market in antitrust, and is gaining ground in strategic management. The test, however, implicitly disregards resource characteristics in relevant market delineation, focusing exclusively on demand side substitutability. In reassessing the hypothetical monopolist, we make 2 general contributions to the strategy literature. First, using cooperative game theory, we advance a precise resource-based definition of the hypothetical monopolist. Second, we demonstrate how this definition broadens our conventional understanding on 2 important topics: resource complementarities and disruptive innovations.

In addition to the effects of ship obsolescence, technical developments and environmental regulations on ship demolition, the state of the shipping market and operational costs are also significant influences. Using a dataset compiled from various data sources, this study analyzes individual shipowners' ship demolition decisions using survival analysis models. The empirical estimation of the Cox proportional hazards regression suggests the different demolition decision behavior under different shipping market cycles. The results also indicate the active ship demolition activities of the owners from developing countries after the financial crisis. Meanwhile, more aged and less efficient ships have been demolished after 2008 because of the high bunker consumption and the big owners cannot escape from this. Finally, the survival distribution function illustrates the impact of different factors on demolition behavior in different market situations.","[Yin, Jingbo] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Naval Architecture Ocean & Civil Engn, State Key Lab Ocean Engn, 800 Dongchuan RD, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Fan, Lixian] Shanghai Univ, Sch Management, 599 Shangda Rd, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Shanghai University,"Fan, LX (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ, Sch Management, 599 Shangda Rd, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China.",lixianfan@shu.edu.cn,"Fan, Lixian/T-3660-2019; Li, Wang/M-1612-2019","Fan, Lixian/0000-0002-7417-9635;",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71673181]; National Social Science Fund of China [17BGL259],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Fund of China,This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 71673181].

However, little research has been conducted regarding its characteristics, spatial patterns and dynamics. Based on the theories of economic growth, economic transition and urban hierarchy, this paper develops an analytical framework for elucidating the growth of the service industry in China. We find that cities with a high increment in the service industry tend to be located in coastal areas, and mainly constitute megacities and large, highly developed cities. Cities with higher administrative rank, such as centrally administrated municipalities, cities designated in the State Plan and provincial capitals, maintain relatively high growth in the service industry. It is concluded that China's economic transition and urban hierarchy play significant roles in the growth of the service industry, suggesting that service industry growth in China does not strictly adhere to growth patterns observed in Western countries.","[Zhong, Yun] Jinan Univ, Coll Econ, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wei, Yehua Dennis] Henan Univ, Key Inst Yellow River Civilisat & Sustainable Dev, Kaifeng 45001, Peoples R China; [Wei, Yehua Dennis] Henan Univ, Collaborat & Innovat Ctr Yellow River Civilisat H, Kaifeng 45001, Peoples R China; [Wei, Yehua Dennis] Univ Utah, Dept Geog, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",Jinan University; Henan University; Henan University; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Zhong, Y (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Coll Econ, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",zhongyunzsu@yahoo.com; wei@geog.utah.edu,"Wei, Yehua Dennis/A-7831-2009","Wei, Yehua Dennis/0000-0002-8510-388X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41371174, 41430637, 41130747]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [S201301001 2369]; Ford Foundation [0155-0883]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); Ford Foundation,"We would like to acknowledge the funding of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41371174, 41430637, 41130747), the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (S201301001 2369) and Ford Foundation (0155-0883).",,69,9,10,5,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

The principal settings for the study were the United States and South African markets representing, respectively, a developed and developing market. Principal component analysis was used to discern the major drivers of developing and developed market interest rates. The findings show that the principal component analysis technique is able to effectively classify and quantify the movements of yield curves across both markets in terms of three main factors, namely level, slope and curvature shifts. During certain periods, South African yield curve changes were largely driven by variations in United States interest rates and the rand/dollar exchange rate. Results also demonstrated that a volatile market and economic environment can significantly distort the shape and smoothness of yield curve movements.","[Patel, Kavir; Mohamed, Ashfaaq] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Cape Town, South Africa; [van Vuuren, Gary W.] Univ Free State, Business Sch, Bloemfontein, South Africa",University of Cape Town; University of the Free State,"van Vuuren, GW (通讯作者)，Univ Free State, Business Sch, Bloemfontein, South Africa.",vvgary@hotmail.com,"van Vuuren, Gary/B-5453-2019","van Vuuren, Gary/0000-0001-6811-0538",,,,,31,2,2,0,5,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Recently, the contractual disgorgement remedy has attracted much attention from scholars, yet no attempt has been made to analyze reliance investment under this remedy. In this article, we develop a model showing that under disgorgement a problem arises that is the mirror image of the problem that arises under expectation damages. While expectation damages lead to over-reliance by the non-breaching party, the disgorgement remedy leads to over-reliance by the breaching party. Therefore, the choice between these two contractual remedies should depend on which over-reliance problem is more costly. We also highlight other factors that can guide the choice between these two remedies.","[Givati, Yehonatan] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Law Sch, Jerusalem, Israel; [Kaplan, Yotam] Bar Ilan Univ, Law Sch, Ramat Gan, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Bar Ilan University,"Kaplan, Y (通讯作者)，Bar Ilan Univ, Law Sch, Ramat Gan, Israel.",ykaplan@sjd.law.harvard.edu,,,Project on the Foundations of Private Law at Harvard Law School; Harvard Law School Summer Academic Fellowship Program,Project on the Foundations of Private Law at Harvard Law School; Harvard Law School Summer Academic Fellowship Program,"We are grateful to the editor, Abraham Wickelgren, and two anonymous referees for their helpful comments.

Decisions should derive from a trade-off between the optimal solution and the most accepted one. Models and simulations are typically used as decision-support tools for technical /economic analyses. This paper proposes a novel modelling approach for a stakeholder analysis, aimed at investigating the complex phenomenon of consensus formation and the collective behaviour that can emerge from an interaction process. Agent-based models (ABMs) are used to reproduce the opinion dynamics on stakeholder networks, by representing single stakeholders (i.e. agents) endowed with certain characteristics (e.g. opinion, influence) and interacting with each other according to simple behavioural rules with the aim to find a convergence of opinions. The implemented models are described according to their main features, and the results of tailored participation experiments built with the help of multi-criteria decision-making methods are presented and compared to those derived from simulations, representing a first step towards model validation. The methodology proposed provides insight on the dynamics of social interaction and the emergent phenomena that can derive from participation processes. The implemented models can be used to help decision-makers and practitioners to support the design of efficient participation processes, and to deal with multiple stakeholders and complex issues regarding transport decisions.","[Le Pira, Michela] Univ Catania, Dept Civil Engn & Architecture DICAR, Via Santa Sofia 64, I-95125 Catania, Italy",University of Catania,"Le Pira, M (通讯作者)，Univ Catania, Dept Civil Engn & Architecture DICAR, Via Santa Sofia 64, I-95125 Catania, Italy.",mlepira@dica.unict.it,"Le Pira, Michela/M-8220-2015","Le Pira, Michela/0000-0002-5963-0854",,,,,65,5,5,1,15,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"VIA SANTA BIBBIANA 28, PISA, I-56127, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

The changing location of Michelin star-rated restaurants in the period 1986-2016 is put into a context of the changing relations between urban centres and their suburbs as well as the Randstad and the rest of the country. This paper suggests that the changing culinary geography of the Netherlands is related to the re-emergence of larger cities, particularly of Amsterdam, associated with the rise of an urban middle class epitomised by processes of gentrification.

The methodology consists in econometrically testing various scenarios of regulation and determining which of these best fits the data. Using aggregate data on the overall passenger traffic for the incumbent French rail operator (RO), SNCF, the two behavioral hypotheses of reference which we consider - absence of regulation of the rail operator which acts as a pure monopoly, and price regulation of services supplied by the RO - are both statistically significant and do not subtract from each other. This result is certainly related to the fact that passenger services include both high speed train services, for which the RO has some entrepreneurial freedom, and regional transport services, which are regulated by local authorities. In any case however, as the presence of unobservable efforts exerted by the RO to improve its productivity is statistically relevant, one concludes that the RO is not fully and properly regulated. This emphasizes that the design of policy reforms must account for the incentives they create on the RO. The analysis also shows that the most statistically significant scenarios are the ones in which the access tariff imposed by the infrastructure manager is such that the revenue generated by the access tariff is equal to the infrastructure spending. The pricing of the access to the infrastructure network therefore does not seem to be governed by economic principles, but more by budget considerations. While data limitations does neither allow to understand all the facets of a complex reality, nor to claim a high level of precision in the measure of all the parameters of interest, we believe however that we provide an objective methodology to characterize the optimal economic policies for the railway sector, in particular because it yields realistic estimates of the main structural parameters. Indeed the empirical results suggest that the railway industry as a whole exhibits increasing returns to scale, which incidentally is not compatible with the presence of multiple firms. In addition, the elasticity of demand for railway transport is relatively high, an indication of the competitive constraints this mode of transport faces from other transport modes or induced traffic.","[Ivaldi, Marc] Univ Toulouse, Toulouse Sch Econ, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31000 Toulouse, France; [Ivaldi, Marc] Univ Toulouse, EHESS, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31000 Toulouse, France; [Pouyet, Jerome] Paris Sch Econ, CNRS, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France; [Pouyet, Jerome] ENS, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Universite de Toulouse; Paris School of Economics; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS),"Ivaldi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse, Toulouse Sch Econ, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31000 Toulouse, France.;Ivaldi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse, EHESS, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31000 Toulouse, France.",marc.ivaldi@tse-fr.eu; jerome.pouyet@ens.fr,,,SNCF,SNCF,"We would like to thank Valerie Champagne, Dominique Deaux, JeanLouis Denizot for providing insights or comments on earlier versions.

This research relies on the aggregate data from the Farm Accountancy Data Network database for different farming types and regions. The DuPont identity was applied to analyse the profitability (returns on equity) of family farms and its determinants in terms of profit margin, asset turnover, and equity multiplier (leverage). The methodological contribution presented in this paper is the integration of the DuPont model into index decomposition analysis framework based on the Shapley value. Therefore, on is able to decompose the changes in profitability with respect to the explanatory factors. Following Calandro and Lane (2007), the research applies a competitiveness matrix to evaluate competitiveness of family farms. Sustainable growth ratio and sustainable growth challenge (SGC) ratio are used to test whether Lithuanian family farms growth had been sustainable. The results show that Lithuanian family farms have negative profitability growth. The profitability and sustainability growth analysis show that farmers must better to exploit all internal resources, used cost control and to improve the scale of operations. Competitive analysis revealed that specialist cereal, oilseeds and protein crops, general field cropping, and horticultural family farms are characterized by a relatively higher profitability and growth if opposed to the other farm types.","[Balezentis, Tomas; Novickyte, Lina] Lithuanian Inst Agrarian Econ, V Kudirkos Str 18, LT-01113 Vilnius, Lithuania",Lithuanian Institute of Agrarian Economics,"Balezentis, T (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Inst Agrarian Econ, V Kudirkos Str 18, LT-01113 Vilnius, Lithuania.",tomas.balezentis@laei.lt; lina.novickyte@laei.lt,"Novickytė, Lina/ABH-7744-2020; Balezentis, Tomas/D-8609-2015","Novickytė, Lina/0000-0002-1399-4679; Balezentis, Tomas/0000-0002-3906-1711",,,,,34,17,17,0,29,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The effect of the inflow of TFWs in interprovincial mobility is negative, substantial and significant. This is not the case for the inflow of permanent immigrants selected through the Canadian point system. The robustness of these empirical results to issues of endogeneity is assessed through a classical instrumentation approach as well as through a diff-in-diff analysis taking advantage of a pilot project facilitating the admission of TFWs in two Western provinces over the 2007-2010 period.

Becoming effective for annual periods on or after 1 January 2018, the International Financial Reporting Standard 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers has replaced the previous International Reporting Standard 18. The most important change is that the new standard creates a single five-step model for revenue recognition from contracts with customers, which is, according to the goals of standard setters, aimed at promoting greater consistency and comparability across industries and capital markets. The core principle of the model is to recognize revenue when control of the goods or services transfers to the customer, as opposed to recognizing revenue when the risks and rewards transfer to the customer. Since these changes will not affect all revenue recognition transactions, but will primarily be limited to contracts with customers, all industries will not be affected to the same extent. Given the characteristics of different activities and the nature of dealing with customers, it is expected that the industries that will be the most influenced are: telecommunication, media and entertainment, retail and consumer products, automotive, software, real estate and construction, power and utilities, travel, hospitality and leisure sector, as well as aerospace and defense sector. The complexity of revenue allocation, transaction price calculation and various industry specific factors (such as considering the effect of warranties, loyalty programs, contract modifications, rebates, discounts, etc.) have resulted in delaying the effective date of the new revenue standard to allow the most effected industries a reasonable time to comply to the new requirements. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the differences between the revenue and profit recognition under both IAS 18 and IFRS 15 by constructing a simplified model of a company providing professional services to customers. The aim is to analyze the short-term and long-term effects on the company's financial position and performance by calculating selected liquidity, indebtedness, activity, economy and profitability ratios. The scientific methods used in this paper include the induction method, method of analysis, comparative methods and case study method. Given that the new methodology primarily results in a change in revenue recognition time, the effects in the long-term are less pronounced, as opposed to the short-term effects, which may further influence company's dividend policy, creditworthiness and tax obligations in the current period.","[Brozovic, Mateja; Pavic, Ivana] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Brozovic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia.",mbrozovic@efzg.hr; ipavic@efzg.hr,"Pavić, Ivana/H-7941-2018; Brozović, Mateja/H-7897-2018",,University of Zagreb,University of Zagreb,"This paper is the result of a project entitled Influence of changes in accounting principles for revenue measurement on company's business performance, which was financed by the University of Zagreb as the short-term research support for the year 2018.",,18,1,2,2,17,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,1008,1021,,,,,,14,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553202006,0

Therefore, a successful retailer has to meet the demands of its consumers in order to create a positive image in the consumer's mind, which can be often reflected on the sales level of its stores. Previously emphasizes the importance of visual merchandising, which should leave a pleasant impression on consumers and enable better results for retailers. Although visual merchandising includes many elements, this paper focuses on in-store space elements and their influence on impulse buying tendency of consumers in grocery stores. Store layout, way of exposing the goods on the shelf and store displays are researched as a main store space determinants. The importance of researching in-store space elements as part of visual merchandising and their effects on impulse buying arises from the high costs of store space, both for retailers and manufacturers. Empirical research focuses on consumers of retail grocery stores in the Osijek-Baranja County, Croatia. It was conducted on a sample of 226 respondents, who are involved in shopping in a grocery stores. The main finding of this research suggests a positive influence of store displays on the impulse buying tendency. Store displays as marketing tools directly influence consumers' impulse buying tendency and therefore, they are one of the most powerful tools for sales increase.","[Dujak, Davor; Botkuljak, Marta; Franjkovic, Jelena] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Dujak, D (通讯作者)，Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.",davor.dujak@efos.hr; botkuljak.marta@gmail.com; jelenaf@efos.hr,"Franjković, Jelena/AAF-5588-2019","Franjković, Jelena/0000-0001-7725-3098; Dujak, Davor/0000-0003-2663-8849",,,,,40,2,2,1,5,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,4796,4806,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553205084,0

Yet, expanding an intervention to a global scale, we suggest, is a significant and difficult accomplishment. In this paper we propose to explore the kind of evidential exigencies that this accomplishment involves. To do so, we focus on the field of global health and examine how child immunization against the pneumococcus bacterium has been scaled up in low-income countries. The paper first attends to initial epidemiological scrutiny that revealed the existence of a large-scale public health problem and the possibility of an expandable solution (vaccination). It then describes the set-up of a funding arrangement using overseas aid to purchase vaccine doses manufactured by pharmaceutical companies, before paying attention to various frictions that affect the widespread use of pneumococcal vaccines. In these different moments through which scalability is accomplished, always partially and temporarily, we show that a dual activity can be witnessed, a pivoting between referential work and forward projection. To conclude, we suggest that scalability is more usefully approached as a form of expansion that is always attentive to the possibilities of change.","[Ehrenstein, Vera; Neyland, Daniel] Univ London, Goldsmiths Coll, Dept Sociol, London SE14 6NW, England",University of London; Goldsmiths University London,"Ehrenstein, V (通讯作者)，Univ London, Goldsmiths Coll, Dept Sociol, London SE14 6NW, England.",v.ehrenstein@gold.ac.uk; d.neyland@gold.ac.uk,,,European Research Council (ERC) [313173]; European Research Council (ERC) [313173] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),The research was supported by the European Research Council (ERC) [grant no. 313173].,,59,6,7,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

The Russian Federation has a lot of negative experience in the implementation of such threats. Throughout the time Russia has existed as a sovereign country, it has been walking a complicated path of fighting terrorism. At the end of the first decade of the 21 century, Russia was able to obtain positive results in standing against terroristic threat. But the burst of terrorist activity in the middle of the second decade has made it important to research the causes of terrorism. The dynamics of documented terrorist crimes in the federal subjects of North Caucasian Federal District has been analyzed. It has been revealed that the total number of documented terrorist crimes has grown. However, the growth rate of such crimes in the regions is different. The presentation of the documented terrorist crimes in equivalent of 100 k population allows us to find out about the activity of the population in the formation and implementation of terroristic threat in a region. There are considerable differences in the level of socioeconomic development of North Caucasian Federal District regions. The differences in trends and change rates of the socioeconomic status have been established. The regions are ranged by indicators, characterizing the socioeconomic status, and the documented terrorist crime indicator. As a result it has been revealed that the condition of the neighboring regions does not make an impact on the number of documented terrorist crimes. In addition, prerequisites of regional typologies have been identified depending on the ranking ratio of the indicators, characterizing the socioeconomic status, and the documented terrorist crime indicator. The provided correlation analysis has not made it possible to find out that the socioeconomic condition of a region is the main cause of terrorism.","[Feorilova, T.

The objective of this study is to investigate the relationships among IJR networks, knowledge diffusion, and science convergence. For this purpose, we used network analysis and regression analysis, based on scientometric analysis in the fields of lithium ion batteries and fuel cells. The results are as follows. First, institutes with high centrality in IJR networks are more likely to be early adopters, and IJR networks in which knowledge is diffused are scale-free. Second, knowledge diffusion is an important factor in promoting science convergence. This study is significant as it determines that knowledge diffusion may significantly help increase science convergence and IJR networks, one of the major sources of innovative technologies.","[Jeong, Daehyun] Res Inst Gangwon, Div Growth, Chunchon, South Korea; [Lee, Kyuhong] Korea Inst Sci & Technol Informat, Div Creat & Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Cho, Keuntae] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Div Management Technol, Suwon, South Korea",Korea Institute of Science & Technology Information (KISTI); Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Cho, K (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Div Management Technol, Suwon, South Korea.",ktcho@skku.edu,,,,,,,64,4,4,2,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

The special attention is paid to the last mentioned component of the human capital. Using the game theory, it is demonstrated that the loss of the human capital efficiency happens rather because of the system setting than the individual failure or unwillingness.

This paper describes the game Titanic and demonstrates that, following the development of the human capital (and searching the social well - off at the same time) it is necessary to push forward the cooperative strategy within this game. They are also identified the subjects that are not interested in playing this strategy and pose a threat to a better using of the human resources.","[Jurasek, Miroslav] Vysoka Skola Financni & Spravni, Prague, Czech Republic",University of Finance & Administration - Czech Republic,"Jurásek, M (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Financni & Spravni, Prague, Czech Republic.",19614@mail.vsfs.cz,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE,PRAGUE 3,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2238-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,185,198,,,,,,14,Demography; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BO2QE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000507522000017,0

In this regard, we compute a dynamic factor model with time-varying coefficients and stochastic volatility. The main results indicate that world factors have a dominant role in explaining sovereign risk, particularly during the period between December 2008 and December 2012, having a U-shaped distribution that reveals the phases of the European sovereign debt crisis. Moreover, we use two different proxies for sovereign risk - sovereign bonds and credit default swaps and we find that sovereign bonds give a more realistic and robust picture for the analyzed countries.","[Kubinschi, Matei; Zaharia, Alina] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Kubinschi, M (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",matei.kubinschi@bnro.ro; alina.zaharia@bnro.ro,"Kubinschi, Matei/IAO-1252-2023","Kubinschi, Matei/0000-0002-3938-1168",,,,,6,0,0,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,6412,6422,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553207038,0

At the same time, the number of old people reliant on health and social assistance. Significant changes in seniors' lives occur when they are, for various reasons, voluntarily or even involuntarily placed in hospital or social facilities. This moment is a turning point in the life of an old man and at the same time comes with it a certain risk. The paper focuses on a brief description of health and scientific care for seniors in the Slovak Republic, concluding that while the number of beds in medical facilities is decreasing, social service facilities are on the contrary growing. The prolongation of human life also increases the share of years spent in poor health, requiring care either in healthcare facilities or in social care facilities. Therefore, it is important to focus more attention on the quality of life of seniors. The quality of life does not only include the health aspect of the human being that is understood through the physical side, but also the complex of mental feelings. It is therefore right to find a new space in this field for the application of selected aspects of neuroscience that would use the potential of sensual marketing. A particularly promising area for the implementation of basic principles in the practice of health and social facilities is aromachology. This is a young scientific discipline that examines the effects of fragrances within the whole palette of human feelings. Applying the natural, holistic way of everyday life brings the unity of body and soul, joy and serenity, thereby enhancing the quality of life of seniors. The paper looks for a certain parallel between the proven areas of implementing sensual marketing and service marketing principles in terms of health and social care facilities. The quality of seniors' life quality could gradually improve.","[Lieskovska, Vanda] Ekon Univ Bratislava, Podnikovohospodarska Fak Kosiciach, Tajovskeho 13, Kosice 04000, Slovakia; [Pavlov, Peter] Vysokospecializovany Odborny Ustav Geriatricky, Strojarenska 13, Kosice 04001, Slovakia",,"Lieskovská, V (通讯作者)，Ekon Univ Bratislava, Podnikovohospodarska Fak Kosiciach, Tajovskeho 13, Kosice 04000, Slovakia.",Vanda.lieskovska@euke.sk; pavlov@gckosice.sk,"Lieskovska, Vanda/AAI-4530-2021","Lieskovska, Vanda/0000-0003-0392-4877",,,,,16,0,0,0,1,OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE,PRAGUE 3,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2281-4,,,,2018,,,,,,,226,236,,,,,,11,Demography; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BO2HN,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000505804100021,0

Although occupational safety and health (OHS) are essential elements of corporate social responsibility (CSR), support for employees returning to work or vocational rehabilitation are rarely part of the CSR strategy. The aim of this paper is to assess and synthesize the current state of research of vocational rehabilitation in the context of CSR. A literature analysis was conducted to examine the need to address vocational rehabilitation as part of the CSR strategy as well as the existing approaches for implementation. Vocational rehabilitation is an important part of a company's social responsibility towards its employees as well as towards society. The promotion of vocational rehabilitation should be an essential element of the CSR strategy and can create shared value. However, a commitment to vocational rehabilitation alone is not enough; the commitment must be explicitly described and go beyond the legal minimum. That can be done, for example, through return-to-work (RTW) policies, proactive initiation and coordination of the rehabilitation process, the adaptation of the workplace and work activities, the institutionalization of sheltered workplaces, and a specialist unit for vocational rehabilitation within the company. Particularly access for external persons to the company's sheltered workplaces, internships or entry-level positions is a critical aspect for substantially promoting vocational rehabilitation and achieving additional shared value. Vocational rehabilitation as part of the CSR strategy must continue to be examined empirically, in particular best practice approaches from business practice.","[Miethlich, Boris; Slahor, L'udomir] Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Bratislava, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Miethlich, B (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Bratislava, Slovakia.",boris.miethlich@fm.uniba.sk; ludomir.slahor@fm.uniba.sk,"Miethlich, Boris/AAK-1184-2020","Miethlich, Boris/0000-0003-4064-6722",,,,,91,2,2,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,1444,1460,,,,,,17,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553202048,0

An infrastructural perspective reframes the politics of financial markets by considering them as vital systems that are deeply integrated with the real economy. This helps explain the successful reframing of regulatory debates away from action that might shrink financial markets, and instead toward incremental change and technical fixes that end up supporting the growth of the system. The infrastructural perspective also allows us to consider financial markets as technical systems that are inherently limited in their capacity to process financial transactions, which in turn helps explain their tendency to fail. Comparing the flow of speculative trades through financial markets to the flow of traffic through congested roads, the article employs a case study of the 1987 US stock market crash and its regulatory aftermath. It suggests that in the wake of the 1987 crash, which was caused by an inability to process trades fast enough, US regulators found it politically impossible to impose any significant limits on speculative trading. Wary of market congestion contributing to another financial accident, regulators instead expanded the speculative capacity of the markets. But just as expanded road systems attract more autos and produce an array of externalities, enhanced market capacity only attracts more speculation and related externalities, not least a deepening of speculative financialization.","[Muellerleile, Chris] Swansea Univ, Dept Geog, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales",Swansea University,"Muellerleile, C (通讯作者)，Swansea Univ, Dept Geog, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales.",c.m.muellerleile@swansea.ac.uk,,,"US National Science Foundation via Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant [1203541]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci [1203541] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","US National Science Foundation via Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","The arguments herein were previously presented at seminars at the School of Geography at the University of Nottingham, the Centre for Business in Society at Coventry University, and the Centre for Urban and Regional Development Studies at Newcastle University.

In addition, the hypothesis was verified that the financial constraints of enterprises affect decisions making by prospective exporters and sales in foreign markets. The empirical analysis was based on the individual data from different sources (from the years 2005 to 2016), which are: balance sheet and profit and loss account (Statistical Office), financial and behavioural data. The evaluation consists of two parts. The first part presents the financial strength depending on the net value of enterprises. The financial strength defines the financial capacity of enterprise. The second part presents Probability of Default (PD) model. The statistical model is built on logistic regression model, and produces an estimate of the annual PD of the assessed company. Based on the results of the evaluation of the risk associated with the financial condition of enterprises, it was found that SMEs faced a higher risk. The lowest risk of bankruptcy was observed in the pharmaceutical industry and the highest risk of bankruptcy - in the mining sector.

The structural equation modeling was used to evaluate the causal simulation and to examine the reliability and validity of the measuring model. The research results showed that customer expectation has the most impact on customer satisfaction with path coefficient of 0.74. On the other hand, customer loyalty, with path coefficient of 0.65, is known as an influential factor. This study helps to understand that customer satisfaction and customer expectations are positive drivers of customer loyalty. Customer loyalty also is a strong predictor of brand power in hoteling and tourism industry. By strengthening that part, which you have better resources, you can have a better supply and thus, there would be more opportunities in establishing reputation and increasing visibility.","[Nobar, Hossein Bodaghi Khajeh] Islamic Azad Univ, Tabriz Branch, Dept Management, Tabriz, Iran; [Rostamzadeh, Reza] Islamic Azad Univ, Urmia Branch, Dept Management, Orumiyeh, Iran",Islamic Azad University; Islamic Azad University,"Rostamzadeh, R (通讯作者)，Islamic Azad Univ, Urmia Branch, Dept Management, Orumiyeh, Iran.",r.rostamzadeh@iaurmia.ac.ir,"Noubar, Hossein Bodaghi Khajeh/AFV-9851-2022; Rostamzadeh, Reza/AAO-2189-2021","Noubar, Hossein Bodaghi Khajeh/0000-0002-8648-627X; Rostamzadeh, Reza/0000-0002-6161-7173",,,,,31,29,39,15,74,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

All equipment, materials and educational actors are designed to carry out the production process to produce products (goods or services). Teaching factory (TEFA) is a combination of production-based learning and competency learning. In production-based learning, students are directly involved in the production process, so that the needs of production build their competence. Production capacity and product type become the main key of successful implementation of learning. In a teaching factory, the school carries out production activities or services that are part of the Teaching and Learning Process. Thus, the school is required to have a factory, workshop or other business unit for TEFA learning activities. The legal bases for the implementation of Teaching Factory are: Law Number 20 Year 2003 (Sisdiknas), Elucidation of Article 15 (Vocational Education prepares learners primarily to work in certain fields); Government Regulation Number 19 Year 2005 (SPN), Article 26 (Vocational Secondary Education Unit aims to improve intelligence, knowledge, personality, noble religius, and skills to live independently and follow further education in accordance with the vocational); and Education Priorities 2010-2014 (INPRES No. 1 of 2010: Improved access to quality education, affordable, relevant, and efficient toward uplifting people's welfare, independence, noble character, and strong character of the nation). The education sector is developed to achieve economic growth that is supported through the harmonisation of the availability of educated personnel and the ability to create employment or entrepreneurship, to answer the challenges of labour needs. From the Presidential Decree 2014 on function and organization, Kemdikbud SMK built a Teaching Factory and technopark SMK environment with the latest technology. The purpose of preparing graduates of vocational schools to become workers and entrepreneurs is to: help students choose the work field in accordance with their competence; grow the creativity of students through learning by doing; provide skills needed in the work world; and extend the scope of recruitment opportunities for SMK graduates. We must determine the right way to achieve these goals. The right way to do this is to improve the quality of education. The quality or quality of education cannot be separated from the teaching and learning process conducted in the classroom by the teachers. A gooid learning process will be reflected through a good and appropriate learning model. How can a teacher choose a good and appropriate learning model that is in line with the goals of TEFA? The current curriculum used by schools is the 2013 curriculum that employs either an inquiry based-learning model, discovery learning model, project-based learning, or problem-based learning. The four models of learning above are not done completely by the teachers in the classroom. It is necessary to determine the appropriate learning model for teachers to be able to implement it well in the field, because it is the teachers who will be spearheading TEFA program implementation. One of the major teaching obstacles to implementing TEFA in education is the lack of teachers who can apply appropriate learning models. According to Aggarwal (1998), universally issued ICT e can facilitate the teaching learning process but it cannot replace the traditional system of teaching-learning. The teaching-learning activities, which are varied and complex, must be harmonized. So, it is very important that an up to date professional teacher integrates the various elements of the teaching-learning situation, and more importantly should be brought into an intelligible whole.","[Nurmalasari, Dewi; Swaramarinda, Darma Rika] Univ Negeri Jakarta, Jl Rawamangun Muka, Jakarta, Indonesia",Universitas Negeri Jakarta,"Nurmalasari, D (通讯作者)，Univ Negeri Jakarta, Jl Rawamangun Muka, Jakarta, Indonesia.",special.dewi@gmail.com; darmarika_s@unj.ac.id,"Swaramarinda, Darma Rika/ABD-1821-2021","Swaramarinda, Darma Rika/0000-0003-1588-4569; nurmalasari, Dewi/0000-0003-4565-5134",,,,,16,1,1,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,7148,7155,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553208013,0

Further evidence from the study suggests a significant long run relationship between federal government expenditure on the agricultural sector and agricultural performance measured by agricultural sector output. The vector error correction result shows that 91.45 percentage of the total variations in agriculture sector growth was explained by the explanatory variables in the model. Government capital and recurrent expenditure on the agricultural sector indicates a weak positive and negative non-instantaneous impact on agricultural sector growth respectively. The adjustment speed from the error correction term indicates that 16 percent of the errors associated with the system as a result of external shocks are being corrected in subsequent period. The study therefore suggests that concerted effort be put in place to ensure that government provides adequate financial support for the agricultural sector.

To overcome the high unemployment is the main challenge of Georgia's macroeconomic policy as it is the main reason of poverty and causes many social-economic problems. For reducing the unemployment rate, one of the crucial factors is to identify, evaluate and analyse challenges in labour market and to develop human capital. Labour market is less developed in Georgia and it is a must to create institutes and mechanisms which finally will be reflected in qualified labour force and decrease unemployment. There are many challenges that Georgia faces nowadays in this direction, thereflore, it is one of the most frequently studied subjects by Georgian researchers. But it will always be an actual issue because of its multifaceted, complex and changeable nature. The aim of this paper is to summarize results of different studies from Georgian and foreigner researchers, evaluate data from state authorities' surveys regarding labor market challenges. The purpose is to give some clear recommendations how to decrease unemployment in Georgia and make more comprehensive picture of current situation based on the existing literature. First, the analysis of the surveys conducted by state authorities is provided. Second, the views of Georgian researches are presented and summarized.

The present research was sparked with a question whether use of technology would help and support autonomous learning and also enhance student engagement? For this end, blended learning approach was applied and a course was redesigned to include elements of blended learning. Blended learning refers to combining face-to-face learning with online learning experience. The paper reports the detailed findings of a study conducted to assess the impact of blended learning initiative on student's engagement and overall learning in a business course. In addition, it also elicits student's perspective on blended learning approach. In the study, eLearning platform, LMS (Learning Management System) was extensively used for flipped classroom and other activities which were applied in Organizational Behavior course throughout one semester (16 weeks). Data was collected mainly from three sources; focus-group interviews; student surveys and LMS records. For comparison purpose, the course learning outcome achievement data was collected from two sections of this course; first, the test group (Section A) and second the control group (Section B). The results clearly show an increase in students learning in the test group (where blended learning was applied), in terms of learning outcome achievement and overall engagement with online activities as well as in class activities. This was depicted in their on-line quiz results, time spent and quality of contribution on online forums, discussions and glossary. According to student's perspective (test group), they felt motivated as they had some control over time, place or pace for learning. This study showed how a balanced approach to blended learning can lead to higher student achievement and improve student engagement. Based on the analysis, the study contributes with its fruitful findings to the literature of Blended learning. Strong implications can be drawn for both the Instructor and the Institutions who wish to implement blended learning approach. Consequently, meaningful reforms in the higher education can be future direction for the government.","[Sahni, Jolly] Prince Sultan Univ, Coll Business Adm, Dept Management, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",Prince Sultan University,"Sahni, J (通讯作者)，Prince Sultan Univ, Coll Business Adm, Dept Management, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",,"SAHNI, JOLLY/T-6567-2018","SAHNI, JOLLY/0000-0001-6889-1303",,,,,49,0,0,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,1356,1367,,,,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553202039,0

Driverless public transport can be a game-changer for urban mobility. However, empirical evidence from the point of user experiences is lacking. A customer's sense of safety and security has a significant influence on public transport acceptance. This case study focuses on driverless shuttle bus passengers' subjective experiences of (a) traffic safety, (b) in-vehicle security, and (c) emergency management compared to the conventional bus. Data were collected through interviews from informants that travelled by driverless shuttle busses in the City of Vantaa, Finland in summer 2015. A total of 19,021 passengers travelled by 3,962 km autonomous buses on a specific route. The sample of 197 informants was analysed by quantitative methods. Informants assessed perception of traffic safety to be better in the driverless shuttle bus than in a conventional bus with a driver. However, they were lacking personal in-vehicle security. 64 per cent of passengers answered that sense of in-vehicle security in the driverless shuttle bus was worse or much worse than in the conventional bus. There was a significant difference between women and men when they evaluated their subjective sense of security on board F(1, 195) = 8.196,p < 0.001. Men assessed their experiences of traffic safety, in vehicle security and emergency management to be overall better than those of women. In order to mainstream the use of driverless shuttle buses, for example as a part of a transport chain, traffic safety is not a problem. Instead, a passenger's sense of security on board should be increased. This is the case especially with female passengers.","[Salonen, Arto O.] Metropolia Univ Appl Sci, POB 4000, FI-00079 Metropolia, Finland",,"Salonen, AO (通讯作者)，Metropolia Univ Appl Sci, POB 4000, FI-00079 Metropolia, Finland.",arto.salonen@metropolia.fi,,"Salonen, Arto O/0000-0002-2614-3734",,,,,44,97,106,5,95,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

Starting from Theory of planned behaviour and Theory of social identity several antecedents of consumers' attitudes were researched in proposed model-quality of brands, prestige, ethnocentrism and materialism. For this purpose, sample comprising of 329 respondents was collected. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test the validity of the model and structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to determine relationships between variables. Empirical research has shown that the factors of quality of local brands and ethnocentrism have a positive and statistically significant effect on the consumers' attitudes towards the local brands. On the other side, brand quality, prestige and materialism have a positive effect on the attitudes of consumers towards global brands, whereas ethnocentrism has a negative effect on attitudes towards this type of brands. In addition, research has shown that the attitudes have positive influence on consumers' behavioural intentions regarding purchase of both local and global brands and that consumers' intentions have positive effect on actual purchase of both types of brands. The main finding of the paper implies that the characteristics of consumers and brands influence consumer behaviour in terms of purchasing aforementioned types of brands.

The purpose of this paper is to provide a description of natural gas market in Croatia and analyse its trading system in order to propose a solution which could minimize or fully eliminate the problems of transmission system imbalance influenced by natural gas orders. Natural gas trading in Croatia is conducted on the trading platform and is based on the balance groups model. The manager of each balance group put the order proposed for the balance group's customers (so called nomination) to transmission system operator and thus reserving capacity of transmission system. Gas from transmission system goes to distribution systems and reach the final consumers. If the real consumption differs from the order, transmission system might become unstable and need to be balanced. The balance group manager has a limited option to trade surpluses or shortfalls and, if this is not reached, balancing of transmission system is needed. The costs of balancing (penalties) must be paid by the balance group manager. This research showed that the difference between nominations and actual consumption rises when the time period is narrowed (from year to hour). To avoid penalties, we are currently trying to develop a simulation model that will test the ability of distribution system to accumulate that amount of natural gas which represents the difference between nominated and consumed amount of gas. This paper represents only a preliminary research, conducted before testing the simulation model.","[Sebalj, Dario; Mesaric, Josip; Dujak, Davor] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Sebalj, D (通讯作者)，Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.",dsebalj@efos.hr; mesaric@efos.hr; ddujak@efos.hr,"Šebalj, Dario/AAE-5636-2019","Šebalj, Dario/0000-0002-8295-7847; Dujak, Davor/0000-0003-2663-8849",Croatian Science Foundation [IP-2016-068350],Croatian Science Foundation,This work has been fully supported by Croatian Science Foundation under Grant No. IP-2016-068350 Methodological Framework for Efficient Energy Management by Intelligent Data Analytics (MERIDA).,,10,2,2,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,1524,1535,,,,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553202056,0

Some devoted all funds under Objective 2B Generation renewal to only one operation M06, but majority supported this objective under more operations (e.g. M01, M02 M16). The amount of finances from the RDP devoted to the support of young farmers shows how important the farmers are in a region. The percentage of the farmers that are supported can indicate how much is each country concerned by the problem of young farmers. The aim of the paper is to assess how important is the support for young farmers in selected countries of the EU in terms of finances devoted to young farmers compared to the total budget of the RDP and the share of farmers with support.

According to the theory developed the health state is at level one at birth and gradually declines to zero at death. Note that the health state of an individual as a stochastic process (an unpredictable process during time) cannot be estimated quantitatively. Fortunately, the theory of the stochastic processes provided a quite effective tool to estimate the mean value of the health state of a large number of individuals, a population. The form of the health state function estimated for several countries is a declining curve with a negative slope by means of an accelerating decline until the end of life. This was the expected health state development due to aging. The development of the health state function provides quantitative tools for estimation of the health state of the human capital of a population and thus providing a supporting tool for the estimation of the average exit age from the labour force and estimating the optimal retirement age.

There are 7,087 observations about innovators, of which 58 % are new-to-the-market innovators, regardless of the type of innovation. Results suggest that there is a negative relationship between the decision to innovate and the land transport or logistics industry. Logistics innovation was a contributing factor across the industries in terms of higher sales of new-to-the-market goods and services per employee in the period 2008-2014.

This study suggests that people expect abandoned coppice forests to be protected from Japanese Oak Wilt and to become rich in biodiversity. However, public preference for biodiversity conservation services had high heterogeneity among people. On the other hand, water and soil regulation services were widely ranked as important among people.

This coevolved with an increase in inter-urban and inter-regional competition for resources, also called policy competition'. The issue for regional governments is how they balance their wish to strengthen their economic structure, without creating conflicts of unfair competition in the designation of winners' and losers'. This paper addresses this balancing act in the Dutch Province of Limburg, where a multinational threatened to leave the region. The case is analysed with the help of actor-network-theory and follows the translations through which an innovative policy tool was constructed that allowed the Province to invest in real estate. Through the innovative campus' concept, the Province could comfort the vested interests of the multinational, while balancing out the interests of other economic cores in the region.","[Kooij, Henk-Jan] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, Dept Human Geog, POB 9108, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen,"Kooij, HJ (通讯作者)，Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, Dept Human Geog, POB 9108, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands.",h.kooij@fm.ru.nl,,,,,,,40,1,1,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Aggregate data were collected from the Terminal Operation Systems (TOS) of three container terminals; two in the Middle East and one in Asia. The Poisson regression models that were developed for each terminal revealed the factors affecting the Dwell Time (DT). Terminal charging policies and customs inspection affect DT especially in ports that impose storage fees from the first day and adopt more efficient customs inspection methods. In addition, DT was found to depend on : 1) container's weight; 2) container status (full or empty); 3) billable line; 4) seasonality, and; 5) pick-up day of the week. Information on the receiver of goods and the commodity was available and incorporated in the Poisson regression models resulting in higher R-2 and better model applicability. The combined model of the three terminals explains the influence of the different monetary policies and the terminal type on the DT. The developed models can be used to predict the DT and consequently the day an import container is to be picked-up from the terminal. Model results highlight the importance of collecting information on the commodity and the receiver of the goods for the development of predicting models that enhance decision making in port container terminals both in an operational and in strategic level.","[Kourounioti, Ioanna] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands; [Polydoropoulou, Amalia] Univ Aegean, Dept Shipping Trade & Transport, Chios 82100, Greece",Delft University of Technology; University of Aegean,"Kourounioti, I (通讯作者)，Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands.",I.Kourounioti-1@tudelft.nl,,"Polydoropoulou, Amalia/0000-0003-1362-5686",,,,,42,3,3,0,4,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

At the same time, the Westphalian framework of political publicity is said to be diminishing in scale due to globalisation. However, both affirmations are not necessarily true in cross-border metropolitan regions. As suggested in this paper, based on a quantitative and a qualitative analysis of a free daily publication located in the cross-border urban region of Luxembourg, commercial media can help to reconfigure a neo-Westphalian and territorial public sphere made of linear and network-like borders. It is not so much the source of income of the media and the functional dynamics of international urban areas which determine the future of the mediatised public sphere and its territorial background in borderlands Europe but the values of plural reporters in a changing economic and cultural context.","[Lamour, Christian] Luxembourg Inst Socioecon Res LISER, 11 Porte Sci, L-4366 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg",,"Lamour, C (通讯作者)，Luxembourg Inst Socioecon Res LISER, 11 Porte Sci, L-4366 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg.",christian.lamour@liser.lu,,"Lamour, Christian/0000-0001-9571-6228",,,,,50,8,8,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

When regional ecological security is threatened, governments attempt to regulate unreasonable behavior via policies and laws. China has a dominant forestry industry, and the country is attempting to implement the dual goals of economic development and ecological security; therefore, the Chinese government has formulated a series of policies and regulations to balance these goals. This study presents the main forest policies in China and implements a logistic regression model to analyze the changes in forest land in the study area (Jiangxi Province) and the primary influencing factors for these changes under the forest policies from 1990 to 2010. Subsequently, a forest fragmentation model (non-traditional forest landscape pattern index) was built to analyze the forest fragmentation patterns and interference modes. The results indicated that the total forest land area increased by more than 40,000 ha during the study period; however, the logistic model showed that a large amount of high-quality forest land was replaced by poor-quality forest land because forest land areas that present rich soil organic matter (SOM) content are more easily converted to other land types, whereas areas with poor SOM are more easily converted to forest land. Between 1990 and 2010, forest fragmentation improved because the proportion of interior forests increased and the proportions of patch and perforated forests decreased. The paper concludes by proposing some policy recommendations for the conservation of biodiversity. (C) 2017 Department of Forest Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Umea.

Subjective probabilistic expectations show great promise to improve the estimation of structural models of decision making under uncertainty. However, a robust finding in these surveys is an inappropriate heap of responses at 50%, suggesting that some of these responses are uninformative. The way these 50s are treated in the subsequent analysis is of major importance. Taking the 50s at face value will bias any aggregate statistics. Conversely, deleting them is not appropriate if some of these answers do convey some information. Furthermore, the attention of researchers is so focused on this heap of 50s that they do not consider the possibility that other answers may be uninformative as well. This paper proposes to take a fresh look at these questions using a new method based on weak assumptions to identify the informativeness of an answer. Applying the method to probabilistic expectations of equity returns in three waves of the Survey of Economic Expectations in 1999-2001, I find that: (i) at least 65% of the 50s convey no information at all; (ii) it is the answer most often provided among the answers identified as uninformative; (iii) but even if the 50s are a major contributor to noise, they represent at best 70% of the identified uninformative answers. These findings have various implications for survey design.","[Gouret, Fabian] Univ Cergy Pontoise, THEMA, 33 Bvd Port, F-95011 Cergy Pontoise, France",CY Cergy Paris Universite,"Gouret, F (通讯作者)，Univ Cergy Pontoise, THEMA, 33 Bvd Port, F-95011 Cergy Pontoise, France.",fabiangouret@gmail.com,"Gouret, Fabian/AAF-9009-2020","Gouret, Fabian/0000-0002-5891-5452",Labex MME-DII; Chaire d'Excellence CNRS,Labex MME-DII; Chaire d'Excellence CNRS,Labex MME-DII; Chaire d'Excellence CNRS,,23,1,1,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0277-6693,1099-131X,,J FORECASTING,J.

However, the literature has given little attention to the latter; namely the evolution and impacts of regulatory reforms amongst Europe's railways. This paper fills this gap by providing an up-to-date, bottom-up assessment of current rail regulatory practice in Europe. We develop a survey of economic regulators across Europe, thus complementing top-down studies of the impact of economic regulation by enabling a richer insight into regulatory activity and its impacts. The questionnaire is based on a review of the literature on ideal regulatory characteristics across multiple industries. Our results show that European rail regulators, in general, exhibit many of the features of ideal regulation; in particular around key features such as independence, resourcing, longevity and expertise, transparency and in turn stability and predictability. However, we find that rail regulatory bodies could take a more proactive role in shaping track access charges, given their importance in respect of efficient use of the network and maintaining non-discriminatory access. Importantly, there is also scope for regulators to play a greater role in regulating the efficiency and quality of infrastructure managers, and potentially becoming more involved in the designing stages of passenger market opening as it emerges; and these changes could deliver substantial beneficial impacts for rail users and funders across Europe.","[Benedetto, Valerio; Smith, Andrew S.

Local authorities are primarily responsible for governing urban areas and implement different measures to regulate UFT. Measures often fail as they do not reach their intended goal and sometimes even produce adverse effects. One of the primary causes is that prior to implementation, the different stakeholders affecting and being affected by the UFT are not sufficiently involved. In this study, the multi-actor multi-criteria analysis (MAMCA) is applied ex-ante to evaluate to what extent different measures contribute to the objectives of different stakeholders. A municipality in Belgium, experiencing a lot of traffic, is used as a case study. Regulating UFT is in this case further complicated due to multi-level governance with different jurisdictions over infrastructure. To our knowledge, there are no similar UFT studies in a multi-level governance context. Results show that all proposed measures are an improvement for all stakeholders compared to the current situation. Future implementation of measures in this context is discussed.

Its optimization is a main aim of the Sustainable Urban Logistic Plans. Currently, the CO2 analysis of such plans is mostly based on a Tank-To-Wheel approach, which does not consider fuel production and distribution, thus not providing a comprehensive evaluation of its carbon effects. In this paper, we propose an alternative two-step approach: after quantifying CO2 emissions through a Well-To-Wheel methodology, which assesses the entire energy pathway of the fuel, we valuate them economically, using a meta-analysis of 700 studies. We test this model to assess the carbon potentialities of a new Urban Consolidation Centre (UCC) in the city of Lucca, Italy. Our results indicate a potential yearly saving of up to 190 tCO(2) (which corresponds to about 10,000 of social cost savings). These benefits are mostly obtained through third funds, which make the investment financially sustainable for the municipality. With adequate adaptations, the model can be used in other urban areas to assess the carbon potentiality of different transport measures. Furthermore, an integration of the long-distance freight movement can provide the total CO2 contribution of freight transport. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper assumes that the core inflation components evolve as a multivariate local level process. While this model is theoretically attractive for modelling inflation dynamics, its usage thus far has been limited, owing to computational complications with the conventional multivariate maximum likelihood estimator, especially when the system is large. We propose the use of a method called moments estimation through aggregation (M.E.T.A.), which reduces the computational costs significantly and delivers fast and accurate parameter estimates, as we show in a Monte Carlo exercise. In an application to euro-area inflation, we find that our forecasts compare well with those generated by alternative univariate and multivariate models, as well as with those elicited from professional forecasters.

In the case of unequal precision, bidders must use the same bidding functions regardless of their own information quality, and thus, the equilibrium strategy should be the same for both bidders.

Sweden switched from left-hand to right-hand traffic in 1967. Before 1967, however, almost all Swedish vehicles were LHD for reasons of international trade and Swedish customer demand. I match on accident figures in the period after 1967, when both Sweden and other European countries drove on the right and used LHD vehicles. Results show that right-hand traffic decreased road fatality, injury and accident risk in Sweden by approximately 30%.

We empirically test whether processing times differ for law firms that integrate the mortgage foreclosure auction process compared with law firms that contract with independent auction companies. We find that independent firms are able initially to schedule auctions more quickly; however, when postponements occur, they are no faster to adapt. Since firms schedule the initial auction before contracting, independent auction companies have an incentive to conform to the law firms' schedules in order to secure the contracts. We argue that this is evidence of a cost of integration that stems from poorly aligned incentives within the firm.","[Lambie-Hanson, Lauren] Fed Reserve Bank Philadelphia, Ten Independence Mall, Philadelphia, PA 19106 USA; [Lambie-Hanson, Timothy] Haverford Coll, Dept Econ, 370 Lancaster Ave, Haverford, PA 19041 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Philadelphia; Haverford College,"Lambie-Hanson, L (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Philadelphia, Ten Independence Mall, Philadelphia, PA 19106 USA.",Lauren.Lambie-Hanson@phil.frb.org; tlambiehan@haverford.edu,,,,,,,19,1,1,0,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

This is often done by applying independence and coverage tests developed by Christoffersen (International Economic Review, 1998; 39(4), 841-862) to so-called hit-sequences derived from VaR forecasts and realized losses. However, as pointed out in the literature, these aforementioned tests suffer from low rejection frequencies, or (empirical) power when applied to hit-sequences derived from simulations matching empirical stylized characteristics of return data. One key observation of the studies is that higher-order dependence in the hit-sequences may cause the observed lower power performance. We propose to generalize the backtest framework for VaR forecasts, by extending the original first-order dependence of Christoffersen to allow for a higher-or kth-order dependence. We provide closed-form expressions for the tests as well as asymptotic theory. Not only do the generalized tests have power against kth-order dependence by definition, but also included simulations indicate improved power performance when replicating the aforementioned studies. Further, included simulations show much improved size properties of one of the suggested tests.

Drawing on a case study of London TravelWatch and Transport Focus in Great Britain, our findings show that statutory passenger watchdogs are effective in representing passenger interests due to four factors in particular: the organizational setting, research-based evidence, accommodating relationships, and public outreach.

This article challenges this conventional view by developing an alternative framework that utilises some of the basic concepts and approaches of evolutionary thinking and dialectic understanding of agglomeration. With the evidence from Istanbul's old city jewellery cluster, we argue that stickiness and slipperiness are inextricably tied together and the spatial configuration of clusters is the result of a complicated balance between these two. In Istanbul, these twin conditions are complementary and interact allowing the possibility to transform each other.

In sports cases, the courts appear to accept claims that fans prefer more competitive balance to less, so that a potential welfare offset is any added enhanced competitive balance attributable to the anticompetitive activity. In addition, courts often decide that less intrusive alternatives may be available to accomplish the same competitive balance gain. From the applied theory perspective, this is troublesome. Theoretically, whether fans prefer more balance is a hypothesis about preferences that needs to be examined in detail for any particular case. Applied theory also is of aid in assessing whether a particular device under scrutiny, including so-called less intrusive alternatives, should even be predicted to enhance balance.

It is proved that the Land Value Capture (LVC) theory can provide theoretical support for exploring new financing mode of urban rail transit to solve these problems. This paper reviews the concept of LVC and the existing LVC finance mechanisms, in particular, Joint Development (JD). It is revealed that JD can't be directly copied and reproduced in mainland China. The characteristics of land acquisition policy as well as the practice of rail transit construction in mainland China are summarized, and based on the findings, the Predetermined Land Reserve Mode (PLR) is proposed. The essence of this proposed mode is to link the reserve of specific land parcels with the relevant rail transit project and ensure it benefits from the predetermined land reserve. Rail transit companies, with the authorizations from the government, can reserve suitable land parcels prior to the planning and construction of the rail transit system so that they can capture the increased land value after the land transfer. PLR is a new finance mechanism based on LVC and it is different from JD under comparative analysis. Analytical results show that PLR has unique advantages. To demonstrate the performance of PLR, a case study of constructing the urban rail transit system in Wuhan City, China, is presented in this paper, and it shows that the PLR is well suited for financing the urban railway systems in cities of mainland China.","[Sun, Jun; Chen, Tian; Cheng, Zuchen] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Mech, Luo Yu Rd, Wuhan 1037, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Wang, Cynthia C.] Univ New South Wales, Fac Built Environm, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Ning, Xin] Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Investment & Construct Management, Dalian, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology; University of New South Wales Sydney; Dongbei University of Finance & Economics,"Cheng, ZC (通讯作者)，Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Mech, Luo Yu Rd, Wuhan 1037, Hubei, Peoples R China.",czc891113@163.com,"Wang, Changxin C/F-7372-2019","Wang, Changxin C/0000-0001-6414-3228",National Social Science Foundation of China [12CJY066],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),The study is supported by National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 12CJY066).,,46,27,29,4,67,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

The key mechanism consists of two complementary channels through which firms handle uninsurable business losses. One channel is based on cost-compensating motive, by which firms raise prices to reflect higher losses stochastically associated with higher output levels. The other channel is based on loss-balancing motive, by which firms lower prices to countervail higher losses stochastically associated with higher output levels. The relative responsiveness of the two channels to a shock depends on each firm's fundamental characteristics and leads to a sharp division of markup cyclicality across sectors.","[Kim, Seong-Hoon] Yonsei Univ Wonju, Dept Econ, 1 Yonseidae Gil, Wonju 26493, Kangwon Do, South Korea; [Moon, Seongman] Chonbuk Natl Univ, Dept Econ, 567 Baekje Daero, Jeonju Si 54896, Jeollabuk Do, South Korea; [Moon, Seongman] Chonbuk Natl Univ, Res Inst Big Data Business, 567 Baekje Daero, Jeonju Si 54896, Jeollabuk Do, South Korea",Jeonbuk National University; Jeonbuk National University,"Kim, SH (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ Wonju, Dept Econ, 1 Yonseidae Gil, Wonju 26493, Kangwon Do, South Korea.",s.kim.econ@gmail.com; nopasanada0501@gmail.com,"Kim, Seong-Hoon/AAA-1314-2020","Kim, Seong-Hoon/0000-0002-7322-7471",,,,,29,1,1,1,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

Using a panel dataset comprising 16 years, we test whether more data makes a difference to conclusions. In contrast to previous estimates using a shorter panel, maintenance costs are now demonstrated to exhibit a positive dynamic effect; an increase in maintenance cost during one year indicates the need for more maintenance also the next year. Moreover, the marginal cost from the dynamic model is larger than its static counterpart. We conclude that the use of dynamic models on longer time series may have charging implications in several EU member states, considering that their track access charges are based on econometric studies that use static models and short panel datasets.","[Odolinski, Kristofer; Nilsson, Jan-Eric] Swedish Natl Rd & Transport Res Inst, Dept Transport Econ, Box 55685, S-10215 Stockholm, Sweden",VTI,"Odolinski, K (通讯作者)，Swedish Natl Rd & Transport Res Inst, Dept Transport Econ, Box 55685, S-10215 Stockholm, Sweden.",kristofer.odolinski@vti.se,"Nilsson, Jan-Eric/HGC-7839-2022",,,,,,36,11,11,1,11,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0122,2212-0130,,ECON TRANSP,Econ.

I find that, in nonstop markets, the price for routes formerly competitive between United and Continental Airlines increases significantly following the merger. This result is robust after controlling for route-specific factors and using different samples and specifications. The market power effect dominates efficiency gains consistently throughout the whole merger process and after the merger was finalized. I also find that the increase in price is only on directly affected routes, not those out of adjacent airports.

Many communities are divided over the trade-offs between a property owner's rights and nuisance problems created by transient populations in residential neighborhoods. This paper empirically examines the effects of regulation restricting short-term rentals on property sales prices, using a unique data set and policy experiment from Anna Maria Island, Florida. We show that nonresident ownership of properties on the island decreased following the rental regulation and that the regulation decreased property values except in areas where the density of non-resident-owned properties in a neighborhood was quite high.","[Kim, Jin-Hyuk] Univ Colorado Boulder, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Leung, Tin Cheuk] Wake Forest Univ, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA; [Wagman, Liad] IIT, Chicago, IL 60616 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Wake Forest University; Illinois Institute of Technology,"Kim, JH (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado Boulder, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",,,,,,,,23,11,11,0,17,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

From this standpoint, most of Network Design Problem (NDP) models aim at identifying the optimal layout of transportation networks by deterministic bi-level problems formulation to reflect the different goals of at least two decision makers (the network users and the planner). Considering the societal function of transport systems, the NDP, even at operational level, should be addressed also to the research of solutions in which the outcomes of the design (costs and/or benefits) are distributed as much as possible among the potential users or classes of users. Traditional approaches often neglect equity goals that, conversely, should play an important role or define some flows rebalancing problem. In this paper an Equity Based NDP is proposed, where the optimal layout of a road network is determined by minimizing the total system cost under flexible constraints, (jointly with rigid thresholds) by solving a single programming problem. It considers both horizontal and vertical equity criteria in the form of an equity constraint specified for uncertain variables or approximate reasoning environment: this results in a multi-objective fuzzy programming model that aims at maximizing user satisfaction according to all constraints, while taking into account the route choice behaviour of network users. A sensitivity analysis has been performed on a test network, and a comparison with a literature equity based model has been carried out; then, the proposed method has been applied to a real sized network, where an application of equity network design optimization is presented and the results discussed.","[Caggiani, Leonardo; Camporeale, Rosalia; Ottomanelli, Michele] DICATECh, Dept Civil Environm & Bldg Engn & Chem, Politecnico Bari,Viale Orabona,4,, I-70125 Bari, Italy",Politecnico di Bari,"Ottomanelli, M (通讯作者)，DICATECh, Dept Civil Environm & Bldg Engn & Chem, Politecnico Bari,Viale Orabona,4,, I-70125 Bari, Italy.",leonardo.caggiani@poliba.it; rosalia.camporeale@poliba.it; michele.ottomanelli@poliba.it,"Ottomanelli, Michele/D-4253-2011; Camporeale, Rosalia/I-4583-2019; Ottomanelli, Michele/JAO-0763-2023","Ottomanelli, Michele/0000-0002-4460-9980; Camporeale, Rosalia/0000-0001-7449-2085; Caggiani, Leonardo/0000-0001-7390-5191",,,,,33,31,35,2,24,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

An unstable macroeconomic context motivates the stochastic interest rate models with time-varying parameters. In this paper, the local parameter approach is introduced to adaptively estimate interest rate models. This method can be generally used in time-varying coefficient parametric models. It is used not only to detect jumps and structural breaks but also to choose the largest time homogeneous interval for each time point, such that in this interval the coefficients are statistically constant. We apply this adaptive approach in both simulations and real data analysis. Using the 3-month Treasury bill rate as a proxy of the short rate, we find that our method can detect the structural breaks as well as the stable intervals for homogeneously modelling of the interest rate process. The time homogeneous interval cannot persist in an unstable macroeconomy. Furthermore, our approach performs well in long horizon forecasting.

To this end, various different optimization strategies have been proposed for minimizing costs, using daily cash flow forecasts as the main input to the models. However, the effect of the accuracy of such forecasts on cash management policies has not been studied. This article uses two real data sets from the textile industry to show that the predictive accuracy is highly correlated with cost savings when daily forecasts are used in cash management models. A new method is proposed to help cash managers estimate whether their efforts in improving the predictive accuracy are rewarded by proportional cost savings. Our results indicate the need for an analysis of the potential cost savings derived from improving the predictive accuracy. On that basis, the search for better forecasting models is in place in order to improve cash management. (C) 2016 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

To address the possible structural break, cointegration tests allowing for a deterministic shift in the level of the variables are employed, and a two-stage estimation with top-down sequential elimination algorithm is performed on the restricted subset VECM. The results demonstrate that there exists a long-run cointegration relationship between China's log import and the explanatory variables. The import elasticities of macroeconomic development and import price are around 0.76 and -0.81, respectively. Other things being equal, the structural break would induce a 29.6% decline in China's log import. All the above parameters are significant at the 1% risk level. Furthermore, the contribution decomposition analysis suggests that China's macroeconomic development plays a dominant role in determining its log import, which implies that China's log import would not increase as quickly as before, given that its economy is shifting into the New Normal State. This conjecture is supported by our simulations, which indicate that, by 2020, the growth rate of China's log import will be lower than it has been in the past and the import volume would be approximately 1.1-1.6 times greater compared to imports in 2013.

To cope with population growth and exploit the slowly unfolding, favorable change in age structure, countries face a triple challenge. Agricultural productivity has to improve. Prospects are good, though climate change remains a threat. Manufacturing jobs need to be created on a far larger scale than hitherto. Success is uncertain because much depends on foreign investors and the actions of competing low-wage countries in Asia. The third challenge concerns the non-agricultural informal sector, which, even under optimistic assumptions about manufacturing, will continue to provide livelihoods for a large segment of the population. Entrepreneurship needs to be encouraged so that an increasing proportion of family enterprises evolve into larger businesses. There is no blueprint to achieve this evolution and much will depend on the hard work and ingenuity of individuals.","[Cleland, John] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London, England",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Cleland, J (通讯作者)，London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Populat Hlth, Keppel St, London WC1E 7HT, England.",John.Cleland@lshtm.ac.uk,"Cleland, John G./AAZ-4185-2020","Cleland, John G./0000-0002-1471-7016",,,,,24,0,1,2,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",2054-0892,2054-0906,,J DEMOGR ECON,J.Demogr.

These results are robust to several additional tests. Our further analysis indicates that such differences in trading profitability are mitigated during the periods of a high level of legal jeopardy such as the periods around earnings announcements and mergers and acquisitions. These findings are consistent with the view that Securities and Exchange Commission oversight has an impact on insiders' trading behavior by influencing their perceptions of sanctions risk.

A challenge in making this discernment is separating trade shocks from common or domestic shocks. Therefore, using US county-level data for 1990-2010, this study carefully constructs shocks to local economies, isolating those arising from international imports and exports to assess whether trade shocks have different effects from domestic shocks. In confirmatory analysis, we also employ a novel combination of IV and matching strategies. We examine a variety of indicators including employment growth, population growth, employment rates, wage rates and poverty rates. The results suggest that international trade shocks have some different effects than overall domestic shocks, though likely less than commonly perceived. We also find that domestic shocks dominate international trade shocks in explaining variation in regional labor market outcomes.","[Partridge, Mark D.] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Rickman, Dan S.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Econ, Stillwater, OK 74074 USA; [Olfert, M.

Understanding the drivers of foreign direct investment (FDI) in these countries is highly relevant in consideration of their increasing integration into the global market and the strong influence exerted by the EU on this process. By employing data on individual greenfield investment projects for the period 2003 to 2008, this paper aims to disentangle the drivers of FDI in these countries for different industrial sectors, business functions and investment origins. The empirical results suggest that FDI in the area tends to follow market-seeking and efficiency-oriented strategies, and show path-dependency and concentration patterns that may reinforce core-periphery development trajectories in the EU neighbourhood.","[Ascani, Andrea; Crescenzi, Riccardo; Iammarino, Simona] London Sch Econ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Ascani, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",a.ascani@lse.ac.uk; r.crescenzi@lse.ac.uk; s.iammarino@lse.ac.uk,"Ascani, Andrea/T-7092-2019; Crescenzi, Riccardo/F-9165-2014","Ascani, Andrea/0000-0003-4738-3144; Iammarino, Simona/0000-0001-9450-1700","Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1, 1096607] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,50,11,11,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

We address, through a complexity perspective, how leisure characteristics of the ECOC can affect regional development in Fryslan. Three aspects are identified that make leisure-led regional development complex: (i) fragmentation of the leisure sector; (ii) balance between developing leisure and protecting existing social, cultural and ecological qualities; and (iii) difficulties obtaining crossovers between leisure and broader regional development. In an analysis of policy documents for the 2018 ECOC, we observe that although the interactions central to these complexities are recognised they are not captured in the monitoring of the ECOC effects through quantified targets such as attracting four million tourists. We argue that an approach that constantly acknowledges the interactions within leisure is required for a positive effect on regional development to emerge. This necessitates a process in which targets can be adapted according to changing circumstances.","[Meekes, Jasper F.] Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, Dept Spatial Planning & Environm, Groningen, Netherlands; [Meekes, Jasper F.] Stenden Univ Appl Sci, European Tourism Futures Inst, Rengerslaan 8, NL-8917 DD Leeuwarden, Netherlands; [Buda, Dorina M.] Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, Dept Cultural Geog, Groningen, Netherlands; [De Roo, Gert] Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, Dept Spatial Planning & Environm, Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen; University of Groningen; University of Groningen,"Meekes, JF (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, Dept Spatial Planning & Environm, Groningen, Netherlands.;Meekes, JF (通讯作者)，Stenden Univ Appl Sci, European Tourism Futures Inst, Rengerslaan 8, NL-8917 DD Leeuwarden, Netherlands.",j.f.meekes@rug.nl; d.m.buda@rug.nl; g.de.roo@rug.nl,,"Meekes, Jasper/0000-0003-3160-3413",Province of Fryslan,Province of Fryslan,The authors wish to thank Veronique Schutjens and Ward Rauws as well as the anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments on previous versions of this paper.

The objective is to analyze how the European Union and singular European states intervene to solve this kind of market problem to make sure that the objectives of perfect competition are saved. A qualitative investigation of four particular cases in the EU was carried out. The paper presents different cases of market dominance and the results of intervention of the EU Court of Justice, and other National courts.

We interpret the US yields as curves since the term structure of interest rates defines a relation between the yield of a bond and its maturity. Within the NP-FDA approach, each curve is viewed as a functional random variable and the dynamics present in the sample are modeled without imposing any parametric structure. In order to evaluate forecast the performance of the proposed estimator, we consider forecast horizons h = 1,3,6,12... months and the results are compared with widely known benchmark models. Our estimates with NP-FDA present predictive performance superior to its competitors in many situations considered, especially for short-term maturities.

We investigate this reallocation in terms of employment gains and losses from innovation. New employment created by product innovation may be offset by employment losses in related products, known as 'cannibalisation' or 'business stealing' effects in the literature, by employment losses from process and organisational innovation and by general productivity increases. The paper investigates this effect empirically with a large data set from the European Community Innovation Survey. We find that employment gains and losses increase with technology intensity of the sector. High-technology manufacturing shows the strongest employment gains and losses from innovation, followed by knowledge-intensive services, low-technology manufacturing and less knowledge-intensive services. The net contribution of innovation to employment growth is mostly positive, an exception being manufacturing industries in recession periods.","[Dachs, Bernhard] Austrian Inst Technol, Dept Innovat Syst, Vienna, Austria; [Hud, Martin; Koehler, Christian; Peters, Bettina] ZEW Ctr European Econ Res, Dept Innovat Econ & Ind Dynam, Mannheim, Germany; [Hud, Martin] Maastricht Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Peters, Bettina] Univ Luxembourg, Fac Law Econ & Finance, Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Peters, Bettina] Univ Zurich, Dept Business Adm, Zurich, Switzerland",Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT); Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); Maastricht University; University of Luxembourg; University of Zurich,"Peters, B (通讯作者)，ZEW Ctr European Econ Res, Dept Innovat Econ & Ind Dynam, Mannheim, Germany.;Peters, B (通讯作者)，Univ Luxembourg, Fac Law Econ & Finance, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.;Peters, B (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Dept Business Adm, Zurich, Switzerland.",b.peters@zew.de,,"Dachs, Bernhard/0000-0001-9534-3193; Peters, Bettina/0000-0002-8611-2016",European Commission [ENTR/2009/033],European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"We would like to thank the two anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions.

Although, many companies invest in green marketing, but not all of them gain as much as they invest. Most of failures of investments in green marketing are rooted in the fact that customers doubt both the real green performance of these products and the real intention of companies regarding green products. This research, being quantitative in nature, attempts to investigate the impact of traditional branding constructs (perceived quality of the brand, credibility of the brand) and green branding constructs (perceived value of a green brand, the green brand image, and brand equity) on the green purchase intention of customers. The hypotheses have been developed in the form of a conceptual model to investigate the relationship of these constructs. The research focuses on consumers of certain liquid washing detergent products. All the data were collected using questionnaires and the analysis of the data was conducted utilizing LISREL 8 and SPSS 16. The results indicate that perceived brand quality has a positive impact on the perceived value of a green brand, brand credibility, and brand image. In addition, green brand value and green brand image have a positive impact on brand equity. This research can serve as validation of the constructs to fill the gap in the investigation of green brand dimensions. Further analysis shows that green brand equity has a meaningful impact on the green purchase intention of the customers, however the impact of brand credibility on brand equity has not been proved.","[Esmaeili, Ahmad] Allameh Tabatabai Univ, Fac Accounting & Management, Dept Ind Management, Tehran, Iran; [Sepahvand, Akbar] Allameh Tabatabai Univ, Fac Accounting & Management, Dept Mkt Management, Tehran, Iran; [Rostamzadeh, Reza] Islamic Azad Univ, Urmia Branch, Dept Management, Tehran, Iran; [Joksiene, Izolda] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Business Management, Dept Econ & Management Enterprises, Vilnius, Lithuania; [Antucheviciene, Jurgita] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Construct Management & Real Estate, Vilnius, Lithuania",Allameh Tabataba'i University; Allameh Tabataba'i University; Islamic Azad University; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Esmaeili, A (通讯作者)，Allameh Tabatabai Univ, Fac Accounting & Management, Dept Ind Management, Tehran, Iran.",Ahmet.ismaeili@gmail.com; a.sepahvand1991@gmail.com; r.rostamzadeh@iaurmia.ac.ir; izolda.joksiene@vgtu.lt; jurgita.antucheviciene@vgtu.lt,"Rostamzadeh, Reza/AAO-2189-2021; Antucheviciene, Jurgita/W-6112-2018; Sepahvand, Akbar/AAD-2572-2019; Esmaeili, Ahmad/AFV-4948-2022","Rostamzadeh, Reza/0000-0002-6161-7173; Antucheviciene, Jurgita/0000-0002-1734-3216; Esmaeili, Ahmad/0000-0001-5129-5089; Joksiene, Izolda/0000-0002-7871-8878",,,,,97,6,6,10,73,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The results of this analysis show the shaping of real poles of creativity, and the selective analysis of the dynamics of economic profiles shows a superior adaptive capacity for territorial systems that have a high share of creative economies.","[Gruia, Andreea Karina; Grecu, Alexandra; Marin, Marian; Radu, Roxana Andreea; Loghin, Vlad] Univ Bucharest, Res Ctr Integrated Anal & Terr Management, Bucharest, Romania",University of Bucharest,"Gruia, AK (通讯作者)，Univ Bucharest, Res Ctr Integrated Anal & Terr Management, Bucharest, Romania.",andreea.karina.gruia@drd.unibuc.ro; alexandra.grecu@drd.unibuc.ro; marin_marian@yahoo.com; radu88roxana@yahoo.com; loghin_vlad88@yahoo.com,"Alexandra, Grecu/R-8788-2017; Gruia, Andreea Karina/AAQ-8978-2020; marin, marian/R-7828-2017","Alexandra, Grecu/0000-0002-8821-4163; Gruia, Andreea Karina/0000-0001-6690-1483; marin, marian/0000-0001-8661-0069",[UB/141083],,The research activities were financed by the research project - Structural Dynamics and Spatial Distribution of Creative Economies in Romania - UB/141083.,,23,0,0,0,0,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",2286-1440,,,INT MANAGE CONF,,,2017,,,,,,,586,594,,,,,,9,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM6KT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000466917100061,0

This organizes its advantages for these countries, by creating the best conditions for work and life. An important advantage in creating a stable environment for growth is that the country has the accumulated high-quality human capital, such as education, health, science, management and other fields. The core of human capital, of course, is human beings, but now, the main component is an educated, creative and enterprising individual, with a high level of professionalism. The human capital in the economy determines the main share of the national wealth of country. Therefore, most of all researchers believe human capital is the most valuable resource of the post-industrial society, and it is much more important than natural or accumulated wealth. In all countries, human capital defines the rate of economic development, scientific and technological progress. Accordingly, the public interest in the education and health systems increases. This paper tries to estimate the effect of human capital through education and health on economic growth. The estimation is conducted by a Cobb-Douglas production function, in which labor, human capital, and physical capital are shown as factors of production. The Cobb-Douglas production function is preferred by time series data on education, health, physical capital, labor and economic growth for the period of 1960-2011 of Turkey. The period is divided into five sub-divisions, series 1: 1960-1980, series 2: 1981-2001, series 3: 1981-2011, series 4: 2002-2011, and series 5: 1960-2011. The findings indicate a positive impact of human capital on economic growth for both health and education. In addition, health policies were much more effective in the period of 2002-2011. The policies should be continued in the health sector for a sustainable development. But in order to attain a higher level of benefits from human capital, it is necessary to implement effective economic policies related to the education expenditures.","[Kartal, Zeki; Zhumasheva, Aida; Acaroglu, Hakan] Eskisehir Osmangazi Univ, Dept Econ, Eskisehir, Turkey",Eskisehir Osmangazi University,"Zhumasheva, A (通讯作者)，Eskisehir Osmangazi Univ, Dept Econ, Eskisehir, Turkey.",zkartal@ogu.edu.tr; aida.zhumasheva@gmail.com; hacaroglu@ogu.edu.tr,,,,,,,57,3,3,2,14,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-54112-9; 978-3-319-54111-2,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2017,7,,,,,,175,191,,10.1007/978-3-319-54112-9_11,0.0,,,17,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ4CE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000424822700011,0

A number of firm-specific factors, as well as country and industry characteristics are compared across three size groups of firms in terms of their impact on various measures of capital structure. The study employs the BACH-ESD database provided by the European Commission and covers 11 EU countries during the period 2000-2013. Using panel data models for different size groups and for different measures of debt, findings provide evidence that both the direction and the significance of capital structure determinants vary along with the firm size, as well as depending on the debt maturity. As for the size-dependent findings, it appears that financing decisions of small firms generally seem to support the pecking order theory more, while medium and large-sized firms tend to follow the trade-off predictions on leverage. The results also indicate that the trade-off theory is more applicable for short-term debt, whereas pecking order predictions on capital structure are more suitable for long-term debt. The research confirms the prevalence of the country effect over the industry effect in the capital structure, although the difference between the importance of the two effects tends to decrease as firms grow larger.","[Koralun-Bereznicka, Julia] Univ Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; University of Gdansk,"Koralun-Bereznicka, J (通讯作者)，Univ Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.",julia.koralun-bereznicka@ug.edu.pl,,"Koralun-Bereznicka, Julia/0000-0003-4498-0381",,,,,21,0,0,0,6,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-54885-2; 978-3-319-54884-5,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,273,283,,10.1007/978-3-319-54885-2_25,0.0,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI5UA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412819500025,0

Controversy between fiscal sustainability and fiscally driven economic recovery fueled a large number of academic and policy discussions about the appropriate response of governments to the crisis challenges. Empirical literature provides mixed evidence about the effects of fiscal policy adjustments on the macroeconomic performance. Moreover, pro-cyclical patterns in fiscal policies of many countries during the pre-crisis period did not reveal clear lessons learned that would be beneficial for fiscal authorities during the crisis years. In the paper we examine effects of the fiscal policy shocks in CE3 (the Slovak Republic, the Czech Republic and Hungary) within different stages of the business cycle by employing threshold vector autoregression (TVAR) model. We calculate fiscal multipliers and generalized impulse-response functions to assess the responsiveness of the real output to the fiscal policy adjustments. The main objective is to determine whether effects of the fiscal policy shocks differ during expansion and recession. Our results indicate that the size of fiscal multipliers and responsiveness of the real output are generally higher for spending fiscal shocks while effects of revenue fiscal shocks are much less dynamic in all three countries. While the effects of the fiscal spending shocks are more dynamic during recession in the Czech Republic and Hungary, fiscal spending multipliers in the Slovak Republic are generally high during the recession as well though higher during expansion. Moreover, differences in the responsiveness of the real output are slightly higher in case of the expenditure based fiscal adjustments in all three countries (in terms of both, regimes and sub-periods).","[Mirdala, Rajmund; Kamenik, Martin] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Kosice, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Mirdala, R (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Kosice, Slovakia.",rajmund.mirdala@tuke.sk; martin.kamenik@tuke.sk,"Mirdala, Rajmund/P-4891-2017","Mirdala, Rajmund/0000-0002-9949-3049",Ministry of Education scheme,Ministry of Education scheme,This paper was written in connection with scientific project VEGA no. 1/0994/15.

Moreover, heat transfers into a building, for example, a wall, floor or a window, and then kept inside the building. As a result, the building accumulates heat. In addition, the air conditioning results in slower working conditions and uses grater power consumption. The Auto Active Airflow-Fan Cooler System has a mechanism that allows for good ventilation, where windows are closed. The system will automatically run when the house temperature reaches a set point. The evening garden system will continue to work to provide effective ventilation, and will drip during the night, when the temperature in a building drops to a set level. If the Auto Active Airflow-Fan Cooler System is installed in conjunction with the ceiling insulation, it will help to improve the performance. The system developed using Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud (AWS) technology.

The model employed in the research is a modified version of Fama and French (J Financ Econ 33(1):3-56, 1993) asset pricing model including additionally the 'order imbalance factor' built on the basis of the original imbalance indicators proposed by Nowak (Order imbalance on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, 2000-2012. Paper presented at the International Conference Financial Investments and Insurance - Global Trends and Polish Market, Wroclaw University of Economics, Wroclaw, 17-19 September 2014). The order imbalance is assumed as the temporary imbalance between buy and sell orders. Its estimation is preceded by an indication which side of the market was initiating the transaction, and a distinction between the so-called buyer-and seller-initiated trades [Lee and Ready (J Financ 46 (2):73-746, 1991), Ellis, Michaely and O'Hara (J Financ Quant Anal 35 (4):529-551, 2000)]. The imbalance indicators are calculated using the high frequency intraday data. The research hypothesis states that the proposed asset pricing model has good descriptive properties. The analysis is conducted for the selected stocks-index WIG20 constituents listed on the WSE over the period of 2000 to 2016. The model is validated using i.a. the underidentification test and the weak identification test [Kleibergen and Paap (J Econom 133(1):97-126, 2006)], overidentification test of all instruments [Hansen (Econometrica 50 (4):1029-1054, 1982)] and endogeneity test of endogenous regressors.","[Nowak, Sabina] Univ Gdansk, Dept Econometr, Fac Management, Gdansk, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; University of Gdansk,"Nowak, S (通讯作者)，Univ Gdansk, Dept Econometr, Fac Management, Gdansk, Poland.",sabina.nowak@ug.edu.pl,"Nowak, Sabina/S-6555-2017","Nowak, Sabina/0000-0003-3930-1890",,,,,17,7,7,0,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-54885-2; 978-3-319-54884-5,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,91,102,,10.1007/978-3-319-54885-2_9,0.0,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI5UA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412819500009,0

Forestry might look as a small part of the bioeconomy, but with a significant role. The aim of this paper is to assess the importance of forestry in the bioeconomy and to point to some confusion. The role of forests can be found in de/recarbonisation that is important in context of energy and meeting climate objectives. Wood as a renewable source is further used for alternative products with a great potential in the future. Higher demand for wood emphasizes the role of good forest management, but there are some risks and doubts arising from certain ambiguities concerning the use of forests for the society in the best way.","[Palatova, Petra] Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Forestry & Wood Sci, Dept Forestry & Wood Econ, Kamycka 1176, Prague 16521, Czech Republic; [Sticha, Vaclav] Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Forestry & Wood Sci, Dept Forestry Technol & Construct, Kamycka 1176, Prague 16521, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Palátová, P (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Forestry & Wood Sci, Dept Forestry & Wood Econ, Kamycka 1176, Prague 16521, Czech Republic.",palatovap@fld.czu.cz; sticha@fld.czu.cz,"Palátová, Petra/AAD-2523-2019",,,,,,17,0,0,0,4,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-499-5,,,,2017,,,,,,,587,592,,,,,,6,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ7IS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427306200061,0

This innovative approach is trying to show the characteristics of young students reflecting their values, socialization and attitudes. The main aim is to analyze the differences in these two student bodies' samples with the focus on values and attitudes of future managers and business experts. The questions under focus include topics such as 1. Are students at these two faculties different because they study different field of study or are they very similar because belong to the same age cohort? 2. Is the group of economic students homogeneous or are there big differences in value orientation? 3. Can we use this knowledge to improve educational management and prepare students successfully to their future careers? The results showed that the students of the FBE in Brno are less liberal in comparison with students of the FH from Prague. These students come from families with similar level of educational background of parents but their opinion on ideal society, where they would like to live in, is different. It seems that economic students are more diversified as there are gender differences regarding the ideal society image.","[Pavlikova, Eva Abramuszkinova] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Law & Social Sci, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Smidova, Michaela] Ctr Higher Educ Studies, U Dvou Srpu 2-2024, Prague 15000 5, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Centre for Higher Education Studies,"Pavlíková, EA (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Law & Social Sci, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",eva.pavlikova@mendelu.cz; smidovami@outlook.cz,"Abramuszkinová, Eva/A-2840-2011; Šmídová, Michaela/HJG-6027-2022; Abramuszkinová, Eva/AAM-7636-2020","Abramuszkinová, Eva/0000-0003-3267-2752; Šmídová, Michaela/0000-0003-4119-1053; Abramuszkinová, Eva/0000-0003-3267-2752","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports, Prague, Czech Republic: LD - COST CZ [LD15065]","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports, Prague, Czech Republic: LD - COST CZ","This paper was supported by The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports, Prague, Czech Republic: LD - COST CZ, project: LD15065 titled Gender dimension of active ageing implementation in the Czech private and public sector in comparison with western countries.",,12,1,1,0,3,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-499-5,,,,2017,,,,,,,3,12,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ7IS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427306200001,0

Productivity and employment/wages link changed after 1980 in many countries, not just the U.S. This study investigates the productivity and employment/wages link (1950-2014) looking for empirical proof of the great decoupling put forward by Brynjolfsson and Mcafee (2013). The results should stimulate policymakers to openly question why real wages and productivity don't line up with the theory. We use the Hodrick and Prescott (1997) filter to isolate trends in real wages, labor share in GDP, and labor productivity and rolling correlation to explore if the great decoupling is real. We have found that the great decoupling i.e. the divergence between real wages/employment and productivity is present in all countries (10 in the sample). The dynamics of the great decoupling are however different between the countries although year 1980 seems to be a dominant breaking point for the start of the phenomena. This paper provides multicounty empirical proof of the presence of the great decoupling phenomena and explores its dynamics over 1950-2014. Policy makers as well as firms and unions should take the existence of this phenomena seriously since it can have significant consequences on economic growth and labor markets' functioning.","[Skare, Marinko] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Preradoviceva 1, Pula 52100, Croatia; [Skare, Damian] Sch Econ Pula, Kovaciceva Ul 3, Pula 52100, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Skare, M (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Preradoviceva 1, Pula 52100, Croatia.",mskare@unipu.hr; damian.skare@skole.hr,"Škare, Marinko/L-5504-2019","Škare, Marinko/0000-0001-6426-3692",,,,,35,5,6,0,10,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The aim of this article is to identify the differences in quality management (its selected characteristics) within efficient and less efficient enterprises. The research was conducted using a questionnaire for a total of 55 enterprises. A specific question from the questionnaire was used to divide the enterprises into efficient and less efficient. The characteristics for quality management were identified within the groups of efficient and less efficient enterprises, and subsequently the statistically significant differences were found between these two groups of enterprises. The statistical significance was set at a level of 90%. The differences between both groups of enterprises were determined using a pairwise comparison method, including the appropriate tests. The results show that there are differences in the degree of formalization and integration of the quality-management system between both groups of companies, with efficient enterprises also having a designated post more often which is responsible for quality management at the level of quality planning. Further differences are in the existence/absence of a quality-management system and in the use of methods and tools for determining customer satisfaction. Efficient enterprises also tend to concur that quality management leads to the support, maintenance and growth of the company's competitiveness in terms of increased productivity.","[Suchanek, Petr; Klapalova, Alena] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Corp Econ, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Suchánek, P (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Corp Econ, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",suchy@econ.muni.cz,"Suchanek, Petr/R-9626-2019; Klapalová, Alena/N-3854-2015","Suchanek, Petr/0000-0002-2606-4040; Klapalová, Alena/0000-0002-7169-6223",Czech Science Foundation [16-16260S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"This article is an output from the project Pristup managementu k redukci zpetnych toku ve vazbe na spokojenost zakazniku a neustale zlepsovani, Czech Science Foundation no.

The use of the dynamically evolving concept of economic services, used to identify economically utilisable services provided by undamaged ecosystems, can thus contribute to dealing with the issues of optimum landscape management. The primary data collection took place in the summer of 2013; a total of 216 questionnaires were collected. The research focused on three ecosystems, namely montane meadows, clearance cairns and quasi-natural mountain streams. The paper presents and discusses primarily the results of a choice experiment that was used to determine the willingness to pay for defined changes in the ecosystems examined. The research showed that visitors to the Eastern Ore Mountains unambiguously prefer a natural (authentic) or quasi-natural condition of the landscape and that people are able to distinguish among the different situations well (e.g., different appearance of montane meadows, mountain streams, clearance cairns, etc.). People prefer montane meadows scythed without farm animals, clearance cairns not overgrown, and streams with a quasi-natural character. The authors point out the finding that the research results indicate a strong connection of the local population to the local landscape and ecosystems, the potential of which in relation to nature protection and landscape management is totally unutilised at the moment. Special attention is paid to a specific ecosystem, not studied yet in the Czech Republic - the clearance cairns, which showed (contrary to expectations) a noticeably higher willingness to pay for their good management compared to the other ecosystems examined.","[Vojacek, Ondrej] Czech Tech Univ, Dept Management & Econ, Prague, Czech Republic; [Vojacek, Ondrej; Louda, Jiri] Univ JE Purkyne, Fac Social & Econ Studies, Inst Econ & Environm Policy, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic; [Louda, Jiri] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Humanities, Dept Social & Cultural Ecol, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech Technical University Prague; University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne; Charles University Prague,"Vojácek, O (通讯作者)，Czech Tech Univ, Dept Management & Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",ondrej.vojacek@gmail.com; louda@ieep.cz,"Louda, Jiri/L-9756-2017","Louda, Jiri/0000-0001-7194-3178","project Value Nature of the Eastern Ore Mountains [100093854]; European Regional Development Fund; programme EUPRO II (Czech Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport) [LE14010]","project Value Nature of the Eastern Ore Mountains; European Regional Development Fund(European Union (EU)); programme EUPRO II (Czech Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport)","The paper was written with support from the project Value Nature of the Eastern Ore Mountains (no. 100093854), implemented as part of the Cil 3/Ziel 3 scheme and co-funded from the European Regional Development Fund and partly also from the project Cross border Flood Risk Management (No. LE14010) financed from the programme EUPRO II (Czech Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport).",,59,3,3,1,15,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Using a sample of 309 US firm-year observations in the retail industry from year 2011 to 2013, we show that both debt financing and credit rating have positive relationships with corporate performance. Further, when a company has high credit rating, its debt financing ratio has no effect on its performance, while a company with low credit rating; it performs better as debt financing ratio increases. The findings can be applied by CFOs (Chief Finance Officers) in retail companies to build an efficient capital structure when considering the companies' credit ratings. A good combination of these two enables firms to gain a bigger profit and attract more investors.","[Wang Jianlong] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Arts & Law, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China",Wuhan University of Technology,"Wang, JL (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Arts & Law, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China.",374233584@qq.com,"wu, jun/ISB-8607-2023",,,,,,14,1,1,0,4,VOLKSON PRESS,KUALA LUMPUR,"C-3A-15 CENTRIO PANTAI HILLPARK, JALAN PANTAI MURNI, BANGSAR SOUTH,, KUALA LUMPUR, WILAYAH PERSEKUTUAN KUALA LUMPUR 59200, MALAYSIA",,,978-1-948012-02-7,,,,2017,,,,,,,21,23,,10.26480/icemi.01.2017.21.23,0.0,,,3,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM2GZ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000461012100007,0

Mixture cure models were used for the first time in medical statistics to model long-term survival of cancer patients. Tong et al.

In this paper, we investigate the use of a mixture cure model for a sample of 5000 consumer credit accounts from a 60-month personal loans portfolio of a Polish financial institution. All loans have been observed for 24 months. Default is the event of interest, whereas earlier repayment is considered to be censoring. We develop and compare default prediction models using the logistic regression, Cox model and mixture cure approaches. Similarities with and differences to the study results obtained by Tong et al.

Lerner indexes for a sample of 61 major airports around the world were calculated for the period 2008-2014. Then, regression analysis was conducted to identify the determinants of the airport Lerner index. We find that a more concentrated downstream airline market would reduce the profit margin for a public airport but increase the profit margin for a private airport. A higher share of concession service is found to decrease the airport's overall profit margin (accounting for both aeronautical and concession services). Airports with significant LCC presence have a lower profit margin. Finally, the concentration in airline market is found to have a larger negative impact on airport aeronautical price than on the concession price.","[Choo, Yap Yin] British Columbia Inst Technol, Sch Business, SE 6,3700 Willingdon Ave, Burnaby, BC V5G 3H2, Canada; [Corbo, Leonardo] Univ Catolica Portuguesa, Catolica Porto Business Sch, Rua Diogo Botelho 1327, P-4169005 Porto, Portugal; [Corbo, Leonardo] Univ Catolica Portuguesa, CEGE, Rua Diogo Botelho 1327, P-4169005 Porto, Portugal; [Wang, Kun] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",British Columbia Institute of Technology; Universidade Catolica Portuguesa; Universidade Catolica Portuguesa; University of International Business & Economics,"Choo, YY (通讯作者)，British Columbia Inst Technol, Sch Business, SE 6,3700 Willingdon Ave, Burnaby, BC V5G 3H2, Canada.",ychoo1@bcit.ca; lcorbo@porto.ucp.pt; kunwang@uibe.edu.cn,"WANG, KUN/HDN-4021-2022; Wang, Kun/AAE-4337-2019; Corbo, Leonardo/JXY-3926-2024","WANG, KUN/0000-0002-2137-9457; Corbo, Leonardo/0000-0001-5133-7592",Air Transport Research Society (ATRS),Air Transport Research Society (ATRS),"We would like to thank two anonymous referees for their constructive comments, which helped us substantially improve this paper.

The political budget cycle appears subdued in the post-Maastricht treaty period, which implies tighter constraints on public finances. We demonstrate, however, that the opportunistic manipulation of public finances lives on, albeit through a different channel. In particular, we produce evidence of electoral effects in the composition of expenditures, with the expenses for compensation to employees increasing during election years. Furthermore, our results show that snap elections affect expenses positively, and prolonged incumbencies affect negatively the government's primary balance and revenues.

Within travel demand, long-distance trips represent a significant amount of the total vehicle-kilometers travelled, in contrast to commuting trips. Consequently, they pay a relevant role in the economic, social and environmental impacts of transportation. This paper describes the development of a microscopic long-distance travel demand model for the Province of Ontario (Canada) and analyzes the sensitivity to the implementation of a new high speed rail corridor. Trip generation, destination choice and mode choice models were developed for this research. Multinomial logit models were estimated and calibrated using the Travel Survey for Residents in Canada (TSRC). It was complemented with location-based social network data from Foursquare, improving the description of activities and diverse land uses at the destinations. Level of service of the transit network was defined by downloading trip time, frequency and fare using the planning service Rome2rio. New scenarios were generated to simulate the impacts of a new high speed rail corridor by varying rail travel times, frequencies and fares of the rail services. As a result, a significant increase of rail modal shares was measured, directly proportional to speed and frequency and inversely proportional to price.","[Llorca, Carlos; Moeckel, Rolf] Tech Univ Munich, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Ji, Joanna] PTV Grp, Haid & Neu Str 15, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Molloy, Joseph] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, IVT, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland",Technical University of Munich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Llorca, C (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",carlos.llorca@tum.de; joanna.ji@ptvgroup.com; joseph.molloy@ivt.baug.ethz.ch; rolf.moeckel@tum.de,"Moeckel, Rolf/H-3104-2016; Llorca, Carlos/K-5180-2016","Moeckel, Rolf/0000-0002-6874-0393; Llorca, Carlos/0000-0002-3760-193X; Molloy, Joseph/0000-0001-9723-8266; Ji, Joanna/0000-0002-1747-5163",Technische Universitat Munchen - Institute for Advanced Study - German Excellence Initiative; European Union [291763],Technische Universitat Munchen - Institute for Advanced Study - German Excellence Initiative; European Union(European Union (EU)),"The research was completed with the support of the Technische Universitat Munchen - Institute for Advanced Study, funded by the German Excellence Initiative and the European Union Seventh Framework Programme under grant agreement no 291763.

In this study, we investigate price levels of ethanol that will be necessary for landowners to grow hybrid poplar. In such an emerging industry, landowners will face a great deal of uncertainty and will consider options to change their production decisions over time. To address this uncertainty, we construct a real options model that considers the dynamic option for Canadian landowners to switch from agriculture to poplar plantations, and also the option to sell poplar plantations for ethanol or pulpwood. The uncertainty in prices for poplar is characterized by time series models of prices for ethanol and pulpwood that characterize price variability as a GARCH process, and reversion to the long term mean average prices. Uncertainty for the value of land allocated to agriculture is characterised by a geometric random walk. Given these price processes, the real options models suggest that current average price levels would have to increase by approximately 35% (i.e. by 0.21 $/L) if only ethanol is considered as an end product, but this increase may be reduced to 32% (i.e., to 0.19 $/L) if the landowner has options to sell the poplar to either ethanol or pulpwood producers. On low value agriculture lands, estimates suggest that an 18% increase relative to current ethanol prices (i.e., of 0.11 $/L) would be needed, which is approximately equal to the current second generation subsidies in Alberta.","[Work, James; Hauer, Grant; Luckert, M.

In telling a global story, the authors provide a vision of the future of work that should guide policy initiatives for the creation of desirable jobs for all. This vision is one where economic growth is consistent with ecological sustainability; with full and fair employment and no discrimination; where workers control their time and tasks; and where there are inclusive labour market institutions. The policies that the authors put forward to advance this vision include flexibility in the rules related to employment protection to avoid deeper segmentation of the labour market; the creation of social protection systems to cover all workers; the provision of broad access to education and skill formation at different stages of life; the guarantee of equal opportunities and non-discrimination; and respect for collective bargaining.","[Alarcon, Diana] Colegio Frontera Norte, Carretera Escenica Tijuana Ensenada Km 18-5, Tijuana, Mexico",Colegio Frontera Norte,"Alarcón, D (通讯作者)，Colegio Frontera Norte, Carretera Escenica Tijuana Ensenada Km 18-5, Tijuana, Mexico.",dalarcon@colef.mx,,,,,,,5,0,0,1,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

We combine two rounds of nationally representative data on child growth from the 2006 and 2011 Nepal Demographic and Health Surveys with district level information on roads and road quality. We estimate a dose-response function for height-for-age and weight for-height z-scores. Results suggest that roads and road quality matter for short- and long-term nutrition outcomes for children under five years of age.

Manne, our friend, Mentor, and colleague, was a pioneer in the economic analysis of law. By consistently challenging the notion that existing institutions were well understood, he expanded the domain of economics to new and fertile ground. In that spirit, our goal in this article is to bring out of the shadows an institution that has thus far evaded the light of economic analysis: antitrust consents. In our view, competition authorities around the world should be asking themselves what ratio of litigation to settlement is optimal for their agency. Over the last 35years, the United States Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice have shifted dramatically toward greater reliance upon consent decrees than upon litigation to resolve antitrust disputes. As an aid to national competition agencies considering the desirability of adopting a similar approach, we focus upon the importance of economic analysis in evaluating movement along the continuum from a law enforcement model to a regulatory model of agency behavior. We draw upon the U.S. experience to substantiate our claim that the costs associated with a shift toward the regulatory model, including the potential distortion in the development of substantive antitrust doctrine, may be under-appreciated and discernable only in the long run. We acknowledge that consent decrees can and should be an important tool in an antitrust agency's toolkit for resolving antitrust disputes. We contend, however, that a full economic analysis of reliance primarily upon consent decrees is necessary to inform each competition agency's strategic decision about the optimal mix of law enforcement and regulatory techniques.","[Wright, Joshua D.; Ginsburg, Douglas H.] George Mason Univ, Antonin Scalia Law Sch, Arlington, VA 22201 USA; [Wright, Joshua D.; Ginsburg, Douglas H.] Global Antitrust Inst, Arlington, VA 22201 USA; [Wright, Joshua D.] Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Washington, DC USA; [Ginsburg, Douglas H.] US Court Appeals Dist Columbia Circuit, Washington, DC 20001 USA",George Mason University,"Ginsburg, DH (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Antonin Scalia Law Sch, Arlington, VA 22201 USA.;Ginsburg, DH (通讯作者)，Global Antitrust Inst, Arlington, VA 22201 USA.;Ginsburg, DH (通讯作者)，US Court Appeals Dist Columbia Circuit, Washington, DC 20001 USA.",dginsburg@cadc.uscourts.gov,,"Wright, Joshua/0000-0002-9835-6579",,,,,42,0,0,1,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Therefore it is important to have quantitative models available which allow passenger demand for rail travel to be simulated for planning purposes and to evaluate different policies. The aim of this article is to specify and estimate trip distribution models between railway stations by considering the most influential demand variables. Two types of models were estimated: Poisson regression and gravity. The input data were the ticket sales and the prices between stations on a regional line in Cantabria (Spain) which were provided by the Spanish railway infrastructure administrator (ADIF RAM). The models have also considered the possible existence of spatial effects between train stations. The results show that the models have a good fit to the available data, especially the gravity models constrained by origins and destinations. Furthermore, the gravity models which considered the existence of spatial effects between stations had a significantly better fit and provided a more realistic journey pattern in a future scenario than the Poisson models and the gravity models that did not consider these effects. The proposed models have therefore been shown to be good support tools for decision making in the field of railway planning.","[Cordera, Ruben; Sanudo, Roberto; dell'Olio, Luigi; Ibeas, Angel] Univ Cantabria, Dept Transportat, Av Los Castros S-N, E-39005 Santander, Cantabria, Spain",Universidad de Cantabria,"Cordera, R (通讯作者)，Univ Cantabria, Dept Transportat, Av Los Castros S-N, E-39005 Santander, Cantabria, Spain.",corderar@unican.es,"Cordera, Ruben/K-3965-2014; Ibeas, Angel/F-4885-2012; dell'Olio, Luigi/A-5148-2008; Sanudo, Roberto/K-4572-2014","Cordera, Ruben/0000-0001-8272-6662; dell'Olio, Luigi/0000-0003-0919-7578; Sanudo, Roberto/0000-0001-6122-1294",Horizon 2020 Framework Programme [730838]; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [730838] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme(Horizon 2020); H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme),"This research was made possible thanks to financing from the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, Shift2Rail Joint Undertaking 2015 call through the NEAR2050: future challenges for the rail sector project (Grant Number: 730838).

To a large extent, public transport in Europe is provided by regional authorities who controls the traffic to a varying degree, from complete public monopoly to competitive tendering. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to analyse how the organisation of the public bus transport market influences the introduction of renewable fuels. The focus is on understanding what the motivation is for the use of different organisational forms and what challenges and opportunities the authorities in a region encounter during the introduction of renewable fuels. Interviews with authorities in ten Swedish public transport regions show that when functional requirements are used in competitive tendering it will exclusively result in the cheapest renewable fuel available. Thus, if new fuels or technologies should be able to enter the market, either it will be necessary for regional authorities to take more control using specific requirements or publicly management, or the national government must introduce policy instruments that enable new renewable fuels to become competitive on the market.","[Aldenius, Malin] Lund Univ, Fac Engn, Environm & Energy Syst Studies, Box 118, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Aldenius, Malin] K2 Swedish Knowledge Ctr Publ Transport, Bruksgatan 8, SE-22236 Lund, Sweden",Lund University; Lund University,"Aldenius, M (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Fac Engn, Environm & Energy Syst Studies, Box 118, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden.",malin.aldenius@miljo.lth.se,,,Swedish Energy Agency [P39738-1]; Swedish Energy Agency (SEA) [P39738-1] Funding Source: Swedish Energy Agency (SEA),Swedish Energy Agency(Swedish Energy Agency); Swedish Energy Agency (SEA)(Swedish Energy Agency),"The research for this paper has been funded by the Swedish Energy Agency (P39738-1).

Pricing decisions are delegated to the partnership operating in the downstream market as a socially concerned firm that maximises a weighted sum of social welfare and profits. The price for essential input required to produce each unit of the transportation service is determined by the monopoly in the upstream market for rolling stock and crew leasing. A forward ownership interest in the vertical partnership held by the monopoly yields a partial rebate of the downstream margin. In turn, the local authorities can extract the upstream monopoly rent via a franchise fee which can be determined ex post. Our theoretical model predicts that local authorities with a relatively high share in the partnership should decrease the net transfer from the budget by increasing the franchise fees if the upstream profit margins are high. The empirical evidence for the impact of the ownership structure on contractual regime is found in the panel data for 25 suburban passenger companies in Russia in 2011-2015, where partial cost recovery and inappropriate compensation plays the role of pseudo-franchising contracts.","[Dementiev, Andrei] Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, 20 Myasnitskaya St, Moscow 101000, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Dementiev, A (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, 20 Myasnitskaya St, Moscow 101000, Russia.",dementiev@hse.ru,"Dementiev, Andrei/G-6337-2015","Dementiev, Andrei/0000-0001-6449-7659",Basic Research Program at the National Research University Higher School of Economics; Faculty of Economic Sciences,Basic Research Program at the National Research University Higher School of Economics; Faculty of Economic Sciences,"The research leading to these results has received funding from the Basic Research Program at the National Research University Higher School of Economics.

For cost-conscious public transport operators, therefore, it may be more convenient and logical to keep service improvements at a bare minimum, or to cut services altogether, in order to reduce operating costs. As a follow-up to Mokonyama and Venter (2013), the paper uses historical financial and patronage data from existing bus contracts in South Africa and a conjoint-analysis based behavioural model to estimate the budgetary implications, and marginal benefits, of specifying service quality in public transport contracts. This is especially relevant in an environment like South Africa, in which authorities seek some formulation of Pigouvian subsidy oriented transport policy. It is shown that the marginal benefits of improved service quality can be significant relative to the business as usual alternative. The non-linear response surface characterising the relationship between probability of using a service and the quality of the service implies that increased satisfaction of both captive and non-captive users produces disproportionately higher benefits for both and society.","[Mokonyama, Mathetha] CSIR, POB 395, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa; [Venter, Christo] Univ Pretoria, Private Bag X20, ZA-0028 Hatfield, South Africa",Council for Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - South Africa; University of Pretoria,"Mokonyama, M (通讯作者)，CSIR, POB 395, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa.",mmokonyama@csir.co.za; christo.venter@up.ac.za,"Venter, Christo/E-6884-2011","Venter, Christo/0000-0002-2666-4812; Mokonyama, Mathetha Thabo/0000-0002-3255-4118",,,,,32,1,1,0,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

In contrast, little is known about the short-term academic consequences of borrowing to finance college attendance. We use detailed student-level administrative data to examine the relationship between the type and amount of student loans used to pay for college and students' academic performance, choice of major, and retention rates. The results suggest that students who take out loans have lower grade point averages (GPAs) than students who do not. Among students with debt, those with greater student loan balances have lower GPAs, take fewer credits per semester, and have lower retention rates. This is true conditioning on detailed background characteristics as well as in individual fixed effect specifications that control for unobserved time-constant characteristics of students. These results can help inform policies to mitigate the adverse effects of increasing education debt.","[Stoddard, Christiana; Urban, Carly] Montana State Univ, Econ, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Schmeiser, Maximilian D.] Amazon Lending, Data Sci, Seattle, WA USA",Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman,"Stoddard, C (通讯作者)，Montana State Univ, Econ, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",cstoddard@montana.edu; carly.urban@montana.edu; maxschmeiser@wisc.edu,"Schmeiser, Maximilian D/A-2350-2010",,,,,,26,5,15,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

In designing public transport contracts it is important that an appropriate risk-share dispensation be considered to ensure that the relevant entity (the authority and/or operator) carries the risk that it is best suited to manage. Inappropriate risk-sharing arrangements can result in additional costs being factored into contract bids by operators thus increasing the overall cost of public transport for the authority. In addition, the design of the contract e.g. net cost versus gross cost (and associated risk apportionment) could have a bearing on the ultimate cost of the contract. This paper explores the risk views of 15 contracted bus operators representing 4950 buses in South Africa, based on their experiences of such contracts over several years of public transport contracting. The lessons learned from this research will assist contracting authorities in understanding how operators respond and view risks associated with various controllable and uncontrollable risks related to public transport contracting as it is the South African government's intention to embark on the next round of public transport contracting in 2018.","[Walters, Jackie] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Transport & Supply Chain Management, Inst Transport & Logist Studies Africa, POB 524, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Johannesburg,"Walters, J (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, Dept Transport & Supply Chain Management, Inst Transport & Logist Studies Africa, POB 524, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa.",jwalters@uj.ac.za,,,,,,,9,3,3,0,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

Rather than observing polarisation, we find evidence for 'middle class squeeze' involving the self-employed and a significant erosion of the advantages associated with the higher social classes. These outcomes derived primarily from a weakening of the degree of association between social class and income class and a reduction of the buffering effect of social class within the lower income classes.

Our case study is based on Addiopizzo, an NGO that, from 2004, invites firms to refuse requests from the local Mafia and to join a public list of non-payers. The research is based on a dataset obtained linking the current administrative archives maintained by the chambers of commerce and the list updated by the NGO. The objective of this paper is twofold: first, to gather sound data on the characteristics of the Addiopizzo joiners; second to model the probability to join Addiopizzo by a two-level logistic regression model. We find that the resilience behavior is likely to be the result of both individual (firm) and environmental factors. In particular, we find that firm's total assets, firm's age and being in the construction sector are negatively correlated with the probability of joining AP, while a higher level of human capital embodied in the firm and a higher number of employees are positively correlated. Among the district-level variables, we find that the share of district's population is negatively correlated with the probability to join, while a higher level of socio-economic development, including education levels, are positively correlated.","[Battisti, Michele; Lavezzi, Andrea Mario] Univ Palermo, Dept Law, Piazza Bologni 8, I-90134 Palermo, Italy; [Masserini, Lucio; Pratesi, Monica] Univ Pisa, Dept Econ & Management, Via Ridolfi 10, I-56124 Pisa, Italy",University of Palermo; University of Pisa,"Battisti, M (通讯作者)，Univ Palermo, Dept Law, Piazza Bologni 8, I-90134 Palermo, Italy.",michele.battisti@unipa.it; mario.lavezzi@unipa.it; lucio.masserini@unipi.it; monica.pratesi@unipi.it,"pratesi, monica/K-8665-2019; Lavezzi, Andrea Mario/AAF-6373-2020","pratesi, monica/0000-0002-9959-5483; MASSERINI, LUCIO/0000-0002-9661-9953",Addiopizzo; MIUR; University of Palermo [FFR 2012],"Addiopizzo; MIUR(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); University of Palermo","We are grateful to Addiopizzo for providing data and for support to this research.

The expressway opened in December 2001 and connects the Seoul Metropolitan area with Jeolla province. Major construction goals were to stimulate the industrial development of nearby regions and improve the traffic flow around existing industrial complexes. The analysis used panel data for the ten years of 1997 through 2006. The database was developed from the annual Korea Mining and Manufacturing Survey and other sources. The analysis used a fine spatial resolution based on three non-overlapping, small spatial administrative units: city wards (Korean: dortg), towns (K. eup), and rural districts (K. myeon). This led to 2029 observations (one for each spatial unit) per year, or a total of 20,290 observations for the 10-year panel. The analysis was performed with a fixed-effect negative binomial panel regression. The analysis modeled the formation of new manufacturing establishments, both in total and classified by technology level and establishment size. The results found that the opening of the West Coast Expressway had a significant positive impact on the decision of the location of new manufacturing establishments. The average wage of employed workers in local manufacturing establishments was also an important location determinant for new manufacturing establishments, especially for establishments based on lower technology levels which pay lower wages. Land price was found to produce a negative effect, regardless of technology level or size. The number of employed workers in existing manufacturing establishments in the local area was a highly significant positive determinant of location for new manufacturing establishments, indicating agglomeration effects.","[Kim, Hyungtai] KDI, Publ & Private Infrastruct Investment Managemet C, 263 Namsejong Ro, Sejong Si 30149, South Korea; [Ahn, Sanghoon] KDI, Dept Ind & Serv Econ, 263 Namsejong Ro, Sejong Si 30149, South Korea; [Ulfarsson, Gudmundur F.] Univ Iceland, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Hjardarhagi 2-6, IS-107 Reykjavik, Iceland",University of Iceland,"Ulfarsson, GF (通讯作者)，Univ Iceland, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Hjardarhagi 2-6, IS-107 Reykjavik, Iceland.",jhtkim@kdi.re.kr; ahn@kdi.re.kr; gfu@hi.is,"Ulfarsson, Gudmundur F/G-8461-2012","Ulfarsson, Gudmundur F/0000-0002-0094-7531",,,,,43,13,14,1,36,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

The data allow detailed analyses of the connection between virtual and physical mobility on an individual level. Our analyses show a slightly stronger enhancement effect of the ICT use although the enhancement and substitution of trips are not exclusive but rather coexist even on an individual level. Furthermore, virtual mobility as well as physical mobility and their connection have to be seen in a wider context of sociodemographic factors and milieus. Basically, the virtual and physical mobility of young people who grew up with ICT as a matter of course in their everyday lives are two supplementary types of activities that are connected in a complex way.","[Konrad, Kathrin; Wittowsky, Dirk] ILS Res Inst Reg & Urban Dev gGmbH, Bruderweg 22-24, D-44135 Dortmund, Germany",,"Konrad, K (通讯作者)，ILS Res Inst Reg & Urban Dev gGmbH, Bruderweg 22-24, D-44135 Dortmund, Germany.",kathrin.konrad@ils-forschung.de; dirk.wittowsky@ils-forschung.de,,,,,,,34,29,32,2,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

Then, using data from the Current Population Survey Outgoing Rotation Groups, we find no evidence that MMLs affect employment, hours, or wages among working-age adults, including among demographic groups whose marijuana consumption is most impacted by MMLs.

In this paper, we use a non-parametric approach (geographically weighted regressions) to identify the determinants of the ageing dynamics, checking for the existence of a convergence/divergence ageing process after controlling for the socio-economic characteristics of the Spanish municipalities.

However, estimates of this impact vary widely. For example, a recent study based on administrative records of six GP practices, predicts an extra 4.4 million GP visits. This paper argues that little reliance should be placed on this estimate due to methodological and sample selection issues, as well as the use of demonstrably inappropriate assumptions. Instead, more reliance should be placed on estimates derived from retrospective self-reporting surveys (e.g. Growing Up in Ireland, the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing) which suggest that extending free GP care to all private patients is likely to result in an increase of around 2.5 million GP visits. The increase in demand for GP services occasioned by free GP care feeds into the wider debate about the enhanced role of primary care in Ireland and the corresponding increase in funding.","[Gorecki, Paul K.] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland; [Gorecki, Paul K.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin,"Gorecki, PK (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland.;Gorecki, PK (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.",pkgorecki@gmail.com,,,,,,,36,2,2,0,0,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

Immigrant families, especially those from Mexico or other Latin American countries, have a higher probability of using NBFS than native-born families, regardless of their banking status. Residing in concentrated ethnic enclaves or being a US citizen, however, lowers the probability of using these services. Similarly, native-born Black and Hispanic families are more likely to use these services than native-born White families. Our findings support continued efforts to encourage mainstream participation among immigrant and minority native-born families. Having access to mainstream financial services can help these families establish financial stability and economic mobility. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study of immigrant families' joint decision making about using NBFS and bank account ownership.","[Northwood, Joyce M.; Rhine, Sherrie L.

We argue that oil-dependent economies have incentives to transfer arms to oil-rich countries to reduce their risk of instability and, as a result, the chances of disruption in the oil industry. We employ gravity models of the arms trade and estimate the effect of both a local as well as a global oil dependence. Two key results emerge. First, the volume of arms transfers to a specific country is affected by the degree of dependence on its supply of oil. Second, global oil dependence motivates arms export to oil-rich countries even in absence of a direct bilateral oil-for-weapons exchange. Our results point consistently toward the conclusion that the arms trade is an effective foreign policy tool to securing and maintaining access to oil.","[Bove, Vincenzo] Univ Warwick, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Deiana, Claudio] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Brussels, Belgium; [Nistico, Roberto] Univ Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy; [Nistico, Roberto] CSEF, Naples, Italy",University of Warwick; European Commission Joint Research Centre; University of Naples Federico II,"Deiana, C (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Brussels, Belgium.",claudio.deiana@ec.europa.eu,"Bove, Vincenzo/O-2279-2019; Nisticò, Roberto/O-7522-2019","Nisticò, Roberto/0000-0002-8589-3703; DEIANA, CLAUDIO/0000-0002-2576-9997",,,,,44,23,23,1,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

How is this divided between workers and landowners? Simple models with homogenous labour suggest that it accrues largely- or entirely-in the form of land rents. This article shows that heterogeneity of labour in two main dimensions (productivity differentials and housing demands) radically changes this result. Even a modest amount of heterogeneity can drive the land share of surplus down to two-thirds or lower, as high productivity and/or low housing demand individuals receive large utility gains. It follows that land value appreciation understates the value of urban amenities and infrastructure. In a system of cities the sorting of workers across cities means that, while total rent is highest, the rent share of surplus is lowest in the largest and most productive cities.","[Collier, Paul] Blavatnik Sch Govt, 120 Walton St, Oxford OX2 6GG, England; [Venables, Anthony J.] Dept Econ, 10 Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England",,"Venables, AJ (通讯作者)，Dept Econ, 10 Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",tony.venables@economics.ox.ac.uk,"venables, anthony/JDW-7805-2023","venables, anthony/0000-0003-0251-7479",ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,14,7,7,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Throughout much of the discussion and analysis on the racial wealth gap, however, the assumption that higher education can at least narrow the gap has often been left unquestioned. While education is a factor in increasing incomes and wealth, recent research challenges the narrative that education is the key to reducing the racial wealth gap. Our findings provide further support for this growing literature. While black college graduates do have higher wealth than those without college degrees, the wealth gap with white college graduates remains vast, and the inheritances received by white college-educated households provide a huge boost to wealth that is not available to their black counterparts. Further, we find that black college-educated households are much more likely to provide financial support for their parents as well as their children, and that black households that do provide support across generations do so with much less net wealth than white households that do not.","[Taylor, Joanna] Brandeis Univ, Heller Sch Social Policy & Management, Waltham, MA 02254 USA; [Meschede, Tatjana] Brandeis Univ, Heller Sch, Inst Assets & Social Policy, Waltham, MA 02254 USA",Brandeis University; Brandeis University,"Taylor, J (通讯作者)，Brandeis Univ, Heller Sch Social Policy & Management, Waltham, MA 02254 USA.",jltaylor@brandeis.edu,,"Taylor, Joanna/0009-0004-4246-5241",,,,,34,9,14,1,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

However, that relationship is significantly attenuated by the addition of a few control variables, suggesting that individuals with higher propensities to have mixed-race births are more likely to live in desegregated school districts. We exploit quasi-random variation from court-ordered school desegregation to estimate causal effects of school desegregation on mixed-race childbearing, finding small to moderate effects that are largely statistically insignificant. Because the upward trend across cohorts in mixed-race childbearing was substantial, separating the effects of desegregation plans from secular cohort trends is difficult; results are sensitive to how we specify the cohort trends and to the inclusion of Chicago/Cook County in the sample. The fact that the addition of a few control variables substantially weakens the cross-sectional relationship between lower levels of school segregation and higher rates of mixed-race childbearing suggests that a substantial portion of the observed correlation is likely due to who chooses to live in places with desegregated schools. Researchers should be cautious about interpreting raw correlations between segregation-whether residential or school-and other outcomes as causal. Our results also point to the need to carefully explore specification of cohort effects in quasi-experimental designs for treatments where cumulative exposure is important.","[Gordon, Nora] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Gordon, Nora] NBER, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Reber, Sarah] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Reber, Sarah] NBER, Los Angeles, CA USA",Georgetown University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Gordon, N (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA.;Gordon, N (通讯作者)，NBER, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",neg24@georgetown.edu,,,,,,,55,3,4,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Our focus is on the impact of educational attainment and partisan attachment on the overestimation of one's party's result. Previous research in this field has relied on data gathered in the months before the elections, which introduces a substantial amount of uncertainty and variation over time into the measurements of citizens' vote share estimations. As an alternative, we investigate voters' estimations of their party's electoral success by means of data gathered in an exit poll survey. Our results show partisan attachments to have a strong impact on overestimations, which suggests that a wishful thinking mechanism is in play.

These areas supply four sawmills with logs, which in turn send lumber to the construction market and chips to one paper mill. In particular, three logistics approaches are compared (i.e., Make-to-Order (MTO), Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI), and a centralized planning approach), and key performance factors used (e.g., demand satisfaction and wood fiber freshness), with the goal of optimizing harvesting, storage, transportation, and production operations while improving the competitiveness of this proposed forest products supply chain. Results demonstrate the importance of an effective balance between chips and lumber production to ensure adequate quality of finished products as well as higher profits for the entire supply chain.

With about 22 banks in Nigeria, there has been a major marketing drive by each bank to attract as many customers as possible. As the number of customers grows, however, the banks begin to encounter challenges relating to accommodating huge number of customers in the banking hall as well as attending to their inquiries. Several banks have attempted to respond to these challenges by introducing online service platforms and encouraging their customers to embrace internet banking. Banks have also adopted the use of social media to communicate with their customers. It is, however, not sufficient for banks to see online platforms, particularly social media, as another means to push information at their customers. Social media creates a valuable opportunity for two-way communication in which the customers will feel like an active participant rather than as helpless recipient. This paper, therefore, examined the perception of the customers of the First Bank of Nigeria on how the bank has used online platforms for customer engagement. A sample size of 246 respondents was selected from five branches in the Festac Zone of First Bank, Lagos State. The Findings reveal that the respondents associated the speed of feedback online with their willingness to explore other service packages of the bank. A Spearman's rank-order correlation result also shows that there is a strong and positive relationship between how quickly the bank responded to inquiries online and the respondents' believe that their issues can be resolved. It was recommended that more efforts should be dedicated to building relationships with customers online and that official websites should be made more interactive.","[Amodu, Lanre; Agedah, Dorcas; Oyero, Olusola; Okorie, Nelson] Covenant Univ, Coll Business & Social Sci, Dept Mass Commun, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria",Covenant University,"Amodu, L (通讯作者)，Covenant Univ, Coll Business & Social Sci, Dept Mass Commun, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria.",lanre.amodu@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; agedahd@yahoo.com; olusola.oyero@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; nelson.okorie@covenantuniversity.edu.ng,"Okorie, Nelson/AAZ-8148-2020; Oyero, Olusola/GQA-8578-2022","Oyero, Olusola/0000-0001-7795-5516","Covenant University, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria","Covenant University, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria","We like to acknowledge Covenant University, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria for sponsoring our participation in this conference.",,12,2,2,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,7570,7577,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553208056,0

Nowadays, investment in quality information rather than capital inputs is becoming more and more important for countries to develop and to be able to compete with each other. The increasing speed in the creation and spreading of knowledge has made it a crucial component in economic development. It is a fact that the countries that make large investments in information factors experience a fast and sustainable growth and are the most dynamic and competitive countries in the world. In this paper, we use context dependent DEA to measure the relative efficiency of the European Union (EU) countries', including Turkey, knowledge economy policy based on 2016 data. In addition, we implement factor-specific DEA in order to identify achievable targets in short term for each output of countries. Four outputs and three inputs were used in the analysis. The results showed that Germany is clearly ahead of other countries such as France, England, Malta and the Netherlands. Turkey, on the other hand, separates from other countries and is the least efficient one. The reason for this separation is that Turkey produces less output than expected relative to its facilities. Another conclusion of the paper is that the countries' patent applications and high-tech exports are more inefficient than other knowledge economy outputs.","[Ayan, Tuba Yakici] Karadeniz Tech Univ, Dept Econometr, Kanuni Campus, TR-61000 Trabzon, Turkey; [Pabuccu, Hakan] Bayburt Univ, Dept Business Adm, Dede Korkut Campus, TR-69000 Bayburt, Turkey",Karadeniz Technical University; Bayburt University,"Pabuçcu, H (通讯作者)，Bayburt Univ, Dept Business Adm, Dede Korkut Campus, TR-69000 Bayburt, Turkey.",ayan@ktu.edu.tr; hpabuccu@bayburt.edu.tr,"pabuçcu, hakan/AAH-6964-2019; AYAN, Tuba YAKICI/B-4924-2018",,,,,,30,2,2,0,7,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

This study examined the relationship between tax revenue and industrial development in Nigeria. The study covered the period of 1981 to 2015. Industrial gross domestic product was used as the dependent Variable and Custom and excise duty tax, petroleum profit tax as independent variable. The Autoregressive Distributive Lag (ARDL) model was used in order to determine the long run relationship amongst the variables utilized in this study. Results revealed that tax revenue has a positive effect on industrial development. Also, the F-statistic is greater than the upper bound value which means that there is a long run relationship amongst variables. This therefore concludes that revenue from tax will be very useful in developing the Industrial sector through improvement in technology in order to increase productivity. The study thus recommended that that the government should ensure that the tax system is free from corruption and actual revenue obtained from tax should be declared and channeled to the right sector.","[Edosomwan, Oghogho; Babajide, Abiola; Isibor, Areghan; Jolaade, Ayobami] Covenant Univ, Ota, Nigeria",Covenant University,"Edosomwan, O (通讯作者)，Covenant Univ, Ota, Nigeria.",ogedosomwan@yahoo.com; Abiola.babajide@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; Areghan.isibor@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; Ayobami.jolaade@stu.cu.edu.ng,"Isibor, Areghan/A-9351-2018","Isibor, Areghan/0000-0002-4989-3458",,,,,29,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,5125,5139,,,,,,15,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553206013,0

Scholars have failed to account for Dewey's support of George. Some have argued that it should not be taken seriously because it is at odds with their interpretation of Dewey's philosophy. This article demonstrates that Dewey perceived the socialization of land values as an essential step toward creating a true democracy. Furthermore, Dewey's interest in George was not an aberration; it was exemplary of his faith in ideology, theory, and transformative social policy. Despite contentions to the contrary, pragmatists of the early 20(th) century never emphasized skepticism, moderation, or rote empiricism. In fact, Dewey embraced the philosophy of Henry George as a general theory of history of society.

The sample size were varied from small to large samples, while the length test were short tests (20 items) and long tests (> 20 items). The results showed that 1) sample size had an effect on the stability of the item parameters, where the increasing of the sample size impact on the raise of item parameter estimation, 2) the test length effect on the stability of the ability parameters, the rise of number of items effect on the increases of ability parameter estimation. Rasch models (1-PL IRT) can be applied by the teacher in conducting classroom assessment with test length 20 and has sufficient reliability.","[Friyatmi] Univ Negeri Padang, Padang, Indonesia; [Mardapi, Djemari; Haryanto] Univ Negeri Yogyakarta, Yogyakarta, Indonesia",Universitas Negeri Padang; Universitas Negeri Yogyakarta,"Friyatmi (通讯作者)，Univ Negeri Padang, Padang, Indonesia.",friyatmi@fe.unp.ac.id; djemari@uny.ac.id; haryanto.@uny.ac.id,"Friyatmi, Friyatmi/ACI-0881-2022; Haryanto, Haryanto/GZM-9031-2022","Friyatmi, Friyatmi/0000-0001-7361-233X;",,,,,22,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-703-4,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,64,,,,,,317,325,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9GP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470910100037,0

The NTOs of the top ten most successful countries according to the number of international tourists in 2016 were selected as a research sample for analysis of the way, intensity and effectivity of the social media use in the destination marketing. The social media selected for above-mentioned analyses were Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Flickr, Instagram, Pinterest, Google+ and Snapchat. The data collected for the analysis were publicly available data found on the NTO websites and in their social media accounts. The quantitative features of these NTO accounts (number of fans, number of their contributions, number of subscribers' responses), their management (especially the response to user contributions and inclusion of users of generated content) and the concept and focus of contributions generated by the NTO were evaluated and mutually compared. The analysis of the social media use by the NTOs of the ten selected countries has pointed out the importance of the social media role in their destination marketing. The selected NTOs use predominantly Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram accounts, but only a few of them perform high quality management of these accounts. British, Italian and Mexican NTOs use the social media most, while Thailand and Turkey NTOs use them least. In addition to YouTube and Facebook, Instagram has shown a great potential for the systematic destination marketing exercised by the NTOs, as it has a significant advantage over still yet dominant Facebook in the posting view for all subscribers.","[Hruska, Jan] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Dept Econ, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic; [Paskova, Martina] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Dept Recreol & Tourism, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic",University of Hradec Kralove; University of Hradec Kralove,"Hruska, J (通讯作者)，Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Dept Econ, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.",jan.hruska.3@uhk.cz; martina.paskova@uhk.cz,"Paskova, Martina/X-5161-2018","Paskova, Martina/0000-0002-9022-6374",Specific Research Project Information and Knowledge Management and Cognitive Science in Tourism of FIM UHK,Specific Research Project Information and Knowledge Management and Cognitive Science in Tourism of FIM UHK,The financial support of the Specific Research Project Information and Knowledge Management and Cognitive Science in Tourism of FIM UHK is gratefully acknowledged.,,67,5,6,6,46,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The findings revealed how positive image on a destination become stronger or weaker due to marketing mix attributes experienced by the visiting tourist. The strong image (on uniqueness, pleasant, price attributes, etc.) produces high perceived values of the destinations. In opposite, less positive or even negative image (on cleanness, available facility, safety, etc.) make low perceived values of the destinations. In case the local governments and related stakeholders do not improve the facility conditions, cleanness, and road safety of those five thematic tourism destinations, the tourist's images on Sukabumi tourism destinations can fade away or eroded in competing with another region.

Therefore, managers need to have at their disposal appropriate assessment tools which assist them in their decisions about the development of the new product and guarantee that their product will generate a desirable profit. The purpose of this review focuses on the exploration of the methodology, commonly used in the economic evaluation as part of health technology assessment for medical devices. On the basis of the selected original studies, the authors summarize the main methods used in the decision-making processes about the development of new medical devices and discuss their benefits and limitations. The methods employed in this study include a method of literature search in the databases Web of Science, MEDLINE, and Embase, and a method of comparison and evaluation of the results. The findings of this study indicate that the most preferred methods used in the economic evaluations of medical device development are cost-utility analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis. In addition, the Headroom Method is recommended to be used in the early assessment of the medical device development since it uses broader estimates of potential by determining the maximum reimbursable price of the new device. Selection of each method then depends on the research question, the condition of interest, and the availability of data on outcomes. There is an urgent need to conduct the early assessment of the medical device development in order to avoid negatively high costs and prevent a failure rate at each stage of the development process.","[Klimova, Blanka] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Dept Appl Linguist, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic; [Maresova, Petra] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Dept Econ, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic",University of Hradec Kralove; University of Hradec Kralove,"Klimová, B (通讯作者)，Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Dept Appl Linguist, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.",blanka.klimova@uhk.cz; petra.maresova@uhk.cz,"Maresova, Petra/L-1743-2017; Klimova, Blanka/F-7016-2019","Maresova, Petra/0000-0002-1218-501X; Klimova, Blanka/0000-0001-8000-9766",The Czech Science Foundation (GACR) [17-03037S (15330/16/AGR)],The Czech Science Foundation (GACR),"This study was supported by the research project The Czech Science Foundation (GACR) 2017 No. 17-03037S (15330/16/AGR) Investment evaluation of medical device development, run at the Faculty of Informatics and Management, University of Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic",,49,3,3,2,17,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

We employ the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to compute the efficiency of Takaful operators, while Panzar-Rosse (P-R) H-statistic method is used to evaluate the degree of competition. The findings indicate that the inefficiency in Takaful's operations is affected by the scale of operations but not by inefficiency in managerial practice. Actuaries need to pay attention to estimating provisions for outstanding claims, as this factor is negatively influencing the efficiency of Takaful insurance. Additionally, the managers are cautioned not to overspend on commissions paid to the agents because this will reduce the profit of the Takaful operators. The findings to a very large extent indicate that improvement in efficiency will increase the entry of a more viable competitor to participate in the Takaful industry. The regulators need to implement prudent monitoring of the operations of Takaful insurers because improvements in efficiency will make Takaful operators more competitive. The implications further shed light on the motivation for insurance firms to improve efficiency that enable them to charge lower price to enhance competition which may benefit both the firms and customers.","[Lee, Hui Shan] Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Fac Accountancy & Management, Selangor, Malaysia; [Lee, Hui Shan; Cheng, Fan Fah; Nassir, Annuar Md; Ab Razak, Nazrul Hisyam] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management, Serdang, Malaysia",Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR); Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Lee, HS (通讯作者)，Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Fac Accountancy & Management, Selangor, Malaysia.;Lee, HS (通讯作者)，Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management, Serdang, Malaysia.",hslee@utar.edu.my,"Lee, Hui Shan/M-2326-2019; Cheng, Fan/JXX-8930-2024","LEE, HUI SHAN/0000-0003-1017-3434",Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education [FRGS/1/2017/SS01/UTAR/03/1]; Geran Universiti Putra Malaysia [GP-IPS/2016/9508700]; Universiti Putra Malaysia Journal Publication Fund,Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education; Geran Universiti Putra Malaysia; Universiti Putra Malaysia Journal Publication Fund,This work was supported by the Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education under Grant [FRGS/1/2017/SS01/UTAR/03/1]; Geran Universiti Putra Malaysia under Grant [GP-IPS/2016/9508700]; Universiti Putra Malaysia Journal Publication Fund.,,32,6,7,1,14,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The symptoms of depressive disorders affect four spheres of human functioning: emotional, behavioural/motivational, physica/somatic and cognitive. Physical activity may be one of multiple therapies for improvement, maintenance and development of cognitive functions. The research aim was to evaluate the effect of group aerobic exercises, strength physical exercises and active video games impact on cognitive functions of depressed patients. Research involved participants with depression who were divided into the experimental (n = 39) and control (n = 13) groups. Twelve exercise sessions were applied for the experimental groups (group aerobic physical exercises, strength physical exercises and active video games). After physical activity sessions, subjectively evaluated mood improved statistically significantly (p<0.05). In the experimental group, the best results were in group aerobic exercises - reaction time in cognitive tests after exercising improved statistically significantly (p < 0.05), faster than the control group, but changes in the mean of correct responses were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Strength physical exercises showed improvement only in the tests of simple reaction time and mathematical processing (p<0,05). Active video games showed no statistically significant changes in cognitive performance (p>0,05). Physical activity training sessions improved the cognitive functions of depressed patients, which clearly demonstrates the benefits of physical activity to work productivity.

First identified as a promising antimalarial by the US Army in the 1970s, tafenoquine has recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the radical cure of vivax malaria - the first product to receive marketing authorization for this indication in more than 65 years. The new drug is the result of a collaboration between the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline and the not-for-profit organization Medicines for Malaria Venture, with the financial support of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The successful development of tafenoquine, the paper argues, signals an important transition within the global health era: from the chemotherapeutic humanitarianism that characterized pharmaceutical efforts against malaria in the early 2000s, towards a period of drug discovery driven by the promise of global disease eradication. The paper uses the example of tafenoquine to advance a more general argument about the multiple and evolving pharmaceutical conjugations of malaria - the articulation of competing visions of the disease around the capabilities (and limitations) of particular molecules.","[Lezaun, Javier] Univ Oxford, Inst Sci Innovat & Soc, Sch Anthropol & Museum Ethnog, 64 Banbury Rd, Oxford OX2 6PN, England",University of Oxford,"Lezaun, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Inst Sci Innovat & Soc, Sch Anthropol & Museum Ethnog, 64 Banbury Rd, Oxford OX2 6PN, England.",javier.lezaun@insis.ox.ac.uk,,,European Research Council under the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme [263447]; European Research Council (ERC) [263447] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council under the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme(European Union (EU)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),This research was supported by the European Research Council under the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (grant agreement no. 263447: BioProperty).,,43,7,8,1,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

However, it remains uncertain how the road infrastructure interacts with the local economic systems. Prior studies demonstrated that associations between the road infrastructure and local development were case-specific to some extent, and even contradictory conclusions could be generated. Simple quantitative or qualitative analysis, therefore, cannot effectively reveal complex interactions. This paper first proposes a conceptual model to theorize a transport-region economic relationship and then applies structural equation modeling (SEM) to explore the relationships between the road infrastructure and local economy, as well as the mediating factors. Using statistical data from 2005 to 2012, SEM models are established for two typical regions with different development levels in China: the Jiang-Zhe-Hu region (highly developed) and the Yun-Gui-Chuan region (less developed). This econometric approach, which emphasizes the economic mechanisms, confirms the efficiency of the SEM in this study. The results show that these two regions differ greatly in mediators for the influence of the road infrastructure on the local economy. The road infrastructure influences the local economy largely by attracting overseas investments and promoting real estate development in the Jiang-Zhe-Hu region. In the Yun-Gui-Chuan region, the road infrastructure impacts the local economy primarily by stimulating market openness. Such results confirm the hypothesis that the pathway for the influence of the road infrastructure on the local economy should vary with regions with different development levels. This paper is believed to provide new insights into transport-region research.","[Li, Hongbo; Liu, Yali; Peng, Kaili] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Publ Adm, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yali] Huazhong Agr Univ, Dept Infrastruct Construct, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yali] Yunnan Univ, Sch Business Adm & Tourism Management, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China",Huazhong Agricultural University; Huazhong Agricultural University; Yunnan University,"Li, HB; Liu, YL (通讯作者)，1 Shizishan St, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China.",lihb20132013@163.com; yalliu@tom.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [41261043]; Huazhong Agricultural University Scientific & Technological Self-innovation Foundation [2016RC014],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Huazhong Agricultural University Scientific & Technological Self-innovation Foundation,We thank Editor Xiaowen Fu and anonymous reviewers for providing constructive comments.

Namely, global financial crisis has shown that large and volatile capital flows can pose risks, especially, for small and open economies. In this paper we are particularly interested to analyse the vulnerability of capital flows in country with limited monetary policy. We are focused on Montenegro, the country that unilaterally adopted euro in 2002 and regained independence in 2006. Since then, Montenegro has become very attractive for investments and has received significant amounts of foreign capital. Thus, in this paper we are assessing how global shocks could be dangerous for such a small open economy. In addition, we are interested in investigating whether domestic factors can influence capital flows due to the full euroization. In order to answer these questions, we have applied structural vector autoregressive model of the determinants of two main components of capital flows, foreign direct investments and portfolio investments separately, using quarterly data from 2005 to 2017. We provide evidence that mainly push factors, such as foreign output, interest rates and euro area risk sentiment, significantly explain the variation of capital flows. Furthermore, domestic factors are found to play little role for capital flow developments in Montenegro.","[Lipovina-Bozovic, Milena] Univ Montenegro, Fac Econ, Jovana Tomasevica 37, Podgorica 81000, Montenegro; [Lipovina-Bozovic, Milena] Cent Bank Montenegro, Dept Financial Stabil Res & Stat, Bulevar Sv Petra Cetinjskog Br 6, Podgorica 81000, Montenegro",University of Montenegro; Central Bank of Montenegro,"Lipovina-Bozovic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Montenegro, Fac Econ, Jovana Tomasevica 37, Podgorica 81000, Montenegro.;Lipovina-Bozovic, M (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Montenegro, Dept Financial Stabil Res & Stat, Bulevar Sv Petra Cetinjskog Br 6, Podgorica 81000, Montenegro.",milena@ac.me; maja.ivanovic@cbcg.me,,,,,,,46,1,1,0,4,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

According to the provisions of Article 3 d) from the Government Decision No. 611/2008 for the approval of the rules concerning the organization and development of the civil servants' career, the evaluation of individual professional performances consists of the entirety of processes and procedures implemented annually, by applying the performance criteria to the degree of fulfilling the individual professional objectives established, based on the duties provided in the job description. Throughout the article we will refer to the criteria taken into account for the performance evaluation, the categories of civil servants who have the competence to evaluate, the evaluation results and the procedure of appeal for the evaluation report. As concerns the procedure of appeal for the individual evaluation report, we will also analyze some decisions of the Romanian courts in this matter. An efficient administrative system, that would rise to the standards imposed by the European Union and respond adequately to the needs of the public service beneficiaries can properly function only through a body of competent civil servants with excellent skills and professionalism. The availability and monitoring of such a level of performance can be achieved both by the results obtained by the Romanian public institutions and by evaluating the performance of civil servants and promoting them on the basis of transparent and objective criteria.

It argues that chains of intermediaries transform fixed, illiquid parcels of land into financial assets open to mobile capital. By investigating how such chains are made, it highlights the agency of the actors who build them. Yet, an examination of the fund's failure in the aftermath of the 2008 credit crisis demonstrates that the intermediaries that capitalists rely on in order to make liquidity possible can actually generate risks and slow transactions, contributing to illiquidity. Thus, to understand the financialization of urban production, we must take into account the ways in which such contradictions of mediation shape dynamics of spatial fixity and capital mobility.","[Searle, Llerena Guiu] Univ Rochester, Dept Anthropol, POB 270161, Rochester, NY 14627 USA",University of Rochester,"Searle, LG (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Dept Anthropol, POB 270161, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",llerena.searle@rochester.edu,,,"University of Rochester; American Institute of Indian Studies, Williams College","University of Rochester; American Institute of Indian Studies, Williams College","This work was supported by the American Institute of Indian Studies, Williams College and the University of Rochester.",,82,20,20,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Feedback for learning is a key component of formative assessment, in a sense that the success or failure of such assessment depends considerably on how the feedback is provided and students' use of feedback. Present study evidences that regular feedback on students' learning leads to considerable gains. Peer assessment is an educational procedure in which students are assigned tasks to act as both reviewers and authors, evaluating the work of their fellow students. In a comprehensive literature review provided bellow on assessment and classroom learning. Psychology as a discipline can exert a direct influence on teachers and researchers. Benefits for assessors and assesses can be categorized into benefits related to knowledge, skills, attitude, performance and behaviour. Knowledge sharing is of great interest of students because it improves performance, promotes learning, and innovation. As every student owes different psychological thinking patters, explaining human behavior in all its complexity is a difficult task. The behavioural beliefs produce a favourable or unfavourable attitude toward other and improvise behavioural control. Through this study, it can be urged that students behaviour for knowledge sharing can be controlled through sophisticated technological development like peer assessment with the help of online assessment tools. For that purpose, peer assessment process need timely changes to become easier for students.","[Soomro, Mansoor Mumtaz; Wang, Yanqing] Harbin Inst Technol, Harbin, Peoples R China; [Buriro, Niaz Hussain] Shah Abdul Latif Univ, Qambar Shahdadkot, Pakistan; [Kalhoro, Maryam] Univ Sindh Campus, Larkana, Pakistan; [Kalhoro, Shadab] Univ Sufism, Bhitt Shah, Pakistan",Harbin Institute of Technology,"Soomro, MM (通讯作者)，Harbin Inst Technol, Harbin, Peoples R China.",mansoorsmro@gmail.com; Yanqing@hit.edu.cn; niazburiro01@gmail.com; Koonjabbasi@gmail.com; shadabkalhoro@hotmail.com,"Kalhoro, Shadab/GQI-1357-2022; Wang, Yanqing/B-4363-2015","Wang, Yanqing/0000-0002-5961-0482",,,,,50,0,0,1,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,4558,4565,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553205060,0

A well-known consequence for US antitrust of their scholarship was for greater determinations of legality through the ad hoc, conduct-specific analysis of the rule of reason standard, inspiring advocacy for a similarly more economic approach to EU competition law. But although supporting the substantive economic outcomes of overturning rules of per se illegality, Bork, Posner, Easterbrook, and other Chicagoans routinely and consistently rejected this form of market intervention for determining legality. Rather than ex post effects-based analysis, the Chicagoan approach was to incorporate economics ex ante into the design of generalized norms (rules, presumptions, structured tests) to thereby foster legal certainty and administrability, virtues associated with the formal rule of law. The overlooked importance of the formal rule of law ideal can be discerned from Bork and Easterbrook's antitrust writing, Posner's economic analysis of law, and even traced back to the foundational scholarship of the Chicago School of economics. Reemphasizing the importance of legal form in Chicagoan writing challenges their common contemporary portrayal, supporters of a particular version of more economic European enforcement, and the supposedly neo-Chicago approach.","[Stones, Ryan R.] City Univ London, Law, London, England",City University London,"Stones, RR (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Law, London, England.",Ryan.Stones@city.ac.uk,,"Stones, Ryan/0000-0003-4422-181X",LSE,LSE,"This article is drawn from my PhD thesis undertaken at the London School of Economics and Political Science.

Based on observations and interviews with teacher of the Crafts and Entrepreneurship Subject, students are less interested or motivated when they did a group task as there were only a few active students in the learning process, while most of the students were late in submitting the tasks given to them and their learning outcome is still under the minimum passing grade. In order to solve the aforementioned problem, the teacher may use an interesting learning model strategy such as Two Stay Two Stray (TSTS) and Co-op Co-op learning model. The goal of this research was to describe the implementation of TSTS dan Co-op Co-op learning model, the students' learning outcome seen from the cognitive domain after the implementation of TSTS dan Co-op Co-op learning model of Crafts and Entrepreneurship subject. The implementation was conducted in 2 cycles in which each cycle consists of 2 meetings. Also, it was conducted by using 4 steps: planning, implementation, observation, and reflection. The data collection techniques used are observation, test, field note, and documentation. The data analysis techniques in this research used 3 steps: data reduction, data display, and conclusion drawing. The research results showed that the success percentage of teacher activity to the TSTS and Co-op Co-op learning model implementation in cycle I was 86,7% which improved by 7,73% to be 94,43% in the cycle II. The students' learning outcome towards cognitive domain improved seen from the average score of the cycle I for 69,92 that improved to be 72,85 in the cycle II. The percentage of learning completeness was 60,76% in the cycle I and improved to be 72,44% in the cycle II and had fulfilled the minimum passing grade. One of the constraints occurred in the implementation of TSTS dan Co-op Co-op learning model is that students are not accustomed to giving questions, and arguments when discussing in front of the classroom and preferably the teacher needs to verify the chances of each group in preparing questions for the group in front of the class.","[Wardana, Ludi Wishnu] Univ Negeri Malang, Fac Econ, Dept Management, Malang, Indonesia; [Setyani, Ratna] Univ Negeri Malang, Program Management Educ, Malang, Indonesia; [Harwida, Gleydis] Univ Negeri Malang, Program Business & Management Educ, Malang, Indonesia",Universitas Negeri Malang; Universitas Negeri Malang; Universitas Negeri Malang,"Wardana, LW (通讯作者)，Univ Negeri Malang, Fac Econ, Dept Management, Malang, Indonesia.",ludi.wishnu.fe@um.ac.id,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,1,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2518-668X,,,KNE SOC SCI,,,2018,,,,,,,140,149,,10.18502/kss.v3i3.1880,0.0,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM5LX,,gold,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000465229600011,0

This makes it difficult for consumers to find out which product fits their needs best, or which one is the cheapest. Why is there no convergence toward common ways to present products? Is it possible for firms to maintain high prices by confusing consumers? We run a market experiment to investigate those questions. In our market, firms choose how to present their products in addition to choosing their price. We find that firms maintain different ways to present their products and that this allows them to maintain high prices. This behavior is not consistent with competitive behavior, such as when firms adopt best responses to each other, imitate the most successful firm, or learn the best strategy over time. Rather, our results are only consistent with cooperation between firms. Firms cooperate by not imitating the way other firms present their products. Cooperation is maintained by the threat of tough competition if a firm makes its product easy to compare with others. Firms are all the more likely to maintain such cooperation if their products do not actually differ much. This is because in that case, maintaining differences in the presentation of their products is the only way to maintain profits.","[Crosetto, Paolo] Univ Grenoble Alpes, GAEL, INRA, CNRS,Grenoble INP, Grenoble, France; [Gaudeul, Alexia] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Chair Microecon, Gottingen, Germany",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); INRAE; Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble; University of Gottingen,"Crosetto, P (通讯作者)，Univ Grenoble Alpes, GAEL, INRA, CNRS,Grenoble INP, Grenoble, France.",paolo.crosetto@inra.fr; alexia.gaudeul@wiwi.uni-goettingen.de,"Gaudeul, Alexia/B-7556-2015; Crosetto, Paolo/M-1304-2019","Gaudeul, Alexia/0000-0003-3397-4234;",Max Planck Institute of Economics in Jena,Max Planck Institute of Economics in Jena,"This research was funded by the Max Planck Institute of Economics in Jena and was presented at the University of Rennes, France, at the 2014 workshop on Industrial Organization: Theory, Empirics and Experiments in Alberobello, Italy, at the 2014 ESA European meeting in Prague, Czech Republic, at the 2015 Maastricht Behavioral and Experimental Economics Symposium in Maastricht, Netherlands, at the 2016 conference of the EARIE in Lisbon, Portugal, and at the 2016 Annual Conference of the Verein fur Socialpolitik in Augsburg, Germany.

We evaluate the MPS efficiency for forest conservation by framed field experiments in Nepal. Forestland demands are elicited from farmers, with which the experiments are carried out. The novelty lies in instituting a uniform price auction (UPA) under trader settings and in identifying the MPS efficiency for forest conservation in the field of developing nations. The results suggest that farmers with limited education understand UPA rules, reveal their forestland valuations and that the MPS is effective with 80% of efficiency.

Despite the apparent initial success of the policy, locally called pico y placa, the problems of congestion and pollution have re-emerged over time. In response, local authorities are considering removing this driving restriction and replacing it with a congestion charge policy, also known as road pricing. To evaluate the impact of the policy implementation on drivers' behaviour, we estimated a hybrid choice model including latent variables. The model was used to analyse the influence of congestion charging policy factors such as tolls and schedules on the modal split during the morning peak hour. The elasticities analysis shows a high tendency of car drivers to change their departure time to avoid paying the toll. A suggested charge of COP 6000 (USD 3.33) and a more extensive charging schedule compared to the current pico y placa schedule reduces the car market share by about 37% which is similar to the car use reduction generated by a two-digit pico y placa policy in the short term.","[Ramos, Raul; Cantillo, Victor; Arellana, Julian] Univ Norte, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Kilometro 5 Antigua Via Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia; [Ramos, Raul] Monteria Ciudad Amable SAS, Strateg Publ Transport Syst Monteria, Carrera 4a 49-110 Villa Rio, Monteria, Colombia; [Sarmiento, Ivan] Univ Nacl Colombia, Dept Civil Engn, Sede Medellin, Colombia",Universidad del Norte Colombia; Universidad Nacional de Colombia,"Cantillo, V (通讯作者)，Univ Norte, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Kilometro 5 Antigua Via Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia.",arramos@uninorte.edu.co; victor.cantillo@uninorte.edu.co; jarellana@uninorte.edu.co; irsarmie@unal.edu.co,"Ramos, Raúl/JBI-9598-2023; Cantillo, Victor/AAC-6403-2021; Arellana, Julian/T-2355-2019","Ramos, Raúl/0000-0003-0463-576X; Cantillo, Victor/0000-0003-1184-2580; Arellana, Julian/0000-0001-7834-5541; Sarmiento Ordosgoitia, Ivan Reinaldo/0000-0001-7287-4573",,,,,60,33,37,2,39,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

A major goal for government and port enterprises alike is the achievement of both effective environmental protection and opdrational efficiency. Therefore, environmental factors should be considered when evaluating port efficiency. However, most of the available data envelopment analysis (DEA) models that have been used in previous studies enable each decision-making unit (DMU) to choose its favorite weight-combination with a rather careless approach. This may have caused some DMUs with very good economic indexes but very poor environmental indexes to be evaluated as fully efficient. This paper proposes a non-radial DEA preference model, based on the assumption of variable returns to scale (VRS) and the Directional Distance Function (DDF). The proposed model has been used to evaluate and analyze the efficiency of Chinese-listed port enterprises. The efficiency results showed the average efficiency to be low for all ports when environmental factors are considered. The regression results show that port assets, berth quantity, and the geographical location can significantly impact the environmental performance of Chinese port enterprises. This study also classified all ports into four categories, based on throughput and efficiency. Recommendations for the implementation for improvements of different environmental policies have been made for the individual ports in each category based on the actual situation of each port.","[Sun, Jiasen; Yuan, Yang; Yang, Rui] Soochow Univ, Dongwu Business Sch, Res Ctr Smarter Supply Chain, Suzhou 215021, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Ji, Xiang; Wu, Jie] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Management, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China","Soochow University - China; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS","Ji, X (通讯作者)，Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Management, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China.",jiasen@mail.ustc.edu.cn; yuanyangxiao@foxmail.com; ryang@suda.edu.cn; signji@mail.ustc.edu.cn; jacky012@mail.ustc.edu.cn,"yang, rui/JJC-2996-2023; Sun, Jiasen/JZD-3473-2024",,"National Natural Science Funds of China [71501139, 71402111, 71571173]; Natural Science Funds of Jiangsu Province [BK20150307]; Research project of philosophy and Social Sciences in Universities of Jiangsu [2015SJB525]",National Natural Science Funds of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Funds of Jiangsu Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province); Research project of philosophy and Social Sciences in Universities of Jiangsu,"The authors would like to thank the financial supports from National Natural Science Funds of China (Nos. 71501139 and 71402111), Natural Science Funds of Jiangsu Province (No. BK20150307), and Research project of philosophy and Social Sciences in Universities of Jiangsu (2015SJB525).

In the case of China, the oldest continuous civilization in the world, the criminal justice system contains ancient traditions that are still influential. The cosmological tradition, which has the longest history, treated nature as the victim when human actions violated social norms. Thus, harsh punishments were imposed that rigidly mimicked violent aspects of nature: if the victim died, even by accident, someone must die to balance the harm caused to nature. The Confucian tradition developed a competing natural philosophy that tempered punishment by restoring social and natural order through moral education about proper behavior. Confucianism was designed to maintain civility in the absence of central authority by persuading leaders to create a harmonious society based on the limited use of raw power and punishment. Finally, the Legalist tradition restored harsh punishment as a way to impose order upon a fragmented society in which local despots had been carrying out arbitrary judgments. But Legalism carried the seeds of its own destruction and required Confucianism to balance it in creating a durable system of governance and justice. Each tradition developed as a way of solving a specific set of social and political problems, and each persisted as a partial solution to perennial questions about how to deal with social disorder. Even though criminal justice in China was Westernized after 1911, the older traditions still have an influence. Socialism has modified traditions of crime and punishment to some extent, but the overriding concern for social order and the ability of the state to guide society has not diminished.","[Zhang, Xiuhua] China Univ Polit Sci & Law CUPL, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiuhua] CUPL, Res Ctr Proc Marxism & Philosophy Praxis, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yao, Tianyu; Xu, Wenjun; Zhai, Yujia] CUPL, Beijing, Peoples R China",China University of Political Science & Law; China University of Political Science & Law; China University of Political Science & Law,"Zhang, XH (通讯作者)，China Univ Polit Sci & Law CUPL, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Zhang, XH (通讯作者)，CUPL, Res Ctr Proc Marxism & Philosophy Praxis, Beijing, Peoples R China.",xiuhuaz@cupl.edu.cn,"zhang, Xiuhua/R-9172-2016",,Beijing Philosophy and Social Science Project on Comparative Research of the Philosophies of Marx and Whitehead [13XXB001],Beijing Philosophy and Social Science Project on Comparative Research of the Philosophies of Marx and Whitehead,"This article is a result of work conducted by two institutions: the Center for Synergy in Innovation on the Theory of the Characteristics of Chinese Socialism (China University of Political Science and Law, in Beijing), and the Beijing Philosophy and Social Science Project on Comparative Research of the Philosophies of Marx and Whitehead (13XXB001).

Based on the 10th survey of the corporate bank Unicredit-Capitalia, I construct an unbalanced panel data of 19,635 firms. As in Cainelli, Ganau and Iacobucci, I compute related variety as a measure of the input-output relationships between firms of different sectors: this procedure allows taking into account the vertical related variety as a proxy for diversification. The results of the econometric analysis, conducted with multinomial logistic regressions, show that vertically related variety and productivity positively influence both export and FDI strategies. The extant literature on firm heterogeneity has been confirmed, while important findings on local externalities enrich the already existing theories.","[Burlina, Chiara] Univ Padua, Dept Econ & Management Marco Fanno, Via Santo 33, Padua, Italy",University of Padua,"Burlina, C (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dept Econ & Management Marco Fanno, Via Santo 33, Padua, Italy.",chiara.burlina@studenti.unipd.it,"Burlina, Chiara/AAL-3797-2020; Burlina, Chiara/V-1423-2019","Burlina, Chiara/0000-0002-1914-8772;",,,,,40,0,0,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

It is motivated by current public sector austerity requiring local authorities to provide efficient highway functions both in terms of learning from best practice (economic efficiency) and potential reorganisation to exploit economies of scale (scale efficiency). The analysis utilises a road condition measure and an end user (public) satisfaction indicator as well as road length and traffic factors. The availability of public satisfaction data is particularly important as incorporation of such a measure into benchmarking is currently in its infancy in economic regulation but is increasing in prominence, such as in regulation of health care. Evidence is found for an optimal road length which has implications for the current trend to merge the delivery of highways services across local authorities. Bigger is not necessarily better. A positive relationship is found between public satisfaction and cost which is strongest for very low or high public satisfaction. Finally, the median cost efficiency is 83% which implies many authorities have the opportunity to save substantial sums by adopting best practice without reducing service quality.","[Wheat, Phill] Univ Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Wheat, P (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",p.e.wheat@its.leeds.ac.uk,,,Highways Maintenance Efficiency Programme (HMEP),Highways Maintenance Efficiency Programme (HMEP),The author acknowledges funding from the Highways Maintenance Efficiency Programme (HMEP) to support this work.,,54,13,13,0,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

Such tariffs, known as border carbon adjustments (BCAs), can also help reduce possible carbon leakage, or the growth in foreign emissions due to increased production of carbon-intensive goods in non-carbon-restricting countries. We demonstrate that BCAs that do not exceed the burdens imposed by carbon taxation on domestic like products could be consistent with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. However, neutral (i.e., nondiscriminatory) BCAs might still be inefficiently high from a global welfare perspective. This stems from the misaligned focus of BCAs on imports rather than production-the real cause of emissions. The discrepancy between neutrality and efficiency enables carbon-restricted industries to seek inefficiently high BCAs. Recognition of this discrepancy strengthens the case for multilateral alternatives that curb global carbon emissions.","[Colares, Juscelino F.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Law, 11075 East Blvd, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Colares, Juscelino F.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 11075 East Blvd, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Rode, Ashwin] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Rode, Ashwin] Univ Chicago, Energy Policy Inst Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University; University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University; University of Chicago; University of Chicago,"Colares, JF (通讯作者)，Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Law, 11075 East Blvd, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",colares@case.edu,"郭, 青霞/GZH-2618-2022",,,,,,42,2,2,3,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1465-7252,1465-7260,,AM LAW ECON REV,Am.

We draw on a novel dataset on the duration of commercial disputes in Slovenia to study how the timing of settlement is shaped by the stages and features of the litigation process. Using competing risk regression analysis, we find that events such as court-annexed mediation and the first court session, which enable the disputing parties to refine their respective expectations about the case outcome, in general reduce case duration to settlement. The magnitude of the respective effects, however, varies with time. Completion of subsequent court sessions, in contrast, does not affect the time to settlement. Judicial workload affects the timing of settlement indirectly, via the effect on the timing of the first court session.

Whilst newer methods to estimate the potential for agglomeration impacts in an imperfectly competitive world have become more mainstream there is still a desire to be able to capture more robustly the even more transformational impacts that are often claimed to result from major projects. This paper reviews some of these approaches and discusses how they have been used in some projects in the United Kingdom. It concludes that there is still scope for further improvement but that the desire of policy makers for precise estimates may have to be modified. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Orthogonal polynomials have been widely used in technical fields and there have also been applications in mortality modeling. In this paper we adopt a flexible functional form approach using two-dimensional Legendre orthogonal polynomials to fit and forecast mortality rates. Unlike some of the existing mortality models in the literature, the model we propose does not impose any restrictions on the age, time or cohort structure of the data and thus allows for different model designs for different countries' mortality experience. We conduct an empirical study using male mortality data from a range of developed countries and explore the possibility of using age-time effects to capture cohort effects in the underlying mortality data. It is found that, for some countries, cohort dummies still need to be incorporated into the model. Moreover, when comparing the proposed model with well-known mortality models in the literature, we find that our model provides comparable fitting but with a much smaller number of parameters. Based on 5-year-ahead mortality forecasts, it can be concluded that the proposed model improves the overall accuracy of the future mortality projection.

The identification of such industries allows for economic structure adjustment resulting in a higher gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate. Aim: The aim of the study is to identify Senegalese long-term revealed comparative advantages and to estimate Senegalese latent comparative advantages. The analysis is focused solely on manufacturing industries because industrialisation serves as an engine of growth in developing countries. Setting: The analysis is carried out on endowment structure and international trade data (1995-2015) of Senegal and appropriate comparator economies (Tanzania, Cambodia, Lao, Vietnam and Cape Verde). Methods: To identify revealed comparative advantages, we calculate the normalised revealed comparative advantage index. To estimate latent comparative advantages, we employ a growth identification and facilitation framework. The methodology is slightly modified because the estimation is based on long- term revealed comparative advantages comparisons (rather than export shares comparisons). Results: We argue that the relatively productive manufacturing industries (with revealed comparative advantage) include chemicals and manufactured goods classified chiefly by various materials. Furthermore, Senegal may have unexploited potential (i.e. latent comparative advantage) in footwear and particularly in apparel production. Conclusion: In order to accelerate GDP growth rate, Senegal should focus on developing the above mentioned industries to align its economic structure with the comparative advantages and also to promote industrialisation.","[Sejkora, Jiri; Sankot, Ondrej] Univ Econ, Dept World Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Sejkora, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Dept World Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",jiri.sejkora@vse.cz,,,IGA project: The impact of growing global middle class on selected developing and developed regions [F2/47/2016],IGA project: The impact of growing global middle class on selected developing and developed regions,"This article was created with the support of the IGA project: The impact of growing global middle class on selected developing and developed regions, No. F2/47/2016.

Versioning in the Market for Second-hand Video Game Software",MANAGERIAL AND DECISION ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,INFORMATION GOODS; NETWORK EXTERNALITIES; PRICE INDEXES,"Information goods are characterised by high fixed costs and low marginal costs of production. A potentially effective strategy that can be adopted by firms operating in such markets is versioning, whereby various features are added or subtracted from a number of distinct versions of the good. This effectively serves as a means of second-degree price discrimination designed to extract prices closer to the maximum willingness to pay from different groups of consumers. This study tests the effectiveness of versioning as a means of exploiting differences in willingness to pay in second-hand markets for information goods by undertaking the first hedonic price analysis of video gaming software. The empirical evidence presented in this paper is based on the analysis of an extensive cross-sectional dataset consisting of over 5000 observations of pre-owned video game prices in the USA. Controls are introduced for a variety of other observable characteristics, including the quality of the game-play experience, the publisher, genre and theme of the game. The results are consistent with theoretical expectations and demonstrate that significant variations in willingness to pay can be exploited through the strategic use of versioning. The practice is therefore argued to represent an effective means by which firms in these markets can enhance revenues.

Sweden applies a time-based infrastructure charge, and has done so since the 1990ies. Germany has introduced distance-based charges and subsidized the purchase of low emission trucks. We find that the German road freight policy has resulted in substantially larger revenues and a cleaner truck fleet and mileage. Some support is found for that the German policy causes spill overs to the neighbouring countries as hauliers tend to use the cleanest trucks in countries with distance-based tolls. By comparing the actual composition of trucks using the Swedish network to a hypothetical case where the composition is the same as on the German toll roads, we estimate the environmental costs to be around (sic)39 million less per year in the latter case. This puts pressure on countries as Sweden to implement stronger policies.","[Vierth, Inge; Schleussner, Heike; Mandell, Svante] VTI, Stockholm, Sweden; [Vierth, Inge; Schleussner, Heike; Mandell, Svante] CTS, Stockholm, Sweden; [Mandell, Svante] Royal Inst Technol, KTH, Stockholm, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology,"Vierth, I (通讯作者)，VTI, Stockholm, Sweden.;Vierth, I (通讯作者)，CTS, Stockholm, Sweden.",inge.vierth@vti.se; svante.mandell@vti.se,,,Centre for Transport Studies (CTS),Centre for Transport Studies (CTS),The authors would like to thank Mohammad-Reza Yahya (VTI) and Anette Myhr (Trafikanalys) for their excellent support when it comes to data.

This article seeks to investigate the current extent of their involvement in public-private partnerships (PPPs) in South Africa. Aim: The study intends to establish factors that influence quantity surveyors' participation in PPPs. Methodology: A mixed-methods research approach was followed by firstly conducting a survey amongst South African quantity surveyors in order to determine their level of participation in PPPs. For triangulation purposes, a case study was also conducted. Results: The results of the research show that, although quantity surveyors have the corresponding skills and competencies required in a PPP project, their current involvement in PPPs in South Africa is limited and that there is a greater role they can play in future. Conclusion: Quantity surveyors are uniquely positioned to play a bigger role in the implementation of PPPs in South Africa.","[Cruywagen, Hoffie; Llale, Josephine] Univ Pretoria, Dept Construct Econ, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Cruywagen, H (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Construct Econ, Pretoria, South Africa.",hoffie.cruywagen@up.ac.za,"Llale, Josephine/JDC-6732-2023; Cruywagen, Jan/AAR-3848-2021; Kleynhans, Ewert/G-6090-2017","Coetzee, Clive/0000-0002-7216-4923; Kleynhans, Ewert/0000-0002-2321-8593; Llale, Josephine/0000-0001-5220-0272",,,,,24,1,2,1,9,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

To that end, several mechanisms have been put at the disposal of the Member States to enhance transport infrastructure of interest for the EU. This paper conducts a review of the main funding programs implemented by the EU authorities in order to evaluate to what extent the European support has been rightly channelled to PPP projects. To that end, a multiple regression model has been applied to road PPP projects in Spain to analyse whether those PPP projects with EU financial backing ultimately have a higher economic performance compared to those projects not receiving such a support. The research concludes that there is a positive correlation between receiving European financial support and the good economic performance of those projects.","[Garrido, Laura; Gomez, Juan; Manuel Vassallo, Jose] Univ Politecn Madrid, Ctr Invest Transporte TRANSyT, Calle Prof Aranguren S-N, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [de los Angeles Baeza, Maria] Univ Granada, Dept Econ Financiera & Contabilidad, Campus Univ La Cartuja, Granada 18011, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; University of Granada,"Garrido, L (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Madrid, Ctr Invest Transporte TRANSyT, Calle Prof Aranguren S-N, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",l.garrido@upm.es; juan.gomez.sanchez@upm.es; mabaeza@ugr.es; jvassallo@caminos.upm.es,"Gomez, Juan/E-8033-2017; Garrido, Laura/T-3158-2018; Baeza, María de los Ángeles/H-5451-2015; Vassallo, Jose Manuel/H-3696-2015","Gomez, Juan/0000-0002-4629-8733; Garrido, Laura/0000-0003-4304-2860; Baeza, María de los Ángeles/0000-0002-4485-4230; Vassallo, Jose Manuel/0000-0001-7151-4939",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) [TRA2012-36590]; Fundacion Agustin de Betancourt,Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO); Fundacion Agustin de Betancourt,"The authors wish to thank the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO), which has funded the project EU Support mechanism to promote public private partnerships for financing transeuropean transport infrastructure [TRA2012-36590].

We estimate a hierarchical model that disentangles the effect of variety on brand and store search costs. Our findings reveal that search costs within each store rise in product variety, suggesting that retailers reduce consumer search by offering deeper product assortments.

This study employs the structural equation model and chi-square test to explore public perception barriers to widespread adoption of BEVs in Tianjin. Based on a sample of 476 urban respondents collected by questionnaire, it finds that consumer interest in BEVs is relatively low and a large proportion of the respondents have a wait and see attitude. Consumers are unsure about BEVs performance, with safety, reliability, and range per charge being the top three concerns. Respondents who focus on vehicle performance express significantly lower BEV acceptance. High battery cost is the main technological barrier to widespread BEV adoption. In terms of public service support, poor public charging infrastructure ranks as the largest impeditive. In terms of respondent personal characteristics, older respondents have a more optimistic attitude to BEVs than younger generations, more respondents express interest to adopt BEVs as the second family car, experienced drivers are more concerned with the cost of battery and maintenance, and consumers who are more concerned about the environment are more likely to adopt BEVs.","[She, Zhen-Yu; Sun, Qing; Ma, Jia-Jun; Xie, Bai-Chen] Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Sun, Qing; Ma, Jia-Jun; Xie, Bai-Chen] Tianjin Univ, APEC Sustainable Energy Ctr, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China",Tianjin University; Tianjin University,"Xie, BC (通讯作者)，Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.",xiebaichen@tju.edu.cn,"马, 家军/GXM-9194-2022","Ma, Jiajun/0000-0001-6632-5340; Xie, Bai-Chen/0000-0002-9588-830X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71373172, 71431005]; MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences [15YJA790091]; Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of China [11-R1-338]; Tianjin Program of Philosophy and Social Science [TJGL16015]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences; Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of China; Tianjin Program of Philosophy and Social Science,"We sincerely acknowledge support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant nos. 71373172 and 71431005; the support from MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences under Grant no. 15YJA790091, Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of China under Grant no. 11-R1-338; and the support from Tianjin Program of Philosophy and Social Science under Grant No. TJGL16015.",,60,211,218,32,150,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

While fertility rates and dependency ratios in Africa remain high, they have started to decline. According to UN projections, they will fall further in the coming decades such that by the mid-21st century, the ratio of the working age to dependent population will be greater than in Asia, Europe, and Northern America. This projection suggests Africa has considerable potential to enjoy a demographic dividend. Whether and when it actually materializes, and also its magnitude, hinges on policies and institutions in key realms that include macroeconomic management, human capital, trade, governance, and labor and capital markets. Given strong complementarities among these areas, coordinated policies will likely be most effective in generating the momentum needed to pull Africa's economies out of a development trap.","[Bloom, David E.] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Boston, MA USA; [Kuhn, Michael] Vienna Inst Demog, Vienna, Austria; [Prettner, Klaus] Univ Hohenheim, Stuttgart, Germany",Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

Contrary to those claims, we prove that metering ties always lower both consumer welfare and total welfare unless they increase capital good output. We further show that under market conditions we argue are realistic (which include a lognormal distribution of usage rates that are independently distributed from per-usage valuations), metering ties always harm consumer welfare, even when output increases. Whether metering ties raise or lower total welfare depends on the dispersion of desired usage, the cost structure, and the dissipation of profits caused by metering. For realistic cost values, metering ties will reduce total welfare if the dispersion in desired usage of the metered good is below 0.62. (For comparison, 0.74 is the dispersion of income in the United States.)

T and TRF are global militainment films made by the DoD-Hollywood complex to make money in markets and put the U.S. military before the world in a positive light. To show how, the article's first section defines the DoD-Hollywood complex, presents a brief 20(th)-century history of its formation, and describes the current DoD institutions, policies, and practices that fuse DoD publicity agencies to Hollywood filmmakers. The second section highlights how DoD assisted T and TRF's production and contemplates why Hollywood solicited DoD support. The third section shows how T and TRF put DoD in a positive light. The conclusion addresses some of the consequences of T and TRF with regard to democratic theory. By showing T and TRF to be global militainment commodities, this article interrogates the nexus of reel and real U.S. military power and sheds light on how DoD interacts with Hollywood studios to influence how it gets screened by entertainment media and seen by global spectators.","[Mirrlees, Tanner] Univ Ontario, Inst Technol, Fac Social Sci & Humanities, Commun & Digital Media Studies, Oshawa, ON, Canada",Ontario Tech University,"Mirrlees, T (通讯作者)，Univ Ontario, Inst Technol, Fac Social Sci & Humanities, Commun & Digital Media Studies, Oshawa, ON, Canada.",tanner.mirrlees@uoit.ca,,"Mirrlees, Tanner/0000-0002-9597-8313",,,,,56,7,7,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the U.S. military have made use of that tool for almost a century, starting with the War Department's quiet support for the movie Birth of a Nation in 1915 and continuing for a century, including such recent CIA-supported products as Homeland, The Agency, The Recruit, and many less likely movies and television shows. During World War II, this sort of propaganda was openly distributed, since there was a widespread consensus in support of that war. However, state-sponsored propaganda in the form of Hollywood movies continued throughout the Cold War up to the present. The production of movies that completely distorted the political meaning of George Orwell's and Graham Greene's novels were important examples of this practice. CIA involvement was covert, since the target audience was the American public and the ideological perspective being propagated often ran counter to democratic ideals. This article recounts the history of the process by which Americans came to accept the ideas continuously promoted by the government, often without knowing that their favorite movies and television shows had been vetted or even altered by agents of the CIA or the Pentagon. Since these practices violate federal laws, the public at least has a right to know that we are being subjected to this sort of propaganda and how much tax money is spent to produce entertaining forms of disinformation.",,,,PorkinsPolicy@gmail.com,,,,,,,24,2,2,1,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

In this paper, we exploit new minimum nurse staffing regulations by the states of New Mexico and Vermont that were implemented in the early 2000s to determine how nursing homes responded in terms of staffing, quality, and the decision to exit the market. Our identification strategy exploits the fact that some nursing homes had pre-regulatory staffing levels near the new requirement and did not need to change staffing levels. We compare these nursing homes to a group that faced binding constraints (low-staffed) and those that were significantly over the constraint (high-staffed). Low-staffed nursing homes increase staffing levels but also use less expensive nurse types to satisfy the new standard. High-staffed nursing homes decrease staffing and use fewer contracted staff. Overall, dispersion in staffing is reduced, but we find little effect by pre-regulatory staffing level on non-staffing measures of quality and the decision to exit the market.","[Bowblis, John R.] Miami Univ, Farmer Sch Business, Dept Econ, 800 E High St, Oxford, OH 45056 USA; [Ghattas, Andrew] Univ Iowa, Coll Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, 100 CPHB,Room N334, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA",University System of Ohio; Miami University; University of Iowa,"Bowblis, JR (通讯作者)，Miami Univ, Farmer Sch Business, Dept Econ, 800 E High St, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.",jbowblis@miamiOH.edu; andrew-ghattas@uiowa.edu,,,Miami University,Miami University,"We acknowledge seminar participants at IUPUI, Yaa Akosa Antwi, John Bailer, Christopher Brunt, Michael Curme, Chuck Moul, and the editor Lawrence White for helpful comments.

Although its effectiveness is recognised in business contexts, little research has been conducted on sensory marketing. In order to contribute to filling this gap, this study sought to build a model that explains how sensory stimulation influences intentions to purchase a brand. Brand experience and brand equity were expected to mediate this relationship. The empirical validation of the model was conducted by carrying out an online survey with a convenience sample of 302 customers of a brand of the catering industry. The data collected were processed using PLS-SEM methodology. The results reveal that sensory stimulation positively influences brand experience and brand equity, which, in turn, have a positive impact on intentions to purchase the brand in question. The relevant contributions that emerged from this study include not only bridging the aforementioned gap in the literature but also offering significant managerial implications.","[Moreira, Antonio C.; Santiago, Ramiro] Univ Aveiro, DEGEIT, Aveiro, Portugal; [Fortes, Nuno] Polytechn Inst Coimbra, ESTGOH, Coimbra, Portugal",Universidade de Aveiro,"Moreira, AC (通讯作者)，Univ Aveiro, DEGEIT, Aveiro, Portugal.",amoreira@ua.pt; nuno.fortes@estgoh.ipc.pt; ramiro.santiago@ua.pt,"Fortes, Nuno/AAF-5526-2021; Moreira, Antonio/K-4259-2017","Fortes, Nuno/0000-0002-0159-6577; Moreira, Antonio/0000-0002-6613-8796",,,,,50,74,91,29,167,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

An empirical analysis ranks environmental protection practices in SMEs and identifies differences on the basis of size and business sector. In addition, groups of firms with different environmental behavior are identified to facilitate the design of environmental policies, improve effectiveness in decision making and the more efficient use of resources. From a theoretical perspective, this paper contributes to the gap identified by the precursors of the Natural Resource-Based View of the firm by analyzing specific resource combinations that each firm can use to improve its environmental performance and achieve competitive advantages. The firms best positioned to develop the dynamic capabilities needed are identified not only considering the physical environment, but also the socio-economic one and key intangible resources are measured that shape firms' environmental strategy.","[Armas-Cruz, Yaiza; Gil-Soto, Esperanza; Ramon Oreja-Rodriguez, Juan] Univ La Laguna, Dept Business Adm & Econ Hist, Apartado 456, San Cristobal la Laguna 38200, Spain",Universidad de la Laguna,"Armas-Cruz, Y (通讯作者)，Univ La Laguna, Dept Business Adm & Econ Hist, Apartado 456, San Cristobal la Laguna 38200, Spain.",yarmas@ull.edu.es; egilsoto@ull.edu.es; joreja@ull.es,"Gil-Soto, Esperanza EGS/C-6590-2014","Gil-Soto, Esperanza EGS/0000-0002-5547-1155; Armas-Cruz, Yaiza/0000-0002-8037-2554",,,,,87,13,13,2,38,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Co-integration between growth and exchange rate is established by means of an augmented pooled mean group estimation method (which controls for heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence). Unlike previous studies, cross-sectional dependence is accounted for which implies that the productivity effect of the Balassa term is expected to be estimated consistently and without bias. Moreover, our results indicate that the effect of the Balassa term depends more on the income group (level of per capita income) than the rate of economic growth. In general, the power of the effect is stronger for higher income countries in the long run. The study clearly indicates that the Balassa hypothesis holds for middle-income countries, while this is not the case for low-income countries. However, fiscal policy and exchange rate volatility rather clearly explain the variations in the real exchange rate.","[Baylie, Fentahun] Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Econ, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Addis Ababa University,"Baylie, F (通讯作者)，Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Econ, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",fbaylie@yahoo.com,,,,,,,38,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE, SINGAPORE",2367-1033,,978-981-10-4451-9; 978-981-10-4450-2,FRONT AFR BUS RES,,,2017,,,,,,,253,287,,10.1007/978-981-10-4451-9_12,0.0,,,35,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK1SG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000432206900012,0

The implementation of accredited management systems results in the increase in the level of formalisation and control. However, in the traditional view, control is treated as the antagonist of trust. Nevertheless, the most recent literature reports prove that the relations between these two categories are not quite so obvious. Both of these elements always coexist in some form, affecting not only one another, but also the organisation's performance.

This paper aims to fill this gap by investigating the contribution of three important formal economic institutions such as market entry, the security of property right, and anti-corruption mechanisms on provincial economic performance in Vietnam. The empirical results suggest that deregulation of market entry is essential for private investment, employment, and sales of enterprises. However, both the security of property right and anti-corruption provides unexpected outcomes as their improvement impede provincial economic outcomes. Finally, further analysis strongly suggests the heterogeneity in the economic effect of those formal institutions between six regions of Vietnam.

The abortion debate in the USA has been closely tied to claims that rely on Christian authority. However, Christians have never held uniform views about abortion. The almost complete silence on abortion in the Bible and by the two most important Christian theologiansSt. Augustine in the 5(th) century and St. Thomas Aquinas in the 13(th) centuryundermine sweeping claims about a definitive Christian position. Dogmatism and ethical certainty on abortion were rare in the past and only became dominant themes in the 19(th) century. This article examines both intellectual debates in the Church and social conditions that influenced thinking on sexuality, the role of women, and the internal politics of the Catholic Church. In the 19(th) century, the mostly Protestant medical profession played a pivotal role, not only by creating anti-abortion politics on a national scale, but by taking the place of the patriarchal family in supervising the behavior of women. Protestant churches in the 20(th) century became politicized and divided into liberal and conservative factions, in part over questions of contraception and abortion. Evangelical Protestants were not deeply troubled by the prospect of liberal abortion laws until they became politicized for extraneous reasons. Christian attitudes on abortion continue to form a maze, never a straight line, just as in the past.","[Castuera, Ignacio] Calif State Univ Long Beach, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA; [Castuera, Ignacio] Claremont Sch Theol, Claremont, CA 91711 USA",California State University System; California State University Long Beach; Claremont Colleges; Claremont Graduate School,"Castuera, I (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Long Beach, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA.;Castuera, I (通讯作者)，Claremont Sch Theol, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",agne23@aol.com,,,,,,,74,3,5,1,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

We propose using alliance-based network to explore external absorptive capacity and fill the gap of quantitative analysis of the internal and external absorptive capacity together by using social network analysis. In the meanwhile we combine learning effects and absorptive capacity together, to explain how internal absorptive capacity and alliance-based networks cause learning effect, which promotes firms to generate more technological innovation in their home countries and abroad. Using panel data from 306 Chinese firms in high-tech industries during 2001-2010, we find evidence that internal absorptive capacity and external collaborations in alliance-based networks do induce higher technology innovation output, which implies that learning effect depend on the combination of firm-internal and external knowledge. The absorptive capacities, whether internal or external, has positive impact on innovation. Such evidence of absorptive capacity effect has nothing to do with the market position in the process of learning, they are shared among domestic and overseas market Further, in terms of external absorptive capacity, higher network density and degree centrality in the firm's alliance-based network strengthen latecomers' innovation capacity.","[Chen, Chunhua] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Management, Yiheyuan Rd 5, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xielin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Econ & Management, Zhongguancun East Rd 80, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Julia Li] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Yiheyuan Rd 5, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Binz, Christian] Lund Univ, Box 117, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Gao, Taishan] State Informat Ctr, Three Li River Rd, Xicheng Dist, Peoples R China","Peking University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Peking University; Lund University","Chen, CH (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Management, Yiheyuan Rd 5, Beijing, Peoples R China.",chchen@nsd.pku.edu.cn; liuxielin@ucas.ac.cn; paperlizhu@nsd.pku.edu.cn; christian.binz@circle.lu.se; gaots@cei.gov.cn,,,,,,,91,1,1,3,25,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Three of these countries are classified as the high-income countries and one as the upper middle-income country. The analysis is based on the global innovation index (GII) of both the input and output side indexes by the OECD and EUROSTAT data. The changes of indexes by the Visegrad countries are identified as well as the trends. The contribution discusses differences or distances between the indexes and their stability. The comparison of global innovation index in Visegrad countries shows the opportunities for better understanding of the innovation activity conditions as well as the performances in the innovation in the country. Two of Visegrad countries are ranked better by innovation output (IO) indexes and two by innovation input (II) indexes. All these countries are weak in market sophistication. It is the opportunity for non-technological innovation processes. This is also the challenge of optimizing the institutional systems and processes. In the context of innovation, the key challenge is developing skills for innovation in education and training systems and connected with the changes and expenditures on education and training. The aim is to connect the equipment of more people with the skills related to innovation and creativity in all its forms.

The results of this empirical study suggest that CEECs' sovereign bond market's fragmentation receded further; however, the fragmentation of this market still remains. The most significant increase in CEECs' sovereign bond market fragmentation was observed during recent financial crisis.

It analyses the effects of introducing an environmental area where economic and residential activity are not allowed. The welfare function used to determine the optimal size of the green area allows for a possible regulator's bias in favour of firms/consumers. It is shown that location-price competition can be either reduced or increased depending on the size of the green area. The results indicate when a regulator implements green zoning, under linear transportation costs, influences the optimal location of firms (because these locations depend on the size of the green zone). In consequence, zoning may be used as an effective industrial or urban policy tool.","[Hamoudi, Hamid] Univ King Juan Carlos URJC, Fac Legal & Social Sci, Dept Fdn Econ Anal, Paseo Artilleros S-N, Madrid 28032, Spain; [Moral, Maria J.] Natl Distance Educ Univ UNED, Dept Appl Econ, Paseo Senda Rey S-N, Madrid 28040, Spain",Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED),"Moral, MJ (通讯作者)，Natl Distance Educ Univ UNED, Dept Appl Econ, Paseo Senda Rey S-N, Madrid 28040, Spain.",hamid.hamoudi@urjc.es; mjmoral@cee.uned.es,"Moral, María J./ABF-5153-2021; hamoudi, hamid/K-4803-2017","Moral, María J./0000-0002-0966-7034; hamoudi, hamid/0000-0002-1557-8281","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2014-52051R, ECO2015-69334]",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government),"The second author acknowledges research funding from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation, Grant no.

Drawing on an extensive longitudinal study, we conclude first that although a majority voted against the tax in the referendum, attitudinal preferences have become more positive since its introduction supporting previous findings and hypothesis of familiarity effects. Second, we present a model for voting behavior that explains significant portions of the variance, concluding that it is not the outcomes of the charges that are important, but rather if the charges are in line with basic values, if the uses of the revenues (in this case, infrastructure investments) are supported, and if the institutions and processes introducing the charges are perceived as legitimate, trustworthy, and responsive.

Investment attractiveness refers to the competitiveness of a country within the investment environment, and investment decisions that are made by a business regarding the localization of its investments. Investment attractiveness may be defined as the set of factors that influence a business entity when making its investment decisions. Investment attractiveness reflects how interesting the relevant territory, area or region is to businesses. The set of factors influencing the level of investment attractiveness are both factors that are fixed (geographic location, deposits of iron ore, large water flows) and, secondly, the factors that from the perspective of state policy influenced (educated population, a policy of investment incentives, labor costs, tax rate, macroeconomic indicators - inflation, GDP and labor productivity). There are many indicators showing the strengths and weaknesses of a country and its economy, and whether the business environment is suitable for investors or if the business environment is risky and problematic. This issue is dealt with using the theory of localization. This article interprets the results of a survey carried out that looked at the effects of selected investment factors on decisions taken by businesses making FDI - which means on the investment attractiveness of countries striving for FDI. First, based on a theoretical search, we selected specific factors for the inquiry that have an impact on investment decisions taken by businesses. The factors were subsequently verified through a questionnaire sent to the investors. They were further verified through a regression analysis.","[Jac, Ivan; Vondrackova, Marie] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Business Econ & Management, Liberec, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Jác, I (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Business Econ & Management, Liberec, Czech Republic.",ivan.jac@tul.cz,"Jáč, Ivan/AHB-3088-2022","Jáč, Ivan/0000-0003-4759-2990",,,,,22,5,5,2,15,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The purpose of this article is to emphasize dental tourism development as an opportunity for Croatian tourism more than just,,sea and sun seasonal tourism products. Research results show that Croatia has the necessary preconditions and key resources for dental tourism development, recognized in the strategic documents of the Republic of Croatia, such include outstanding natural and qualified human resources, but also competitive prices and proximity to the large source markets, however this form of tourism in Croatia has not used its development possibilities due to the lack of systematic national promotion and the absence of a strong sales network in Croatia. The existing market position of dental tourism in Croatia is still insufficiently diversified, relatively unorganized and poorly recognized, and it's determined mainly by the individual efforts of private clinics so the special focus is given to marketing initiatives which influence the international recognisability of Croatia as a popular destination of dental tourism. The methods used in the research include description, compilation and classy-ication of scientific and professional papers. The primary research was conducted in February 2017 by quota sampling of 15 dental clinics in Primorsko - Goranska County, selected from the Croatian Dental Chamber's list. Selection criteria was made in base of location and the number of employees, The study was focused on gathering qualitative data, focused on the analysis of their websites and an online survey was send to above mentioned dental clinics. The online survey was consisted of 18 questions and structured in a way to meet all research objectives. The sample included employees and managers of dental clinics. The study tested the following hypotheses: H1 Croatia has developed dental tourism as a health tourism sub-segment. H2 Dental clinics use marketing activities to promote dental tourisam. H3 Croatia government doesn't offer subventions for the marketing activities of dental tourism. Dental tourism offers Croatia an opportunity to prolong the tourist season throughout the year, as dental patients have teeth problems all year long, which leads to an increasing percentage of capacity utilization, but it can also influence development of tourist facilities and infrastructure (hotels, restaurants, travel agencies) and raise overall employment. Marketing activities in Croatia's dental tourism are insufficiently diversified. Dental clinics should enhance their strategic marketing to lure international clients. Croatia's government should support and evaluate dental tourism development as an economic process and an opportunity for tourism. Contribution of this study is in assessment of Croatia's dental clinics marketing initiatives and government efforts towards increasing performance and quality of the dental tourism offer. Following global trends and observing the practice and promotional techniques of neighboring countries who are active in the dental tourism market we can find the most appropriate way of implementing such marketing and tourism activity's which can serve as basis for further development with the aim of enhancing Croatia's position on the global dental market. Limitation of the study is that research results couldn't be compared as there is no primer conducted related study in Croatia best to our knowledge. Future research should focus on the number, profile, motives, satisfaction and movements of dental tourists because there is a general lack of research on those subjects.","[Jurisic, Eva] Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management, Opatija, Croatia; [Cegur Radovic, Tihana] Univ Appl Sci, Karlovac, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Jurisic, E (通讯作者)，Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management, Opatija, Croatia.",eevajurisic@gmail.com; tcradovic@vuka.hr,"Cegur Radović, Tihana/GPK-0460-2022","Cegur Radović, Tihana/0000-0002-1030-3449",,,,,40,3,3,1,10,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2017,13,,,,,,297,311,,,,,,15,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM4RS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000463854000019,0

We investigated the relationship between the degree of ownership concentration and the structure of the offered bonds. The aim of this study was to verify the hypothesis about the impact of ownership concentration on the borrowing policy of companies. The study was conducted on a group of non-financial US companies which have issued convertible bonds from 2002 to 2014. Using the main descriptive statistics, measures of correlation and linear regression analysis we demonstrated that there was a weak correlation between the degree of ownership concentration and selected features of the issued convertible bonds. Issuers with more concentrated shareholding offered bonds with shorter maturities and lower conversion time. They offered lower conversion premium as well. Therefore it can be seen that the increase in the ownership concentration is conducive to financing with bonds with lower probability of conversion. This means that shareholders tend to maintain long-term ownership structure and the current impact on the company. The obtained results do not confirm therefore the previous observations on the effect of ownership concentration on the capital structure choices. They are, however, consistent with the main concepts explaining the premises of convertible bond issue.","[Marszalek, Jakub] Univ Lodz, Dept Finance & Strateg Management, Matejki St 22-26, PL-90237 Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Marszalek, J (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Dept Finance & Strateg Management, Matejki St 22-26, PL-90237 Lodz, Poland.",jmarszalek@uni.lodz.pl,,"Marszalek, Jakub/0000-0002-7665-1497",,,,,23,0,0,0,1,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-499-5,,,,2017,,,,,,,523,532,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ7IS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427306200055,0

As a result, the conclusion was reached about superiority of 3-month EURIBOR rate as a measure of funding costs of banks. The measures characterising creditworthiness of borrowers and banking risk are significant factors determining lending rates in the Baltic countries. Across the Baltic States, the pass-through from funding costs of banks to lending rates is high. Long-term pass-through from funding costs of banks to lending rates tends to be higher in Lithuania, but creditworthiness of borrowers appeared to have the highest influence on lending rates in Latvia.","[Micune, Vija] Univ Latvia, Dignajas St 3B-2, LV-1004 Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Micune, V (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Dignajas St 3B-2, LV-1004 Riga, Latvia.",vija_micune@yahoo.com,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,2,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-48454-9; 978-3-319-48453-2,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,607,623,,10.1007/978-3-319-48454-9_41,0.0,,,17,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1MX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447881400041,0

Brand architecture is the way a company organizes, manages, and markets their brands and achieves optimal brand portfolio. It must be aligned with and support business goals and strategies. Different business strategies require different brand architectures. The two most common types are: Branded house architecture employs a single (master) brand to span a series of offerings that may operate with descriptive sub -brand names and House of brands architecture each brand is stand-alone; the sum of performance of the independent brands is greater than it would be under a master brand. Neither type is better than the other and some companies use a mix of both. Brand architecture furthermore is an organizing structure of the brand portfolio that specifies brand roles and the nature of relationships between brands. This article introduces a powerful commercial market research brand architecture tool used in FMCG industry, with intent to help brand architecture strategists employ insight and subtlety to sub brands, endorsed brands, and their alternatives in a way they can measure to manage optimal brand portfolio by optimising target audiences through optimal brand architecture.","[Mrcela, Dajana] Saponia Dd, Osijek, Croatia; [Mikrut, Martina] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Law Osijek, Osijek, Croatia; [Ham, Marija] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek; University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Mrcela, D (通讯作者)，Saponia Dd, Osijek, Croatia.",dajana.mrcela@saponia.hr; martina.mikrut@pravos.hr; mham@efos.hr,"Ham, Marija/AAC-3577-2022","Ham, Marija/0000-0003-4390-2218",,,,,7,0,0,0,4,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2017,13,,,,,,230,243,,,,,,14,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM4RS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000463854000013,0

Major economists such as Adam Smith, Karl Marx, Alfred Marshall and Joseph Schumpeter (1939) have emphasized the importance of knowledge through its components: skills and competences, organizational process, the development of new technologies and innovations, in order to increase productivity and economic development in a sustainable manner. Lately, the importance, magnitude, scope and field of application of knowledge in economic growth seem to have intensified. Today, much more attention is paid to a new, global economy, called the knowledge economy in which the importance of the information, skills and know-how is critical, especially for large corporations, for the success of local, national or regional economies. The new knowledge economy is materialized in the emergence of new firms and new industrial branches, in a context of real-time interconnections of global influences and speed. The present paper aims to make a temporal incursion and a dynamic analysis of the steps that have been taken in recent years through the specialty literature related to the topic proposed for the research. The specialized literature, in the spectrum under investigation, includes leading names in the fields of knowledge economy, entrepreneurship, innovation and new technologies such as: A. Smith, M Friedman, P. Drucker, D. Kahneman (2011), K Marx, A. Marshall, J. Schumpeter, Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995), A. Toffler, but also reports, articles and studies of national and international bodies and organizations. In this context, we present the debates which have been over the years between the great economists and which gave birth to the definitions of this concept so controversial; and we outline aspects of the revolution brought by knowledge and its impact on global economic development.","[Neamtu, Daniela-Mihaela; Ciobanu, Oana] Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Suceava, Romania",Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava,"Neamtu, DM (通讯作者)，Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Suceava, Romania.",danan@seap.usv.ro; oana.ciobanu91@yahoo.com,"Neamtu, Daniela Mihaela/IAQ-7440-2023","Neamtu, Daniela Mihaela/0000-0002-8488-0900",,,,,23,0,0,0,1,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",2286-1440,,,INT MANAGE CONF,,,2017,,,,,,,297,305,,,,,,9,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM6KT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000466917100031,0

The aim of the article was to indicate the most important factors determining the location of newly built hotels in Poland, depending on their size. The spatial scope of the research included the area of south-western Poland, i.e. the provinces of Lower Silesia, Opole, and Silesia, diverse in terms of cultural, social, economic, and natural conditions, and characterized by different attractiveness as tourist destinations. The time range of the statistical data analysis covered the years of 2000-2009. In the initial phase, the authors applied the deductive method to perform literature analysis, and the diagnostic survey method with the questionnaire technique to identify the most important hotel location factors. Secondly, a quantitative analysis was performed to indicate the most significant factors determining the location of independent hotels in Poland, conditioned by the hotel size. The results of the study indicate clearly that there are differences in the location factors for independent hotels, conditioned by their size. The location of small hotels depends mostly on the communication availability, investment incentives, and tourist attractions. The location of medium and large hotels is mainly related to land prices and the presence of anthropogenic tourist attractions. The results can contribute to a better understanding of the motives of investors selecting a location and may have implications for economic policies, since they can focus local and regional authorities' attention on important determinants of reception areas investment attractiveness. The research should be extended in the future to include other hotel features, such as the degree of integration with other business entities, standard, organizational form, or capital origin.","[Puciato, Daniel; Markiewicz-Patkowska, Julita] Wroclaw Sch Banking, Fac Finance & Management, Dept Tourism, Wroclaw, Poland; [Gawlik, Agnieszka; Wos, Barbara] Opole Univ Technol, Fac Phys Educ & Physiotherapy, Dept Tourism & Recreat, Opole, Poland; [Goranczewski, Boleslaw] Wroclaw Sch Banking, Fac Finance & Management, Dept Management & Mkt, Wroclaw, Poland; [Olesniewicz, Piotr; Soltysik, Mariusz] Univ Sch Phys Educ, Fac Phys Educ, Dept Tourism & Recreat, Wroclaw, Poland; [Jandova, Sona] Tech Univ Liberec, Liberec, Czech Republic",Opole University of Technology; Technical University Liberec,"Puciato, D (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Sch Banking, Fac Finance & Management, Dept Tourism, Wroclaw, Poland.",daniel.puciato@wsb.wroclaw.pl; a.gawlik@po.opole.pl; boleslaw.goranczewski@wsb.wroclaw.pl; piotr.olesniewicz@awf.wroc.pl; b.wos@po.opole.pl; sona.jandova@tul.cz; jmarkiewicz@op.pl; mariusz.soltysik@awf.wroc.pl,"Puciato, Daniel/Q-7608-2019; Gawlik, Agnieszka/AAG-7375-2019; Jandova, Sona/W-9347-2018","Gawlik, Agnieszka/0000-0001-5647-8896; Jandova, Sona/0000-0003-4459-5248; Puciato, Daniel/0000-0002-2390-6038; Olesniewicz, Piotr/0000-0002-0426-0630; Soltysik, Mariusz/0000-0002-0317-0705; Goranczewski, Boleslaw/0000-0001-9081-083X; Markiewicz-Patkowska, Julita/0000-0003-4408-5387",,,,,41,1,1,2,21,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

On the second place, we can point out the design of the organizational structure in a specific organization, or which type of organizational structure in concrete organization is applied in functional terms. Furthermore, the number of organizational levels within an organization affects the degree of centralization or decentralization of any organization. The growth of decentralization reduces the number of organizational levels. The last, but by many authors the most important factor that influence on the number of organizational levels is control range. Thus, the number of associates that can, from the side of immediate superior, personally direct, coordinate and monitor. Number of control range increases from the top of the pyramid to the bottom of the pyramid, therefore the number of control range is the smallest at the top and the largest at the bottom of the pyramid.

Top management contributes to product innovations only by developing mentoring relationships with their engineers. However, top management may make a significant contribution to innovations, by playing a key role in creating customer relationships to promote knowledge transfer.","[Ueki, Yasushi] Econ Res Inst ASEAN & East Asia, Jakarta, Indonesia",Economic Research Institute ASEAN & East Asia,"Ueki, Y (通讯作者)，Econ Res Inst ASEAN & East Asia, Jakarta, Indonesia.",yasushi.ueki@eria.org,,"Ueki, Yasushi/0000-0002-2893-8864",Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia; Institute of Developing Economies; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [16K03924]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K03924] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia; Institute of Developing Economies; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This study has received financial support from the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia, Institute of Developing Economies and Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (16K03924).",,32,3,5,0,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

We consider a three-stage supply chain, consisting of a R&D firm, a manufacturer, and a seller. We develop six supply chain models based on various structures and power dynamics, and reveal important implications by comparing the models. R&D performance is a function of supply chain structure; an integrated supply chain can expect improved performance. The selling price is a function of power dynamics, and is higher when R&D has bargaining power. Market and profit performances are higher in an integrated, manufacturer-led supply chain. The manufacturer's role must be revisited; due to its location in the middle of the supply chain, the manufacturer can directly control the overall chain. On the other hand, a R&D firm could innately be associated with marginalization issues. Therefore, it is important for the R&D firm to have a systematic understanding of the entire system. This study contributes to the literature and practice by not only bridging the gap in the previous studies but also offering important managerial implications.","[Yoo, Seung Ho] SunMoon Univ, Dept Business Adm, Asan 336708, South Korea; [Seo, Yong Won] Chung Ang Univ, Dept Business Adm, Seoul 156756, South Korea",Sun Moon University; Chung Ang University,"Seo, YW (通讯作者)，Chung Ang Univ, Dept Business Adm, Seoul 156756, South Korea.",shy1228@sunmoon.ac.kr; seoyw@cau.ac.kr,,,,,,,27,10,11,5,36,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The analysis has been carried out from a triple helix perspective, investigating the structure and dynamics of the Sino-Korea scientific and technological collaborations. The result reveals an imbalance between science and technology in knowledge dynamics and the different extent and intensity of collaborative efforts of the two countries. Based on comparative analysis of co-authorship and co-inventorship networks, the scale and density of scientific collaboration networks appear much higher than those of the technological counterpart. In fact, the technological collaboration between China and Korea is not common in patents and its network needs to be further strengthened.

We then combine lawsuit data from Derwent Litalert with non-practicing entity (NPE) lawsuits collected by Patent Freedom, and use an event-study approach to estimate losses suffered by alleged infringers during 1984-2009. To estimate rents, we combine patent data from the USPTO and EPO with financial data from COMPUSTAT, and use market-value regressions to estimate the value of patent rents for publicly-traded US firms during 1979-2002. We find that private costs exceed private rents during 1999-2000 and the trend in costs is sharply higher. Costs also exceed forecasts of rents for 2005-09.

An important value espoused by all of these writers is proportionality between punishments and crimes, both as an end in itself and as a means of achieving marginal deterrence. This essay asks how closely the concept of proportionality is reflected in the prescriptions of the economic theory. The answer turns out to depend both on how proportionality is defined and on the assumptions underlying the enforcement regime.","[Miceli, Thomas J.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, 365 Fairfield Way, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",University of Connecticut,"Miceli, TJ (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, 365 Fairfield Way, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",Thomas.Miceli@UConn.edu,,,,,,,29,8,10,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

As such, they may create a moral motivation not to engage in the sanctioned behavior. This is desirable as this makes the success of a sanctioning system depend less on quality of enforcement. However, sanctions may not always succeed in conveying moral norms. In this paper, three conditions are highlighted that, in the psychology literature, have been empirically proven to influence whether a sanction succeeds to evoke moral norms. First, a sanction should not be regarded as a way to make up for the negative consequences of a transgression a sanction. So, they should be communicated in a retributive way rather than in a compensatory way. Second, as punishments communicate an obligatory rule and rewards communicate a voluntary rule, punishments are a better way to incur moral norms than rewards. Third, severe sanctions more strongly convey a moral norm than mild ones as long as these severe sanctions are not unreasonably severe, are installed by trustworthy authorities and in a fair way. The value of the moral expressive function of sanctions, as well as its drawbacks, are discussed.","[Mulder, Laetitia B.] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Dept HRM&OB, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Mulder, LB (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Dept HRM&OB, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",l.b.mulder@rug.nl,"Mulder, Laetitia/AAZ-5681-2021",,,,,,58,10,11,2,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

The method traditionally used to evaluate the socioeconomic profitability of investments in transport infrastructure is cost-benefit analysis. However, efficiency benefits are unevenly distributed among the project's stakeholders and, in practice, transport infrastructure investment entails a diversity of redistributive effects that are actually relevant in the decision-making process. The reality is that investment decisions are made on the basis of some form of explicit or implicit use of multi-criteria analysis encompassing both the results obtained in the cost-benefit analysis and other policy (or simply political) considerations implying some sort of redistribution. This paper proposes a classification of the differential impacts of major transport infrastructure projects (redistribution effects), including territorial, social, environmental and intergenerational impacts. Its aim is to generate awareness of their existence and to facilitate their consideration in the decision-making process so it becomes more transparent. Redistribution effects, which should be considered alongside the socioeconomic and financial assessment, are seldom reflected in a systematic way in the decisions on major infrastructure investments. The proposed classification should facilitate a more consistent incorporation of these effects in the decision-making process.",,,,domingo.penalver@upc.edu,"Peñalver, Domingo/K-2495-2015; Rojo, Domingo Peñalver/M-5544-2019","Rojo, Domingo Peñalver/0000-0001-5468-3546",,,,,129,3,3,0,11,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

The parking requests arrive as a Poisson process, and the arrival intensity is influenced by the time-varying parking price. The optimal pricing scheme is proved to be unique for any general demand and derived in closed form for some particular types of demand functions, like exponential and linear. Numerical examples show that the dynamic pricing scheme can provide significant improvement in revenue and make full use of the parking resources during peak periods.","[Tian, Qiong; Yang, Li; Wang, Chenlan; Huang, Hai-Jun] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Tian, Qiong; Yang, Li; Wang, Chenlan; Huang, Hai-Jun] Minist Educ, Key Lab Complex Syst Anal & Management Decis, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China",Beihang University,"Wang, CL (通讯作者)，Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.",chenlanwang@buaa.edu.cn,"Huang, Hai-Jun/AAP-2269-2020","Huang, Hai-Jun/0000-0002-9001-9172","National Science Foundation of China [71471010, 71601008]",National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported by the National Science Foundation of China (71471010, 71601008).

This provides a fast, reliable and secure service along the UK landbridge route relative to the more economical and less frequent direct continental route. However, the relative competitiveness of maritime services along both routes may be significantly influenced by the UK exit from the European Union or Brexit. This paper aims to understand the potential impact of Brexit on maritime freight transport demand from Ireland to continental Europe for export trade shipments. Based on data collected from an efficient stated preference (SP) experiment, discrete choice models that allow for non-compensatory behaviour are estimated. Results from a range of likely variations in the level of service of the UK landbridge route following Brexit suggest that the probability of using the direct continental route is likely to increase by up to a 14% with respect to its current level.","[Vega, Amaya] Galway Mayo Inst Technol, Sch Business, Galway, Ireland; [Feo-Valero, Maria] Univ Valencia, Inst Econ Int, Dept Econ Struct, Valencia, Spain; [Espino-Espino, Raquel] ULPGC, Inst Univ Desarrollo Econ Sostenible & Turismo, Dept Appl Econ Anal, Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Spain",Atlantic Technological University (ATU); University of Valencia; Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,"Vega, A (通讯作者)，Galway Mayo Inst Technol, Sch Business, Galway, Ireland.",amaya.vega@gmit.ie; maria.feo@uv.es; raquel.espino@ulpgc.es,"Espino, Raquel/HPE-1283-2023; Vega, Amaya/IAR-5450-2023; Espino, Raquel/AAI-8157-2021","Espino, Raquel/0000-0002-4138-5846; Espino, Raquel/0000-0002-4138-5846; Vega, Amaya/0000-0003-1477-8086",Beaufort Marine Research Award [BEAU/ECON/04]; Irish Marine Institute; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness under its National Programme for Research Aimed at the Challenges of Society [ECO2014-AQ19 58674_R]; Generalitat Valenciana [GV/2015/096],Beaufort Marine Research Award; Irish Marine Institute; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness under its National Programme for Research Aimed at the Challenges of Society; Generalitat Valenciana(Center for Forestry Research & Experimentation (CIEF)),"This research was funded through the Beaufort Marine Research Award (BEAU/ECON/04), Economic and Social Research related to Development Dynamics of the Marine Sector in Ireland, with the support of the Irish Marine Institute.; This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness under its National Programme for Research Aimed at the Challenges of Society [grant number ECO2014-AQ19 58674_R] and the Generalitat Valenciana under Grant GV/2015/096 supporting R&D Projects of Emerging Research Groups 2015.",,60,8,9,2,26,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

Accordingly, the present study aims to evaluate how crashes in the urban road network are affected by contributing factors. Therefore, in the present paper, a comparison has been done among four artificial neural network (ANN) techniques: extreme learning machine (ELM), probabilistic neural network (PNN), radial basis function (RBF), and multilayer perceptron (MLP). According to the measures used, including Nash-Sutcliffe (NS), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE), ELM was found to be the most successful approach in addressing the objectives defined in the present study. Moreover, not only is ELM the fastest algorithm due to its different structure, but it has also led to the most accurate prediction. In the end, the RReliefF algorithm was utilized to find the importance of variables used, including V/C, speed, vehicle kilometer traveled (VKT), roadway width, existence of median, and allowable/not-allowable parking. It was proved that VKT is the most influential variable in accident occurrence, followed by two traffic flow characteristics: V/C and speed.","[Behbahani, Hamid] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, POB 1684613114, Tehran, Iran; [Amiri, Amir Mohamadian] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Highway Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Imaninasab, Reza] Purdue Univ, Lyles Sch Civil Engn, Dept Highway Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Alizamir, Meysam] Islamic Azad Univ, Young Researchers & Elite Club, Hamadan, Iran",Iran University Science & Technology; Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Islamic Azad University,"Behbahani, H (通讯作者)，Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, POB 1684613114, Tehran, Iran.",behbahani@iust.ac.ir,"Alizamir, Meysam/AAK-6312-2021; Mohammadianamiri, Amir/AAK-4978-2020","Mohammadianamiri, Amir/0000-0002-1459-5856",,,,,27,18,21,3,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0277-6693,1099-131X,,J FORECASTING,J.

Continuous improvement is possible in organisations that take a holistic approach to managing knowledge, which gives them the ability to continue to innovate and sustain their value creation to their stakeholders. Aim: The levels of knowledge management maturity in the Tax Audit Business Unit of a revenue services institution had to be identified in order to provide guidance on how to improve and contribute to future information and communication technology (ICT) strategy planning. Setting: The ICT strategy planning process at the revenue services institution identified a gap in how it managed information and knowledge. This indicated a discrepancy in knowledge management (KM) maturity. Method: A deductive approach was followed, motivated by analysis of tested and well-researched theories to create a theoretical framework. This was then tested against empirical research conducted in a specific business unit. Descriptive statistics in the form of frequencies, proportions, and means were obtained from the data, to describe the patterns and trends in the data set. Results: The key findings confirm that generally the value of KM is well regarded. Barriers exist and levels of consensus generally drop as the levels progress towards the highest KM maturity level, mostly lacking in terms of continuous improvement. Conclusion: The conceptual KM framework developed from this study will give revenue services institutions insights on how to innovate and sustain their value creation to their stakeholders. The desired activities for adoption of the framework will help achieve continuous improvement of a revenue services institution.","[Mthembu, Mlungisi; du Plessis, Tanya] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Informat & Knowledge Management, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Johannesburg,"du Plessis, T (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, Dept Informat & Knowledge Management, Johannesburg, South Africa.",tduplessis@uj.ac.za,"Du Plessis, Tanya/H-6571-2013",,,,,,38,1,1,0,7,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,2222-3436,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Arguing that conventional tests of the EH need to assume EGPs that may be significantly at odds with the true EGP, we investigate this possibility by analyzing the out-of-sample predictive performances of several models for predicting interest rates, including a few models which assume that the EH holds in its functional form that relates long- to short-term yields. Using US riskless yield data for a 1970-2016 monthly sample and testing methods that take into account the parameter uncertainty, the null hypothesis of an equal predictive accuracy of each model relative to the random walk alternative is hardly ever rejected at intermediate and long horizons. This confirms that, at least at a practical level, the main difficulty with the EH is represented by the effective prediction of short-term rates. We discuss the relevance of these findings for central banks' use of forward guidance. (C) 2018 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The key finding is that proximity to metro stations tends to have a positive but nonlinear effect. Within two-kilometre road network distances from metro stations, property value uplift is lowest in areas immediately adjacent to metro stations, explained by negative externalities around metro stations outweighing accessibility gains. The highest effect is revealed at distances between 300 and 1200 metres away from stations. Other significant influences include the distance to the central business district, the size of the property, the age of the property, interior decoration, residential building type and geographical location.

A stronger preference by women for the welfare of children induces redistribution from women to men in exchange for higher educational investment in children, although the cost to women of child rearing is compensated by men when women care for their children. Subsequently, this paper presents description of the policy effects on the dynamics that arise from expansion of formal child-care coverage. The policy substitutes time costs that were previously borne by mothers, i.e., a policy targeted at mothers. If the education level of mothers is sufficiently high (low), then the policy lowers (raises) fertility and increases (decreases) investment in education for children in the long term. Most notable is the intermediate case: When a mother's education level is not too high and not too low, the policy raises both the fertility rate and educational investment in daughters, while probably decreasing investment in sons. The quantity-quality tradeoff for children might not hold. The policy also raises the probability of marriage and the probability of having children.","[Yakita, Akira] Nanzan Univ, Fac Econ, Showa Ku, 18 Yamasato Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4668673, Japan",,"Yakita, A (通讯作者)，Nanzan Univ, Fac Econ, Showa Ku, 18 Yamasato Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4668673, Japan.",yakita@nanzan-u.ac.jp,,,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI Grant [16H03635]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16H03635] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI Grant(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This work was partially funded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI Grant (No. 16H03635).

The conceptualization and measurement of transport service quality-a fundamental determinant of demand-poses challenges for conducting economic analyses and designing mobility policies. Several operating companies are involved in the transport sector. In this paper, the bus network of the metropolitan area of Granada, Spain, is taken as a case study. The aim is to design a model of overall satisfaction based on level of satisfaction using a specific set of factors that take into account the individual characteristics of users and the differential effect of using different bus lines. A combined method using nonlinear principal component analysis (NLPCA) and a logit multilevel model (LMLM) in two steps is applied to a satisfaction survey conducted by the Metropolitan Transport Consortium of Granada (Consorcio de Transporte Metropolitano del area de Granada) in 2013. The survey shows that even though customers within the metropolitan area of Granada are satisfied with the service received (67.26%), the level of satisfaction is not equal for all bus lines, with the perceived quality of some lines being above or below the average. This differential effect is due to different reasons, including the technical and functional performance of the operating companies, commercial speed and length and type of route, among others.

The underlying sources for the database are business registers, firm-level surveys on production, usage of Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) and innovative activities, as well as recorded information on trade and worker education, all linked at the firm level. The unit of observation in the MMD represents groups of firms within industries and allows research that bridges micro and macroanalysis. The paper delineates the type of research questions that uniquely can be addressed with the MMD, and the advantages and disadvantages of using MMD for questions where alternative data sets are available. The paper next presents the methodology underlying construction of the MMD and provides documentation of the rich set of features.

This has been particularly marked in Britain, often in historic cities (such as York, Oxford and Cambridge). Development of busways has also provided opportunities for complementary P&R development. Nonetheless, a net increase in passenger car unit (pcu)-kilometres may be observed, despite a reduction on the principal radial corridor. This is due to increased car-kilometres in catchment areas of P&R sites, but this simple additive approach to changes in pcu-km may not reflect overall impacts if pcu-km are removed from a congested urban corridor. By using monetised external cost per pcu-km for different road types and traffic conditions (such as those in 'WebTAG' guidance in Britain), the net effect can be expressed in economic terms. Presented here is a case study of the Chelmsford system, showing that a net economic benefit may be attained, even though a net increase in pcu-km has occurred.

However, its full potential is not utilized in present climate policies. Optimizing sequestration, while continuing to harvest wood for materials and energy, could reduce the economic burden of mitigation efforts. Optimal sequestration can be incentivized by subsidizing carbon storage according to its social value. We analyze the dynamic market-level impacts of implementing a forest carbon policy by using the Finnish Forest and Energy Policy model (FinFEP). We find that sizeable and immediate increases in carbon sinks can be obtained, even with low carbon prices. High carbon payments strongly increase the carbon sink in the short run, but this impact diminishes over time. Low payments have a milder but longer-lasting impact. Forest owners' valuations of forest amenities also affect the magnitude and dynamics of harvest and carbon sequestration results. Thus, a realistic description of forest owner behavior is needed to assess the impacts of forest carbon policies. Moreover, we show that a market-level model is necessary for assessing the regional carbon sequestration impacts and costs. Relying on stand-level models with fixed timber prices may yield overly optimistic results.","[Pohjola, Johanna] Finnish Environm Inst SYKE, POB 140, FI-00251 Helsinki, Finland; [Laturi, Jani; Lintunen, Jussi; Uusivuori, Jussi] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, POB 2, FI-00791 Helsinki, Finland",Finnish Environment Institute; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke),"Pohjola, J (通讯作者)，Finnish Environm Inst SYKE, POB 140, FI-00251 Helsinki, Finland.",johanna.pohjola@ymparisto.fi; jani.laturi@luke.fi; jussi.lintunen@luke.fi; jussi.uusivuori@luke.fi,,"Lintunen, Jussi/0000-0002-4635-634X","Metsamiesten Saatio Foundation; Academy of Finland [257919, 292825]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [292825, 257919] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA)",Metsamiesten Saatio Foundation; Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); Academy of Finland (AKA)(Research Council of Finland),We thank two anonymous reviewers for their insightful and constructive suggestions and comments that helped us to improve the paper.

Their priorities are likely to conflict, as the ratio between costs and benefits of infrastructure differs according to place and to scale. Yet, for evaluating strategic decisions, policy makers typically use methods that assess impacts from a single-actor viewpoint, providing little insight in the political feasibility and desirability of projects that cross institutional borders. This paper presents a novel evaluation and group decision-making framework: Competence-based Multi Criteria Analysis (COMCA). It provides a structure for applying Multi Criteria Decision Analysis-based methods in a multi-actor, multi-level context. The framework can be used to evaluate the desirability of project alternatives for each of the actors, whose support, individually or as a group, is deemed necessary. Doing so, COMCA helps mapping local and global interests, providing valuable insight and input into the interjurisdictional decision making and negotiation process. The article describes how COMCA was applied in a study with the aim to assess solutions for the main bottleneck of the Belgian railway network. It was found that, in terms of desirability among stakeholders, certain little-studied alternatives potentially surpass the alternatives which for many years were regarded as the most plausible options by the key players. Based on experiences during the study, the article discusses various parameters for finding the equilibrium between methodical precision and applicability in a real-world decision making context.","[te Boveldt, Geert; Van Raemdonck, Koen; Macharis, Cathy] Vrije Univ Brussel, MOBI, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"te Boveldt, G (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Brussel, MOBI, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",geert.te.boveldt@vub.ac.be,,"te Boveldt, Geert/0000-0002-5411-0817",,,,,53,11,11,1,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

This paper considers the behavioral consequences of overconfidence by venture capitalists, comparing their anticipated returns to actual average returns. Our primary metric is Bell's disappointment, a measure of the difference between anticipated and actual payoff. We construct both deterministic and stochastic models, based on empirical data.

This article uses three consecutive surveys on household transportation carried out in the Lyon urban area in France in 1995, 2006 and 2015. We propose a technique to extract consistent data on household expenses from the three surveys. Changes are then analysed, taking care to distinguish between changes in prices, population structure and mobility behaviour. The results reveal trends that diverge widely during the two periods between the surveys. In addition, significant differences appear in the changes in expenditure levels and structure depending on the location of households. Finally, a transition to reduced car use has become very clear, however significant generational effects produce contrasting results in young and retired households.","[Nicolas, Jean-Pierre; Pele, Nicolas] Transport Urban Planning Econ Lab, Lyon, France",,"Nicolas, JP (通讯作者)，Transport Urban Planning Econ Lab, Lyon, France.",nicolas@entpe.fr,,,,,,,50,4,4,0,3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

However, related to predatory pricing it resulted in systematic over- and under-enforcement: Economic theory does not require dominance for predation to be a rational (and harmful) strategy, although an ex ante dominant firm would often refrain from predation. Hence, within the current legal framework which requires dominance for antitrust to apply, a more effect-based and theoretically grounded antitrust enforcement cannot pursue harmful predation. Therefore, we suggest separating predatory pricing from exclusionary abuse of a dominant firm, both legally and analytically. Instead, predatory pricing should be analyzed along the same logic as a merger. In particular, we argue that three elements from merger control should be adopted: in the absence of dominance, market share and/or turnover thresholds may serve as a de minimis rule; recoupment should be analyzed similar to the competitive effect of a merger between the predator and its prey; and a stronger efficiency defense should be established.","[Funk, Michael; Jaag, Christian] Swiss Econ, Zurich, Switzerland; [Jaag, Christian] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne,"Funk, M (通讯作者)，Swiss Econ, Zurich, Switzerland.",michael.funk@swiss-economics.ch; christian.jaag@swiss-economics.ch,,,,,,,31,0,1,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Unlike firearm homicides the definition of firearm deaths does not depend on the broadening of the self-defense provision that the SYG law represents. Using a difference-in-difference design, we find that the SYG law had no impact on gun deaths at the state level. However, once the U.S. states are disaggregated into portions by degree of urbanization-central city, suburb, small urban area and rural area-we find that the law increased gun deaths in the central cities and the suburbs, and had no impact in smaller urban areas and rural areas. These findings are consistent with the fact that there is a great divide between urban and rural areas in terms of ownership and usage of guns, attitudes towards guns, and the implications thereof. The finding of increased violence in the suburbs is of particular interest in the historical backdrop whereby the growth of the suburbs, to a large extent, may have been motivated by a desire to escape crime and violence.","[Munasib, Abdul; Kostandini, Genti; Jordan, Jeffrey L.] Univ Georgia, Agr & Appl Econ, 1109 Expt St, Griffin, GA 30223 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Munasib, A (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Agr & Appl Econ, 1109 Expt St, Griffin, GA 30223 USA.",abdulmunasib@gmail.com; gentik@uga.edu; jjordan@uga.edu,,,,,,,67,7,10,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

It appears of importance to combine education with practical exercises allowing participants to apply the skills they learn. Motivating clients is another important recurring theme.

Bargaining outcomes are determined by upstream market power and countervailing buyer power downstream. This paper uses a panel of B2B transactions in the UK brick market to study B2B transaction prices. The empirical analysis identifies three effects on prices: nonlinear volume and freight absorption effects; countervailing power effects that arise from buyers' local commercial significance; and competition effects that are due to the buyers' local potential suppliers. And it shows that small buyers benefit more from competition than do large buyers because they are not constrained by the suppliers' capacity.,"[Beckert, Walter] Birkbeck Univ London, Dept Econ Math & Stat, Malet St, London WC1E 7HX, England",University of London; Birkbeck University London,"Beckert, W (通讯作者)，Birkbeck Univ London, Dept Econ Math & Stat, Malet St, London WC1E 7HX, England.",w.beckert@bbk.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M007421/1]; ESRC [ES/M007421/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M007421/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This paper is a non-structural companion paper to my structural work with Howard Smith and Yuya Takahashi.

A key determinant of such operational models' viability is the competitiveness of their cost structures. Using a comprehensive analysis of the respective cost structures, this research shows that public transportation (in its current form) will only remain economically competitive where demand can be bundled to larger units. In particular, this applies to dense urban areas, where public transportation can be offered at lower prices than autonomous taxis (even if pooled) and private cars. Wherever substantial bundling is not possible, shared and pooled vehicles serve travel demand more efficiently. Yet, in contrast to current wisdom, shared fleets may not be the most efficient alternative. Higher costs and more effort for vehicle cleaning could change the equation. Moreover, the results suggest that a substantial share of vehicles may remain in private possession and use due to their low variable costs. Even more than today, high fixed costs of private vehicles will continue to be accepted, given the various benefits of a private mobility robot.","[Boesch, Patrick M.; Becker, Felix; Becker, Henrik; Axhausen, Kay W.] ETH, IVT, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Bösch, PM (通讯作者)，ETH, IVT, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",patrick.boesch@ivt.baug.ethz.ch; felix.becker@ivt.baug.ethz.ch; henrik.becker@ivt.baug.ethz.ch; axhausen@ivt.baug.ethz.ch,"Axhausen, Kay W/A-1598-2008","Bosch, Patrick/0000-0001-5506-0682; Becker, Henrik/0000-0002-0376-4802; Becker, Felix/0000-0003-3287-7870","Swiss National Science Foundation; SNF-project [200021_159234, 407140_153807]; National Research Program: Managing Energy Consumption [71]; SW project [2016/001]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [200021_159234, 407140_153807] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)",Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); SNF-project; National Research Program: Managing Energy Consumption; SW project; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"This research is part of two projects funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation; the SNF-project number 200021_159234, Autonomous Cars, and the SNF-project number 407140_153807, Sharing is Saving, which is part of the National Research Program 71: Managing Energy Consumption, as well as the SW project 2016/001, Induced Demand by Autonomous Vehicles.",,59,296,321,8,81,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

Walking and cycling are preferred when the accessibility of public facilities and services is good, while e-bikes are used when public transport provision is low. Urban form variables of population density, job employment density, and public facilities and services confirmed the experience from western countries that higher density mixed land use increases walking, cycling and e-biking. It is recommended that future sustainable transport policy addresses the maintenance of proximity environments at the neighbor. hood level. Furthermore, if the contribution of walking and cycling to sustainable urban mobility is to be maintained and repositioned, the younger generation requires substantial encouragement to get them to cycle more, while low education, low and middle income earners, non-hukou citizens are groups that should be encouraged to keep on walking, cycling and e-biking even if their income situation may improve in the future.","[Zhao, Chunli; Olafsson, Anton Stahl; Carstensen, Trine Agervig] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Nielsen, Thomas Alexander Sick] Danish Rd Directorate, Sect Planning & Anal, Niels Juels Gade 13, DK-1022 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Meng, Xiaoying] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Architecture & Design, 3 Shangyuancun, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China",University of Copenhagen; Beijing Jiaotong University,"Zhao, CL (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",zhao@ign.ku.dk; tasn@vd.dk; asol@ign.ku.dk; tac@ign.ku.dk; xymeng@bjtu.edu.cn,"Olafsson, Anton/D-1002-2015; Nielsen, Thomas Alexander Sick/F-1701-2016; Carstensen, Trine Agervig/C-8504-2015","Olafsson, Anton/0000-0002-7940-8126; Nielsen, Thomas Alexander Sick/0000-0002-6679-4515; Carstensen, Trine Agervig/0000-0002-2133-1621",University of Copenhagen,University of Copenhagen,"This study has been possible due to PhD research grant funded by the University of Copenhagen.

These measures are highly persistent estimates of the underlying integrated variance, but are also noisy. Bollerslev, Patton and Quaedvlieg (2016), Journal of Econometrics 192(1), 1-18 exploited this so as to extend the commonly used heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) by letting the model parameters vary over time depending on the estimated measurement error variances. We propose an alternative specification that allows the autoregressive parameters of HAR models to be driven by a latent Gaussian autoregressive process that may also depend on the estimated measurement error variance. The model parameters are estimated by maximum likelihood using the Kalman filter. Our empirical analysis considers the realized variances of 40 stocks from the S&P 500. Our model based on log variances shows the best overall performance and generates superior forecasts both in terms of a range of different loss functions and for various subsamples of the forecasting period.

Forecasts may be either unaided or made with the help of statistical forecasts. In practice, the latter are often crude forecasts that do not take sporadic perturbations into account. Most research considers forecasts based on series that have been cleansed of perturbation effects. This paper considers an experiment in which people made forecasts from time series that were disturbed by promotions. In all conditions, under-forecasting occurred during promotional periods and over-forecasting during normal ones. The relative sizes of these effects depended on the proportions of periods in the data series that contained promotions. The statistical forecasts improved the forecasting accuracy, not because they reduced these biases, but because they decreased the random error (scatter). The performance improvement did not depend on whether the forecasts were based on cleansed series. Thus, the effort invested in producing cleansed time series from which to forecast may not be warranted: companies may benefit from giving their forecasters even crude statistical forecasts. In a second experiment, forecasters received optimal statistical forecasts that took the effects of promotions into account fully. This increased the accuracy because the biases were almost eliminated and the random error was reduced by 20%. Thus, the additional effort required to produce forecasts that take promotional effects into account is worthwhile. (C) 2017 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Our approach is based on the functional partial least squares (FPLS) model, which is capable of avoiding multicollinearity in regression by efficiently extracting information from the high-dimensional market data. By using its well-known ability, we can incorporate auxiliary variables that improve the predictive accuracy. We provide an empirical application of our proposed methodology in terms of its ability to predict the conditional average log return and the volatility of crude oil prices via exponential smoothing, Bayesian stochastic volatility, and GARCH (generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity) models, respectively. In particular, what we call functional data analysis (FDA) traces in this article are obtained via the FPLS regression from both the crude oil returns and auxiliary variables of the exchange rates of major currencies. For forecast performance evaluation, we compare out-of-sample forecasting accuracy of the standard models with FDA traces to the accuracy of the same forecasting models with the observed crude oil returns, principal component regression (PCR), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) models. We find evidence that the standard models with FDA traces significantly outperform our competing models. Finally, they are also compared with the test for superior predictive ability and the reality check for data snooping. Our empirical results show that our new methodology significantly improves predictive ability of standard models in forecasting the latent average log return and the volatility of financial time series.","[Kim, Jong-Min] Univ Minnesota, Div Sci & Math, Stat Discipline, Morris, MN 56267 USA; [Jung, Hojin] Henan Univ, Sch Econ, Ming Lun St, Kaifeng 475001, Henan, Peoples R China",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Morris; Henan University,"Jung, HJ (通讯作者)，Henan Univ, Sch Econ, Ming Lun St, Kaifeng 475001, Henan, Peoples R China.",2hojin.jung@gmail.com,,"Kim, Jong-Min/0000-0003-3821-2060",,,,,30,15,15,3,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0277-6693,1099-131X,,J FORECASTING,J.

Public enforcement dominates. Leniency programs give cartelists incentives to reveal the cartel and disclose relevant information to the competition authority. The incentives originate from a reduction in sanctions. Directive 2014/104/EU aims at removing practical obstacles to compensation for victims of infringements of EU competition law. The literature suggests that facilitating private damages actions tends to limit the effectiveness of leniency programs. If victims are able to claim compensation, the incentive to apply for leniency may vanish. In addition to the literature, this paper not only considers the effect of private damages on incentives to apply for leniency, but also explores the consequence for deterrence and consumer welfare. Specifically, this paper investigates the implications of an improvement in the claim position of victims for (1) decisions to start or continue a cartel, (2) decisions to apply for leniency, and (3) consumer welfare. Cartelists' behavior is analyzed in a dynamic setting. The paper finds that a marginal improvement in the position of victims in most cases leads to an increase in consumer welfare but not in deterrence. In some cases, it also leads to an increase in deterrence, and, in exceptional cases, makes consumers worse off because cartelists refrain from applying for leniency.","[Buiten, Miriam C.] Univ Mannheim, Dept Law, Law & Econ, Mannheim, Germany; [van Wijck, Peter] Leiden Law Sch, Law & Econ, Leiden, Netherlands; [Winters, Jan Kees] RBB Econ, The Hague, Netherlands",University of Mannheim,"Buiten, MC (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Dept Law, Law & Econ, Mannheim, Germany.",buiten@uni-mannheim.de; p.w.vanwijck@law.leidenu-niv.nl; jankees.winters@rbbecon.com,,,,,,,17,3,3,2,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

The existing literature mainly focuses on observed traveler or trip characteristics and is less likely to capture latent preferences or heterogeneity of roadway users. Motivated to address this knowledge gap, the study herein puts an effort to examine how underlying behavioral attitudes will affect drivers' choices in utilizing managed lane facilities. Based on the data from the South Florida Expressway Stated Preference Survey, factor analysis was conducted based on ten attitudinal statements, and four latent attitudinal factors were identified: willingness to pay, willingness to shift travel schedule, utility (cost/time) sensitivity, and congestion tolerance. In order to assess managed lane's utility for drivers, two sets of multinomial logit (MNL) models were developed using combined revealed preference (RP) and stated preference (SP) data, with and without these attitudinal factors. Results indicated significant contribution of attitudinal parameters in the model, both in terms of coefficients and model performance. The factors were further used in a cluster analysis which identified major segments of roadway users. Such market segmentation is expected to provide valuable insights in capturing travelers' behavior while accounting for attitudinal aspects, which could enhance transportation planning efforts and policy making procedures.","[Jin, Xia] Florida Int Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 10555 W Flagler St,EC3603, Miami, FL 33174 USA; [Hossan, Sakoat; Asgari, Hamidreza; Shams, Kollol] Florida Int Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 10555 W Flagler St,EC3725, Miami, FL 33174 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida International University; State University System of Florida; Florida International University,"Jin, X (通讯作者)，Florida Int Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 10555 W Flagler St,EC3603, Miami, FL 33174 USA.",xjin1@fiu.edu; mhoss009@fiu.edu; hasga001@fiu.edu; ksham004@fiu.edu,"Shams, Kollol/AAH-6009-2019","Jin, Xia/0000-0002-8660-3528",Research Office of the Florida Department of Transportation [BDV29-977-12],Research Office of the Florida Department of Transportation,"This work was supported by the Research Office of the Florida Department of Transportation (grant BDV29-977-12).

This study proves that there is relationship between personality and grit with organizational citizenship behavior, and this relationship is partially mediated by job involvement. These empirical findings reinforce previous researches about the relationship between personality and organizational citizenship behavior. As the extension of the theoretical concepts constructed in this study, it also proved that the relationship between grit and organizational citizenship behavior is also partially mediated by job involvement. Finally, this finding offers the empirical evidence about the importance of job involvement on the relationship between personality and grit to organizational citizenship behavior. It indicates that the presence of personality and grit do not automatically increase the level of organizational citizenship behavior of lecturers, if there is no job involvement inside.

Frequent stock-outs remain one of the biggest issues in the retail business because they directly contribute to lost sales and reduced profits, and indirectly contribute to reduced loyalty and potential loss of customers. Although the stock-outs can occur anywhere in the entire supply chain, literature confirmed that the most of most of stock-outs occur at the store level. A number of researchers have tried to reveal the product and store related drivers and the factors that contribute to lower product availability. Identification of stock-outs was usually performed using the point-of-sale (POS) estimation method or manual audit method, so the results and conclusions were mostly based on a small number stores and products, and they were observed in a shorter period of time. In this research, probit regression was used to examine the relationship between various store-related drivers and product availability. The data sample included 115 SKUs and 98 stores and the data was provided by a large grocery retailer in Serbia. To identify stock-outs on a large data sample, a perpetual inventory (PI) aggregation method was selected. The store related variables that were determined to be the drivers of stock-out performance include distance from distribution center, average store sale and stock-keeping-unit density as the most the most prominent driver. Especially high probability of stock-out can be expected when stock-keeping-unit density and average store sale are high at the same time. On the other hand, it was observed that the income level of the population living in the store area does not have a significant influence on stock-out performance at store level.","[Avlijas, Goran; Golijanin, Danilo] Singidunum Univ, Fac Business, Belgrade, Serbia; [Milicevic, Nikola] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ, Novi Sad, Serbia",University of Novi Sad,"Avlijas, G (通讯作者)，Singidunum Univ, Fac Business, Belgrade, Serbia.",gavlijas@singidunum.ac.rs; milicevic.nikola@ef.uns.ac.rs; dgolijanin@singidunum.ac.rs,"Avlijas, Goran/AAA-1674-2019; Milicevic, Nikola/JSK-6433-2023","Avlijas, Goran/0000-0001-6379-3341; Milicevic, Nikola/0000-0003-4834-6994",,,,,26,2,2,0,18,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

As the market is oversaturated, companies are forced to fight for each customer because it is easier than ever to change the partner who will fulfil customer's needs. User experience and website usability is an important factor during the online purchasing process. The main objective of our study was to analyse the website usability issues users have when purchasing products from abroad. In order to achieve our objective, we analysed the data from Consumer Barometer. We conducted the principal components analysis, followed by fuzzy clustering in order to determine the groups of users based on the perceived website usability problems during online purchasing. By using factor analysis, we created two factors consisting of variables explaining website usability issues. Moreover, with the use of fuzzy clustering, we created and described three groups of users based on their perception of website usability issues during online purchasing from abroad and assigned countries of origin of these users. The results of our analysis pointed out to one particular group of Internet users (Cluster 3) which are highly sensitive when it comes to the usability issues during their online purchasing process. These results can be used by companies operating on one or more of the observed markets in order to improve their performance when serving their potential customers. In addition, the results can be used in the educational process of educational institutions which field of study is focused on economics and business.

Unlike simultaneous ambidexterity, sequential ambidexterity - defined as temporal switching between exploration and exploitation - has not been examined fully, and the conditions under which this temporal switching can be successful are unclear. This paper proposes the concept of temporal switching capability to better understand the process by which sequential ambidexterity is executed. In addition, we hypothesise that performance effects are contingent upon firm-specific factors: a firm's business strategy and absorptive capacity. Utilising three sources of data - a secondary database, annual reports and a survey administered to 145 firms in the electronics industry with 10-year observations - we find support for our hypotheses. The results show that the temporal switching capability positively relates to new product performance and that business strategy type and absorptive capacity have moderating effects. The results are meaningful in both theory and practice.","[Chou, Christine; Yang, Kuo-Pin] Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Int Business, Hualien, Taiwan; [Chiu, Yu-Jen] Oriental Inst Technol, Dept Mkt & Distribut Management, New Taipei, Taiwan",National Dong Hwa University; Asia Eastern University of Science & Technology,"Chou, C (通讯作者)，Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Int Business, Hualien, Taiwan.",chou@mail.ndhu.edu.tw,,"Chiu, Yu-Jen/0000-0002-9584-1448",,,,,79,12,16,3,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Yet, little is known about which combinations of internal and external knowledge sources are triggers for innovation. Extending theories about searching for innovation, we examine the effectiveness of different combinations of knowledge sources for achieving innovative performance. We suggest that combinations involving integrative search strategies - combining internal and external knowledge - are the most likely to generate product and process innovation. In this context, we present the idea that cognitively distant knowledge sources are helpful for innovation only when used in conjunction with knowledge sources that are closer to the focal firm. We also find important differences between product and process innovation, with the former associated with broader searches than the latter.

However, though formative assessment is much more favored, it is time-consuming and requires significant, ongoing dedication and efforts from teachers. As such, it often yields little benefit to both learning and teaching. Nevertheless, the emergence of big data analytics in the last couple of years has opened up new avenues in educational assessment. Our objective in this paper is, therefore, to explore the potential role that these new technologies play in enhancing the assessment process. In this respect, it has been found out that by retrieving and processing the voluminous amounts of data that students generate while using different online learning materials, teachers can gain valuable insights into how their students are learning. They can identify the strengths and weaknesses as well as the preferred learning mode of every individual student. Based on this valuable information, all students can be provided with real-time and customized feedback that they need to improve their learning experiences. Using big data analytics can also allow teachers to enhance curricula and adapt their teaching strategies to the changing needs and requirements of students. Thus, rather than being confined to traditional formal and informal assessment procedures, educators can, through big data analytics, improve formative assessment by making beneficial use of the digital footprints that students leave behind while learning online.","[El Fkihi, Sanaa; Ezzahid, Samia Soumia; Faizi, Rdouan; Chiheb, Raddouane] Mohammed V Univ Rabat, ENSIAS, Rabat, Morocco",Mohammed V University in Rabat,"El Fkihi, S (通讯作者)，Mohammed V Univ Rabat, ENSIAS, Rabat, Morocco.",s.elfkihi@um5s.net.ma; sezzahid@um5s.net.ma; r.faizi@um5s.net.ma; rchiheb@um5s.net.ma,"EL FKIHI, Sanaa/KBQ-2521-2024; Faizi, Rdouan/GLV-1575-2022",,,,,,29,0,0,1,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,6717,6723,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553207068,0

Focusing on the United States, the article traces the creation of an asset class derived from securitizing the rental income of foreclosed homes turned rental properties. The study strategically combines conceptual agendas often pursued separately. Theories of market formation rooted in science and technology studies inform the method of analysis so as to attend to the work of realizing markets, the role of calculative devices in market formation, and the contingent and conditional aspects of markets. This analysis reveals the single-family rental (SFR) asset class as a practical accomplishment. However, a broader framework rooted in political economy is necessary to attend to the broader significance of the SFR asset class in terms of power, politics, and the dynamics of capital accumulation. The article particularly focuses upon the historical and geographic contingencies making it possible to conceive of a large-scale SFR market, the work of state and capital market actors in reframing repossessed single-family homes as rental properties and the role calculative practices played in this process, and the strategies of issuers and credit rating agencies to frame a novel asset class for institutional investors. The SFR asset class affirms the fundamental role for housing in the ideology of capital, and speaks to new entanglements of financial actors and home life as financial accumulation is adjusted to the postcrisis context. Beyond shedding light on postcrisis housing financialization, the article demonstrates how economic geographers can carefully integrate theoretical perspectives to critically examine both the circumstances of market formation and the social, spatial, and political consequences of markets.","[Fields, Desiree] Univ Sheffield, Western Bank, Dept Geog, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Fields, D (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Western Bank, Dept Geog, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",d.fields@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Fields, Desiree/0000-0001-6959-8803",,,,,116,176,192,6,130,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

This study analyzes the commercial performance of global airports using a panel dataset of 75 airports in 30 countries. Applying pooled OLS, random effects and 3SLS estimation frameworks, we identify the main drivers of financial performance. Our results are in line with the existing literature. The share of international passengers, the size of the commercial area as well as airport size and the mix and intra-terminal location of retail space are found to be significant determinants. The latter finding suggests the presence of economies of scale in generating higher commercial revenue and ensuring profitability for an airport's non-aeronautical operations. Staterun and partially privatized airports appear to retain a significantly smaller share of concession sales than their privatized counterparts. Regarding the retail mix, a higher share of food and beverage outlets appears to increase the revenue share retained by the airport while a higher percentage of outlets located airside rather than landside depresses commercial revenues.","[Fuerst, Franz] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, 16-21 Silver St, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England; [Fuerst, Franz] Univ Melbourne, THRIVE Res Hub, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Gross, Sven] Harz Univ Appl Sci, Priedrichstr 57-59, D-38855 Wernigerode, Germany",University of Cambridge; University of Melbourne,"Fuerst, F (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, 16-21 Silver St, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England.",ff274@cam.ac.uk,"Gross, Sven/D-6295-2016; Fuerst, Franz/C-8827-2009","Gross, Sven/0000-0001-5290-1802; Fuerst, Franz/0000-0003-2780-938X",,,,,46,22,22,2,39,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

Transition of western countries to the new technological mode of social relationship development requires a new society to be built that is based on principle of legality, application of high moral and ethical ground, innovative approaches to the society management system, and broad application of IT and Innovative Technologies. The latest decades' experience, both in Russia and abroad, has shown that industrial complex is one of the key branches of national economy; it significantly influences the economic development of a country, including the increase in employment and incomes of its population and in taxation proceeds. Experts say that home industry has considerably contributed to the creation and improvement of high technology, which is an indispensable factor in the country's national and economic security. Under the conditions of today, companies face the impact of many external factors: the country's current policy, its business situation (the investment climate, the tax level, the economic and legal consequences of economic sanctions against Russia, etc.), the existing economic environment and the conditions of fund-raising (rates on bank credits, the general state of global capital market, etc.) In this context, it is most timely to explore new methods, approaches and ways that may improve efficiency of industrial company management, which is exactly the goal of this scientific research.

This paper argues that the presence of crowding externalities may neutralise the welfare benefits of travel pass provision, because a zero marginal fare after an initial entry payment leads to inevitable overconsumption. Therefore, only severely under-subsidised welfare maximising operators should supply season tickets. We show that the ignorance of crowding externalities and a demand maximising (political) objective may be two potential explanations why travel passes are still widely used in public transport.","[Horcher, Daniel] Imperial Coll London, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Railway & Transport Strategy Ctr, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England",Imperial College London,"Hörcher, D (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll London, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Railway & Transport Strategy Ctr, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England.",d.horcher@imperial.ac.uk,"Graham, Daniel/AAA-6157-2021; Alidadi, Mehdi/HJZ-0235-2023","Graham, Daniel/0000-0002-6971-8737; Alidadi, Mehdi/0000-0001-5183-7829",,,,,18,4,4,0,2,UNIV BATH,BATH,"JRNL OF TRANSPORT ECON & POL CLAVERTON DOWN, BATH BA2 7AY, AVON, ENGLAND",0022-5258,1754-5951,,J TRANSP ECON POLICY,J.

Our motivation for the research study has grown from the deficiency of similar kind of studies for these countries in the observed period. This is important because of the investigation of recent global crisis consequences. The backbone for the research can be found in Hakkio and Rush (1991) and Husted (1992). However, we employed different methodological tools with a purpose to include the possibility of structural breaks. The crucial idea is to empirically test current account sustainability through the concept of cointegration between export and import. In the last decades, substantial progress has been made in econometric modeling, which has shown that conclusions derived from standard tests can be inadequate in the presence of structural breaks. We want to check this hypothesis by application of new approaches. Unit root tests were applied on observed variables. After that, Gregory-Hansen approach was employed with purpose of cointegration presence testing. Finally, we estimated cointegration vectors. The main finding of the research study is that there is some form of the current account sustainability in all of the observed countries. In Czech Republic and Hungary, it is stronger, while in Poland and Serbia it is weak. Therefore, policymakers have to significantly improve competitiveness with the purpose of strengthening external stability.

The visionary style is the leadership style most frequently applied in industrial companies within the researched territory; the manager's future orientation, visionary behaviour, ability to predict as well as the ability to form a team, integrate and coordinate it in the desired direction, are among the typical features.","[Jankova, Zuzana] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Inst Informat, Kolejni 2906-4, Brno 61200, Czech Republic; [Mazanek, Lukas] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Inst Management, Kolejni 2906-4, Brno 61200, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology; Brno University of Technology,"Janková, Z (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Inst Informat, Kolejni 2906-4, Brno 61200, Czech Republic.",xpjanko01@vutbr.cz; mazanek@fbm.vutbr.cz,"Mazánek, Lukáš/F-1450-2018; Jankova, Zuzana/IQT-8157-2023","Jankova, Zuzana/0000-0003-1798-5275",[FP-J-18-4944],,This paper was supported by project 'No. FP-J-18-4944 Leadership competencies perceived as desirable in the emerging era of digital transformation'.,,15,0,0,1,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,5305,5317,,,,,,13,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553206033,0

Using game-theoretical approach and numerical analysis, it turns out that under quantity leadership, the R&D investments of enterprises decline with the increasing knowledge spillovers in the industry. The relative R&D expenditures of the Stackelberg follower are lower and they decline significantly faster than the R&D investments of the Stackelberg leader. Each enterprise supplies the lowest value of the final product when a research joint venture is formed, which also results in the highest market price. Under price leadership, a larger extent of knowledge spillovers in the industry leads to the reduction of R&D expenditures by both enterprises. The highest price of the final product is set when a research joint venture is formed. In a cartelized industry, the lowest values of R&D expenditures occur when there are no knowledge spillovers between enterprises, or when they form a research joint venture at the R&D stage. The highest values of R&D investments are observed for the medium values of knowledge spillovers. Performed analysis allows to conclude that tightening of cooperation in research and development between competitors creates incentives for them to fully cartelize the market.","[Karbowski, Adam] Warsaw Sch Econ, Dept Business Econ, Grad Studies, Al Niepodleglosci 162, PL-02554 Warsaw, Poland; [Prokop, Jacek] Warsaw Sch Econ, Int Relat, Dept Business Econ, Al Niepodleglosci 162, PL-02554 Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics; Warsaw School of Economics,"Karbowski, A (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Dept Business Econ, Grad Studies, Al Niepodleglosci 162, PL-02554 Warsaw, Poland.",adam.karbowski@sgh.waw.pl; jacek.prokop@sgh.waw.pl,"Prokop, Jacek/K-1035-2019","Prokop, Jacek/0000-0001-5228-658X","National Science Centre, Poland [UMO-2017/25/B/HS4/01632]","National Science Centre, Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)","The research was supported by National Science Centre, Poland, grant number UMO-2017/25/B/HS4/01632.",,43,6,6,2,12,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

Based on threshold regression models, it is found that the pre-repurchase systematic risk will significantly change the relationship between investor behavior, market factors and stock price responses and the asymmetry of the relationship exists when pre-repurchase systematic risk is lower than a repartition, which supports that institutional investors and credit trading investors differ in these existing relationships. When the pre-repurchase beta is below repartition, it will be detrimental to the returns in event period. But on the contrary, the returns in the short-term shock of news exposure period present the favorable results, which may be related to the fact that there exists sentiment premium in short-term when credit trading investors' repurchase news exposure occurs. Finally, the study is to confirm the effect of systematic risk for returns and investor sentiment, these results have not been further explored in the past, and can be used as the firm's evaluation reference to the repurchase program in the future.","[Liu, Ying-Sing] Jen Teh Jr Coll Med Nursing & Management, Miaoli, Taiwan",,"Liu, YS (通讯作者)，Jen Teh Jr Coll Med Nursing & Management, Miaoli, Taiwan.",liuyingsing@yahoo.com.tw,"LIU, YING-SING/L-7287-2019","LIU, YING-SING/0000-0002-3161-2136",,,,,35,0,0,0,7,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The main implications are that cross-border mergers and acquisitions have a negative effect on GDP per capita in the year of merger or acquisition, while their lagged level shows a positive impact. From long-term perspective, this type of FDI has negative and significant effect on GDP per capita. The results show that one-year lagged cross-border mergers and acquisitions positively affects domestic investment, suggesting that spill-over effects of this type of investment can be expected not earlier than one year after the merger or acquisition. The value of this paper is that our results show how the advances in structural reforms enhance GDP per capita whereas their influence on domestic investment activity is insignificant. We found that there is insignificant impact of the relationship between overall structural reforms and cross-border mergers and acquisitions on GDP per capita and domestic investment both in short and long run.

The equal pre- and post-futures data is used for analysis. An AR (1) augmented GJR-GARCH approach with GED is used to estimate the level of market efficiency and volatility in underlying stock market. This finding suggests presence of volatility spot market post introduction of futures in spot market. On the other hand, the study presents the significant increment in market efficiency of all stocks of BRICS except Nifty index of India.

ERM encompasses activities and strategies which enable the company to systematically identify, measure, reduce or exploit, as well as to control and monitor the exposure to various types of corporate risks - strategic, financial, operational, reporting as well as compliance risks. By considering the interactive effects of different risk events, ERM offers a balance between the dual nature of risk - ensuring effective protection from threats and seizing the opportunities. This paper explores the association between ERM and a set of fundamental value determinants of S&P 500 non-financial companies over the period from 2003 to 2012. Contrary to arguments found in the existing ERM literature, ERM companies did not experience a positive effect on most of the value drivers. We find that ERM is associated with lower expected growth rates within one to two years after the ERM adoption, indicating that ERM could even have a negative effect on the company's fundamental value. On the other hand, the study showed that ERM is associated with higher free cash flows after six years of its use. Our research thus found indicative evidence that ERM produces some positive effects over a longer term, as well as some negative immediate effects, which could be explained with the increased risk aversion of ERM companies. However, since the tested models are explorative in nature, more theoretical and empirical research is needed to establish how ERM really works within a company.","[Marc, Mojca] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Acad Unit Management & Org, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Sprcic, Danijela Milos] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Managerial Econ, Zagreb, Croatia; [Zagar, Marina Mesin] Univ Southern Calif, USC Marshall Sch Business, Dept Finance, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Zagar, Marina Mesin] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Org & Management, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Ljubljana; University of Zagreb; University of Southern California; University of Zagreb,"Marc, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Acad Unit Management & Org, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",mojca.marc@ef.uni-lj.si; dmilos@efzg.hr; mesin@marshall.usc.edu,"Sprčić, Danijela Miloš/I-2456-2018","Marc, Mojca/0000-0002-6563-0279",University of Zagreb,University of Zagreb,"We would like to thank the University of Zagreb for the financial support granted to the research project Impact of Enterprise Risk Management on the Company's Financial Performance in a Period of the Global Financial Crisis.

It can be considered as a confirmation of the actual efficiency of the national economy and its ability to be competitive in the global economics. In this paper, we analyze main tendencies of export trade of Ukraine with Visegrad countries and examine whether there is a relationship between the level of GDP and the volume of export activities between these countries. It should be noted that various agreements were concluded between Ukraine and each country of the V4 group regarding economic and trade relations. The main aim of this paper is to evaluate development of export of goods between Ukraine and Visegrad countries between years 2002-2013. The data of State Statistics Service of Ukraine, Eurostat and United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) were used. The development of export from Ukraine to V4 countries is investigated using the software GRETL and log-log linear model. It is discovered that Ukraine's export operations are impacted by export to other trade partners and GDP per capita of the country. The strongest positive link to Ukraine export from V4 group is represented by Poland. It is identified that, when the GDP per capita of the concerned country goes up, the export to that country declines. It is also revealed that there is a substantial difference with respect to export of agricultural commodities from Ukraine to the above-mentioned countries. To a significant extent, Ukraine's export is oriented towards plant products. Ukraine should elaborate a well-defined trade strategy and extend its current export activities with V4 countries.

The focus is on revealing the importance of socio-psychological credentials for an active labour market participation of immigrants, aiming to extrapolate factors (timespan 2000-2019), which can foster or complicate similar process in the future. Beside total immigration flows, we particularly entail the benefit spillovers for Serbia and Romania in their migration challenges towards EU-10. A set of methods and macro-econometric models, based on spatial analysis, cross-sectional analysis and structural equations modelling, was applied on the balanced panel formed by EU-10. The results highlight that an increased participation in society, community and improved living standards satisfaction (subjective wellbeing) positively reverberate on migrant integration into host economies since it tends to upsize the employment rate of the foreign population. The opposite, a negative impact is induced by social exclusion and reduced job security, while material deprivation also significantly diminishes the employment opportunities of foreign population and their active labour market integration.","[Noja, Graliela Georgiana] West Univ Timisoara, Fac Econ & Business Adm, East European Ctr Res Econ & Business, 16 Pestalozzi St, Timisoara 300115, Romania; [Petrovic, Nebojsa] Univ Belgrade, Fac Philosophy, Cika Ljubina 18-20, Beograd 11000, Serbia; [Cristea, Mirela] Univ Craiova, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Ctr Banking & Financial Res, 13 AI Cuza St, Craiova 200585, Romania",West University of Timisoara; University of Belgrade; University of Craiova,"Noja, GG (通讯作者)，West Univ Timisoara, Fac Econ & Business Adm, East European Ctr Res Econ & Business, 16 Pestalozzi St, Timisoara 300115, Romania.",gratiela.noja@e-uvt.ro; npetrovi@f.bg.ac.rs; mirelas.cristea@gmail.com,"Noja, Gratiela/X-2471-2019; Cristea, Mirela/AAP-8154-2020","Noja, Gratiela/0000-0002-9201-3057; Cristea, Mirela/0000-0002-6670-9798",COST Action [CA16111],COST Action(European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)),"Part of this work was conducted within the framework of STSM - Short-Term Scientific Mission, COST Action CA16111 International Ethnic and Immigrant Minorities' Survey Data Network (ETHMIGSURVEYDATA).

Mergers and acquisitions became predominant in the banking sector in Nigeria in year 2005 in reaction to the central Bank of Nigeria's guideline to raise the minimum requirement of capital of the Nigerian deposit money banks from N2 billion to N25 billion. At that time, more than half of the deposit money banks were involved in merger and acquisitions. This research work analyzes the impact of merger and acquisitions on bank performance in the Nigerian banking industry from 2000-2013. The ordinary least squares method was used to examine the significant effect on bank performance mutually for the pre- merger and post-merger phases to find out if merger of banks resulted into any performance benefits in addition to its effect on efficiency of operations. Evidence proves that mergers and acquisitions have a tangible impact on bank performance and effectiveness of operations. We therefore recommend that deposit money banks should utilize the impact effectively so that they could play their role well in the growth of the real sector.","[Olokoyo, Felicia O.; Adegboye, Folasade B.; Okafor, T.

Global value chain and global production network analyses have recognized that financialization is increasingly driving the way that lead firms coordinate their relationships with supplier firms. The contribution of this article is to unpack the mechanisms that lead firms adopt to govern their supply chains in the context of financialization and the implications this has for the territorial embeddedness of lead firms. The boom-bust cycle of mining, arising from massive fluctuations in global commodity prices, provides a revealing context in which to explore the changing agendas of financial markets and their implications for lead firm connections to territory. This article examines the mechanisms lead firms use to coordinate relations with local suppliers in the Queensland coal industry, which accounts for 50 percent of international trade in metallurgical coal and which has evolved in the context of the most recent boom-bust cycle of global coal prices.","[Parker, Rachel; Cox, Stephen] Queensland Univ Technol, Business Sch, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Thompson, Paul] Univ Stirling, Dept Management Work & Org, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); University of Stirling,"Parker, R (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, Business Sch, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",r.parker@qut.edu.au; sd.cox@qut.edu.au; paul.thompson@stir.ac.uk,"; Parker, Rachel/I-9759-2012","Cox, Stephen/0000-0002-5666-9016; Parker, Rachel/0000-0003-4961-6714","Australian Research Council Discover Project, Southwest Regional Fisheries Division [DP1093222]; Australian Research Council [DP1093222] Funding Source: Australian Research Council","Australian Research Council Discover Project, Southwest Regional Fisheries Division; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council)","Funding for this research was provided by the Australian Research Council Discover Project DP1093222, Southwest Regional Fisheries Division.",,54,25,27,4,29,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

Albeit, different challenges appear through this application, most of the previous studies consider less about these challenges and focus on the advantages of IOT. To overcome this defect, different challenges that a supply chain may face as whole are determined based on systematic literature review and expert opinions. Then, a rough group decision-making and trial evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) is applied. Advantages of the proposed model are that both internal strength and external influence of challenges and also vagueness and ambiguity of experts' opinions are simultaneously noticed to completely show the importance of these challenges. The results show that challenges such as lack of strategy and scenario planning in IOT, storage issues, lack of security and lack of privacy are of great importance. So, these challenges should have a higher priority in attracting attention and resources. These results help managers to be equipped to face with main challenges in their path toward IOT in their supply chains. Accordingly some practical suggestions for managers are discussed in this paper, such as starting the journey toward IOT step by step, planning for a data storage system which is appropriate for big data, setting up a security policy to prevent out-coming problems caused by lack of security and privacy inherited by IOT, conducting a privacy or security risk assessment, minimizing the data collection and retain and testing the security measures before launching the products, and establishment of a legal framework to construct a problem-solving network in such a messed up and dynamic environment for processing such complicated huge data.","[Pishdar, Mahsa; Ghasemzadeh, Fatemeh] Allameh Tabatabai Univ, Fac Accounting & Management, Dept Ind Management, Tehran, Iran; [Antucheviciene, Jurgita; Saparauskas, Jonas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Construct Management & Real Estate, Vilnius, Lithuania",Allameh Tabataba'i University; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Pishdar, M (通讯作者)，Allameh Tabatabai Univ, Fac Accounting & Management, Dept Ind Management, Tehran, Iran.",mahsa.pishdar@yahoo.com; ghasemzadeh.fa@gmail.com; jurgita.antucheviciene@vgtu.lt; jonas.saparauskas@vgtu.lt,"Antucheviciene, Jurgita/W-6112-2018; pishdar, Mahsa/JSK-6110-2023","Antucheviciene, Jurgita/0000-0002-1734-3216; pishdar, Mahsa/0000-0003-4517-8796; Ghasemzadeh, Fatemeh/0000-0002-6988-1083",,,,,41,17,18,2,36,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The Gibson law has been a source of widespread academic discussion on the dynamics of long-term interest rates and the price level. Today the Gibson law re-emerges on the economic science stage since historically low-interest rates and deflationary pressures are present worldwide. This paper studies the correlation between cyclical components of interest rates and prices for CEE (Central and Eastern Europe) states over the 2000-2014 period. Empirical results show only a weak correlation between the cyclical components implying no long run (cointegrating) relationship between bond yields and prices. Evidence presented in the study shows Gibson law is not valid for the CEE states, advancing the possibility that fixed exchange regimes, lack of the gold reserves, and monetary stabilisation policies are the forces driving the law outside the CEE area. The results show that Gibson paradox is not present in CEE states but also point to the possible non-linear nature of the paradox. In order to investigate the non-linear nature of the paradox in CEE, because of constant changes and adaptation of the monetary policies in CEE states, future studies should use a long memory approach. The paper shows limited theoretical explanation for the non-existent Gibson law in CEE economies but still advances an explanation - lack of gold reserves, fixed exchange regimes and restrictive monetary policy. Policy makers should monitor the nature of the paradox in relation to the historically low levels of interest rates in order to avoid or at least alleviate future financial crisis.","[Skare, Marinko; Tomic, Daniel] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic Pula, Pula, Croatia; [Porada-Rochon, Malgorzata] Univ Szczecin, Fac Management & Econ Serv, Szczecin, Poland",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula; University of Szczecin,"Skare, M (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic Pula, Pula, Croatia.",mskare@unipu.hr; dtomic@unipu.hr; malgorzata.rochon@wzieu.pl,"Škare, Marinko/L-5504-2019; Tomić, Daniel/AAD-8845-2020; Rochoń, Małgorzata Porada/V-5807-2019; Tomić, Daniel/N-7647-2019","Škare, Marinko/0000-0001-6426-3692; Tomić, Daniel/0000-0002-7309-6096; Rochoń, Małgorzata Porada/0000-0002-3082-5682; Tomić, Daniel/0000-0002-7309-6096",,,,,35,2,2,0,5,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

A group of 456 enterprises from the entire Czech Republic (201 entities from the manufacturing and industrial sector and 255 from the services sector) were investigated with statistical tests (one-tailed one-sample test of proportions and interval estimation) to determine which function, or a group of functions in mutual integration, has the biggest influence on creation and implementation of a corporate strategy or which seems to have the biggest influence based on the performed statistical tests. The obtained results have confirmed importance of the economic function in both the tested sectors. In the manufacturing and industrial sector statistical significance has been also identified for the manufacturing and technological function, while in the services sector the important functions included marketing and sales and the process of provision of services. The obtained outputs are in agreement with the general character of the tested sectors. On the contrary, the relatively low importance of human resources, innovation, management and leadership can be seen as negative since those functions should be considered fairly important from the viewpoint of corporate strategy and sustainability.","[Strakova, Jarmila] Inst Technol & Business, Fac Corp Strategy, Dept Management, Okruzni 10, Ceske Budejovice 37011, Czech Republic","Institute of Technology & Business, Ceske Budejovice","Straková, J (通讯作者)，Inst Technol & Business, Fac Corp Strategy, Dept Management, Okruzni 10, Ceske Budejovice 37011, Czech Republic.",strakova@mail.vstecb.cz,"Straková, Jarmila/ABE-8222-2020",,,,,,19,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,2790,2800,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553203083,0

From a methodological perspective, the research is based on Dumitrescu and Hurlin causality and the dynamic panel regression methodology, based on adapted growth model. The empirical evidence is performed on unbalanced annual panel data of eight selected countries (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Slovak Republic and Slovenia), during the period 1995-2016. The research confirms that there is a trend to combine direct and indirect public funding instruments. Because of limited financial resources, indirect support has become more important in recent years. Cash grants and tax deduction are the tools most often used for support and funding of R&D in the selected CEE countries. A dynamic panel analysis with fixed effects confirms a positive and statistically significant impact of R&D expenditure on economic growth. Government R&D expenditure is reported to be a key driver for economic performance followed by business R&D expenditure, a higher share of persons with tertiary education and/or employed in science and technology and country openness. On the contrary, investment and higher education R&D expenditure were found to have a positive but statistically insignificant impact. Hence, special care of policymakers should be given to investment mix. It is decisive to direct and support investment to growth-enhancing areas (e.g. infrastructure and communication, R&D, education and health care) and to improve the ratio between current and capital investment. Attention should also focus on higher education R&D support, and future development must be concentrate on its cooperation with business sector especially in the area of applied research. Finally, a crisis is reported to have a negative and statistically significant impact on economic growth.","[Szarowska, Irena] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm, Dept Finance & Accounting, Opava, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Szarowská, I (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm, Dept Finance & Accounting, Opava, Czech Republic.",szarowska@opf.slu.cz,"Szarowská, Irena/J-6391-2012","Szarowská, Irena/0000-0002-5197-6455","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports Czech Republic","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech RepublicCzech Republic Government)","This article was supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports Czech Republic within the Institutional Support for Long-term Development of a Research Organization in 2018.",,53,12,12,0,19,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI) were based on a structured questionnaire, then, data exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed. The conducted EFA determined four main factors for information management and integration in the supply chain that should be considered, namely, information characteristics, ICT used in information management, the scope of information and shared performance metrics. Results confirmed the importance of some of the factors related to information management in the supply chain, however having a different set of variables than indicated in the literature. Additionally, research introduced new factors, namely, information characteristics and the scope of shared information, instead of information quality and information content. Moreover, findings suggested that the key role in supply chain information integration was related to established technologies, focused on transport, customer, and ERP management, while emerging technologies, such as cloud computing and data mining were not of the top importance among the surveyed companies.","[Szymczak, Maciej] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Fac Int Business & Econ, Dept Int Logist, Poznan, Poland; [Ryciuk, Urszula; Leonczuk, Dorota; Nazarko, Joanicjusz; Jakuszewicz, Joanna] Bialystok Tech Univ, Fac Engn Management, Int Chinese & Cent Eastern Europe Inst Logist & S, Bialystok, Poland; [Piotrowicz, Wojciech] Hanken Sch Econ, Dept Mkt Supply Chain Management & Social, Helsinki, Finland; [Witkowski, Krzysztof] Univ Zielona Gora, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Logist, Zielona Gora, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business; Bialystok University of Technology; Hanken School of Economics; University of Zielona Gora,"Nazarko, J (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Fac Engn Management, Int Chinese & Cent Eastern Europe Inst Logist & S, Bialystok, Poland.",j.nazarko@pb.edu.pl,"Nazarko, Joanicjusz/L-1285-2016; Ryciuk, Urszula/R-5547-2017; Ajmi, Ghalia Al/AAB-6467-2019; Szymczak, Maciej/HLQ-1671-2023; Leonczuk, Dorota/R-7576-2017","Nazarko, Joanicjusz/0000-0002-0236-2334; Ryciuk, Urszula/0000-0001-6410-9601; Szymczak, Maciej/0000-0002-1107-3390; Piotrowicz, Wojciech/0000-0002-4598-9065; Leonczuk, Dorota/0000-0002-0424-0226","National Science Centre, Poland [2014/13/B/HS4/03293]","National Science Centre, Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)","This work was supported by the National Science Centre, Poland under Grant no. 2014/13/B/HS4/03293.",,48,9,10,1,29,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

At last, the sales leader's groups, doing main return, may present just 6-10% of total assets number, but bring more than 80% of total portfolio return. Thus the structure of portfolio may be very heterogeneous, which probably is explaining sufficient asymmetry of earnings random variable distribution about normal in daily horizon. We offer more sophisticated probabilistic portfolio model, which allow us to take into account not only sufficient quantitative heterogeneity, but also causal relations between asset groups, mapped on the principle of comparable demand. We prove that there is the process of permanent overflowing of assets in the direction of sales leader's group, and with this flow the risk parameters of portfolio are changing.","[Voronov, Victor S.; Davydov, Vasiliy D.] St Petersburg State Univ Econ, St Petersburg, Russia; [Kazansky, Alexander V.] St Petersburg State, St Petersburg, Russia",Saint-Petersburg State University of Economics,"Voronov, VS (通讯作者)，St Petersburg State Univ Econ, St Petersburg, Russia.",box864tmn@yandex.ru; a.kazanskiy@spbu.ru; vasiliydavydov93@gmail.com,"Kazansky, Alexander Vyatcheslavovich/N-7487-2013; Voronov, Victor/E-3432-2014","Voronov, Victor/0000-0002-0655-4413",,,,,5,2,2,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,4279,4284,,,,,,6,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553205032,0

Quota cartels employ regular reporting schemes and use compensation mechanisms for departures from set quotas. Specialization cartels divide markets, and rely the least on information exchange and punishment. Price and payment condition cartels primarily aim to prevent secret price cuts, requiring information provision upon request, allow for discretionary decision-taking and (sometimes immediate) punishment.

The goal of the article is neither to plead in favor nor against emissions trading for households, but rather to provide an analysis of such a scheme. To that end, the article gathers relevant theoretical insights and discusses how established empirical findings can be used to design a potentially workable scheme. The analysis not only presents an overview of possible economic and behavioral barriers, but also creates a feedback to its institutional design by presenting possible solutions to overcome them. Downstream allocation creates a more direct and visible carbon incentive, whereas administrative costs can be reduced by concentrating monitoring and enforcement upstream. Behavioral acceptance can be boosted via strategic communication, for instance by stressing that emissions trading is both effective (emissions are capped) and fair (those who emit less, pay less). Energy conservation can be stimulated by frequently sending updates to households of their carbon transactions to make the consequences of their behavior more noticeable. Whether these necessary conditions are also sufficient to ensure political acceptance remains an open question.","[Woerdman, Edwin] Univ Groningen, Dept Law & Econ, Fac Law, Oude Kijk t Jatstr 26, NL-9712 EK Groningen, Netherlands; [Bolderdijk, Jan Willem] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Mkt, Nettelbosje 2, NL-9747 AE Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen; University of Groningen,"Bolderdijk, JW (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Mkt, Nettelbosje 2, NL-9747 AE Groningen, Netherlands.",e.woerdman@rug.nl; j.w.bolderdijk@rug.nl,,"Bolderdijk, Jan Willem/0000-0003-2358-6932; Woerdman, Edwin/0000-0003-2883-160X",,,,,111,7,7,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

We analyze the behaviors of subjects in an experimental environment in which it is possible to observe expectations directly, since the sole task of each player is to predict the future price of an asset. We investigate the mechanism of expectation formation in two different contexts: first, where the fundamental value is constant; second, where the fundamental price increases over repetitions. First of all, we look at whether there is a convergence to the rational equilibrium even if agents have adaptive expectations, according to the main results of Palestrini and Gallegati (2015). Moreover, we concentrate on the accuracy of aggregate forecasts compared with individual forecasts. We find that there is collective rationality instead of individual rationality. In the context of an increasing fundamental value, contrary to theoretical predictions, players are able to capture the trend, but underestimate that value. This implies that there is no full convergence to the rational expectations equilibrium if all agents make their forecasts according to an adaptive scheme.

Our identification strategy exploits a quasi-experimental feature of a reform in Slovakia that shifted the school grade during which high-stakes exams are taken by 1 year. This reform enables us to compare students at the moment when they pass these exams with students in the same grade 1 year ahead of the exams. Using data from the low-stakes international TIMSS skills survey and employing difference-in-difference methodology, we find that the occurrence of high-stakes admission exams increased 10-year-old students' math test scores by 0.2 standard deviations, on average. This effect additionally accrues by around 0.05 standard deviations among students with the highest probability of being admitted to selective schools.

Under negligence, uncertainty aversion calls for a higher standard of care if, and only if, the safest prevention measures are also the most reliable ones (i.e., they reduce the uncertainty perceived by the victim). Strict liability dominates negligence when the injurer has lower degrees of uncertainty aversion than the victim and can formulate more precise estimates of the probability of harm. When harm is dispersed on a very large number of victims, however, negligence dominates independently of their degree of uncertainty aversion.","[Franzoni, Luigi Alberto] Univ Bologna, Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Franzoni, LA (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",luigi.franzoni@unibo.it,"Franzoni, Luigi Alberto/AAC-9520-2022","Franzoni, Luigi Alberto/0000-0002-6116-5373",,,,,47,10,11,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1465-7252,1465-7260,,AM LAW ECON REV,Am.

Moreover, we show empirically that a considerable number of patents are litigated across multiple European jurisdictions; and further, that in the majority of these cases divergent case outcomes are reached across the different jurisdictions, suggesting that the long-suspected problem of inconsistency of decision-making in European patent litigation is in fact real.

The improvement of these facilities is a major challenge as most of the Governments are not only finding it difficult to provide an additional subsidy for the improvement but are also hesitant to increase the fare because of socio-political reasons. In this context, the present paper demonstrates an approach for investigating the rationality of fare increment with reference to a case study of transfer facilities at metro stations in Kolkata city, India. Rationality of the fare increment is judged by comparing the fare increment with (i) benefits likely to be transferred to commuters due to improvement, (ii) present fare, and (iii) average daily income of metro commuters. The work also highlights the need for quantifying the benefits likely to be transferred to commuters from the proposed improvements for relating the fare increment to derived benefits. It is shown that if the fare increment is found rational then facilities should be developed by recovering the associated cost from commuters without putting the additional financial burden on the Government. The Government subsidy should be introduced only when it is required to bring down the fare increment to a level which is considered rational. The findings will hopefully encourage policy makers to apply the approach to other contexts for improvement of transport facility or quality of service with a rational increment of fare and use of Government subsidy, as and when required.","[Sadhukhan, Shubhajit] Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, RCG Sch Infrastruct Design & Management, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India; [Banerjee, Uttam K.] Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Dept Architecture & Reg Planning, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India; [Maitra, Bhargab] Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Dept Civil Engn, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur,"Maitra, B (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Dept Civil Engn, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India.",shubhajit.iitkgp@gmail.com; ukb@arp.iitkgp.ernet.in; bhargab@civil.iitkgp.ernet.in,"Sadhukhan, Shubhajit/L-2121-2018; Sadhukhan, Shubhajit/AAF-3263-2021","Sadhukhan, Shubhajit/0000-0001-5245-3480; Maitra, Bhargab/0000-0003-2083-9930",,,,,34,6,6,1,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

The credit crisis of 2008-2009 provoked added concern about the use of models in finance. Measuring and managing model risk has subsequently come under scrutiny from regulators, supervisors, banks and other financial institutions. Regulatory guidance indicates that meticulous monitoring of all phases of model development and implementation is required to mitigate this risk. Considerable resources must be mobilised for this purpose. The exercise must embrace model development, assembly, implementation, validation and effective governance. Setting: Model validation practices are generally patchy, disparate and sometimes contradictory, and although the Basel Accord and some regulatory authorities have attempted to establish guiding principles, no definite set of global standards exists. Aim: Assessing the available literature for the best validation practices. Methods: This comprehensive literature study provided a background to the complexities of effective model management and focussed on model validation as a component of model risk management. Results: We propose a coherent 'best practice' framework for model validation. Scorecard tools are also presented to evaluate if the proposed best practice model validation framework has been adequately assembled and implemented. Conclusion: The proposed best practice model validation framework is designed to assist firms in the construction of an effective, robust and fully compliant model validation programme and comprises three principal elements: model validation governance, policy and process.","[de Jongh, Pieter J.

However, in circumstances characterised by negative emotions, duress and stress, very little is known about how human beings respond at the subconscious level to the attractiveness of frontline service providers. Aim: The purpose of this study was to assess whether consumers who complain to a frontline service provider about a service failure respond differently at the subconscious level when the service provider involved in the service encounter is attractive compared with one who is less attractive. Method: Forty respondents were exposed to a video clip of a service failure and service recovery situation. While viewing the hypothetical scenario, two neuro-physiological measurements were used to collect data at the subconscious level, namely galvanic skin response (GSR) and electroencephalography (EEG). Results: The results suggest that, at the subconscious level, customers respond differently to the service recovery efforts depending on the attractiveness of the frontline service provider who attempts to rectify the service failure. Conclusion: The results seem to suggest that the physical attractiveness of a frontline service provider moderates (or softens) the negative emotions that a complaining customer might experience during a service failure and complaint situation -consistent with the ' what is beautiful is good' contention.","[Boshoff, Christo] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Business Management, Stellenbosch, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"Boshoff, C (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Business Management, Stellenbosch, South Africa.",cboshoff@sun.ac.za,,,,,,,82,0,0,2,10,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Examples include targeted price promotions that are made available through on-site couponing and forecasts of market segments for which new products have been developed. One challenge in the production of disaggregate forecasts of demand, and of consumer responses to marketing actions, relates to the limited amount of data that is available at the individual level.

In difficult economic limes, it is more important than ever for public transport systems to reduce revenue loss through fare evasion to better target income and service supply to available budgets. This paper reports the results of a major project seeking to reduce fare evasion by better understanding the psychological factors causing evasion. The focus of the research is Melbourne Australia where some $Aust55M/(sic)35Mp.a. (average 2005-2011) is lost through fare evasion representing 11.6% of ridership (in May 2012). The major aim of the research is to identify, using empirical, research the factors influencing passengers to either deliberately or unintentionally fare evade. A web-based survey was administered to residents of Melbourne, Australia with a total sample size of 1561. The questionnaire was introduced as a survey about transit travel and ticketing but included questions about various aspects of fare evasion behaviour. The research developed a new framework for fare evasion psychology based on the concept of 'Consumer Misbehaviour' and the Theory of Planned Behaviour to explain intention to fare evade as a function of attitudes, norms, perceived control, servicescape perceptions and personality factors. The framework is tested using Structural Equation Modelling Two statistically significant models were developed to explain 'deliberate' and 'unintentional' fare evasion. The 'deliberate' evasion model showed that honesty attributes, perceived ease of evasion and permissive attitudes to evasion were the key explanatory factors. For 'unintentional' evasion, honest and permissive attitudes were also significant however 'ticketing competence' was also influential. The paper explores how the findings are to be used to reduce evasion rates including areas for future research. The research has been applied by authorities to considerably reduce fare evasion rates in Melbourne, Australia.","[Currie, Graham; Delbosc, Alexa] Monash Univ, Inst Transport Studies, Dept Civil Engn, Publ Transport Res Grp, 23 Coll Walk, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",Monash University,"Currie, G (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Inst Transport Studies, Dept Civil Engn, Publ Transport Res Grp, 23 Coll Walk, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",graham.currie@monash.edu,"Currie, Graham/P-5431-2019; Currie, Graham/ABC-6611-2020; Delbosc, Alexa/ABG-5920-2020","Currie, Graham/0000-0001-7190-7548; Delbosc, Alexa/0000-0001-8744-3469",Public Transport Victoria (PTV),Public Transport Victoria (PTV),This research was funded by Public Transport Victoria (PTV).

Using existing data from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveys and the Uniform Crime Reports, and newly-collected data on school shootings, we find little evidence that the typical state ABL is effective in improving school safety and student well-being. However, this null finding masks substantial policy heterogeneity. State mandates that require school districts to implement strong, comprehensive anti-bullying policies are associated with a 7 to 13 % reduction in school violence and an 8 to 12 % reduction in bullying. In addition, our results show that strong anti-bullying policy mandates are associated with a reduction in minor teen school shooting deaths and violent crime arrests, suggesting potentially important spillover effects.","[Sabia, Joseph J.] San Diego State Univ, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Sabia, Joseph J.] Univ New Hampshire, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Sabia, Joseph J.] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Bass, Brittany] Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA USA",California State University System; San Diego State University; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Sabia, JJ (通讯作者)，San Diego State Univ, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.;Sabia, JJ (通讯作者)，Univ New Hampshire, Durham, NH 03824 USA.;Sabia, JJ (通讯作者)，Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany.",joseph.sabia@unh.edu; bassb@uci.edu,,,,,,,84,30,55,4,70,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Gen Xers (people born between 1965 and 1979/1980) also use the digital environment to seek information about the characteristics of products selected during the purchasing process, but in parallel with traditional channels of communication, which they continue to heavily rely upon. Being aware of these realities, the authors conducted an exploratory empirical study of Generation X, Y and Z members in an emerging market (Romania), which highlights the way these generations identify the products that best suit their expectations and preferences. In their study, the authors set to identify the relevant factors that determine the use of social networks by the three generations of consumers to communicate and seek information, as well as the connection between social media communication and information seeking, and the use of personal sources of information (family, friends, colleagues, other consumers) during the buying decision-making process.","[Dabija, Dan-Cristian; Babut, Raluca] Babes Bolyai Univ Cluj Napoca, Dept Mkt, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Teodor Mihali 58-60, RO-400591 Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Dinu, Vasile] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Business & Tourism, Dept Business Consumer Sci & Qual Management, 41 Dacia Blvd,Dist 1, Bucharest, Romania; [Lugojan, Madalina Ioana] Babes Bolyai Univ Cluj Napoca, Dept Mkt, Teodor Mihali 58-60, RO-400591 Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Lugojan, Madalina Ioana] Babes Bolyai Univ Cluj Napoca, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Int Business Management, Teodor Mihali 58-60, RO-400591 Cluj Napoca, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj; Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Babes Bolyai University from Cluj; Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Dabija, DC (通讯作者)，Babes Bolyai Univ Cluj Napoca, Dept Mkt, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Teodor Mihali 58-60, RO-400591 Cluj Napoca, Romania.",cristian.dabija@econ.ubbcluj.ro; raluca.babu@econ.ubbcluj.ro; dinu_cbz@yahoo.com; madalina.lugojan@econ.ubbcluj.ro,"Babut, Raluca/ABC-1612-2020; Dabija, Dan-Cristian/I-8101-2012; Dinu, Vasile/L-5051-2017","Dabija, Dan-Cristian/0000-0002-8265-175X; Dinu, Vasile/0000-0003-3606-2548","Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI [PN-II-RU-TE-2014-4-0312]","Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI","This work was supported by a grant of the Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI, project number PN-II-RU-TE-2014-4-0312.",,86,43,43,3,55,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The discipline is not scientifically spread nowadays in a significant way. One of the main reasons might be the lack of knowledge about process mining and advantages one can achieve with it. In this paper, firstly, we present systematic literature review in the form of state of the art in the process mining field.

Conduct risk comes about when financial services companies conduct themselves in an inappropriate way towards their customers, resulting in a negative (economic) outcome for the customer. What makes the management and mitigation of conduct risk by banks so different is that it cannot be easily integrated into a bank's standard risk management framework. So far, the concept of conduct risk has not been formally covered by the Basel Accords. Aim: There are, however, global efforts by international organisations and local regulators to control it - with little clarity on the 'how'. The aim of this study is to explore this 'how'. Setting: While regulators need to protect customers, resulting in a positive outcome for the customer, they must also ensure that banks take conduct risk management and its mitigation seriously. At the same time, any regulatory model for conduct risk needs to be incorporated into the existing bank regulatory strategy and methodology and assimilated with the profile of a country. Methods: An exploratory model that regulators could use to keep conduct risk at bay is developed based on primary and secondary data and this is then applied to the South African, Kenyan and Malaysian milieus to determine what can be learnt about conduct risk in emerging economies. Results: The model investigates the interrelationships between different goals that regulators ideally need to achieve and the findings show that regulators have a difficult task balancing these goals and at the same time achieving a positive outcome. Conclusion: Based on the model, the recommendation for regulators in the developing world would be to collaborate in their approach to conduct risk, as they might face similar difficulties and operate in a comparable context.","[Hargarter, Antje] Milpk Educ, Sch Investment & Banking, Johannesburg, South Africa; [van Vuuren, Gary] North West Univ, Sch Econ, Dept Risk Management, Potchefstroom, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"Hargarter, A (通讯作者)，Milpk Educ, Sch Investment & Banking, Johannesburg, South Africa.",antje.hargarter@milpark.ac.za,"van Vuuren, Gary/B-5453-2019","van Vuuren, Gary/0000-0001-6811-0538",,,,,42,3,4,0,4,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

In this paper, the author clarifies the various mechanisms of land policy to the real estate market, which will provide effective scientific basis for drafting policies to regulate the real-estate industry, as well as provide a reference for decision-making.","[HengTian] Tianjin Univ Finance & Econ, Tianjin 300222, Peoples R China",Tianjin University of Finance & Economics,"HengTian (通讯作者)，Tianjin Univ Finance & Econ, Tianjin 300222, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,2,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-407-1,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2017,168,,,,,,299,304,,,,,,6,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI9GO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416079900065,0

Empirical analysis (by means of descriptive statistics, logistic regression and classification tree models) indicates that private convertibles are typically issued by nonprofitable, more leveraged firms with higher growth opportunities, which is similar to findings for straight debt. Companies with a poor financial performance decide to offer convertible bonds on the private market, perhaps in order to speed up raising capital from a small group of lenders able to carry out due-diligence process relatively fast. Second, using private convertible debt may help firms to undertake valuable projects and enable them to accelerate investment by alleviating the debt overhang problem which should result in improving their weak financial results.","[Kazmierczak, Damian] Univ Lodz, Dept Corp Finance & Strategy, Fac Management, Matejki 22-26, PL-90237 Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Kazmierczak, D (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Dept Corp Finance & Strategy, Fac Management, Matejki 22-26, PL-90237 Lodz, Poland.",damian.kazmierczak@uni.lodz.pl,"Kaźmierczak, Damian/GZH-1325-2022","Kaźmierczak, Damian/0000-0002-7133-2665; Kazmierczak, Damian/0000-0003-1620-8941",,,,,26,0,0,1,7,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-499-5,,,,2017,,,,,,,412,421,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ7IS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427306200043,0

However, the associated forecast errors follow nonstandard distributions that complicate forecast evaluation tests. We propose a finite sample simulation-based solution to this problem. The method requires a flexible parametric null model that can be simulated as long as a finite dimension nuisance parameter can be specified. The size control of our method is robust to non-standard limiting distributions, such as degenerate asymptotic distribution problems that arise from nested and unit root models. Our simulation studies demonstrate that many of the existing forecast evaluation methods, including various bootstraps, over-reject for highly persistent data. In contrast, our method is level correct and has good power. We extend our approach to the inversion of forecast evaluation statistics in order to construct exact confidence sets for the benchmark model. Confidence sets provide much more information than tests, particularly in the case of the persistence -adjusted relevance of predictive regressors (Rossi, 2005).

In addition to variables that describe the natural production of wood, into these models flow among others also such variables that depict nature conservation legislation, market contexts, etc. The limited availability of large amounts of data and more particularly of precise data to all these subject areas considerably weakens the validity of the models. Our study therefore takes up the challenge to develop a model, as simple as possible, that can help to estimate export and import volumes as well as export and import prices of raw timber in Germany. To this end, we apply the technique of time series analysis and develop a simple model that allows for short-term and medium-term forecasting in the German forest sector. We show that using a vector error correction model (VECM) can succeed in a relatively simple modelling of future quantities and prices of raw timber for Germany.

The authors are using the method of comparison, while the results of tax burden for fictitious persons with different incomes are calculated according to current legislation. The analysis shows gradual decline of tax burden together with the growing inequality of its distribution in different forms of labor. Although the Czech government declares the support of development of small and medium entrepreneurship, the biggest decline has occurred in the tax burden of legal persons. The analysis illustrates that the most important factor determining the unequal levels of tax burden is the size of contribution on social and health insurance.

Analysis of different forms and models of collective financing marketplaces showed that crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending becomes a good alternative to traditional sources of funding.

Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to analyze data. The results indicate the following. Store image variables (except product quality) and store awareness affect repurchase intention directly or indirectly through private label image.

One of currently ever-spreading technologies is cloud computing. Transfer from the current infrastructure to cloud computing one is risky and expensive matter. The main question when considering cloud computing employment is the investment's effectiveness and return on investment. The aim of this contribution is to present a model and web application for cloud computing investments evaluation, which will allow customers to answer the main question whether migration from current IT infrastructure to cloud method is suitable or not. The model specifies return on investment based on chosen economic indicators as well as suitability of the solution in regard to characteristics and chosen aspects of company management. Among the main methods used during the model development are multi-criteria variant analysis, quantitative analysis by professional discussions while assembling the model, verification of the initial model with companies, its modification, and application development. The model is based on Cost Benefit Analysis method, and therefore it allows for considering qualitative variables, by which it significantly differs from the existing web calculators for cloud method cost calculations. Furthermore, the developed application is vendor independent and it is based on the following principles: requirement of inputs that take into account the specifics of companies, scalability and complexity in the form of static and dynamic economic indicators and includes sensitivity analysis and thus enables recalculate the result and based on a certain % change of input parameters.","[Maresova, Petra; Sobeslav, Vladimir] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic",University of Hradec Kralove,"Maresová, P (通讯作者)，Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.",petra.maresova@uhk.cz; Vladimir.sobeslav@uhk.cz,"Sobeslav, Vladimir/J-7809-2013; Maresova, Petra/L-1743-2017","Sobeslav, Vladimir/0000-0002-0917-5988; Maresova, Petra/0000-0002-1218-501X","TACR [TG0 2010020]; project of internal specific research (University of Hradec Kralove, Faculty of Informatics and Management)","TACR; project of internal specific research (University of Hradec Kralove, Faculty of Informatics and Management)","This research was supported by the following projects TACR Applications for the economic evaluation of the migration of IT infrastructure into the cloud no.

However, for the so-called Stage II of non-profit organisations, namely, spending the achieved resources to program services delivery, DEA studies are very scarce. In attempting to address this research gap and to the best of our knowledge, this investigation is the first study that applies DEA to the assessment of international cooperation schemata. Consequently, we offer a significant contribution to the literature by overcoming the limitations of other techniques used to assess the efficiency and providing new insight into the efficiency of targeted different international cooperation schemata (ICS) in international cooperation development projects. Aim: The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the efficiency of the ICS of developmental projects funded by the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation for Development. Setting: Our setting is composed of different international cooperation projects funded with different schemata by the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation for Development between 2002 and 2006 in two African countries that are top priority targets of Spanish international aid: Morocco, and Mozambique. Methods: Using a sample of 48 international cooperation projects carried out in two African countries considered priorities in the Spanish Cooperation Master Plan, we analyse project efficiency using DEA. Results: The findings suggest that some schemata are more efficient than others when applied to international cooperation projects (ICS). Specifically, we find that permanent open-call subsidies are more efficient than non-governmental development organisation subsidies. Conclusion: Measures for evaluating international aid projects with respect to efficiency are problematic. The DEA method provides an ex-post meausure of efficiency that allows for the measurement in a specific and objetive way of the results achieved by each project and to propose corrective actions for the future. The comparison among ICS provides an opportunity to identify the conditions under which an ICs may achieve greater efficiency.","[Martin-Perez, Victor; Martin-Cruz, Natalia] Univ Valladolid, Business Sch, Dept Business & Mkt, E-47002 Valladolid, Spain",Universidad de Valladolid,"Martin-Perez, V (通讯作者)，Univ Valladolid, Business Sch, Dept Business & Mkt, E-47002 Valladolid, Spain.",vmartin@eco.uva.es,"Pérez, Víctor Martín/ABG-7308-2020; CRUZ, NATALIA MARTIN/N-5217-2014","Pérez, Víctor Martín/0000-0002-0532-9425; CRUZ, NATALIA MARTIN/0000-0002-5687-4060",AECID [08-CAP2-0770],AECID,"The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments, as they have proved very helpful towards improving the manuscript by providing further work or additional clarification when required.

Aim: This article seeks to identify the determinants of the capital structure of Portuguese firms with direct investment in Angola and to understand whether the determinants normally considered by standard finance theory are in line with those used by firms when structuring their capital structure policy to participate in the specific market of Angola. Setting: This article examines 26 large Portuguese firms with investments in Angola using econometric panel data for the period 2006-2010. Methods: The study applied fixed and random effects methods and panel-corrected standard errors that maintain efficiency and unbiased behaviour even in the presence of panel-level heteroscedasticity and contemporaneous correlation of observations among panels. Results: The results provide evidence that the determinants normally considered by standard finance theory are in fact - in terms of sign and coefficient dimension - those used by firms for structuring their capital structure policy when involved in the internationalisation process of entering Angola. Specifically, age, asset structure, return on assets and tangibility have a positive influence on the capital structure of Portuguese firms that have invested in Angola, while non-debt tax shields and liquidity have a negative influence on these companies' leverage ratios. When comparing our results with studies that have analysed the capital structure determinants of listed Portuguese firms - firms belonging to the PSI 20 Index and large firms in the Portuguese corporate sector - we found similarities in the sign and coefficient dimension of the determinants of capital structure. However, the profitability coefficient sign is in line with the trade-off framework (i.e. profitability is positively related to debt) but not with pecking order theory (i.e. profitability is negatively related to debt). Conclusion: Our results suggest that the high-growth Angolan market is seen by larger Portuguese firms as a low-risk diversification process because of the economic hardship Portugal has gone through, as well as cultural and linguistic similarities to Portugal. As such, the Angolan market is seen as an extension of the Portuguese domestic market that has increased potential. This scenario potentially reduces the firm default probability and the cost of debt. Maintaining the tax shield benefits of debt and decreasing the cost of debt - through a reduction in the default probability - have induced profitable firms to use more debt.","[Mota, Jorge H.

The remarkable findings could be concluded as follows: (1) University types relate to modes in a certain degree. National universities tend to have R&D collaboration with firms, while other types of university do not predominantly rely on any specific mode. Not only government policy, historical background does matter as well. (2) Instead of university type, types of modes are likely to relate to the size of collaborating firm. Large firms tend to be potential R&D partners, whereas small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are focused partners for consulation. (3) Socio-economic characteristics of the location where universities are located affect roles of universities in supporting industry. National universities in local area often work with both large firms and SMEs in order to respond to local demands. In addition, universities' specialisations perhaps influence university and industry collaboration. Different types of universities having relatively high specialisation in engineering courses have similar roles in supporting industry and (4) country contexts influence roles of universities due to different policy focuses, and different levels of universities and firms' technological capabilities. Japanese university-industry collaboration seem to focus more on R&D acitivities, comparing to Thai universities.","[Pittayasophon, Siriporn; Intarakumnerd, Patarapong] Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies, GRIPS Innovat Sci & Technol Policy Program, Tokyo, Japan; [Pittayasophon, Siriporn] Natl Sci Technol & Innovat Policy Off, Directorate Innovat Policy, Bangkok, Thailand",National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies,"Intarakumnerd, P (通讯作者)，Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies, GRIPS Innovat Sci & Technol Policy Program, Tokyo, Japan.",doc13151@grips.ac.jp,,"Intarakumnerd, Patarapong/0000-0001-6190-1388",,,,,21,6,6,0,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

However, Greek consumers demand from domestic companies to respond in a higher extent to their economic goals compared to their foreign counterparts. Moreover, they tend to favor national companies since they were found to be more willing to pay a higher price for domestic than for foreign products.

Using individual corporate data (sample of 5,033 firm-year observations), wide dispersion both in performance and taxation is documented. The domicile of the parent has an impact on the subsidiary's effective tax rate. The effective taxation of Czech subsidiaries under control of foreign listed parents is significantly lower than for other Czech companies. Despite exhibiting some kind of tax avoidance, data reveal high variability in relative tax rates, suggesting that the majority of foreign parents from western and northern EU countries prefer to tax profits in the Czech Republic rather than to shift them elsewhere. The shifting profits to the Czech Republic results in superior reported performance of affected subsidiaries. On the other hand, empirical evidence shows that parents from southern EU countries search the way how to avoid taxation.

This uncontested popularity, doubled by an exaggerated use of the term, led to dilution and stereotype use, being rendered innocuous and used in connection with a multitude of activities and life situations. Starting from the concepts of manager, leader or manager - leader, I have tried, through a qualitative study, to analyze the perception of the employees regarding the meaning of the notion of chief and to place the chief, according to the perception of the employees, between the manager and the leader. I made this research in two stages. In the first stage, I have interviewed 100 persons with authority in the public and private area, using the Delphi technique, trying to identify the the main 15 abilities necessary to a manager and 15 necessary to a leader, in the opinion of the respondents. I relied on their managerial experience, minimum 3 years on management positions, without structuring the specimen based on the management level, age, studies or gender. The only structuring I made was based on the field where the management was manifested - public or private. After the identification of the abilities, I requested to a number of 100 employees in the private and public environment, to choose, undifferentiated, 20 of them, which would be adequate, in their opinion, for the chief. I analyzed if the 20 identified features belong to the psycho - behavioral profile of the manager or of the leader. In this way, I wanted to find out if the employee in the public field, for instance, when he thinks about his chief, considers him closer to the manager or closer to the leader.","[Pruna, Stefan] Alexandra Ioan Cuza Police Acad, Bucharest, Romania",,"Pruna, S (通讯作者)，Alexandra Ioan Cuza Police Acad, Bucharest, Romania.",stefanpruna@yahoo.com,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,0,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",2286-1440,,,INT MANAGE CONF,,,2017,,,,,,,718,728,,,,,,11,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM6KT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000466917100074,0

Investment decision making is described as a game between two players. Since a real options approach is used to find the value of an investment project, the paper falls in the field of real options games (ROG). Analysis of these games may help explain some aspects of firm behavior and give guidelines for managers. It appears that in a purely competitive environment a real options framework will only be applicable when the classic NPV is definitely negative, even if economic calculations indicate its use at positive NPV. Firms which create a coopetition relationship should be more interested in using real options approach. Furthermore, in order for firms to keep their coopetition agreement and receive greater benefits, high-risk projects should be a greater incentive than low-risk projects.","[Rychlowska-Musial, Elzbieta] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Rychlowska-Musial, E (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Poznan, Poland.",elzbieta.musial@ue.poznan.pl,,,,,,,8,4,4,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,,978-3-319-54885-2; 978-3-319-54884-5,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,285,295,,10.1007/978-3-319-54885-2_26,0.0,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI5UA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412819500026,0

However, especially for very big portfolios of clients, also the fraud management and post-approval portfolio monitoring becomes essential. Since the fraud patterns are often complicated, the analyses become multi-variate and the number of hypotheses grows exponentially. Also the number of observations in each segment decreases and the rate of frauds gets statistically insignificant. This paper deals with two principle problems in fraud detection - identifying the segments with high default concentrations and finding these segments in a big data sample. For the purpose of the identification, several methods are suggested and the proposed expert binomial test is concluded to be the most relevant for this task. Then for finding the segments the GUHA method is discussed and compared with the classification tree method on a real set of data from the financial market. In this comparison the GUHA method brings more comprehensive results containing all possible predictor combinations, whereas the classification tree method was quicker and covered the most relevant distinct segments.","[Rychnovsky, Michal] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Stat & Probabil, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Rychnovsky, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Stat & Probabil, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague, Czech Republic.",michal@rychnovsky.com,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,2,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-499-5,,,,2017,,,,,,,731,740,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ7IS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427306200076,0

Nevertheless, attention is nowadays more than ever paid to quality of children's lives, including their diet. Therefore, the question is how large the impact of the marketing directed at children is, and how to teach children to be selective and resistant to such impacts in order to develop healthy instead of capricious consumer habits. Food and beverages are omnipresent elements in advertising, and children's programmes are particularly abundant with advertisements for junk food, such as candies, fast food and sweetened drinks. The answer to the question why we need restrictions in the promotion of food and drinks intended for children lies in the dramatic increase in the levels of childhood obesity and diet -related diseases in the recent years, with alarming statistics showing the need for action. Taking into consideration the afore -mentioned situation, it is necessary to urge the government and industry to act by imposing restrictions in advertising, as well as parents as the main co -participants who most often buy products that appeal to children. Although there are specific regulations in certain countries or e.g. at the European or global level, some regulations are not in line with each other, and they are generally not comprehensive. In the absence of complete prohibition of marketing of unhealthy food, which is impossible to implement due to advertising freedom, there is a need for comprehensive and consistent approach that would not only regulate the quantity of advertising the unhealthy'', but also emphasize the need for advertising and imposing high nutritional value diet to children, which is important for their growth and development. Such initiatives would probably result in significant contribution to combating international epidemic of childhood obesity, and increasingly frequent health problems related to nutrition. These problems in children most often relate specifically with the negative influence the media has on children, which is done through promotion of food with low nutritional values, and low -nutrient and high -energy -density food.","[Smit, Marija; Smit, Zorislav] Fac Econ, Osijek, Croatia; [Smit, Zorislav] Gradnja Ltd, Osijek, Croatia",,"Smit, M (通讯作者)，Fac Econ, Osijek, Croatia.",marija.jelic.028@gmail.com; zorislav.smit@gmail.com,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,8,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2017,13,,,,,,501,520,,,,,,20,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM4RS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000463854000034,0

In the proposed approach, the most appropriate alternative is the alternative with the largest number of appearances in the first position or in ranking lists, or the one determined based on negotiations of decision makers/experts. The proposed ARCAS approach is based on the use of the ARAS method, a new normalization procedure, and the SWARA method. In the proposed approach, each decision maker/expert involved in evaluation has an opportunity to set the preferred level of rating for each criterion used in such evaluation.

The bottom-up activity of society, that actively entered the process of rural policy in the past decade, accelerated several new discourses in field. By questioning the underlying support principles and justification of the public value, created by farmers that are subject to the support, the general public elucidated the existing gap between multifunctionality and sustainability in agriculture. Some insights had been proposed to close the gap with the help of corporate social responsibility (CSR). This entails to perform a study concerning farmer's social responsibility from a broader rural development perspective. The aim of this study is to explain farmer's social responsibility as a challenge for the twenty-first century, as well as possible conceptual framework for meeting transformations of post-industrial rural development. Research results show that using the systemic approach towards on-going transformations in post-industrial rural development, farmer's social responsibility originates alongside multifunctionality, endogenous development, place-based approach and network conceptions in relationships and interactions among agricultural stakeholders throughout the local and global value chains, and thus make an impact on social welfare and inclusive economic development issues next to the broadly discussed environmental concerns.","[Vilke, Rita; Pareigiene, Lina] Lithuanian Inst Agr Econ, Dept Rural Dev, Vilnius, Lithuania; [Stalgiene, Aldona] Lithuanian Inst Agr Econ, Dept Farm & Enterprises Econ, Vilnius, Lithuania",Lithuanian Institute of Agrarian Economics; Lithuanian Institute of Agrarian Economics,"Vilke, R (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Inst Agr Econ, Dept Rural Dev, Vilnius, Lithuania.",rita.vilke@gmail.com; lina.pareigiene@laei.lt; aldona.stalgiene@laei.lt,,"Stalgiene, Aldona/0000-0002-9791-7864",Research Council of Lithuania [MIP-098/2015],Research Council of Lithuania(Research Council of Lithuania (LMTLT)),This research was funded by a grant (No. MIP-098/2015) from the Research Council of Lithuania.,,38,0,0,1,12,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-54112-9; 978-3-319-54111-2,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2017,7,,,,,,231,244,,10.1007/978-3-319-54112-9_14,0.0,,,14,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ4CE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000424822700014,0

This paper systematically examines the labor market consequences of China's family planning policies. First, we briefly review the historical evolution of China's family planning policies and the existing literature. Second, we investigate the effects of these policies on the labor market, focusing on the size and quality of the working-age population and its age and gender composition. We give special attention to regional differences in the demographic structure resulting from the interaction of the family planning policies and internal migration. Finally, we discuss ongoing and prospective policy changes and their potential consequences. Although urban areas and coastal provinces have implemented stricter family planning policies, our analysis shows that because of internal migration, the aging problem is more severe in rural areas and in inland provinces. Our simulation results further indicate that the new two-child policy might fall short of pulling China out of its aging situation.","[Wang, Fei; Zhao, Liqiu; Zhao, Zhong] Renmin Univ China, Sch Labor & Human Resources, Beijing, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,"Zhao, Z (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Labor & Human Resources, Beijing, Peoples R China.",mr.zhong.zhao@gmail.com,"Wang, Fei/AAT-3876-2020","Wang, Fei/0000-0002-6774-6670; Zhao, Zhong/0000-0003-3587-400X",Natural Science Foundation of China [71403286]; Center for Labor Economics and Public Policy at Zhejiang University; Special Fund for Building World-Class Universities and Disciplines through the Renmin University of China [16XNL005],Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Center for Labor Economics and Public Policy at Zhejiang University; Special Fund for Building World-Class Universities and Disciplines through the Renmin University of China,Liqiu Zhao acknowledges financial support from the Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 71403286) and the Center for Labor Economics and Public Policy at Zhejiang University.

In fact, as many of them were approved before 2010, they didn't include a precise methodology for the further analysis of the proposed and/or implemented mobility measures. So, this evaluation of the mobility plans, their results and the comparison between cities and their evolution towards a more sustainable mobility represents nowadays a challenge in many cases. In 2011, the Spanish Law for a Sustainable Economy (Law 2/2011) was approved, which encouraged local administrations to create a SUMP. The approval of a SUMP was compulsory to local authorities to get any public funding for public transport projects. The main objectives of these plans were not only the reduction of the urban congestion and pollution, but also to encourage the citizens to change their habits so they are less car-dependent and more active in their daily trips. However, it is still necessary an evaluation to confirm that these SUMPS have represented a substantial change in terms of logistics and management of the transports and vehicles, both private and public, as well as of behaviour and habits of the citizens. The main objective of this paper is to show the results of a research conducted on 38 Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans. The cities are all members of the Spanish Network of Smart Cities (Red Espanola de Ciudades Inteligentes -RECI-). The SUMPs are analysed, addressing the identification and evaluation of the different specifically proposed mobility measures included in plans, the degree of definition of them, the costs, the implementation programs, etc. Also, follow-up programs were discussed. First, an analysis was made of the diagnosis of the mobility situation in each location according to the diagnosis document included in many of the SUMPs. The second stage consisted on the analysis of the measures in the plan, considering sixteen indicators, such as accessibility, intermodality, pedestrians or design of public space. Finally, it was also determined whether the document included a monitoring plan, a budget and a timeline. Through the comparison of the results, we obtain a brief overview about the evolution of efforts to get a more sustainable mobility in Spain. With these results, we finish our study proposing some guidelines for further analysis as well as for the new SUMPs that will be approved on the following years.","[Angel Mozos-Blanco, Miguel; Pozo-Menendez, Elisa] Univ Politecn Madrid, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Arce-Ruiz, Rosa; Baucells-Aleta, Neus] Univ Politecn Madrid, TRANSyT, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Baucells-Aletà, N (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Madrid, TRANSyT, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",madelosmozos@gmail.com; e.pozo@upm.es; rosa.arce.ruiz@upm.es; neus.baucells@upm.es,"Arce-Ruiz, Rosa/K-3479-2019; Arce-Ruiz, Rosa/T-3491-2018","Arce-Ruiz, Rosa/0000-0001-9897-509X; Pozo Menendez, Elisa/0000-0001-5420-7849; Mozos-Blanco, Miguel A./0000-0002-2448-6995",,,,,50,48,50,9,91,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

With increasing frustration over the reaction from Brussels, some are suggesting that an Irish exit from the EU would benefit the nation. A key argument for this is that it would allow for reintegration with the UK, thus reinstating close ties with one of its largest trading partners. Using a structurally estimated general equilibrium model, we estimate that such a move would substantially worsen the impacts of Brexit, with lower-skill and agricultural workers being disproportionately affected. This is due to the fact that while the UK is one of Ireland's most important trading partners, trade with the rest of the EU is much more important.","[Davies, Ronald B.] Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; [Francois, Joseph] Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, Bern, Switzerland",University College Dublin; University of Bern,"Davies, RB (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.",ronbdavies@gmail.com,"Francois, Joseph/B-6108-2017; Davies, Ronald/AAT-4531-2021","Francois, Joseph/0000-0002-4686-7780; Davies, Ron/0000-0002-9738-9256",,,,,13,2,2,0,4,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

The decision was made based on a field test of the potential risks of longer HGV op-eration monitored by the Federal Highway Research Institute (BASt). This study was mainly focused on safety concerns and less so on environmental impacts. To gain additional insight on the policy's climate effects, the state government of Baden-Wurttemberg and Daimler AG asked Prognos AG and thinkstep to investigate how longer HGV change the CO2-emissions from freight transport in Germany. In this paper, we present the impact of longer HGV on transport performance and CO2-emissions from road and rail freight transport under the conditions of the field test and for a future scenario. In addition to the quantitative analysis, the paper also presents a discussion of the factors that favor or hinder the use of long HGV in road freight transport in Germany. Our methodology draws on several very different sources. Expert interviews with carriers, shippers and forward-ers were vital in identifying the constraints for the use of longer HGV in road freight transport operations. Based on these interviews, we were able to define the potential demand for longer HGV in Germany by analyzing NST2007 goods classifications and by developing regional demand coefficients at the NUTS 3 level. Following a cross price elasticity approach, we estimated the intramodal (from conventional HGV) and inter-modal (from rail) shift that can be expected from the new policy under the different scenarios. The data base for affected transport volumes are the demand matrices of the 2030 Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan. Our transport cost calculations take into account detours caused by the restrictions for long HGV use in Germany. The modal shift results served as input for the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions in freight transport in Germany with and without longer HGV. The calculation is based on fuel consumption functions established by analyzing theoretical and operational values obtained from both conventional and longer HGV operators, rele-vant vehicle parameters as well as specific power supply sources. The results give a detailed look on the climate impact that can be expected from longer HGV operations in Germany.","[Eckert, Stefan; Faltenbacher, Michael] Thinkstep, Stuttgart, Germany; [Gutberlet, Theresa; Kienzler, Hans-Paul; Labinsky, Alexander] Prognos AG, Basel, Switzerland",,"Labinsky, A (通讯作者)，Prognos AG, Basel, Switzerland.",alexander.labinsky@prognos.com,,,Daimler AG; Landesanstalt fur Umwelt Baden-Wurttemberg,Daimler AG; Landesanstalt fur Umwelt Baden-Wurttemberg,This study was funded to equal parts by Daimler AG and Landesanstalt fur Umwelt Baden-Wurttemberg.

Since the 2000s, biofuel production has been rapidly developing to address issues of economic development, energy poverty and reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, the sustainability of biofuels is being challenged, particularly at the environmental level, due to their impact on deforestation and the GHG emissions they can generate as a result of land-use changes. In order to isolate the impact of bioethanol and biodiesel production among classic determinants of deforestation, we used a fixed effects panel model of 112 low- and middle-income countries between 2001 and 2012. Firstly, we found a positive relationship between bioethanol production and deforestation in these countries, among which we highlighted the specificity of Upper-Middle-Income Countries (UMICs). An acceleration of incentives for the production of biofuels from 2006 onwards enabled us to highlight higher marginal impacts for the production of bioethanol in the case of low- and middle-income countries and UMICs. Secondly, for low- and middle-income countries, these results are not significant before 2006. Thirdly, biodiesel production appears to have an impact on deforestation before 2006 on both subsamples. These last two results seem surprising and could be related to the role of biofuel production technologies and the crop yields used in their production.","[Keles, Derya] Univ Lorraine, AgroParisTech, Univ Strasbourg, CNRS,INRA,BETA, F-54000 Nancy, France; [Choumert-Nkolo, Johanna] Econ Dev Initiat EDI Ltd, High Wycombe, Bucks, England; [Motel, Pascale Combes] Univ Clermont Auvergne, CNRS, IRD, CERDI, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Kere, Eric Nazindigouba] African Dev Bank AfDB, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire",INRAE; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; AgroParisTech; Universite de Lorraine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); African Development Bank Group (AfDB),"Keles, D (通讯作者)，14 Rue Girardet,CS 14216, F-54042 Nancy, France.",derya.keles@inra.fr; j.choumert.nkolo@surveybe.com; pascale.motel_combes@uca.fr; e.kere@afdb.org,"Combes Motel, Pascale/ABE-9633-2021","Combes Motel, Pascale/0000-0002-3532-2339; Keles, Derya/0000-0003-0755-0913",French National Research Agency (REVE project) [ANR-14-CE05-0008]; French Ministry of Research; BETA,"French National Research Agency (REVE project)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); French Ministry of Research(Ministry of Research, France); BETA","This work is part of a research project funded by the French National Research Agency (REVE project, ANR-14-CE05-0008) and the French Ministry of Research.

This study applies a particle filter algorithm for sequential estimation of volatility dynamics. In order to improve our estimation, the cross-asset class approach is adopted by adding option price information to the model. The entire estimation procedure including the derivation of theoretical option price is based on Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, so the method presented in this paper can be applied to diversified volatility models. Through the simulation study, we confirm that this method can estimate unknown volatility dynamics correctly, and the use of additional option prices improves both the accuracy and efficiency of volatility filtering. The sequential one-step-ahead prediction of the distribution of the KOSPI 200 index and index option prices shows that the additional option price information also enhances the prediction performance.","[Kwon, Tae Yeon] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Dept Int Finance, 81 Mohyeon Myeon, Yongin, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",Hankuk University Foreign Studies,"Kwon, TY (通讯作者)，Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Dept Int Finance, 81 Mohyeon Myeon, Yongin, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",tykwon@hufs.ac.kr,,"Kwon, Tae Yeon/0000-0002-0772-332X",,,,,22,0,0,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0277-6693,1099-131X,,J FORECASTING,J.

Mainly because of the recent population decrease in local areas, many local rail lines face severe declines in passenger numbers. When it comes to upholding unprofitable public transport, Sweden implemented a radical reform in 1988 by means of vertical separation and decentralisation, and then gradually introduced competitive tendering to procure unprofitable passenger rail services. In this paper, the situation in Japan, and primarily Hokkaido, is presented in some more detail, as well as the situation in Sweden. The study of railway operation and management in the two countries leads to a couple of lessons and implications for sustaining unprofitable but socially beneficial passenger railways.

This paper explores the time-series development of accessibility, using this poverty-relevant metric, in low-income residential areas of Johannesburg, biennially from 2009 to 2013 when accessibility patterns were altered as a result of investment in the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system. The results suggest that significant changes in accessibility are driven by improved affordability rather than spatial coverage enhancements, which were very marginal in this case. A difference-in-differences approach is adopted to explore the effects of access to the BRT on the subjective well-being of lower-income households. The model fails to find evidence that the additional accessibility provided by the BRT improves the general sense of well-being in the communities it serves. There is evidence however of well-being improvements among the narrower cohort of actual users of BRT, especially in terms of their satisfaction with their amount of free time. This suggests that the BRT in Johannesburg is beneficial as a transport project, but not yet as a general urban intervention able to leverage wider improvements in life satisfaction within served communities.","[Lionjanga, Nahungu; Venter, Christo] Univ Pretoria, Dept Civil Engn, Private Bag X20, ZA-0028 Hatfield, South Africa; [Venter, Christo] Univ Pretoria, Ctr Transport Dev, Private Bag X20, ZA-0028 Hatfield, South Africa",University of Pretoria; University of Pretoria,"Lionjanga, N (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Civil Engn, Private Bag X20, ZA-0028 Hatfield, South Africa.",nahungu.lionjanga@up.ac.za; christo.venter@up.ac.za,,"Venter, Christo/0000-0003-3480-3656",Volvo Education and Research Foundation via the BRT + Centre of Excellence,Volvo Education and Research Foundation via the BRT + Centre of Excellence,"The work of Willem Badenhorst and Johan du Toit from Mapable in assisting with software development is greatly appreciated.

In the current literature on public transport policy and governance, governments are generally seen as singular: the transport authority or the government. However, as has been well researched in administrative science, governments are not as singular and not as unitary as assumed by this literature. Different governments in an area operate on various scales of jurisdictions and their actions in a specific policy field are generally mutually dependent. These different levels of government do not necessarily coordinate their policies, as the scale differences drive different perspectives and objectives. This is conceptualised as multi-level governance with documented issues and practices that resonate in the provision of urban public transport. This paper presents the literature context of multi-level governance and its application to public transport provision through the examination of case studies. The hypothesis that the distribution of agency (decision power) and funding has a great deal of explanatory power for the public transport solutions that are implemented is examined in the context of case studies in the Netherlands, Australia and South Africa. These seek to demonstrate how the distribution of agency and funding over different layers of government explain the directions in which public transport service solutions have developed in recent times.","[Veeneman, Wijnand] Delft Univ Technol, Bldg 31,Jaffalaan 5,POB 5015, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands; [Mulley, Corinne] Univ Sydney, Business Sch, Inst Transport & Logist Studies C13, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",Delft University of Technology; University of Sydney,"Veeneman, W (通讯作者)，Delft Univ Technol, Bldg 31,Jaffalaan 5,POB 5015, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands.",w.w.veeneman@tudelft.nl; corinne.mulley@sydney.edu.au,"Mulley, Corinne/ACN-0179-2022; Veeneman, Wijnand/AAD-5722-2020; Londe, Pedro/AAG-2267-2019","Veeneman, Wijnand/0000-0002-8507-2286; Mulley, Corinne/0000-0001-6411-1269",,,,,34,18,20,5,22,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

This was a period in which Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) increasingly used physician cost control incentives but Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) did not. We show that cost growth and its components cannot be understood without accounting for (1) consumers' switching between plans, and (2) differences in cost characteristics between new entrants and those leaving the market. New entrants are markedly less costly than those leaving (and their costs fall after their entering year), so cost growth of continuing enrollees in a plan is significantly higher than average per-member cost growth. Relatively high-cost HMO members switch to PPOs while low-cost PPO members switch to HMOs, so the impact of cost control incentives on HMO costs is likely different from their impact on market-wide insurer costs.","[Ho, Kate] Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, 420 West 118th St, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Pakes, Ariel] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Littauer Room 117, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Shepard, Mark] Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, 79 JFK St,Mailbox 114, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ho, Kate; Pakes, Ariel; Shepard, Mark] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Columbia University; Harvard University; Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Ho, K (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, 420 West 118th St, New York, NY 10027 USA.;Ho, K (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",kh2214@columbia.edu; apakes@fas.harvard.edu; mark_shepard@hks.harvard.edu,,,Commonwealth Fund; NIH via the National Bureau of Economic Research [P01AG005842]; National Institute on Aging [T32-AG000186],Commonwealth Fund; NIH via the National Bureau of Economic Research; National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),The authors gratefully acknowledge funding support for this work through a grant from the Commonwealth Fund.

Good estimates of the effect on price of the entry of another generic competitor would inform competition policy and test oligopoly theories. However, identifying the causal effect of entry is difficult since the number of firms that compete in a market is endogenously determined. We exploit provisions of the 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act to identify a causal effect. We find that ignoring endogenous selection into generic drug markets imparts a significant downward bias to the estimates of the effects of two and three competitors on generic drug prices.","[Olson, Luke M.] US Dept Treasury, Off Comptroller Currency, Washington, DC 20226 USA; [Wendling, Brett W.] Fed Trade Commiss, 600 Penn Ave NW, Washington, DC 20580 USA",United States Department of the Treasury; Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,"Wendling, BW (通讯作者)，Fed Trade Commiss, 600 Penn Ave NW, Washington, DC 20580 USA.",luke.olson@occ.treas.gov; bwendling@ftc.gov,,,,,,,17,6,9,1,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

Using Australian panel data and employing a dynamic random effects probit model, we show that social capital exacerbates the incidence of over-education, particularly for females. Furthermore, for the foreign born, ethnic concentration significantly increases the incidence of over-education. Using an Alternative Index, we also show that social participation, friends and support and ethnic concentration are the main contributors in generating a mismatch, while reciprocity and trust does not seem to have any effect on over-education for both, immigrants and natives. Finally, we show that social networks are more beneficial for the relatively better educated.","[Kalfa, Eleni; Piracha, Matloob] Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Canterbury CT2 7NP, Kent, England",University of Kent,"Piracha, M (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Canterbury CT2 7NP, Kent, England.",M.E.Piracha@kent.ac.uk,,"Piracha, Matloob/0000-0003-0885-349X","Australian Government Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaHCSIA)","Australian Government Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaHCSIA)(Australian Government)","We would like to thank Massimiliano Tani, Guy Tchuente, an anonymous referee and the Editor-in-Chief Klaus Zimmermann for their detailed comments on an earlier draft.

Setting: A non-probability judgment sample of 1000 informal traders in the Avondale area of Harare was used in this study. Method: The study established four potential financial inclusion construct pillars: demand side factors, supply side factors, behavioural factors and individual factors; these were largely influenced by age, which can be investigated in further future grounded theory studies to develop a framework. Results: The results indicate that healing from the financial experiences of the hyperinflation era of 2008 still has not been achieved. The study suggests a need for Zimbabwe to restore human rights, political stability, and ensure compliance with the Financial Action Task Force regulations regarding money laundering and terror financing in order to boost external confidence in the financial system of the country. Conclusion: There is still a challenge of confidence in the country's financial system. The proposed framework is envisaged to minimise the negative impacts of the mistrust of formal financial service providers and boost confidence in the financial system. It is hoped that the findings will aid government to craft policies that will be perceived as supportive of the informal sector to achieve optimal financial inclusion. The study further suggests penetration of the rural areas through technological advances such as mobile networks.","[Ngwenya, Bongani; Pelser, Theuns] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Grad Sch Business & Leadership, Durban, South Africa; [Chivaura, Talent] Solusi Univ, Grad Sch Business Studies, Bulawayo, Zimbabwe",University of Kwazulu Natal,"Ngwenya, B (通讯作者)，Univ KwaZulu Natal, Grad Sch Business & Leadership, Durban, South Africa.",ngwenyab@ukzn.ac.za,"Pelser, Theuns/O-5963-2019; Ngwenya, Bongani/AAB-4107-2021","Pelser, Theuns/0000-0001-5935-0185; Ngwenya, Bongani/0000-0002-6852-1449",,,,,54,7,10,0,5,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

We combine data of the 14 metro services of the Paris network with survey data from a contingent valuation study of in-vehicle congestion. The gap between current and optimal PT patronage is 9%, and ECC is moderate.

The screening method is particularly suited to address the problem of partial collusion, that is, collusion that does not involve all firms and/or all contracts in a specific dataset, implying that many of the classical markers discussed in the corresponding literature will fail to identify bid rigging. In addition to presenting new screens for collusion, it is shown how benchmarks and the combination of different screens may be used to identify subsets of suspicious contracts and firms. The discussed screening method succeeds in isolating a group of suspicious firms exhibiting the characteristics of a local bid-rigging cartel with cover bids and a-more or less pronounced-bid rotation scheme. Based on these findings, the Swiss Competition Commission (COMCO) opened an investigation and sanctioned the identified suspicious firms for bid rigging in 2016.","[Imhof, David; Karagok, Yavuz] Swiss Competit Commiss, Bern, Switzerland; [Imhof, David] Univ Fribourg, Fribourg, Switzerland; [Imhof, David] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CRESE EA 3190, F-25000 Besancon, France; [Imhof, David] Unidistance Format Univ Distance, Bern, Switzerland; [Rutz, Samuel] Swiss Econ, Bern, Switzerland; [Rutz, Samuel] Avenir Suisse, Bern, Switzerland",University of Fribourg; Universite de Franche-Comte,"Imhof, D (通讯作者)，Swiss Competit Commiss, Bern, Switzerland.;Imhof, D (通讯作者)，Univ Fribourg, Fribourg, Switzerland.;Imhof, D (通讯作者)，Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CRESE EA 3190, F-25000 Besancon, France.;Imhof, D (通讯作者)，Unidistance Format Univ Distance, Bern, Switzerland.",david.imhof@weko.admin.ch; yavuz.karagoek@weko.admin.ch; samuel.rutz@avenir-suisse.ch,,,,,,,31,30,31,2,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

We use both standard and new methods to elicit attitudes toward soft interventions in various hypothetical scenarios. The majority of the participants accept these types of interventions by the government. However, a substantial proportion opposes them and would prefer that the government simply provide information to help the public make the right choice rather than use a more effective choice architecture intervention. Some even refuse to make the choice that the government promotes, although they would have done so in the absence of the intervention. The opposition to soft interventions appears to be driven by concerns about manipulation and the fear of a slippery slope to nonconsensual interventions. Opposition to soft interventions is reduced when they are implemented by employers rather than the government.","[Arad, Ayala; Rubinstein, Ariel] Tel Aviv Univ, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Rubinstein, Ariel] NYU, Econ, New York, NY 10003 USA",Tel Aviv University; New York University,"Arad, A (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, Tel Aviv, Israel.",,,"Arad, Ayala/0000-0002-8562-3447",European Research Council [269143]; Henry Crown Institute of Business Research in Israel; Edmond J.

Many studies argue that knowledge spillovers are localized based on the observation that patents tend to cite nearby patents disproportionately. Specifically, patent citations are typically interpreted as marking the transmission of knowledge from the cited invention to the citing invention. The localization of patent citations is therefore taken as evidence that such knowledge transmission is also localized. Localization of knowledge transmission, however, may not be the only reason that patent citations are localized. Using a set of citations that are unlikely to be associated with knowledge transmission from the cited to the citing invention, we present evidence that challenges the view that localization of citations is driven by localized knowledge transmission. While we are silent on the question of whether knowledge transmission is localized, to the extent that such localization exists, we argue that it is unlikely to be captured by patent citations.","[Arora, Ashish; Belenzon, Sharon; Lee, Honggi] Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, 100 Fuqua Dr, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Arora, Ashish] Duke Univ, NBER, 100 Fuqua Dr, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Duke University; Duke University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Belenzon, S (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, 100 Fuqua Dr, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",sharon.belenzon@duke.edu,,,,,,,53,12,15,4,78,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

However, the following is the first examination of the value of an extension of a light-rail line. The analysis relies on repeat sales of houses in Bayonne, New Jersey, where the first sale occurred before the 2008 announcement of a southern extension to the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail to 8th Street in Bayonne, and the second sale occurred after the opening of the station in 2011. Our results show that the 8th Street Station had no statistically significant impact on annual house price appreciation. That is, we find no evidence that properties closer to the station showed more price appreciation than properties further from the station. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This is despite the growing scientific concern about climate change, habitat destruction and extinction of species and mounting evidence on the implications of these environmental issues for our current way of life. This necessitates additional research on biodiversity reporting, especially in a South African context given that the country is home to some of the richest biodiversity regions on earth. Aim: This research examines what information companies in the South African seafood industry are reporting on biodiversity. This includes the development and application of an easy-to-use disclosure scorecard to track the quality of biodiversity-related disclosures. Setting: The study focuses on South African biodiversity reporting. The choice of region is informed by the country's significant marine resources and mature corporate reporting environment, where non-financial disclosures are expected to be well developed. Methods: Content analysis was used to collect data from a sample of companies' integrated and sustainability reports. The data were analysed interpretively to determine what biodiversity disclosures companies provide and the quality of those disclosures. Conclusion: The study shows that while the quantum of biodiversity reporting is relatively low, some companies are starting to provide more detailed accounts of their biodiversity impact, pointing to higher levels of reporting quality. There is still room for improvement, but these findings suggest that reporting on non-financial sustainability issues is maturing and that companies are beginning to appreciate the importance of preserving biodiversity for ensuring long-term sustainability.","[Usher, Kieran; Maroun, Warren] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Accountancy, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Maroun, W (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Accountancy, Johannesburg, South Africa.",warren.maroun@wits.ac.za,"Maroun, Warren/AAA-7338-2021","Maroun, Warren/0000-0001-7448-1220",National Research Foundation,National Research Foundation,"The authors would like to thank the participants at the Meditari Accountancy Research Conference (2016) for their comments on earlier drafts of this article.

Evaluation of bicycle route related improvement strategies becomes necessary to devise suitable policies for such upgradation. In this study, a set of key route related attributes such as Level of risk, Route visibility, Road width, Bicycle operating cost and Bicycle journey time are used to design a stated preference survey to collect relevant data from users. Based on the collected data, appropriate route choice models such as Multinomial Logit (MNL) and Random-Parameter Logit (RPL) models are formulated. Subsequently, for evaluation of improvement strategies, a set of alternative bicycle routes are generated and compared with the base route. The alternatives are evaluated in terms of shift in bicyclist's probability to choose alternatives with better infrastructure and savings in generalized cost of travel per km compared to the base scenario. To demonstrate the methodology, Kharagpur and Asansol, two small and medium-sized Indian cities with varying urban and transport characteristics are selected. Results suggest that Level of risk is perceived as the most important attribute influencing bicyclist's route choice followed by Route visibility, Bicycle journey time and Road width. Overall, alternatives with improved infrastructural characteristics are observed to be associated with significant increase in probability and substantial Generalized Cost (GC) savings compared to the base alternative for both regular and irregular bicyclists.","[Majumdar, Bandhan Bandhu; Mitra, Sudeshna] Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Dept Civil Engn, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur,"Mitra, S (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Dept Civil Engn, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India.",bandhan_majumdar@iitkgp.ac.in; sudeshna@civil.iitkgp.ernet.in,,,"HUDCO, HSMI, Ministry of Housing & Urban Poverty Alleviation, Government of India [HSMI/RD/3/2012]","HUDCO, HSMI, Ministry of Housing & Urban Poverty Alleviation, Government of India","The authors would like to acknowledge the funding from HUDCO, HSMI, Ministry of Housing & Urban Poverty Alleviation, Government of India (HSMI/R&D/3/2012) to carry out this study.

Borrowers were randomly assigned to a loan with an interest rate reduction after three on-time payments; borrowers assigned to this loan show fewer late payments compared to a control group. While the financial incentive of the interest rate reduction was small, the offer of a rate reduction appears to result in borrowers attending to due dates. This result illustrates that lenders can use simple mechanisms to encourage more positive repayment patterns among borrowers with a history of late payments.","[Collins, J.

We argue that the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) on pollution in the host country is contingent on the level of corruption of the host country. By using a sample of 70 developing countries, the findings reveal that FDI do not directly influence carbon dioxide (CO2) emission. However, further investigation using threshold regression analysis uncovers that PHH only exist in countries with high level of corruption. In other words, corrupted countries absorb dirty FDI and therefore generate more pollution than less corrupted countries.","[Azman-Saini, W. N.

It draws from the global value chain/GPN literature, labour process theory and agrarian political economy to examine the architecture of labour control in the Senegalese-European horticultural GPN through an analysis of local labour control regimes that are constituted at different scales (global, national and local). It frames labour control through the interplay of labour exploitation and disciplining, identifying the different actors, institutions and dynamics shaping labour control and links places of production to broader spaces of labour control. The strong role of the Senegalese state indicates that labour control is closely connected to a broader 'labour question' that revolves around the productive/reproductive activities of households and gender subordination. The historical analysis shows the path-dependent, dialectical nature of labour control and labour resistance, and importantly, their dependency on broader production and reproduction relations.","[Baglioni, Elena] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, Francis Bancroft Bldg,Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England",University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Baglioni, E (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, Francis Bancroft Bldg,Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.",e.baglioni@qmul.ac.uk,,,,,,,124,26,30,4,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

This paper investigates how the development and spread of seemingly insignificant price display technologies in US grocery retailing related to the development of US food prices at large during the interwar years (1918-1939). We find that the development of these new technologies (e.g. preprinted price cards, price tags and price mouldings) afforded new retail pricing practices (e.g. price cutting, specials and bundles). This development both fed off and contributed to the periods of intense price competition that marked the development of US food prices in the studied period. We conclude that price formation mechanisms are historically situated socio-technical phenomena rather than the product of abstract and historically constant market forces. As such, well-working markets hinge on the efforts of a wide range of market actors to continuously test the contextualization of particular price mechanisms and develop alternative solutions to overcome the shortcomings that such reflexive efforts are able to establish.","[Cochoy, Franck] Univ Toulouse Jean Jaures, Dept Sociol, LISST, CNRS, 5 Allees Antonio Machado, F-31058 Toulouse, France; [Hagberg, Johan] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Business Adm, POB 610, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Kjellberg, Hans] Stockholm Sch Econ, Dept Mkt & Strategy, Box 6501, S-11383 Stockholm, Sweden",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Toulouse; Universite de Toulouse - Jean Jaures; University of Gothenburg; Stockholm School of Economics,"Cochoy, F (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse Jean Jaures, Dept Sociol, LISST, CNRS, 5 Allees Antonio Machado, F-31058 Toulouse, France.",cochoy@univ-tlse2.fr; johan.hagberg@gu.se; hans.kjellberg@hhs.se,"Kjellberg, Hans/P-2844-2019","Kjellberg, Hans/0000-0002-9058-6724; Cochoy, Franck/0000-0002-0382-5660; Hagberg, Johan/0000-0002-4023-2741",Swedish Research Council [2012-5736],Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council),This research was made possible by the Digcon program headed by Magdalena Petersson McIntyre and funded by The Swedish Research Council (grant number 2012-5736).,,43,4,5,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

This paper analyzes the limitations of some of the popular restricted parametric MGARCH models that are often used to represent the dynamics observed in real systems of financial returns. These limitations are illustrated using simulated data generated by general VECH models of different dimensions in which volatilities and correlations are interrelated. We show that the restrictions imposed by the BEKK model are very unrealistic, generating potentially misleading forecasts of conditional correlations. On the other hand, models based on the DCC specification provide appropriate forecasts. Alternative estimators of the parameters are important in order to simplify the computations, and do not have implications for the estimates of conditional correlations. The implications of the restrictions imposed by the different specifications of MGARCH models considered are illustrated by forecasting the volatilities and correlations of a five dimensional system of exchange rate returns.

Today, proponents of randomized control trials (so-called randomistas) are among the most influential of development experts. This paper examines the growth of this thought collective, analysing how uncertainty has become a central concern of development institutions. It demonstrates that transformations within the aid industry - including the influence of evidence-based policy, the economization of development and the retreat from macro-planning - created the conditions of possibility for experimentation. Within this field, the randomistas adeptly pursued a variety of rhetorical, affective, methodological and organizational strategies that emphasized the lack of credible knowledge within aid and the ability of experiments to rectify the situation. Importantly, they have insisted on the moral worth of experimentation; indeed, the experimental ethic has been proposed as the way to change the spirit of development. Through causal certitude, they propose to reduce human suffering. The rise of experimentation has not, however, eliminated accusations of uncertainty; rather, it has redistributed the means through which knowledge about development is considered credible.","[Donovan, Kevin P.] Univ Michigan, Program Anthropol & Hist, Room 1029,435 South State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Donovan, KP (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Program Anthropol & Hist, Room 1029,435 South State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",kevinpd@umich.edu,,,National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program [DGE1256260],National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This paper was substantially written while in residence at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, and I am grateful to its director, Dagmar Schafer, for welcoming me.

Estimating the effect of the reform on individuals' health within the age range 65-69, the results show no evidence that the reform impacted mortality or health care utilization.

China's high income gap is transmitted from generation to generation, which will form a long-term problem of income inequality. The purpose of this paper aims at using the micro-survey data and macro-statistical data to build an intergenerational income gap impact mechanism model, and through empirical method to estimate the role of personal factors, family factors and macroeconomic factors in the transmission of intergenerational income gap, so as to explore ways to promote intergenerational income mobility. The results show that the parents' income will affect the transmission of the intergenerational income gap; and the intergenerational income gap shows regional differences; the intergenerational income gap is different due to educational level of the parents; the participation of parents' pension insurance and medical insurance will affect the transmission of intergenerational income gap between father and son; the total annual income of father's family will have a significant positive impact on the intergenerational transmission of income gap; the impact of the total assets of the father's family on intergenerational income gap cannot be ignored; the macroeconomic development in the region where fathers live obviously affects the transmission of intergenerational income gap.","[Lu, Kangyin; Chen, Manxue; Jia, Liwen] Northeast Normal Univ, Sch Business, 2555 Jing Yue St, Changchun 130117, Jilin, Peoples R China",Northeast Normal University - China,"Lu, KY (通讯作者)，Northeast Normal Univ, Sch Business, 2555 Jing Yue St, Changchun 130117, Jilin, Peoples R China.",luky440@nenu.edu.cn; 987167701@qq.com; 1209450064@qq.com,"Liwen, JIA/ABA-2181-2021; CHEN, MANXUE/JVE-0908-2024","Liwen, JIA/0000-0002-7103-9821; Lu, Kangyin/0000-0002-0698-1327","General Project of National Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science [20 I 4, 14BJL040]",General Project of National Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science,"This research is funded by General Project of National Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science (20 I 4,Project No. 14BJL040).

Prior to this stage, firm-specific unions set the workers' wages, while the owners of both firms hire managers and provide them with incentive contracts. Owners can freely decide to arrange the managerial contract before or after the (non-managerial) wage determination stage. Hence, the endogenous choice of the incentive contract stage is derived. The possibility of multiple equilibria arises, where both owners choose managerial contracts before or after unions' wage setting, crucially depending on unions' preferences. Such results also prove to be true for a remarkable degree of asymmetry in preferences over wages vis-a-vis employment across unions.","[Meccheri, Nicola; Fanti, Luciano] Univ Pisa, Dept Econ & Management, Via C Ridolfi 10, I-56124 Pisa, Italy; [Meccheri, Nicola] RCEA, Rimini, Italy",University of Pisa,"Meccheri, N (通讯作者)，Univ Pisa, Dept Econ & Management, Via C Ridolfi 10, I-56124 Pisa, Italy.",nicola.meccheri@unipi.it,"Meccheri, Nicola/AGK-0269-2022","Meccheri, Nicola/0000-0002-2251-0365",Universita di Pisa [PRA 2016_2],Universita di Pisa,"Universita di Pisa, Grant/Award Number: PRA 2016_2",,35,2,2,0,1,JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD,CHICHESTER,"THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND",0143-6570,1099-1468,,MANAG DECIS ECON,Manag.

The application of Promethee I in a base scenario, and the development of two alternative scenarios allowed to identify that in the case study's portfolio there are projects with a very high preference, regardless of the criteria weight. Similarly, it allowed to identify the least preferred projects. These results are an important input for projects selection decision-making to be carried out by the holding company board of directors.

The erotic appeal is one of the most controversial emotional appeals. The use of sex appeal in advertising is influenced by several factors that need to be taken into consideration. Sex sells and perhaps that is why marketers consider it to be one of the most potent tools in advertising. One of the characteristics that sets Generation Y apart from earlier generations, and which is relevant for this research, is that they have reported greater liking of advertisements compared to previous generations and are less often offended, insulted and misled by advertising. The objective of this study is to verify whether sex sells. In selected advertising campaigns with an erotic undertone, it was tested whether the use of sex appeal in combination with a suitable product can increase the demand for such a product rather than in areas where there is no association of the product with sex appeal. The study also investigates whether men pay more attention to sex in advertising than women.","[Micik, Michal] Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt Trade & Serv, Plzen, Czech Republic; [Tesarova, Tereza M.] Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Plzen, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen; University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Micík, M (通讯作者)，Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt Trade & Serv, Plzen, Czech Republic.",micikm@kmo.zcu.cz; tesarova.terezamagdalena@gmail.com,"Mičík, Michal/D-2014-2016","Mičík, Michal/0000-0002-4112-4160",,,,,33,0,0,1,5,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,623,633,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553201012,0

The results obtained show that, irrespective of the base product chosen, there is no change in the final value allocated to each product in terms of conversion unit cost. In this way, the main contribution of the study is to prove, mathematically, the neutrality of this method in terms of the product chosen to be the base product, because it does not effectively change the value assigned each product.

Human behavior also leads to climate change, which has been repeatedly and independently confirmed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The consequences of climate change are then manifest in extreme weather situations with corresponding massive financial losses for insurers and insured persons. Indicators, values and consequences get investigated. Design/methodology/approach: Any here discussed objectives are only a small extract of all existing or potential objectives. The research method used by the author was an analysis of existing and published literature within Web of Science and elsewhere like the IPCC and her organisations (in total more than 15 references), mainly from the last decade. The approach of the topic is to define and evaluate the actual status quo of climate change regarding results for insurances and insured from the US American and German point of view. Findings: Research findings are shown within a brief summary to offer an opportunity for further analysis, discussions, or results. The climate change is an accepted possibility to measure effects on nature, based on numerical indicators and values. The emergence of external costs must be borne in full by the insurers and thus the insured persons. Ecology, Society and insurances have to go hand in hand and people have to be taught their current behavior regarding environment costs money direct and indirect. Research/practical implications: results and implications for practice, applications and consequences are identified. Climate change and its effects can be evaluated in the short, mid and long term run. The insured persons bear all costs incurred through the risk calculation of the insurer. Avenues of future research should always include Insurance contributions that are payable by all and thus directly and indirectly bill the climate impact damage to the insured. Originality/value: This paper sees climate change from the economics point of view (a research gap so far) and is in contrast to most existing literature which has the approach from the environment (natural sciences/technique) or society/politics.","[Novak, David] Engerode 56, D-30880 Laatzen, Germany",,"Novak, D (通讯作者)，Engerode 56, D-30880 Laatzen, Germany.",David.novakl@t-online.de,,,,,,,15,1,1,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,1891,1898,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553202103,0

However, as citation has become vital criteria for ranking academic excellence globally, studies have shown that it has also become a symbol of manipulation among some journal editors and individual scholars. With respect to editors, previous studies have shown that citation has been providing an opportunity for some publishing companies to engage in coercive citations while other studies have found individual scholars indulging in self-citations to receive undeserved or unjustified academia merit. The act of manipulating citations has long been explored in several studies in developed nations but such efforts are yet to be adequately explored in the literature emanating from Nigeria. The dearth of literature on citations in Nigeria could be responsible for the poor ranking of her scholars and tertiary institutions. It is on this ground that this paper is conceived to discuss the: (i) the problems associated with citations (coercive and self-citations) which Nigerian authors may not have been well acquitted with; (ii) reasons for indulging in coercive and self-citations; and (iii) solutions to the problems associated with citations in order to ensure academic integrity. Being a review article, data were collected for this paper through the historical method.

Three hypotheses were formulated from the structure of research questions. T - Test and other statistical tools were used in testing these hypotheses, after data had been presented on both contingency table percentage and charts. The result provides empirical and archival document evidence such as taxation does effect on corporate investment, which went along with existing literatures. Managers place high priority on taxation matters before embarking on corporate investment, taking step like employing professionals to analysis tax considerations before investment decisions are taken. The research also went against conventional wisdom by stating, taxation also has positive effect on the company going against the common notion that it is only beneficial to the government. The research concluded with recommendations such as therefore corporation must have a flexible taxation policy in operation to enable them coupe with constant taxation review and policy change. For corporation to effectively face the effect of taxation professionals not just on taxation but also areas like investment portfolio, law, resources management should be engage by corporations, in order to meet any complexity or situation that may arise.

We argue that modularizability of a core technology can enhance adopting firms' dynamic capabilities in technology competition by influencing the shape of suppliers' networks not only within but also across industries. Furthermore, the increased possibilities of firms' participation enhance the chances of the technology to better address evolving needs of consumers in market. To coherently explain the effects of the product architectural characteristics of a technology, we explain through the conceptual model how factors such as modularizability, collaborability, expandability and addressability, interact with one another to affect the determination process of a dominant technology. To verify the construct validity of the factors, measurement items for each concept are developed and empirically tested using survey data collected from manufacturing firms across different industries. We show that a technology that is more suitable for modular product architecture exhibits better possibilities for firms' participation and cooperation by extending a supplier network both within an industry and across different industries. We also show that technologies that excel in the aforementioned fronts are more likely to accommodate evolving market needs during technology competition and to finally win the competition.","[Park, Jinhan] Korea Inst Sci & Technol Informat, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Su] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Grad Sch Global Entrepreneurship, Coll Engn, Seoul, South Korea; [Chhajed, Dilip] Univ Illinois, Coll Business, Dept Business Adm, Champaign, IL USA; [Kim, Kilsun] Sogang Univ, Coll Business, Seoul 04107, South Korea",Korea Institute of Science & Technology Information (KISTI); Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Sogang University,"Kim, K (通讯作者)，Sogang Univ, Coll Business, Seoul 04107, South Korea.",kilsunkim@sogang.ac.kr,"Kim, Kilsun/AAW-2236-2021; Kim, Kilsun/HZI-6540-2023","Kim, Kilsun/0000-0002-7845-8666",National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2013S1A2A1A01064039],National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government),This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government [NRF-2013S1A2A1A01064039].,,81,1,1,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

In Niger, actors contested the lack of standards in the Chinese oil industry but capitalized on the opportunities that linkages to the industry had produced. In Uganda, by contrast, local entrepreneurs objected to the insistence of Western multinational oil companies on international standards, characterizing it as a barrier to the creation of linkages to the oil industry. To conceptualize these radically different outcomes of capitalist expansion, we identify specific socio-political, legal and corporate configurations that shape the way the oil industry operates in particular contexts.

As a result, there is a problem of payback of public investments and increasing their effectiveness.","[Selentyeva, Tamara N.; Ivanov, Maxim V.; Talov, Vadim V.] Peter Great St Petersburg Polytech Univ, St Petersburg, Russia; [Azarenko, Natalia U.] Bryansk State Technol Univ Engn, Bryansk, Russia",Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University,"Selentyeva, TN (通讯作者)，Peter Great St Petersburg Polytech Univ, St Petersburg, Russia.",selentieva_tn@spbstu.ru; ivanov_mv@spbstu.ru; talov.vv@edu.spbstu.ru; salovanat@mail.ru,,"Azarenko, Natalya Yu/0000-0001-6644-418X",,,,,15,0,0,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,8266,8273,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553209026,0

The main objective of this study is to verify the existence of the political-economic cycle model in the case of Greece and to identify the type of this cycle. The basement is given by the approach of Alesina and Roubini (1992), which observes the relationship between the political dummy variables and the selected macroeconomic variables such as gross domestic product, unemployment rate and inflation rate. The eight linear regression models are developed in the R software environment, while the three of them are opportunistic and the five are ideological. These models are identified as statistically significant and according to the methodology, tested for the presence of serial correlation, heteroscedasticity and residual normality. As the models do not confirm the presence of an opportunistic or ideological political-economic cycle, according to the data, the influence of the political parties on changes in the macroeconomic variables before the election is not proved for the case of Greece.","[Tkacova, Andrea; Kovac, Viliam] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Finance, Kosice, Slovakia; [Gavurova, Beata] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Banking & Investment, Kosice, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice; Technical University Kosice,"Gavurová, B (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Banking & Investment, Kosice, Slovakia.",beata.gavurova@tuke.sk,"Kováč, Viliam/AAH-5542-2019; Tkáčová, Andrea/ABC-9384-2021; Gavurová, Beáta/N-9159-2018","Kováč, Viliam/0000-0002-5265-9005; Tkáčová, Andrea/0000-0002-6025-1261; Gavurová, Beáta/0000-0002-0606-879X",,,,,38,3,3,0,10,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

In this study, 49 Chinese enterprises, which were simultaneously listed as A-shares in Chinese stock exchanges and H-shares in Hong Kong Stock Exchange from 1993 to 2017, were chosen and divided into outside-in and inside-out cross-listing groups. The effects of capital cost, private benefits of control, separation degree between the capital and product markets, and domestic product market share on the cross-listing behaviours of Chinese enterprises were verified on the basis of such samples through multiple regression estimations by using the cross-listing dummy variable as a dependent variable. Results show that reducing the capital cost, relieving the separation degree between the capital and product markets, and consolidating the domestic market share are the cross-listing motivations for Chinese enterprises to return and cross-list in their domestic stock market, whereas relieving the separation degree between the capital and product markets, and alleviating the increasing saturated domestic product market are the cross-listing motivations for Chinese enterprises to go abroad and cross-list in overseas stock markets. However, the motivation of the private benefits of control has no remarkable impacts on the two types of cross-listing behaviours.

Organizations competing with each other to hire the best available employees. They also need to keep their best performers from leaving. That is why organizations should identify their employee intention to leave. This study examines the relationships among perceived organizational support (POS), job stress, and turnover intention among plantation employees in Irian Province. Operating in remote area and facing cultural differences organization has its own challenges to manage their human resources. A total of 117 participants from various jobs in one organization participated. Job stress was found to be a mediator of the POS and turnover intention relations. Surprisingly, we found no significant relation of POS and turnover intention. However, the study found a positive relation between POS and job stress while job stress and turnover found to had a negative relationship. Results of the study suggest that organizations should provide enough support for their employees in order to reduce the level of stress which then would decrease the intention to leave.","[Yunita, Irni; Prasetio, Arif Partono; Dharmoputra, Soeparwoto; Sa'adah, Samrotu] Telkom Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Bandung, Indonesia",Telkom University,"Yunita, I (通讯作者)，Telkom Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Bandung, Indonesia.",irniyunita81@gmail.com,"Dharmoputra, Soeparwoto/AAF-2397-2021; Y, IR/AAC-7053-2022; Prasetio, Arif/AAE-7357-2021",,Lembaga Penelitian & Pengabdian Masyarakat Telkom University,Lembaga Penelitian & Pengabdian Masyarakat Telkom University,"We would like to thanks Lembaga Penelitian & Pengabdian Masyarakat Telkom University for providing the grant by the scheme of Penelitian Dasar Terapan First Semester, 2018.",,62,0,0,0,7,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-723-2,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,65,,,,,,451,457,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BN2FA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000476673700098,0

This conduct also imposes losses on the victimized sellers, which provide the foundation for private enforcement through private damage actions. In this paper, we present a rigorous economic analysis of buyer cartels. This effort includes both full participation and partial conspiracies. We review the antitrust treatment of collusive monopsony in the United States, the European Union, and Asia, offer a measure of antitrust damages, and examine the necessary precision of the damage estimate. We also suggest that the proper use of modern econometrics should allay judicial concerns with speculation.","[Blair, Roger D.; Wang, Wenche] Univ Florida, Dept Econ, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Wang, Wenche] Univ Florida, Inst Informat, Gainesville, FL USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Blair, RD (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Dept Econ, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",rdblair@ufl.edu,,"Wang, Wenche/0000-0003-0320-1476",,,,,18,1,1,0,4,JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD,CHICHESTER,"THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND",0143-6570,1099-1468,,MANAG DECIS ECON,Manag.

We investigate the relevance and impacts of such distribution strategies in the presence of an OS software competitor. We determine the conditions for this strategy to be profitable for the software firm, and its impact on price, market share, and welfare. We show that a DL strategy can be used to crowd the OS software out of the market. This strategy then is profitable for the software firm only if the spillovers coming from the hybrid software (i.e., second distribution launched by the software firm) are sufficiently high and result in both a higher price and a lower market share for the proprietary software. We also consider a situation where the introduction of DL leads to a market shared between the firm's software and the OS competitor. In this situation, the profitability of the DL strategy depends also on the degree of compatibility between the proprietary software and its OS competitor. We show also that this situation can generate conflicts of interests between proprietary software vendors and users, resulting in suboptimal outcomes.","[Darmon, Eric] Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, CREM, Rennes, France; [Torre, Dominique] Univ Cote Azur, GREDEG, CNRS, Valbonne, Provence Alpes, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Rennes; Universite Cote d'Azur; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Darmon, E (通讯作者)，Univ Rennes 1, Fac Sci Econ, Domin Torre GREDEG, 250 Rue A Einstein, F-06560 Valbonne, France.",eric.darmon@univ-rennes1.fr,,,,,,,29,2,2,0,9,JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD,CHICHESTER,"THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND",0143-6570,1099-1468,,MANAG DECIS ECON,Manag.

We examine whether incorporating cross-excitation improves the forecasts of extremes in asset returns compared to only self-excitation. The models are applied to US stocks, bonds and dollar exchange rates. We predict the probability of crashes in the series and the value at risk (VaR) over a period that includes the financial crisis of 2008 using a moving window. A Lagrange multiplier test suggests the presence of cross-excitation for these series. Out-of-sample, we find that the models that include spillover effects forecast crashes and the VaR significantly more accurately than the models without these effects.
