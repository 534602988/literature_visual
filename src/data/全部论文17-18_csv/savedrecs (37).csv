Based on mental accounting theory and the comparability of the current and missed opportunities, this study explores how promotional formats influence consumers' inaction inertia. The authors propose that when the missed and current promotions are monetary (vs. nonmonetary), consumers perceive that these opportunities are more comparable, which results in consumers expressing higher inaction inertia. Two imaginary scenario experiments and one incentive-compatible experiment were conducted to test this prediction, and the results provide empirical support for it. Additionally, devaluation was determined to be the internal mechanism connecting promotional format with inaction inertia. These findings have significant practical and theoretical implications, the details of which are discussed herein.","[Liu, Hsin-Hsien] Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Asia Pacific Ind & Business Management, 700 Kaohsiung Univ Rd, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Chou, Hsuan-Yi] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Inst Mkt Commun, 70 Lien Hai Rd, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan",National University Kaohsiung; National Sun Yat Sen University,"Chou, HY (通讯作者)，Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Inst Mkt Commun, 70 Lien Hai Rd, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.",hsuanyi@mail.nsysu.edu.tw,"Liu, Hsin-Hsien/AAY-1321-2021","Liu, Hsin-Hsien/0000-0001-5984-1195","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 102-2410-H-390-027-MY2]","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 102-2410-H-390-027-MY2].

Commercial end-users' swaps exposure is larger than their futures exposure, and they are net short in both markets. Financial end-users are smaller in swaps than in futures and are net long in both.

In this paper, we assess the current distribution of heat exposure within countries, to explore possible distributional consequences of climate change through temperature. Combining survey data from 690,745 households across 52 countries with spatial data on climate, this paper suggests that the welfare impacts of added heat stress may be regressive within countries. We find: (1) a strong negative correlation between household wealth and warmer temperature in many hot countries; (2) a strong positive correlation between household wealth and warmer temperatures in many cold countries; and (3) that poorer individuals are more likely to work in occupations with greater exposure. While our analysis is descriptive rather than causal, our results suggest a larger vulnerability of poor people to heat extremes, and potentially significant distributional and poverty implications of climate change.","[Park, Jisung] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Publ Policy, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Bangalore, Mook] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst, London, England; [Bangalore, Mook] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England; [Bangalore, Mook; Hallegatte, Stephane] World Bank, Global Facil Disaster Reduct & Recovery, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Sandhoefner, Evan] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; The World Bank; Harvard University,"Bangalore, M (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst, London, England.;Bangalore, M (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England.;Bangalore, M (通讯作者)，World Bank, Global Facil Disaster Reduct & Recovery, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",M.Bangalore@lse.ac.uk,,,Harvard Environmental Economics Program; National Science Foundation (GRFP); Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University; Office of the Chief Economist of the Climate Change Group; Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery of the World Bank; Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; UK's Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC); ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Harvard Environmental Economics Program; National Science Foundation (GRFP)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University; Office of the Chief Economist of the Climate Change Group; Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery of the World Bank; Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; UK's Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors would like to thank Geoffrey Heal, Marianne Fay, Laura Bonzanigo, Tom Pullum, Ruilin Ren and Clara Burgert, as well as participants at the World Bank Poverty and Climate Change conference, for valuable comments and feedback.

This paper reviews the considerations that led me to revive the secular stagnation idea, summarizes the theory as I understand it today, and argues that events since I started advocating the secular stagnation view have tended to confirm its predictions and reject those of its critics. It addresses the various objections, both theoretical and empirical, that have been put forward to the secular stagnation idea, and argues that if secular stagnation is a central macroeconomic issue, much of the conventional wisdom regarding macroeconomic policy needs to be rethought. Contrary to current orthodoxy, monetary policies may be able to have lasting impacts on levels of output but not to determine rates of inflation. Fiscal policies may be essential for assuring full employment and financial stability. Increases in government indebtedness may contribute to financial stability.","[Summers, Lawrence H.] Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Mailbox 8,79 JFK St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Summers, LH (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Mailbox 8,79 JFK St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",julie@lawrencesummers.com,,,,,,,29,17,18,0,11,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

The key question examined in this research, given credit union not-for-profit objectives, is whether this pricing strategy increases the availability of loans, particularly for high-risk borrowers. Data on the number of loans per credit union member and loan delinquency rates are used to assess loan access and average risk-levels, respectively. The results indicate that risk-based pricing adopters increase the availability of loans relative to otherwise similar non-adopters. However, average risk levels, as measured by delinquency rates, appear to be somewhat lower for adopters of risk-based pricing compared to matched non-adopters. This suggests that lending increases primarily for low-risk borrowers, which contrasts with claims that risk-based pricing chiefly benefits high-risk borrowers who might otherwise be denied credit.

Connected firms are less profitable in the cross-section and also experience a drop in profitability when a connected CEO comes to power.","[Bertrand, Marianne] Univ Chicago, Grad Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Bertrand, Marianne; Schoar, Antoinette] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Bertrand, Marianne; Kramarz, Francis; Schoar, Antoinette; Thesmar, David] CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA; [Bertrand, Marianne] IZA, Durham, NC 27713 USA; [Kramarz, Francis] CREST ENSAE, Paris, France; [Schoar, Antoinette; Thesmar, David] MIT Sloan, Cambridge, MA USA",University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Institut Polytechnique de Paris; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Bertrand, M (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Grad Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.;Bertrand, M (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Bertrand, M (通讯作者)，CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA.;Bertrand, M (通讯作者)，IZA, Durham, NC 27713 USA.",,,"thesmar, david/0000-0001-9265-0526",,,,,29,142,151,8,51,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

Applying a moment-based approach and a Mundlak-Chamberlain IV fixed effects model to control for unobserved heterogeneity and endogeneity, the paper uses a translog production function to estimate the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of production. These estimated moments of production are then included in a multivariate adoption model to assess their effects on input adoption decisions. Results reveal that the first four moments of production significantly explain changes in the probability of adopting chemical fertilizer, improved seeds, and pesticides. While the use of these modern inputs is found to be risk decreasing, estimates suggest that the higher their purchasing costs, the greater the cost of farmers' private risk bearing. Under the assumption of a moderate risk aversion, the risk premium amounts to 8.7% and 13.7% of the expected production revenues in Tanzania and Uganda, respectively. This willingness-to-pay is largely explained by production volatility and downside risk aversion and to a small extent by kurtosis aversion. The findings underscore the need to account for farmers' preferences towards higher order moments when designing and implementing modern inputs' adoption policies in developing countries.

Our model is inspired by dual-process theories omation elaboration, but does not introduce purely behavioral traits. The decision-maker receives a message containing an offer of unknown quality together with a reference cue that associates the offer with a category of offers, whose average quality is known. The decision-maker initially exerts little cognitive effort in processing the message, assessing the offer quality on the sole basis of the reference cue (acting as a coarse thinker). The decision-maker can then take a decision on the offer without further investigating or she can exert substantial cognitive effort to scrutinize the message carefully and obtain more precise knowledge of the offer quality. The proposed model predicts that the persuader can exploit reference cues to affect attitudes both directly (by inducing acceptance of offers) and indirectly (by inducing low cognitive effort, and hence influencing acceptance). This model matches several predictions of prominent psychological models of attitude change such as the Elaboration Likelihood Model and the Heuristic-Systematic Model.","[Bilancini, Ennio] IMT Sch Adv Studies, Piazza S Francesco 19, I-55100 Lucca, Italy; [Boncinelli, Leonardo] Univ Firenze, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Impresa, Via Pandette 9, I-50127 Florence, Italy",IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca; University of Florence,"Boncinelli, L (通讯作者)，Univ Firenze, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Impresa, Via Pandette 9, I-50127 Florence, Italy.",ennio.bilancini@imtlucca.it; leonardo.boncinelli@unifi.it,"Bilancini, Ennio/J-6405-2019","Bilancini, Ennio/0000-0002-2027-3992; Boncinelli, Leonardo/0000-0003-0626-5133","Einaudi Institute for Economics and Finance (EIEF); Italian Ministry of Education, Universities and Research under PRIN project [2012Z53REX]","Einaudi Institute for Economics and Finance (EIEF); Italian Ministry of Education, Universities and Research under PRIN project","We want to thank Stefano Barbieri, Olga Chiappinelli, Luis Corchon, Martin Cripps, Francesco Filippi, Jana Friedrichsen, Massimo Morelli, Antonio Nicole, Eugenio Peluso, Bradley Ruffle, Anastasia Shchepetova, and Francesco Squintani, for their useful comments, which helped us to improve the paper.

This paper addresses that question by analyzing the response of credit spreads to weekly polling data from 17 gubernatorial elections between 2009 and 2012, during the 6 months prior to Election Day. The findings are that political affiliation has a significant effect on states' default risks. The estimated effect of electing a Republican governor is a 6% reduction in the credit spread of the state. The effect prevails regardless of the party in control of the state legislature, and it is larger when gubernatorial elections are contested closely. Set in the context of case law, the paper links higher tax levels to greater credit risk. Moreover, an analysis of the candidates' campaign promises suggests that stronger positions against tax increases are associated with less default risks. The results of the paper are therefore consistent with the empirical evidence suggesting that Republicans prefer lower taxes.","[Cestau, Dario] IE Business Sch, 12 4To Izq, Madrid 28006, Spain",IE University,"Cestau, D (通讯作者)，IE Business Sch, 12 4To Izq, Madrid 28006, Spain.",dario.cestau@ie.edu,,,[ECO2014-53022-R],,"This manuscript is the third chapter of my doctoral dissertation at Carnegie Mellon University.

We use multivariate extreme value theory to estimate equity-based tail-dependence networks, whose links proxy for the markets' view of bank interconnectedness in case of elevated financial stress. The paper finds that early warning models including estimated tail dependencies consistently outperform bank specific benchmark models without networks. The results are robust to variation in model specification and also hold in relation to simpler benchmarks of contagion.

After the collapse of many weakly performing monopolist organizations during the 1980s and 1990s, strengthened cooperatives have emerged since the 2000s. Scholarly knowledge about the state-cooperative relations in which this revival takes place remains poor. Based on new evidence from Uganda's coffee sector, this paper discusses the political economy of Africa's cooperative revival. The authors argue that donors' and African governments' renewed support is framed in largely apolitical terms, which obscures the contested political and economic nature of the revival. In the context of neoliberal restructuring processes, state and non-state institutional support to democratic economic organizations with substantial redistributional agendas remains insufficient. The political-economic context in Ugandaand potentially elsewhere in Africacontributes to poor terms of trade for agricultural cooperatives while maintaining significant state control over some cooperative activities to protect the status quo interests of big capital and state elites. These conditions are unlikely to produce a conflict-free, substantial, and sustained revival of cooperatives, which the new promoters of cooperatives suggest is under way.","[Wedig, Karin] Univ Denver, Korbel Sch Int Studies, 2201 S Gaylord St, Denver, CO 80201 USA; [Wiegratz, Jorg] Univ Leeds, Sch Polit & Int Studies, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Denver; University of Leeds,"Wedig, K (通讯作者)，Univ Denver, Korbel Sch Int Studies, 2201 S Gaylord St, Denver, CO 80201 USA.",karin.wedig@du.edu,,"WEDIG, KARIN/0000-0001-5426-1001",,,,,127,16,20,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

We show that women's odds of being involved in bankruptcy events are 28% of those of men after controlling for demographic variables, housing type, cultural and spatial fixed effects. Using motor vehicle accidents as an instrument, we confirm that the gender gap in bankruptcy risk is mainly driven by risk-taking behavior.

The extant literature that is at the crossroads between sources of knowledge and the experiential and intellectual base of an entrepreneur (i.e., dimensions of his/her human capital) suggests that it is through experience and through education that an entrepreneur obtains knowledge. Using information on a sample of high-tech manufacturing firms across ten European countries, we explore heterogeneities in the influence of experience, age, and education of the firm's primary founder on the perceived importance of (i.e., use of) alternative sources of knowledge. We find that the association of these characteristics differs significantly across sources of knowledge, and across European regions. Education is positively related to the importance of knowledge from research institutes and internal know-how, while age is negatively related to the importance of research institutes and positively related to publications and conferences. On the one hand, in South/East European countries, the importance of internal know-how is positively associated with age and education, but negatively associated with experience. On the other hand, the characteristics of primary founders of North/West European firms are more linked to the importance of the participation to funded research programmes. This source of knowledge is related positively with age and education and negatively with experience.","[Amoroso, Sara] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Seville, Spain; [Audretsch, David B.] Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN USA; [Link, Albert N.] Univ North Carolina Greensboro, Greensboro, NC 27412 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Greensboro,"Link, AN (通讯作者)，Univ North Carolina Greensboro, Greensboro, NC 27412 USA.",sara.amoroso@ec.europa.eu; daudrets@indiana.edu; anlink@uncg.edu,"; Amoroso, Sara/L-7179-2014","Audretsch, David/0000-0002-3815-7762; Amoroso, Sara/0000-0001-5835-079X",empirical investigation of knowledge- intensive entrepreneurship in Europe in different sectoral - European Commission; European Commission under Theme 8 ''Socio- Economic Sciences and Humanities'' of the 7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development,empirical investigation of knowledge- intensive entrepreneurship in Europe in different sectoral - European Commission; European Commission under Theme 8 ''Socio- Economic Sciences and Humanities'' of the 7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development,"The authors wish to thank the AEGIS consortium for providing data of the AEGIS survey which supported the empirical investigation of knowledge-intensive entrepreneurship in Europe in different sectoral, country and socioeconomic contexts.

When risk-neutral investors disagree about average default probabilities, structuring collateral cash flow raises prices by concentrating optimists' demand on risky tranches. With disagreement about default correlation, low-correlation investors believe in diversification and pay high prices for senior tranches they deem riskless. High-correlation investors value junior tranches they expect to pay whenever aggregate conditions are good. Risk aversion and short selling through credit default swaps reduce the prices of both pass-through and structured securitizations but may increase the return to tranching. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The model we are going to introduce extends a previous model proposed by Liu and Tang (2011), including a non constant volatility and jumps in the spot price dynamics. The estimation methodology we are going to adopt is similar to the Particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) method proposed by Andrieu et al. (2010), and both spot and futures quotation data related to WTI (West Texas Intermediate) are analyzed in order to perform our inference procedure. The models considered allow to obtain explicit expressions for futures prices as functions of the model parameters and this in turn makes the calibration procedure fast and accurate at the same time. A comparison between the model considered and the model proposed by Liu and Tang is provided in terms of prices forecasting ability. The inference analysis shows that the introduction of both stochastic volatility and jumps improve significantly the ability of the model in capturing the oil price dynamics features.","[Fileccia, Gaetano; Sgarra, Carlo] Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Matemat, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan,"Sgarra, C (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Matemat, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",gaetano.fileccia@polimi.it; carlo.sgarra@polimi.it,"SGARRA, CARLO/GQQ-8697-2022",,,,,,30,7,7,0,7,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2405-8513,2405-8505,,J COMMOD MARK,J.

There has been a great deal of research examining how option implied volatilities (IV) can be used to forecast asset return volatility. However, the role of IV in the context of predicting extreme risk has received relatively little attention. The potential benefit of IV in forecasting extreme risk is considered within a range of models beginning with the traditional GARCH based approach, along with a number of novel point process models. Univariate models where IV is included as an exogenous variable are considered along with a novel bivariate approach where extreme movements in IV are treated as another point process. It is found that in the context of forecasting Value-at-Risk, the bivariate models produce the most accurate forecasts across a wide range of scenarios. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Evidence from Virginia Elections,JOURNAL OF POLICY ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PRICE DISCOVERY; CAPITALIZATION,"This study examines the market impact of targeted property tax relief, which is critical for understanding who exactly benefits from a widely used local policy. Specifically, we investigate this in the context of two statewide ballot measures in Virginia that provided property tax relief or heightened expectations for future relief intended to aid disabled veterans and seniors, respectively. Using residential multiple listing service microdata from Virginia, results from a regression discontinuity analysis show that once the 2010 tax relief measures passed on Election Day, property values rose sharply in response to the sudden increase in demand for homeownership among the targeted groups. We find that senior preferred housing and properties within areas with higher proportions of seniors and veterans experienced the highest price appreciation, while areas with fewer veterans or seniors saw little impact. The findings suggest that this type of policy provides an immediate benefit to current homeowners, thereby offsetting benefits for subsequent homeowners within the targeted groups. This effect represents an unintended consequence of targeted property tax relief as a policy tool more generally, as immediate capitalization into home prices subsequently increases the cost of housing for many individuals the relief was intended to help.","[Moulton, Jeremy G.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Publ Policy, Abernethy Hall,CB 3435, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Waller, Bennie D.] Longwood Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Hiner Hall,201 High St, Farmville, VA 23909 USA; [Wentland, Scott A.] Bur Econ Anal, 4600 Silver Hill Rd, Suitland, MD 20746 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; Longwood University,"Moulton, JG (通讯作者)，Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Publ Policy, Abernethy Hall,CB 3435, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",moulton@email.unc.edu; wallerbd@longwood.edu; scott.wentland@bea.gov,"Waller, Bennie D./AAF-6043-2021; Waller, Bennie D/HKM-9179-2023",,,,,,35,6,8,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

Both embodiment theorists and cognitive scientists have proposed that the architecture of the mind is flexible and adaptable. This proposition implies that cognitions can be shaped through repeated bodily actions and modal simulations, making them physically embodied at the brain level. To explore this notion, a measure of cortical thickness is extracted from anatomical brain scans to test whether cortical thickness is correlated with choice (here, in the domain of fast food). Results revealed that consumers' large-sized fast-food choices are significantly correlated with the cortical thickness of structures in the prefrontal cortex and that this association holds even for cases in which the participants were offered a possible monetary incentive to choose a smaller-sized portion.

Using data from the nationally representative 2011 Canadian Work, Stress, and Health Survey (N = 1427), we documented the relevance of perceived unfairness of the division of parenting and the ways that employment status and work hour preferences (mismatch) modify those relationships. We found that mothers in dual-earner households experience greater parenting inequalities than do similarly-situated fathers, net of housework inequalities. The negative association between parenting inequality and relationship quality was stronger among mothers-but that was due to perceived unfairness in the division of parenting tasks. We also observed that the detrimental effect of parenting inequality was stronger for mothers who worked part-time-but that was because of work hours mismatch: they tended to prefer to work longer hours. Our results contribute to the gendered nature of the division of parenting labor and its intersection with work hours and preferences.","[Schieman, Scott; Milkie, Melissa A.] Univ Toronto, Dept Sociol, 725 Spadina Ave, Toronto, ON M5S 2J4, Canada; [Ruppanner, Leah] Univ Melbourne, Dept Sociol, Grattan St, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Toronto; University of Melbourne,"Schieman, S (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Sociol, 725 Spadina Ave, Toronto, ON M5S 2J4, Canada.",scott.schieman@utoronto.ca,,"Ruppanner, Leah/0000-0002-6111-1914",Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) [MOP-102730]; Australian Research Council DECRA [DE150100228]; Australian Research Council [DE150100228] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Australian Research Council DECRA(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),This study was funded the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) (Funding Reference Number: MOP-102730) and the Australian Research Council DECRA (project number DE150100228).,,71,35,41,3,31,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

The aim is to determine to what extent the form of profit calculation influences value of return on assets (hereinafter referred to as 'ROA'), which is frequently used as an indicator for measuring financial performance. The theoretical part is focused on the comparative analysis of accounting data based on Czech practices and IFRS with the in-depth focus on interest charges and reporting requirements. There is discussed the topic of objective and subjective measurement of financial performance. In the practical part, ROA is calculated using a profit in two forms of its construction. There are evaluated TOP 100 Czech companies in order to assess the differences in the final values of the tested indicator. The results are linked to the capital structure of the analysed companies and prove that the level of indebtedness influences the difference in the ROA calculations when different kinds of profit are used. In the case of the companies with higher indebtedness, it is more appropriate to compare the ROA indicators based on the nominator containing earnings before interest and taxes. It shall be concluded that this is a pioneer study of this topic in the Czech Republic and probably also in the CEE region.","[Strouhal, Jiri] Czech Tech Univ, MIAS Sch Business & Interdisciplinary Studies, Dept Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic; [Stamfestova, Petra] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Business Adm, Dept Strategy, Prague, Czech Republic; [Kljucnikov, Aleksandr; Vincurova, Zuzana] Paneuropean Univ, Fac Econ & Business, Bratislava, Slovakia",Czech Technical University Prague; Prague University of Economics & Business; Pan-European University,"Strouhal, J (通讯作者)，Czech Tech Univ, MIAS Sch Business & Interdisciplinary Studies, Dept Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic.",jiri.strouhal@cvut.cz; petra.stamfestova@vse.cz; kliuchnikov@gmail.com; zuzana.vincurova@paneurouni.com,"Ključnikov, Aleksandr/K-6273-2018; Strouhal, Jiri/H-6426-2012","Ključnikov, Aleksandr/0000-0003-0350-2658;",,,,,18,14,19,4,24,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

Using panel data on 120 countries during the 1996-2011 period, we find that commitment to the SDDS occurs when costs for states are low, and that compliance with the SDDS initiative is associated with increased data transparency after controlling for self-section bias.

We develop a theoretical model of the economic connection between communal grazing, disease transmission risk, risk perceptions, and antimicrobial use, and derive testable hypotheses about these connections. Regression results suggest that history of disease and communal grazing are associated with higher subjective disease risk and greater antimicrobial use.

We present descriptive evidence on the micropolitical correlates of informality using direct measures of the concept in public opinion surveys from 18 Latin American countries. We test three scholarly impressions of informal workers that they are less politically engaged, more right leaning, and more favorable toward noncontributory social programs than formal-sector workers. These are grounded in a dualist conception of labor markets that views the formal and informal sectors as having little overlap. We find minimal evidence for these impressions and argue that recent empirical findings consistent with a revisionist view of informality better account for our null results. According to this view, informal and formal labor markets are highly integrated, which, we argue, melds together the economic interests and political preferences of individuals in both sectors. We also provide evidence that casts doubt on alternative explanations that would attribute our null results to the timing of our surveys, to arational sources of political behavior, or to measurement error.

A set of harmonized representative CO2 taxes and tax revenue recycling schemes is implemented in five large-scale economy-wide general equilibrium models. Recycling schemes include various combinations of uniform transfers to households and labor and capital income tax reductions. Particular focus is put on equity - the distribution of impacts across household incomes - and efficiency, evaluated in terms of household welfare. Despite important differences in the assumptions underlying the models, we find general agreement regarding the ranking of recycling schemes in terms of both efficiency and equity. All models identify a clear trade-off between efficient but regressive capital tax reductions and progressive but costly uniform transfers to households; all agree upon the inferiority of labor tax reductions in terms of welfare efficiency; and all agree that different combinations of capital tax reductions and household transfers can be used to balance efficiency and distributional concerns. A subset of the models go further and find that equity concerns, particularly regarding the impact of the tax on low income households, can be alleviated without sacrificing much of the double-dividend benefits offered by capital tax rebates. There is, however, less agreement regarding the progressivity of CO2 taxation net of revenue recycling. Regionally, the models agree that abatement and welfare impacts will vary considerably across regions of the U.S. and generally agree on their broad geographical distribution. There is, however, little agreement regarding the regions which would profit more from the various recycling schemes.","[Caron, Justin] MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Caron, Justin] HEC Montreal, 3000 Chemin Cote St Catherine, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada; [Cole, Jefferson; McFarland, James] US EPA, 1200 Penn Ave NW, Washington, DC 20460 USA; [Goettle, Richard] Northeastern Univ, 360 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Goettle, Richard] Dale Jorgenson Associates, 433 NH Route,119 East Fitzwilliam, Fitzwilliam, NH 03447 USA; [Onda, Chikara] Stanford Univ, Emmett Interdisciplinary Program Environm & Resou, 473 Via Ortega,Y2E2 Suite 226, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Woollacott, Jared] RTI Int, 3040 E Cornwallis Rd, Durham, NC 27709 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; United States Environmental Protection Agency; Northeastern University; Stanford University; Research Triangle Institute,"Caron, J (通讯作者)，MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;Caron, J (通讯作者)，HEC Montreal, 3000 Chemin Cote St Catherine, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada.",jcaron@mit.edu,,,Intramural EPA [EPA999999] Funding Source: Medline,Intramural EPA,,,30,16,16,3,24,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2010-0078,2010-0086,,CLIM CHANG ECON,Clim.

Mobility does not derive from individual decisions or free choices. On the contrary, it is the result of the interaction between individual attributes and social structure. To grasp this interaction, it is necessary to go well beyond observed mobility. This paper explores the unequal access to urban opportunities among different social classes in Montevideo. It does so by computing potential public transport accessibility to two types of crucial opportunities: jobs and education. The paper findings show an unequal distribution of potential mobility, especially for jobs and upper level public education. Primary public schools are an exception, revealing the spatial footprint of the mature Uruguayan social protection network at this level. This paper's approach allows to identify and describe various fields of contestation such as urban form, transit network, the state provision of public goods (in the case of education), through examining the effects of uneven mobility on social goods access and, as a result, on social equity.","[Hernandez, Diego] Univ Catolica Uruguay, Polit & Social Sci Dept, 4th Floor,Off 425 Ave 8 Octubre 2738, Montevideo 11600, Uruguay",Universidad Catolica del Uruguay,"Hernandez, D (通讯作者)，Univ Catolica Uruguay, Polit & Social Sci Dept, 4th Floor,Off 425 Ave 8 Octubre 2738, Montevideo 11600, Uruguay.",dhernandez@ucu.edu.uy,"Hernandez, Diego/HNI-5316-2023","Hernandez, Diego/0000-0002-9485-305X",,,,,50,69,84,8,45,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

This paradigm involves not only considering more seriously the environmental consequences of transport, but also including a wider variety of actors in transport policymaking processes. In this article we use qualitative evidence from Mexico City and Guadalajara to show the tensions that exist within the apparent consensus around sustainable mobility policy in Latin American cities. In doing so, we analyze a particular kind of non state actor who has become a critical figure in both the production and contestation of sustainable mobility policy in Mexico. These actors, whom we call expert-citizens in this article, are characterized by their mobilization of legitimacy as both experts and citizens to influence urban transport policy agendas. This legitimacy is mobilized through three key practices: 1) their focus on small-scale interventions; 2) their capacity to engage the state and civil society through the use of a toned-down language; and 3) a strategic use of media and public opinion tools. We argue that the work these expert-citizens undertake- and the strategies, practices and spaces they use-are telling of a new type of urban political actor that goes beyond the traditional divide between state planners and civil society groups that has characterized studies of urban transport politics. Finally, by focusing on the relational ways in which these actors confront and collaborate with transport activists, planners and experts, both globally and in their home cities, we show new ways in which sustainable mobility policy is produced, circulated and contested in Latin American cities.","[Lopez, Oscar Sosa] Univ Georgia, Coll Environm & Design, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Montero, Sergio] Univ Andes, Ctr Interdisciplinario Estudios Desarrollo, Bogota, Colombia",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; Universidad de los Andes (Colombia),"López, OS (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Coll Environm & Design, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",oscarsosa@uga.edu; s.montero@uniandes.edu.co,"Montero, Sergio/J-2513-2019","Montero, Sergio/0000-0002-8708-1290; Sosa Lopez, Oscar/0000-0002-8498-6297",,,,,61,31,35,2,17,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

The literature on global production networks only recently began to pay more detailed attention to conceptualizing the role that labour plays in such networks and has so far focused mainly on industrial settings - not smallholder farming. Similarly, the literature on sustainability standards has focused on wage-workers in large-scale workplaces such as factories or plantations. This article seeks to remedy this lack of attention and make contributions to both literatures by arguing first, that labour agency in export-oriented smallholder tea production in developing countries may not be advanced much by the sustainability certifications demanded by Western buyers and second, that labour agency can nevertheless be present at the margins' of global production networks even though informal rural wage workers are most often assumed to lack both 'structural' and 'associational' power. These arguments are made on the basis of a case study of on-farm wage labour in smallholder tea production in Kenya. The article finds labour's bargaining power to be stronger in some locations compared to others and that differences between locations can be fruitfully explored by looking not just at workers insertion into the vertical structures of the global production network but by also including more 'horizontal' dimensions relating to the local context in which smallholder tea production and on-farm wage-workers are embedded.","[Riisgaard, Lone] Roskilde Univ, Univ Vej 1,Postbox 260, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Okinda, Obadia] Cooperat Univ Kenya, Nairobi, Kenya",Roskilde University; Cooperative University of Kenya,"Riisgaard, L (通讯作者)，Roskilde Univ, Univ Vej 1,Postbox 260, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.",loner@ruc.dk,"; Riisgaard, Lone/Y-4324-2018","Miroro, Obadia Okinda/0000-0002-5729-974X; Riisgaard, Lone/0000-0002-8827-3227",Consultative Committee for Development Research (FFU) [10-107DIIS],Consultative Committee for Development Research (FFU),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors received funding from The Consultative Committee for Development Research (FFU) 10-107DIIS.",,36,18,18,1,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1024-5294,1477-2221,,COMPET CHANG,Compet.

The method, which is based on the observation of morning transactions of frequent users, is applied to a sample of over 2 million cards. The method is evaluated using a sample from the Santiago ODS where users declared their card id and also declared their home address. A sample of 888,970 cards that are observed at least three days in a week and show spatial regularity for the morning transaction is used for zone of residence estimation and analysis of travel patterns and time use.

Moreover, if there is some heterogeneity in the identification of households as poor and vulnerable, it investigates the degree of mismatch between measures? The ex-post monetary poverty (MP) and multidimensional poverty (MDP) measures are used to identify poor households. Likewise, the ex-ante vulnerability to monetary poverty (VMP) and vulnerability to multidimensional poverty (VMDP) measures are used to identify vulnerable households. Using a large household survey data-set of about 90,000 households from the Punjab province of Pakistan, we find that most of the vulnerable households are accurately identified by the ex-ante measures of vulnerability to poverty. However, the ex-post measures of poverty identify different households as poor. Our results show that 18 percent households experiencing MDP are not captured by the one-dimensional measure of MP. The important implication of this study is that the choice of measures does matter in ex-post poverty identification, but not as much in the identification of ex-ante vulnerability to poverty.","[Azeem, Muhammad Masood; Mugera, Amin W.; Schilizzi, Steven] Univ Western Australia, UWA Sch Agr & Enviornment, 35 Stirling Hwy, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Azeem, Muhammad Masood] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Inst Agr & Resource Econ, Faisalabad, Pakistan; [Azeem, Muhammad Masood] Univ New England, Ctr Agribusiness, Armidale, NSW, Australia",University of Western Australia; University of Agriculture Faisalabad; University of New England,"Azeem, MM (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, UWA Sch Agr & Enviornment, 35 Stirling Hwy, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",masood.azeem@research.uwa.edu.au,"Mugera, Amin/E-6749-2012","Mugera, Amin/0000-0002-5199-2201; Schilizzi, Steven/0000-0002-4063-074X; Azeem, Muhammad Masood/0000-0003-4531-1016",University of Western Australia [UWA-Pakistan Flood Reconstruction Scholarship],University of Western Australia [UWA-Pakistan Flood Reconstruction Scholarship],This work was supported by the University of Western Australia [UWA-Pakistan Flood Reconstruction Scholarship].,,85,31,33,5,66,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

The transition was supported by the entrepreneurial initiative, that took advantage from a new open economy [1]. The characteristics of the entrepreneur can influence in a major way the business success and development, the well-being of a nation being closely related to the intensity of the entrepreneurial activity. With no doubt, entrepreneurship is vital for the national economy, being an important growth factor and contributing significantly to the long-term prosperity. For the countries in transition, as Romania, the massive loss of jobs after 1990, determined by the shrinking of the state sector, was compensated partially by the small business sector that was the main factor driving economic growth and absorbed also the unemployment. The purpose of this paper is to analyse whether there are significant differences in the profile of the founders of newly created enterprises (especially the level of education and previous socio-professional category of founder/manager) from developed regions in Romania during 2010-2016 taking into consideration the rural and urban areas.

Field research was conducted by utilizing a structured questionnaire, which was developed by adopting relative constructs reported in literature. The research target sample consisted of Amway's Independent Business Owners (IBOs). Two hundred and twenty five questionnaires were distributed during company's big and small conferences in Greece. Moreover, an online version of the questionnaire was created and communicated to IBOs from various regions of Greece via the web, while the same link was also emailed to a small number of IBOs. The resulting sample comprised 151 correctly answered questionnaires. Principal Component Analysis was initially performed to identify latent factors within the questionnaire items measuring the trust antecedents, components and consequences, which led to alterations of the initial model. The emerged trust antecedents were named cultural similarity, privacy concerns and conflict. The trust components were named ability, integrity and goodwill, while the trust consequences were named commitment and perceived continuity. The results of the regression analyses conducted showed that cultural similarity is the most significant antecedent of trust. Moreover, goodwill was found to be the trust component that leads to higher levels of both commitment and perceived continuity.","[Chatzopoulou, Ioanna; Santouridis, Ilias] Technol Educ Inst Thessaly, Larisa, Greece",,"Santouridis, I (通讯作者)，Technol Educ Inst Thessaly, Larisa, Greece.",isant@teilar.gr,"Chatzopoulou, Ioanna/HKO-3701-2023",,,,,,41,0,1,0,6,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2518-668X,,,KNE SOC SCI,,,2018,,,,,,,201,220,,10.18502/kss.v3i10.3539,0.0,,,20,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7SJ,,gold,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455399000013,0

A guiding principle in built environment design for sustainability and livability is a latent construct termed Sense of Place (SOP), which leads visitors to perceive and associate a strong identity or character with a particular location. We hypothesize that visitors' SOP affects their access of sites via walking/biking or other non-motorized travel modes. Furthermore, we also hypothesize their ICT use shapes their SOP. In an information era, mobile ICT provide ubiquitous information and communication across multiple geographies, expanding interaction with locations to include both the physical and virtual. Visitors can engage with a location pre and post-trip through online reviews or virtual visualizations, such as Google Street View. To investigate these interrelationships, we conduct a visitor intercept survey and analyze the responses to investigate the direction and magnitude SOP impacts on non-motorized site visit frequency. The estimation results indicate that SOP statistically impacts non-motorized visits; ICT use for learning about the site was found to positively impact visitors' estimated SOP.","[Chen, Roger B.; Sekar, Ashok] Rochester Inst Technol, Golisano Inst Sustainabil, 119 Lomb Mem Dr, Rochester, NY 14623 USA",Rochester Institute of Technology,"Chen, RB (通讯作者)，Rochester Inst Technol, Golisano Inst Sustainabil, 119 Lomb Mem Dr, Rochester, NY 14623 USA.",rbcgis@rit.edu; ashoks@mail.rit.edu,,"Chen, Roger/0000-0002-0528-6007",University Transportation Research Center for Region 2 (UTRC2) at City College of New York - CUNY [49198-24-27],University Transportation Research Center for Region 2 (UTRC2) at City College of New York - CUNY,"The authors would like to thank the University Transportation Research Center for Region 2 (UTRC2), Grant #49198-24-27 at City College of New York - CUNY for funding this research work.",,51,7,7,2,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

It demonstrates the importance of aspirations to informing agricultural policies and understanding the behaviour of farmers and their vision regarding their farms. The Heckman two-step regression model was used to determine factors affecting aspirations/willingness of farmers to expand in the first stage and their ability to achieve or realise those aspirations in the second stage. The paper identifies five key factors that influence farmer aspirations (willingness to expand), i.e., positive psychological capital, access to markets, access to credit, land tenure security, and membership in other social groups. Gender, asset ownership, access to markets and local resource use conflicts were significant in determining farmers' ability to achieve those aspirations. The study reveals the importance of developing positive psychological capital among smallholders and affirms the need for affordable production credit. To better make use of irrigation schemes, there is a need to build the capacity of smallholders to achieve their aspirations through empowering women and improving access to physical assets and markets. Land tenure security concerns need addressing while supporting institutions that promote social interaction and learning remain vital for the growth of the smallholder irrigation sector.","[Chipfupa, Unity; Wale, Edilegnaw] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Private Bag X01, ZA-3209 Scottsville, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal,"Chipfupa, U (通讯作者)，Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Private Bag X01, ZA-3209 Scottsville, South Africa.",uchipfupa@gmail.com,"Wale, Edilegnaw/N-5292-2013; Chipfupa, Unity/ABD-9878-2020; Wale, Edilegnaw/AAC-9048-2021; Zegeye, Edilegnaw Wale/JXY-0016-2024","Wale, Edilegnaw/0000-0003-4705-7971; Chipfupa, Unity/0000-0001-9759-9301; Wale, Edilegnaw/0000-0003-4705-7971;",Water Research Commission of South Africa [K5/2278/4],Water Research Commission of South Africa,This work was supported by the Water Research Commission of South Africa [grant number K5/2278/4].,,57,8,9,1,7,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2018,57.0,3-4,,,,,284,299,,10.1080/03031853.2018.1531773,0.0,,,16,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,HD1WR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000452303600008,0

The purpose of this study is to uncover problems and information needs on the environment. To achieve these objectives, the researchers first identify environmental issues, especially related to biodiversity which is a significant issue in the local government, then mapping the need for reporting biodiversity accounting. This study operates discourse analysis methods. Discourse in this perspective is interpreted as multiple and irregular pronunciations, then using universal norms or standards will organize regular meanings. The findings of this study show that environmental problems raise some anxiety about ecological damage. The rapid development of urban development is one of the main driving factors in the emergence of environmentalism movement and increases the need for the importance of reporting biodiversity accounting as a form of government accountability.","[Damayanti, Ratna Ayu; Syarifuddin; Rahmawati, H.

This phenomenon is becoming increasingly apparent also in Poland and manifests itself in, for instance, the decline in the importance of the agricultural sector as a type of occupation. However, the Polish economy is still characterized by high agricultural employment, which determines the low labour productivity in this sector and results in its weak adaptation to the functioning in the conditions of competition. Further changes in agriculture are subject to the labour outflow to other sectors. This process is one of the objectives of the Polish labour market policy. The paper examines the scale of deagrarianisation of employment and its exogenous and endogenous conditions in the Polish economy. The effects of the support of labour outflow from the agriculture, which had been implemented through the Cohesion Policy as well as the RDP in the years between 2007 and 2015, were also assessed. According to the research results, the process of deagrarianisation of employment is continuous and sustainable. It was determined by many various factors, which can be divided into two groups: internal -pushing the labour force out of agricuture (supply), and external identifying the needs for employment outside agriculture (demand). As the analysis of ways and effects of the impact of projects financed from the EU funds on changes in agricultural labour resources proves that these initiatives contributed to the growth in non-agricultural employment, at different levels of effectiveness and sustainability of support depending on the type of allocation.","[Dudek, Michal; Karwat-Wozniak, Bozena] Natl Res Inst, Inst Agr & Food Econ, Warsaw, Poland",Institute of Agricultural & Food Economy,"Dudek, M (通讯作者)，Natl Res Inst, Inst Agr & Food Econ, Warsaw, Poland.",Michal.Dudek@ierigz.waw.pl; Bozena.Karwat-Wozniak@ierigz.waw.pl,"Dudek, Michał/AAB-7513-2020","Dudek, Michał/0000-0002-6977-8561; Karwat-Wozniak, Bozena/0000-0003-2503-5181",,,,,19,0,0,0,1,"INST AGRICULTURAL & FOOD ECONOMICS, NATIONAL RESEARCH INST-IAFE-NRI",WARSZAWA,"UL.

The concept is explained and a variety of ways to measure SRISK are developed. In this article, new results are presented on the uncertainty associated with the SRISK measure and on how it compares with other related measures from both academics and regulators. By focusing on the mechanism by which undercapitalization of the financial sector initiates a financial crisis, new research examines how the probability of a financial crisis is affected by the level of SRISK and, consequently, how much SRISK a country can stand without having a high probability of crisis. The model used to evaluate this probability recognizes the externalities between financial institutions that make an undercapitalized firm or country more fragile if other firms and countries are also undercapitalized.","[Engle, Robert] NYU, Stern Sch Business, Volatil Inst, 550 1st Ave, New York, NY 10012 USA",New York University,"Engle, R (通讯作者)，NYU, Stern Sch Business, Volatil Inst, 550 1st Ave, New York, NY 10012 USA.",,,,,,,,35,23,23,3,28,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4810-6,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

We construct a simple model that generates predictions regarding the effect of fiscal policies on average emissions of new cars, and then test the model empirically. Our empirical strategy combines a diverse series of data. First, we use a large database of vehicle-specific taxes in 15 EU countries over 2001-2010 to construct a measure for the vehicle registration and annual road tax levels, and separately, for the sensitivity of these taxes. We find that for many countries the fiscal policies have become more sensitive to emissions of new cars. We then use these constructed measures to estimate the effect of fiscal policies on the emissions of the new car fleet. The increased -sensitivity of registration taxes have reduced the emission intensity of the average new car by 1.3 %, partly through an induced increase of the share of diesel-fuelled cars by 6.5 percentage points. Higher fuel taxes lead to the purchase of more fuel efficient cars, but higher diesel fuel taxes also decrease the share of (more fuel efficient) diesel cars; higher annual road taxes have no or an adverse effect.","[Gerlagh, Reyer; van den Bijgaart, Inge] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Nijland, Hans] PBL Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, The Hague, Netherlands; [Michielsen, Thomas] CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, The Hague, Netherlands; [van den Bijgaart, Inge] Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden",Tilburg University; CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy; University of Gothenburg,"Gerlagh, R (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Tilburg, Netherlands.",r.gerlagh@uvt.nl,,"Gerlagh, Reyer/0000-0001-9781-9212",Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency; Norwegian Research Council (through CREE),Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency; Norwegian Research Council (through CREE),"We received a remarkable amount of constructive and helpful comments.

Swedish FDIs in 73 countries worldwide have been examined using a dataset provided by Statistics Sweden. According to the study, 83.2% of variation in the dependent variable, FDI, can be explained by the profitability of investments.

Firstly, we define the terms alternative finance, alternative funding, and crowdfunding. The paper continues with the theoretical framework of crowdfunding and discusses different models of this type of financing. Development of alternative forms of financing is analysed based on data from previous surveys carried out in the field of alternative finance markets and individual crowdfunding platforms functioning around the world. Crowdfunding is growing worldwide, and the Asia-Pacific region, headed by China, is the world's largest alternative finance market, followed by the Americas. In Europe, the UK is the market leader in alternative finance. As individual models of financing are concerned, the most common forms of alternative finance activities are peer-to-peer consumer lending, reward-based crowdfunding, and peer-to-peer business lending. At the end of the paper, we provide a conclusion of the presented aspects of crowdfunding and development of alternative finance. Finally, we mention potentially problematic areas of this type of financing that could be elaborated upon in the future.","[Hejdukova, Pavlina; Krechovska, Michaela] Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Plzen, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Hejduková, P (通讯作者)，Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Plzen, Czech Republic.",,"Krechovska, Michaela/C-5510-2016","Krechovska, Michaela/0000-0002-1215-1418","project 'Finance and Sustainable Development from the Perspective of Theory and Practice' at the University of West Bohemia, Faculty of Economics [SGS-2017-0004]","project 'Finance and Sustainable Development from the Perspective of Theory and Practice' at the University of West Bohemia, Faculty of Economics","This is paper has been prepared under financial support of the project SGS-2017-0004 'Finance and Sustainable Development from the Perspective of Theory and Practice' at the University of West Bohemia, Faculty of Economics, which authors gratefully acknowledge.",,28,0,0,11,43,INTL INST SOCIAL & ECONOMIC SCI,PRAGUE,"TREBESOVSKA 2038/14, PRAGUE, 193 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",2336-6044,,978-80-87927-53-3,PROC ECON FINAN CONF,,,2018,,,,,,,63,74,,10.20472/EFC.2018.009.005,0.0,,,12,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2CN,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000505163200005,0

Drawing on interviews with 131 former production team members from 16 provinces, this paper re-examines the issue of work incentives by placing it in a historical and social context in which formal institutions, such as the different forms of collective organization, income distribution and state extraction, as well as informal institutions, such as indigenous social networks, communal norms and collective sanction, interacted with non-institutional factors, especially local geographical, demographic and ecological conditions, to constrain and motivate Chinese villagers participating in collective production. The complexity and fluidity of this context gave rise to a multiplicity of patterns of peasant behaviour in team farming, which accounts for the contrasting performances of rural collectives in different areas and periods.","[Li, Huaiyin] Jinan Univ, Hist, 601 Huangpu W Ave, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Li, Huaiyin] Univ Texas Austin, Hist, 116 Inner Campus Dr, Austin, TX 78712 USA",Jinan University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Li, HY (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Hist, 601 Huangpu W Ave, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;Li, HY (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Hist, 116 Inner Campus Dr, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",hli@utexas.edu,,,,,,,28,10,11,2,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

In terms of entrepreneurial performance, the increase of educational years, the improvement of health level and the growth of financial assets can have a significant positive effect on entrepreneurial performance. Besides, family entrepreneurship in rural areas is also affected by family factors and regional differences.

All the policies should be combined together and be reasonable so as to stabilize the real estate market.","[Lyu, Wenjun; Bu, Chunyi] Shanghai Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Shanghai University,"Bu, CY (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",lwj@shu.edu.cn; buchunyi96826@163.com,,,,,,,4,0,0,3,11,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-623-5,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,56.0,,,,,,378,381,,,,,,4,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO0KO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000491539600086,0

Design/methodology/approach The paper uses literature review as a method to identify a research gap in the literature on internationalization of Indian firms. Findings The synthesis of the theoretical debate and empirical studies conducted in context of EMNEs, with a particular focus on India and preliminary examination of data on cross-border acquisitions as well as institutions in India lead us to argue for the consideration of institutions at sub-national level (Indian states) in examining the determinants of outward FDI from India. The paper also proposes a conceptual framework relating to the mechanism through which institutions at the state level in India affect the propensity of firms to invest overseas. Research limitations/implications Since the propositions are not tested empirically, the paper does not provide conclusive results. Originality/value In addition to providing the synthesis of the theoretical debate and empirical studies, paper is, to the best of author's knowledge, the first one to present a conceptual framework relating institutions at sub-national level with the outward foreign direct investment from India.","[Nayyar, Rishika] Indian Inst Foreign Trade, Qutub Inst Area, New Delhi, India",,"Nayyar, R (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Foreign Trade, Qutub Inst Area, New Delhi, India.",rishikadse@gmail.com,"Nayyar, Rishika/GON-5230-2022","Nayyar, Rishika/0000-0003-0363-2946",,,,,103,9,9,1,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

We contend that this lock-in originates from a lack of market orientation and consequential neglect of key stakeholders' preferences in program design. Considering the case of a retailer-owned meat brand, we demonstrate the relevance of stakeholders' inclusion when establishing animal welfare programs for pigs. Surveys among 62 farming members of a pig trading cooperative and 692 supermarket customers reveal the heterogeneity of beliefs and acceptance within both groups. While a Responsible Innovation approach, including key actors from the initial criteria selection, could be effective for raising acceptance, it would likely lead to lengthy time-to-market, prohibiting first-mover advantages. We suggest instead that beliefs and acceptance among farmers may be influenced through a communication strategy based on survey results and experimental research, as well as facilitating positive word-of-mouth.","[Purwins, Nina; Schulze-Ehlers, Birgit] Gottingen Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Goettinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Schulze-Ehlers, Birgit] Lincoln Univ, Fac Agribusiness & Commerce, Dept Global Value Chains & Trade, Christchurch 7647, New Zealand",University of Gottingen; Lincoln University - New Zealand,"Purwins, N (通讯作者)，Gottingen Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Goettinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",nina.purwins@agr.uni-goettingen.de,,"Schulze-Ehlers, Birgit/0000-0003-0440-3133",Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL); German Research Foundation; Open Access Publication Funds of the Gottingen University,Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL); German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Open Access Publication Funds of the Gottingen University,The data stem from a project which is supported by funds of the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) based on a decision of the Parliament of the Federal Republic of Germany via the Federal Office for Agriculture and Food (BLE) under the innovation support program.

This study selects 146 ground observation stations on the Mongolian Plateau and analyzes the temporal and spatial distribution of the sand-dust weather features (dust storm, blowing dust, and floating dust) in this region. The results show that: (1) High frequency of the blowing dust occurs in arid areas such as Alashan, central and western Inner Mongolia, and a high frequency of the dust storms is found in Mongolia, with the highest values observed in the Gobi Desert in the southern part of this country. (2) The sand and dust weather in Inner Mongolia and Mongolia is mainly concentrated in the months of March, April, and May, with the dust weather days in Inner Mongolia and Mongolia accounting for 28% and 24% of the total days in April, respectively. (3) In general, the dust storms in Mongolia show an increasing trend. In particular, the days of dust weather recorded by the three stations of Baitag, Hovd, and Uliastai have the fastest growth rate, which increases at the rate of 1.62 d/a, 2.59 d/a, and 4.01 d/a annually.

To abstract from the business cycle shocks, data are modified by frequency filters. Finally, to avoid a false regression, the specifications are differenced. Since we do not reject the correlation between error terms of the specification, we use the seemingly unrelated regression method to estimate the coefficients.

Additionally, the endogeneity of financial literacy is controlled for by using the Control Function approach. Financial literacy is found to be a significant determinant of the decision to enter the stock market, with an average partial effect of 5.8%. The education quality (proxied by student-teacher ratios) and the financial incentives observed at early ages (captured by the sharpe-ratios observed by individuals at early adult life) play a significant role as well.

Using the 2006 Core Welfare Indicator Survey for Burundi we compare their food intake and their level of expenses with that of their non-displaced neighbours. We test whether it is the duration of displacement that matters for current food security and nutritional status or the time lapsed since returning home. We use log-linear as well as propensity score matching and an instrumental variable-approach to control for self-selection bias. We find that the individuals and HHs who returned home just before the time of the survey are worse off compared to those who returned several years earlier. On average, the formerly displaced have 5 per cent lower food expenses and 6 per cent lower calorie intake. Moreover, we find evidence in favour of duration of displacement as the main mechanisms through which displacement affects HH welfare. Results are robust after controlling for self-selection bias. Despite international, government and NGO assistance, the welfare of recent returnees is lagging seriously behind in comparison with the local non-displaced populations.","[Verwimp, Philip] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Ctr Emile Bernheim, ECARES, Ave Roosevelt 42, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Verwimp, Philip] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Solvay Brussels Sch Econ & Management, Ave Roosevelt 42, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Carlos Munoz-Mora, Juan] Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, Barcelona, Spain; [Carlos Munoz-Mora, Juan] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Solvay Brussels Sch Econ & Management, Barcelona, Spain; [Carlos Munoz-Mora, Juan] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain",Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Solvay SA; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Pompeu Fabra University,"Verwimp, P (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, Ctr Emile Bernheim, ECARES, Ave Roosevelt 42, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.;Verwimp, P (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, Solvay Brussels Sch Econ & Management, Ave Roosevelt 42, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",philip.verwimp@ulb.ac.be,"Muñoz-Mora, Juan Carlos/AGK-9291-2022","Muñoz-Mora, Juan Carlos/0000-0002-7304-8115",European Union [263905],European Union(European Union (EU)),This work was supported by the European Union Seventh Framework Programme; [263905].,,48,17,18,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

This study uses Macau, a high-density city in Asia, as a case study area and tracks changes in the distribution of UGS accessibility across space and across population groups from 2010 to 2015. Based on the two-step floating catchment area model (2SFCA), the results indicate that UGS accessibility is distributed unevenly across space and population groups in Macau. Over time, however, UGS accessibility became more evenly distributed, despite the decline in overall UGS accessibility. These changes are attributable to the policies of upgrading UGSs and building micro-scale UGSs. These results shed light on how future policies can enhance UGS equity in high density urban areas.","[Ye, Changdong; Li, Min] South China Agr Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture & Urban Planning, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Ye, Changdong; Hu, Lingqian] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA",South China Agricultural University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"Hu, LQ (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",hul@uwm.edu,"Hu, Ivy/L-3119-2019","Hu, Ivy/0000-0002-5687-0764",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41701190],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The authors would like to thank the Civic and Municipal Affairs Bureau of Macau for providing the data and helping with the UGS survey.

This paper analyzes the spatial economic impacts of road and railway accessibility levels on manufacturing output, focusing on substitution and complementarity of the intra- and the inter-modal relationship. By estimating Translog production functions, we find that the improvement in railroad accessibility increases the marginal value added of local manufacturing industries associated with the change in road accessibility. The marginal value added with respect to the change in railroad accessibility increases by the level of railroad accessibility, resulting in increasing returns to scale. However, road accessibility can positively influence the marginal value added only with respect to the railroad variables, holding decreasing returns to scale. This implies that there is not a substitutive but a complementary relationship between the two transportation modes in terms of manufacturing output.","[Yi, Yoojin a] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Reg Quantitat Anal Res Grp BK21plus, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Euijune] Seoul Natl Univ, Res Inst Agr & Life Sci, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU),"Kim, E (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Res Inst Agr & Life Sci, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Seoul, South Korea.",jinparki@snu.ac.kr; euijune@snu.ac.kr,,"Yi, Yoojin/0000-0002-4390-2560",,,,,39,14,16,6,38,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

The transformation works because the assumption of profit maximization links the firms' decisions together.

Further tests reveal that any positive reactions are driven by small and/or low risk institutions, while negative ones are consistent across subsets; except for investment banks. We also find market risk increases for most financial institutions that are dominated by small and/or low risk firms. The cross-section results reveal that large institutions fare better than their smaller counterparts and that large investment banks gain value at the expense of others.

Using a new dataset on housing finance and house prices for a sample of more than 50 countries, this paper analyzes the dynamic relationship between household credit and house-price booms. It also examines the potential role of some housing finance characteristics on the likelihood of house-price booms and on how they ended. The following stylized patterns are high-lighted. First, credit and house-price booms are tightly linked. Second, house-price booms have occurred more often with a twin credit boom (simultaneous booms in both household and firm credit) than with a solo boom in household credit. Third, house-price booms seem to be more likely in countries with higher loan to value ratios and mortgage. funding models based on securitization or wholesale sources. Finally, we find that the majority of house-price booms end up with a recession, and that both twin credit booms and non-retail deposit funding predict a worse landing.

We employ a dynamic general equilibrium model with sticky prices, in which banks trade excess funds in the interbank lending market. We find that an increase in the liquidity requirement effectively reduces the impact of an interbank shock on the real and financial sector, while an increased capital requirement propagates only through nominal variables as inflation and interest rates. We conclude that stricter liquidity measures which limit inside money creation, dampen the severity of a breakdown in interbank lending. Targeting interbank financing directly through liquidity measures along with a moderate capital requirement generates lower welfare losses. We thereby provide a comprehensive rationale in favor of the regulatory measures in Basel III. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This paper estimates the causal effects of the ACA on health insurance coverage in 2014 using data from the American Community Survey. We utilize difference-in-difference-in-differences models that exploit cross-sectional variation in the intensity of treatment arising from state participation in the Medicaid expansion and local area pre-ACA uninsured rates. This strategy allows us to identify the effects of the ACA in both Medicaid expansion and non-expansion states. Our preferred specification suggests that, at the average pre-treatment uninsured rate, the full ACA increased the proportion of residents with insurance by 5.9 percentage points compared to 2.8 percentage points in states that did not expand Medicaid. Private insurance expansions from the ACA were due to increases in both employer-provided and non-group coverage. The coverage gains from the full ACA were largest for those without a college degree, non-whites, young adults, unmarried individuals, and those without children in the home. We find no evidence that the Medicaid expansion crowded out private coverage.

Leveraging lender- and liquor store-level data, we find that the changes reduce sales, with the largest decreases at stores located nearest to payday lenders. By focusing on states with state run liquor monopolies, we account for endogenous supply-side variables that are typically unobserved. Further analysis of consumer-level data indicates that the lending restrictions reduce alcohol expenditures without affecting total household spending. This is consistent with a distinct relationship between payday lending access and alcohol purchases, and suggests that present biased motivations underlie some loan use. The finding is significant because it shows that payday loan access is associated with unproductive borrowing, and directly links payday loan access to public health issues. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The key feature is that investors use different forecasting models, and hence assess uncertainty differently. As economic conditions deteriorate, uncertainty rises and investors' opinions polarize. Disagreement thus spikes in bad times, causing returns to react to past news. This phenomenon creates a positive relation between disagreement and future returns. It also generates time-series momentum, which strengthens in bad times, increases with disagreement, and crashes after sharp market rebounds. We provide empirical support for these new predictions.","[Cujean, Julien] Univ Maryland, Robert H Smith Sch Business, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Hasler, Michael] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Toronto,"Cujean, J (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Robert H Smith Sch Business, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",,,,University of Maryland; University of Toronto; Connaught New Researcher Award,University of Maryland; University of Toronto(University of Toronto); Connaught New Researcher Award,"Julien Cujean is with the University of Maryland, Robert H.

It requires that foreign products be treated no less favorably than national products. This paper empirically examines the 1996 WTO recommendation that a Japanese distilled alcoholic beverage, shochu, be classed as a directly competitive or substitutable product with regard to other distilled drinks, and thus that not taxing similarly be in violation of its national treatment obligation. Demand estimates obtained from a random-coefficient discrete choice model reveal that a substitution pattern of shochu is far more complicated than that presumed by the WTO. Upon the WTO recommendation, Japan made all distilled alcoholic beverages be taxable at the same level. Our simulation analysis indicates that the tax revision, while it reduced the tax revenue, improved Japanese national welfare. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

A revision is only possible as long as the insured person is healthy. The combination of unspanned labor income and the stickiness of insurance decisions reduces the long-term insurance demand significantly.

As a result, some assets will have to be liquidated and sold to outsiders at firesale prices, giving rise to a potentially high losses given default (LGDs) for creditors of failed institutions. This study analyzes the consequences of this firesale mechanism for systemic risk. Our findings suggest that systemic risk is likely to be heavily underestimated when the potential for firesales, and thereby the endogenous nature of LGDs, is not taken into account. The magnitude of the negative bias increases with asset return correlations, banks' return variability, the degree of asset specificity of bank loans and the degree of concentration in the banking sector. The analysis suggests that time-varying liquidity requirements are an effective way to reduce the potential for firesales and thereby lower systemic risk. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

These households, who are often forgotten in transportation policy discussions, can be organized into two groups based on whether they are voluntarily carless or not. Understanding why some households decide to voluntarily forgo cars could inform policies aiming at reducing our dependency on cars. Understanding the plight of households who are not able to own a car is no less important as these households are at greater risk of social exclusion. Unfortunately, our knowledge of carless households is still sketchy so the purpose of this paper is to start filling this gap. We analyze data from the 2012 California Household Travel Survey using univariate tests and Generalized Structural Equation Models (GSEM) that account for residential self-selection to assess the impacts of various socio-economic and built environment variables on the likelihood to be carless, voluntarily or not. Our results (GSEM Model 1) indicate that carless households are more likely to have less education, a lower income, and a smaller number of members than motorized families. They also tend to live in denser, more land-use diverse, and more walkable areas with better transit coverage. Contrasting voluntarily and involuntarily carless households (GSEM Model 3), we find that involuntarily carless households are less affluent on average and they tend to live in areas that are less land-use diverse, less walkable, and with worse transit coverage. Finally, although residential self-selection is present, its impacts are minor.","[Mitra, Suman K.; Saphores, Jean-Daniel M.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Bangladesh Univ Engn & Technol, Inst Transportat Studies, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Saphores, JDM (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Civil & Environm Engn Econ & Planning, Policy & Design, Inst Transportat Studies, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",slunitra@uci.edu; saphores@uci.edu,"Saphores, Jean Daniel/Q-5445-2019; Mitra, Suman/HPE-7906-2023; Saphores, Jean-Daniel/JCZ-2810-2023","Saphores, Jean Daniel/0000-0001-9514-0994; Saphores, Jean-Daniel/0000-0001-9514-0994; Mitra, Suman/0000-0002-7776-5779",UCI; UCI Graduate Division for a Public Impact Fellowship,UCI; UCI Graduate Division for a Public Impact Fellowship,The first author is grateful to the UCI Chancellor for a Chancellor's Club Fellowship and to the UCI Graduate Division for a Public Impact Fellowship.

We analyse whether food price volatility is mainly induced by transfer of the oil price shock or if it is the consequence of a rising and competitive biofuel production. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of biofuels on land use as well. Food prices have lately surged and declined sharply and become more volatile. High fuel prices combined with a rising biofuel production created a link between crude oil and food prices. We investigated the impact of a biofuel production on an increased volatility in oil and food prices, and found correlations between cereals, sugar and vegetable oil price index and crude oil prices from 2003 to 2016. Our results show that the main driver for food price fluctuation is mainly the oil price shock. The increasing biofuel output has been associated with a rising protein-rich animal feed production. The use of co-products as animal feed has land use implications including GHG emission savings because co-products reduce land and the demand for chemical inputs required in the feed production.","[Olah, Judit; Lengyel, Peter; Balogh, Peter; Harangi-Rakos, Monika; Popp, Jozsef] Univ Debrecen, Fac Econ & Business, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary",University of Debrecen,"Oláh, J (通讯作者)，Univ Debrecen, Fac Econ & Business, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary.",olah.judit@econ.unideb.hu; lengyel.peter@econ.unideb.hu; balogh.peter@econ.unideb.hu; rakos.monika@econ.unideb.hu; popp.jozsef@econ.unideb.hu,"Oláh, Prof. Dr. Judit/U-5352-2019; Popp, József/AFN-1250-2022; Popp, József/AAF-4461-2021; Lengyel, Peter/S-3438-2017; Balogh, Peter/J-9183-2019","Oláh, Prof. Dr. Judit/0000-0003-2247-1711; Popp, József/0000-0003-0848-4591; Balogh, Peter/0000-0002-8611-0221",New National Excellence Program of the Ministry of Human Capacities [UNKP-17-4],New National Excellence Program of the Ministry of Human Capacities,Supported by the UNKP-17-4 New National Excellence Program of the Ministry of Human Capacities.,,31,40,40,0,15,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

A potentially important part of the School-to-Prison Pipeline is the use of sworn School Resource Officers ( SROs), but there is little research on the causal effect of hiring these officers on school crime or arrests. Using credibly exogenous variation in the use of SROs generated by federal hiring grants specifically to place law enforcement in schools, I find evidence that law enforcement agencies learn about more crimes in schools upon receipt of a grant, and are more likely to make arrests for those crimes. This primarily affects children under the age of 15. However, I also find evidence that SROs increase school safety, and help law enforcement agencies make arrests for drug crimes occurring on and off school grounds.

Can governments attract private capital in infrastructural investments through policy reform? We address this question by showing that, in the case of electricity generation, a simple legislation enabling independent power production increases private investment in electricity generation bymore than an order of magnitude. Contrary to the conventional wisdom on the importance of constraints on executive power for credible commitment, we find that such constraints neither draw private capital nor condition the effectiveness of policy reform. We also find that both domestic and foreign investment increase with IPP reform.

Transit service performance measurement reflects a very first step towards an efficient and proactive management, where public transit agencies are increasingly pressured to provide high-quality services in spite of constrained resources. However, the performance evaluation of transit services is complicated by an array of quantitative measures available to assess the goals and the diversity in the goals themselves, which usually include improving operational efficiency and providing equitable access. While much previous work has examined public transit services for achieving optimal operational efficiency and/or access equity separately, the interplay of the two has rarely been investigated to date. This article proposes a new method for evaluating the overall performance of public transit services via a combination of data envelopment analysis (DEA), Geographic Information System (GIS), and multi-objective spatial optimization techniques. The new method is applied to assessing the performance of fixed route bus services operated by the Utah Transit Authorities (UTA) in the Wasatch Front, Utah. Results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively account for operational efficiency and access equity in an integrated framework, providing a more comprehensive assessment for transit service performance.","[Wei, Ran] Univ Calif Riverside, Sch Publ Policy, Ctr Geospatial Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Liu, Xiaoyue] Univ Utah, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Mu, Yongjian] Univ Utah, Sch Comp, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Wang, Liming; Golub, Aaron] Portland State Univ, Toulan Sch Urban Studies & Planning, Portland, OR 97207 USA; [Farber, Steven] Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Human Geog, Toronto, ON M1C 1A4, Canada",University of California System; University of California Riverside; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Portland State University; University of Toronto; University Toronto Scarborough,"Wei, R (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Riverside, Sch Publ Policy, Ctr Geospatial Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",ran.wei@ucr.edu,"Farber, Steven/ABE-6061-2021; wei, wei/IQW-1347-2023; wei, wei/HHR-8613-2022",,National Institute for Transportation and Communities (NITC) [1024],National Institute for Transportation and Communities (NITC),This project was funded by the National Institute for Transportation and Communities (NITC) under grant 1024.,,49,46,48,2,79,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

The literature considers bidders that have complete information about the costs of adoption and optimal bidding behavior reflects this information advantage. Farmers seek information rents and bids decrease when risk aversion increases because farmers are more averse to losing the auction. We contribute to the literature by allowing for cost risk. Our paper shows that farmers must balance the risk of losing the auction (thus foregoing information rent) with the risk of submitting a bid that is not high enough to pay the costs of adopting conservation practices (thus incurring losses). We design an experiment to trade off these two risks and examine how risk aversion affects bidding behavior when participants face different sources and levels of risk. Our experiment contributes to a small literature on experimental auctions with risky product valuations. We find that participants decrease their bids as risk aversion increases, even in auctions with cost risk, suggesting that the risk of losing the auction dominates. These findings uncover new challenges for the practical implementation of conservation auctions as an efficient policy instrument.","[Wichmann, Bruno; Boxall, Peter; Wilson, Scott; Pergery, Orsolya] Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, 503 Gen Serv Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada",University of Alberta,"Wichmann, B (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, 503 Gen Serv Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada.",bwichmann@ualberta.ca; pboxall@ualberta.ca; scott.wilson@ualberta.ca; operger@ualberta.ca,,"Wichmann, Bruno/0000-0003-1104-0035",Watershed Evaluation of Beneficial Management Practices (WEBs) project of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada [AAFC 1585-10-3-2-1-3]; Australian Research Council's Discovery Fund [150104219],Watershed Evaluation of Beneficial Management Practices (WEBs) project of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada; Australian Research Council's Discovery Fund(Australian Research Council),"We would like to thank Philippe Marcoul and Jens Schubert for helpful comments.

To this end, the S&P 500 option implied variance term structure is used as a proxy for aggregate variance risk. Principal component analysis shows that time variation in the variance term structure over the 1996-2012 period can be explained mainly by two factors which capture changes in the level and slope. The market price of risk of each factor is estimated in the cross-section of stock returns. The slope of the variance term structure is the most significant factor in the cross-section of stocks returns and carries a negative risk premium. The slope factor has also some predictive ability over long horizon equity returns. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Attracted by unprecedented government incentives under Mississippi's Balance Agriculture with Industry (BAWI) Program, 13 large manufacturing plants established operations in the state between 1936 and 1940. Using difference-in-differences and synthetic control matching techniques, I find that counties that received these plants experienced an over 15% increase in female labor force participation on average in the short run. Moreover, these effects persisted decades into the future, well after many of the original companies shut down. I also find suggestive evidence of an increase in educational attainment among women in counties where BAWI investment occurred.

Assuming that utility functions have realization forms, the above notions are characterized by the shapes of their reduction components.

Although economic growth has been volatile throughout the postwar World War II period, recent growth (2008-2015) has been remarkably weaker than in the previous low-growth period (1974-1995). The 2006-2015 period is often characterized by sluggish economic growth. This study investigates stock price reactions to stock dividend announcements, 30 days before and after the announcement dates, of publicly traded companies in the period 2006-2012. We use an event study methodology for 460 events and daily stock price data for companies in the CRSP historical data set. The study shows a significant reaction in stock prices around the event date. On average, stock prices reacted positively to stock dividend announcements. However, compared to previous findings of abnormal returns (5.9%), results from this study show small abnormal returns (about 1.81%) attributable to stock dividend announcements that are cumulative of the announcement day and up to 3-day post-announcement days.

The existing empirical evidence on the oil curse, however, does not account for variations in the ownership of oil. This article investigates whether the effect of oil abundance on growth varies with ownership structures. It also investigates whether pre-existing institutional conditions influence the effect of oil abundance across different ownership structures. Using a novel database on ownership structures and employing a panel fixed effects estimation method, it analyzes,a sample of oil-exporting developing countries during the period 1984-2005. The results show that the effect of oil abundance on growth varies with ownership structures and is also influenced by the quality of pre-existing institutions. Under state ownership and control, oil abundance reduces growth when the institutional quality is poor, but increases growth when the institutional quality is good. Under private ownership, on the other hand, oil abundance increases growth when the institutional quality is poor, but reduces growth when the institutional quality is good. The results suggest that ownership matters and countries can avoid the oil curse by choosing an appropriate ownership structure given their pre-existing institutional circumstances. The policy advice in this article is: adopt state ownership and control if the institutions are strong, if the institutions are weak, transfer ownership to foreign oil companies.

Whether such a stringent standard for expert testimony is beneficial or detrimental to the American justice system is still under fierce debate, but there has been scant economic analysis of this issue. This paper attempts to fill the gap by presenting a game-theoretic argument showing that a stringent admissibility standard operates to increase the accuracy of judicial decision-making in certain situations. More precisely, when the judge faces uncertainty regarding an expert's quality, the admissibility standard may provide the judge with information about the quality of expert testimony, thereby increasing the accuracy of judicial decision-making by mitigating the judge's inference problem. I show the ways in which this effect dominates at trial and discuss related issues.","[Kim, Chulyoung] Yonsei Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Kim, C (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",,,"Kim, Chulyoung/0000-0001-8921-3288",Yonsei University Future-leading Research Initiative [2016-22-0048],Yonsei University Future-leading Research Initiative,I am grateful to two anonymous referees for comments that substantially improved this paper.

Optimal taxation theory typically concludes that they should hold large stocks of assets. To reconcile facts and theory, we introduce two simple modifications into an otherwise standard optimal taxation model with commitment: government impatience and continuous debt limits. Two results are obtained. First, positive government debt is optimal for even minimal government impatience. Second, the optimality of negative government debt disappears even without impatience if discrete debt limits are replaced by very wide but continuous debt limits. We go on to quantify the implications for debt, interest rates and business cycle dynamics.","[Kumhof, Michael] Bank England, Res Hub, Suite 332HO-2B-D,Threadneedle St, London EC2R 8AH, England; [Kumhof, Michael] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kumhof, Michael] Barclays Bank, London, England; [Yakadina, Irina] IMF, Inst Capac Dev, Washington, DC USA; [Yakadina, Irina] IMF, African Dept, Washington, DC USA; [Yakadina, Irina] IMF, European Dept, Washington, DC USA; [Yakadina, Irina] IMF, Fiscal Affiars Dept, Washington, DC USA; [Yakadina, Irina] IMF Inst, Washington, DC USA",Bank of England; Stanford University; Barclays; International Monetary Fund; International Monetary Fund; International Monetary Fund; International Monetary Fund,"Kumhof, M (通讯作者)，Bank England, Res Hub, Suite 332HO-2B-D,Threadneedle St, London EC2R 8AH, England.",michael.kumhof@bankofengland.co.uk,,,,,,,45,0,0,3,12,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

Our empirical results first reveal that all variables are relevant to the economic growth equation, but most variables enter the model non-linearly, thus justifying the use of non-parametric methods. Second, most of the partial effects of globalization are positive for a poor performing economy (in terms of the levels of education, initial income, and globalization), while the partial effects are negative for those of a better performing economy. As to whether and how insurance market and globalization exert an influence on economic growth under different conditions, we find that a positive effect of globalization on economic growth does exist under a lower level of insurance activities, while it has a negative effect for those higher levels of insurance activities. Finally, the partial effects of the insurance sector on economic growth are negative in almost all cases. These findings offer several useful insights for policy-makers and researchers.

I quantify this effect early in the housing crisis by exploiting exogenous variation in the incentives to modify securitized nonagency loans. An additional modification reduces loan losses by 35.8% relative to the average loss; this reduction suggests that the marginal benefit of modification likely exceeded the marginal cost. Consistent with the idea that high-income borrowers may be better equipped to withstand bad economic times, I find that modifications are especially beneficial when borrowers have larger loans.","[Maturana, Gonzalo] Emory Univ, Goizueta Business Sch, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",Emory University,"Maturana, G (通讯作者)，Emory Univ, Dept Finance, Goizueta Business Sch, 1300 Clifton Rd, Atlanta, GA 30320 USA.",gonzalo.maturana@emory.edu,,,,,,,36,13,13,1,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Using the system-GMM technique with four-year average panel data over the period 1995-2014, including 53 African countries, the paper finds four main results. (1) There is a U-shaped relationship between the manufacturing share of GDP and per capita GDP. (2) Exchange rate depreciation stimulates Africa's manufacturing sector. (3) Good governance, especially a low level of corruption and better government effectiveness contribute to Africa's manufacturing development. (4) The size of domestic market positively affects the manufacturing share of GDP. On the other hand, the paper finds no significant effects of FDI and urbanization on manufacturing development. The implication of these findings is that improving the level of competitiveness, expanding the size of domestic market, combating corruption as well as improving government effectiveness are key for Africa's manufacturing sector development. Moreover, the U-shaped relationship between the manufacturing share of GDP and per capita GDP, implies that African countries should not expect industrialization to automatically happen with income increase, but rather, they should proactively tackle key obstacles to the development of the manufacturing sector.

In particular, they determine the impact of government spending that alleviates market failure such as subsidies to the poor which reduce credit market failure and environmental regulations to correct for pollution externality. It is found that a shift in government spending towards goods that alleviate market failure has countervailing effects - consumption pollution rises due to increases in income, but consumption pollution also falls due to increasing environmental regulations. Conditional on the government adopting a democratic regime, the effect through environmental regulations outweighs the effect through income leading to lower consumption pollution. The authors estimate an empirical model and find that the results support their theoretical predictions.","[Galinato, Gregmar I.] Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Islam, Asif] World Bank USA, Dev Econ Indicators Grp, Enterprise Anal Unit, Washington, DC USA",Washington State University,"Galinato, GI (通讯作者)，Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",ggalinato@wsu.edu; aislam@worldbank.org,"Islam, Asif/IQR-5824-2023; Islam, Asif/AAQ-2113-2020",,,,,,41,15,15,0,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

The greatest positive effect of knowledge spillovers is on startup entrepreneurship and the resulting magnitude grows somewhat over time. The spillovers are modest on overall entrepreneurship, while entrepreneurs who were previously employed see more immediate benefits.

Furthermore, a subset of these measures is driven by similar demographic characteristics as such that males are more risk seeking and risk-aversion increases with age. Using extensive data on the retirement portfolios of the participants during the years 2008-2014, we find that all of these measures are positively correlated with the riskiness of individual portfolios.

Ethiopia embarked on a land tenure reform program in 1998, after years of communism during which all land was nationalized. The reform began in Tigray region where land certificates were issued to household heads, who were primarily male. In a second phase carried out in 2003-2005, three other regions issued land certificates jointly to household heads and spouses, presenting variation in land tenure security by gender. Results using household panel data show that joint land certification to spouses was accompanied by increased household consumption of healthcare and homegrown food and decreased education expenditure, compared to household-head land certification. Joint land certification was also accompanied by increased consumption of women's and girls' clothing, and decreased men's clothing expenditures indicating results may be explained by a shift in the gender balance of power within households. Analysis on the incidence and duration of illness indicates that increased healthcare expenditures after joint land certification may be due to joint certification households seeking more effective treatment than head-only certification households for household members who fell ill or suffered injuries.

We find that VOV exposure is a significant determinant of hedge fund returns. After controlling for fund characteristics, we find a robust and significant negative risk premium for VOV exposure in the cross section of hedge fund returns.

Our results suggest that (1) a risk-minimizing structure of total retirement income still allows a fraction 5 percent to be financed via private savings, due to the benefits of hedging, (2) the optimal portfolio shares at a fixed total pension level imply high fractions of private savings even if agents are highly risk-averse, and (3) determining the optimal size of the total pension level under the current social security system implies only low additional private saving rates.","[Anders, Christoph] WGZ Bank, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Groneck, Max] Stockholm Sch Econ, POB 6501, SE-11383 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm School of Economics,"Anders, C (通讯作者)，WGZ Bank, Dusseldorf, Germany.",christoph.anders@wgzbank.de; max.groneck@hhs.se,,,,,,,39,0,1,2,17,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,1614-0974,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,SEP,2017,73.0,3,,,,,255,291,,10.1628/001522117X14915570953903,0.0,,,37,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FG6TY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000410527000002,0

New Basel III regulatory framework highlights the importance of liquidity risk management implemented by financial institutions. Moreover, updated International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) require the improvements about fair value measurements and reinforce existing principles for disclosures about the liquidity risk associated with financial instruments. Using the liquidity discount model of Chen (2012), we are able to empirically classify Taiwan's financial institutions into three liquidity categories: safe, crisis contagious and vulnerable. Our findings can serve as an early warning signal for liquidity calamity. In addition, we investigate what factors affect firm-specific liquidity discounts for these institutions and conduct a sub period analysis, which examines whether there is significant liquidity discounts changes before and after the 2008 financial crisis. We find that liquidity discounts change substantially during the financial crisis. Furthermore, we find that liquidity discounts can be attributed to some firm -specific performance.

Specifically, many companies use an average tax rate (the GAAP effective tax rate, ETR) to evaluate incremental decisions, rather than using the theoretically correct marginal tax rate. We find evidence consistent with behavioral biases (heuristics, salience) and managers' educational backgrounds affecting these choices. We estimate the economic consequences of using the theoretically incorrect tax rate and find that using the ETR for capital structure decisions leads to suboptimal leverage choices and using the ETR in investment decisions makes firms less responsive to investment opportunities.

This model features, first, heterogenous energy sources and, second, a capacity-constrained backstop technology. This setup allows for capturing the following two empirical observations. First, different types of energy sources are used simultaneously despite different production cost. Second, experiences from various European countries show that a further expansion of the use of climate friendly technologies faces substantial technological as well as political constraints. We use this framework to analyse if under two policy scenarios a so-called Green Paradox occurs. A subsidy for the clean energy as well as an expansion of the capacity of the clean energy are considered. The analysis shows that under plausible parameter values both policy measures lead to a weak Green Paradox; however a strong Green Paradox is only found for the capacity expansion scenario. In addition, the subsidy is found to be welfare enhancing while the capacity increase is welfare enhancing only if the cost of adding the capacity is sufficiently small.We also show the effects of the policies crucially depend on the initial capacity and that under certain scenarios even an extreme Green Paradox is found.","[Gronwald, Marc] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Business, CESifo, Aberdeen AB24 3QY, Scotland; [Gronwald, Marc] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Business, Ifo Inst, Aberdeen AB24 3QY, Scotland; [Ngo Van Long] McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada; [Ngo Van Long] Univ Tasmania, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Roepke, Luise] Ifo Inst Econ Res, Munich, Germany",University of Aberdeen; University of Aberdeen; McGill University; University of Tasmania; Ifo Institut,"Gronwald, M (通讯作者)，Univ Aberdeen, Sch Business, CESifo, Aberdeen AB24 3QY, Scotland.;Gronwald, M (通讯作者)，Univ Aberdeen, Sch Business, Ifo Inst, Aberdeen AB24 3QY, Scotland.",mgronwald@abdn.ac.uk; ngo.long@mcgill.ca; roepke@ifo.de,,,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),Marc Gronwald and Luise Roepke gratefully acknowledge financial support by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research.

In the states of Central and Eastern Europe, public transport had a dominant position in the transport market in the 90s. Nowadays, the market share is declining, particularly in the bus transport, with the rising costs for public budgets regarding an increase in individual motoring.

The Taiwan Stock Exchange discloses subscription demand information, after which individual investors request the highest sub-scription rate shares; this can lead to herding. The empirical results of this study showed that investors exhibit increased attraction toward IPOs with extremely high subscription demand. After identifying sample issues with herd features, herd behavior in Taiwan's IPO market was found to be consistent with the winner's curse theory. Additionally, investors overreacted to subscription demand in the short run, which leads to negative long-term returns.","[Wang, Chao-Shi] Natl Taichung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Business Adm, Taichung, Taiwan; [Tang, Hui-Wen] Tamkang Univ, Dept Insurance, New Taipei, Taiwan; [Chen, Roger C.

A model closely related to the approach of Lai (2010) is linked to externalities that are familiar from conventional public finance. The observed deviations from efficient taxation are derived from the interplay of four externalities, which can be divided into two groups: externalities occurring due to tax competition and externalities which are caused by lobbying. Whether or not the centralization of tax competences is useful depends mainly on the relative sizes of the competition-induced and lobbying-induced externalities.","[Winter, Simon] Univ Munster, Inst Econ Educ, Scharnhorststr 100, D-48155 Munster, Germany",University of Munster,"Winter, S (通讯作者)，Univ Munster, Inst Econ Educ, Scharnhorststr 100, D-48155 Munster, Germany.",simon.winter@uni-muenster.de,,"Winter, Simon/0000-0002-2715-4144",,,,,32,2,2,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

Having children can change preferences that are central to the decision whether to be self-employed. On the one hand, individuals' preference for autonomy and flexibility increases when having children, which increases the willingness to be self-employed. On the other hand, having children entails a responsibility over someone else, which increases individual risk aversion and decreases the willingness to be self-employed. Using a pooled cross section of 26 years from the General Social Survey, instrumental variable estimates indicate that, in the USA, having children under the age of 18 in the household decreases the likelihood of being self-employed by 11 % (i.e., the responsibility effect dominates). This effect is considerable as a child decreases the probability of self-employment more than the increase associated with being raised by a self-employed father-one of the main determinants of self-employment.","[Caballero, Gustavo A.] Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB N2N 1N4, Canada",University of Calgary,"Caballero, GA (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB N2N 1N4, Canada.",gacaball@ucalgary.ca,,"Caballero, Gustavo/0000-0001-5696-5213",Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarships by the Social Science and Humanities Research Council,Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarships by the Social Science and Humanities Research Council,"I would like to thank Robert Oxoby, Ana Ferrer, Atsuko Tanaka, Jean-Francois Wen, Curtis Eaton, the editor and two anonymous referees for valuable comments.

This effect is increasing in a firm's ownership by transient investors and nonblockholders. Liquid firms have a higher likelihood of future bad earnings news releases, which are accompanied by greater selling by transient investors, but not blockholders. Our results suggest that liquidity induces managers to withhold bad news, fearing that its disclosure will lead to selling by transient investors.

The model also generates endogenous consumption volatility risk. Precautionary savings motives make consumption sensitive to shocks in bad times, leading to countercyclical volatility, even with homoscedastic technology shocks. Habit acts as countercyclical leverage, which amplifies this channel.

As a result of more predation of livestock, conflicts with livestock farmers have deepened. We model this conflict using sheep farming as an example, and in instances in which farmers are given compensation for the predation loss. The compensation scheme is composed of a fixed per animal loss value (ex-post), but also a compensation just for the presence of the carnivores (ex-ante). Ex-post compensation payment is practiced in many countries where farmers are affected by killed and injured livestock, but also damages to crops. Ex-ante payment implies payment for environmental services and is also widely practiced. In the first part of the paper, the stocking decision of a group of farmers is analyzed. In a next step, the Directorate for Natural Resource Management (DNRM), managing the carnivores and compensation scheme, is introduced. The strategic interaction between the sheep farmers and DNRM is modelled as a Stackelberg game with DNRM as the leader. We find that it is not beneficial for DNRM to use ex-post, but only ex-ante compensation.

We find that the impact of a shock in the terms of trade on the external balance depends on whether the traditional rule or the new view for the current account dominates. If the new view for the current account holds, the Harberger-Laursen-Metzler effect holds for creditor countries: a deterioration of the terms of trade deteriorates the external balance. However, if the traditional rule dominates, changes in the terms of trade may not affect the external balance, and the effect fails to hold. The empirical evidence, based on a sample of 37 countries from 1970 to 2009, shows that when the ratio of the net foreign asset position is approximately between-15% and +15% as a share of domestic wealth the new view dominates and the effect holds for creditor countries; however, in large creditor or debtor countries, the traditional rule dominates, and the effect ceases to hold.","[Erauskin, Inaki] Univ Deusto, Deusto Business Sch, P Mundaiz 50, Donostia San Sebastian 20012, Spain; [Gardeazabal, Javier] Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Bilbao, Spain",University of Deusto; University of Basque Country,"Erauskin, I (通讯作者)，Univ Deusto, Deusto Business Sch, P Mundaiz 50, Donostia San Sebastian 20012, Spain.",inaki.erauskin@deusto.es; javier.gardeazabal@ehu.eus,"Gardeazabal, Javier/G-9765-2015; Erauskin, Iñaki/P-2475-2019","Gardeazabal, Javier/0000-0001-9200-1710; Erauskin, Iñaki/0000-0002-3449-7372","Programa de Movilidad del Personal Investigador del Departamento de Educacion, Politica Linguistica y Cultura del Gobierno Vasco; Programa de ayudas para apoyar las actividades de los grupos del sistema universitario vasco del Departamento de Educacion, Politica Linguistica y Cultura del Gobierno Vasco (Grupo de investigacion) [IT885-16, IT783-13]; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad y Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional [ECO2015-64467-R]","Programa de Movilidad del Personal Investigador del Departamento de Educacion, Politica Linguistica y Cultura del Gobierno Vasco; Programa de ayudas para apoyar las actividades de los grupos del sistema universitario vasco del Departamento de Educacion, Politica Linguistica y Cultura del Gobierno Vasco (Grupo de investigacion); Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad y Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional","We are grateful to two anonymous referees and the editor (Hamid Beladi) for all of their helpful comments.

These measures contain information from both the earnings quarter (within quarter) and the period between the quarter-end and the earnings announcement date (post quarter). Our within-quarter measure is powerful in explaining quarterly sales growth, revenue surprises, and earnings surprises, generating average excess announcement returns of 3.4%. However, our post-quarter measure is related negatively to announcement returns and positively to post-announcement returns. When post-quarter private information is positive, managers, at announcement, provide pessimistic guidance and use negative language. This effect is more pronounced when, post-announcement, management insiders trade. We conclude that managers do not fully disclose their private information and instead bias their disclosures down when in possession of positive private information.

Relative size of IMF credit as a share of gross domestic product sends two mixed signals to multinational enterprises (MNEs). First, it is a signal that a country is facing an actual or potential BOP crisis. Second, countries that seek IMF credit typically agree to implement a set of IMF conditionality before financial credit is disbursed. This may signal to MNEs that policy reforms that must accompany IMF financial credit may result in ex ante positive economic outlook and stability. We find that relative size of IMF credit is negatively (positively) correlated with FDI inflows to developing countries below (above) a threshold value of economic freedom. The main implication of these findings is that MNEs may view developing countries with below average index of economic freedom as lacking institutional capabilities to implement recommended IMF policy reforms when faced with an actual or potential BOP crisis. Our results are robust across alternative model specifications and consistent with the theory of catalytic finance.

In this paper, I examine fee structures for private equity real estate funds from an investors perspective. Fee structures, as proposed by fund managers in placing documents, are used to calibrate the total fee load. The average total fee load for closed-end funds equals 2.7%, which is substantially lower than for private equity funds. Through regression and simulation, I show that core and value-add funds charge significantly lower performance fees compared with opportunistic funds, although there is no difference in management fees. Moreover, larger funds charge significantly less management fees. Investors can substantially reduce fees by controlling the amount of leverage and avoiding commitment fees and catch-ups.","[van der Spek, Maarten] PGGM Investments, Zeist, Netherlands",PGGM,"van der Spek, M (通讯作者)，PGGM Investments, Zeist, Netherlands.",mrvdspek@gmail.com,"van der Spek, Maarten/KDM-6138-2024",,PGGM,PGGM,"I would like to thank the participants at the Annual Conference of the European Real Estate Society in Vienna, J.L.

We find a range of annual WTP values for successful propositions from $3.47 per person for children's hospitals to $94.48 per person for transportation infrastructure and management. We also impute the per capita cost of each proposition. Comparing these imputed costs to our WTP measure allows us to infer the upper bound on prices that would still ensure passage of a successful measure. Conversely, this comparison provides an estimate of the decrease in prices that would have been necessary to ensure passage of unsuccessful propositions. In addition, we estimate the relative effects of prices, income, and ideology on the support for public goods. We show that both ideology and economic costs have significant impacts, which stands in contrast to previous work that contends that voting patterns are driven purely by fiscal costs.","[Burkhardt, Jesse] Colorado State Univ, 1200 Ctr Ave Mall, Ft Collins, CO USA; [Chan, Nathan W.] Colby Coll, 5246 Mayflower Hill, Waterville, ME 04901 USA",Colorado State University; Colby College,"Chan, NW (通讯作者)，Colby Coll, 5246 Mayflower Hill, Waterville, ME 04901 USA.",jesse.burkhardt@colostate.edu; nwchan@colby.edu,"Burkhardt, Jesse/IQU-4168-2023","Chan, Nathan/0000-0003-0909-8393",,,,,27,12,16,1,10,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

Four main messages emerge from the analysis. First, the region is increasingly more connected with itself and with the rest of the world, even relative to GDP. Second, although economies in the North capture the bulk of the region's inward and outward investments, EAP's connectivity with the South has grown relatively faster. Third, EAP is relatively more connected through arm's length financing (portfolio investments and syndicated loans) with the more financially developed North, and through FDI (M&As and greenfield investments) with itself and the South. Fourth, more developed EAP economies have a larger role in EAP's arm's length investments than in the region's FDI. (C) 2017 The World Bank. Published by Elsevier Inc.

This is an issue of recent and major interest to the financial sector, both from a regulatory and financial institutions perspective, especially in light of observed negative values for major bond yield and interest rate spread time series. In historical simulation a common approach is to consider log returns (that is, relative changes), given that the risk factors remain positive. If a risk factor allows for negative values, log returns cannot be applied and one either ignores such scenarios or switches to considering absolute changes. The latter approach implies an abrupt model change. Our displaced historical simulation model strongly improves the historical simulation by displacing the shifts such that negative values can be handled, smoothly moving to the limit case of using absolute shifts instead of relative shifts of the original data. Our empirical results show that compared to other models presented in the literature, models equipped with our proposed displacement feature handle situations of close-to-zero or negative risk variables particularly well.","[Fries, Christian P.] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Math, Theresienstr 39, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Nigbur, Tobias] Univ St Gallen, Rosenbergstr 52, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland; [Seeger, Norman] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Seeger, Norman] Tinbergen Inst, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Munich; University of St Gallen; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute,"Seeger, N (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Seeger, N (通讯作者)，Tinbergen Inst, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",christian.fries@math.lmu.de; tobias.nigbur@gmx.de; n.j.seeger@vu.nl,"Seeger, Norman J./HTP-8307-2023","Seeger, Norman J./0000-0003-4606-1995",,,,,46,6,6,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5398,1879-1727,,J EMPIR FINANC,J.

This paper offers a comparative analysis of the impact of design on the financial performance of intentionally selected companies. The two-part study was carried out in 2014 and 2016. The survey was aimed at managers of various enterprises. The main goal was to investigate the evolution of the opinions of managers regarding a design and its influence on the financial performance (generally, increases in revenue, sales or brand value) of the company. Furthermore, the study aimed to determine whether enterprises earmark part of the budget for design, and whether the issue of return on investment in design is addressed. The statistical analysis was performed with the Pearson's chi-squared test analysis tool. Elementary statistical software was also used for a numerical evaluation of the findings. The results demonstrate the increasing importance of design and prove that investments in design have a positive effect on financial indicators and also on enterprise competitiveness in the Czech Republic.","[Kramolis, Jan; Stankova, Pavla] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Kramolis, J (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic.",kramolis@fame.utb.cz; stankova@fame.utb.cz,"Azonnoudo, Seyido/ISU-7505-2023; Kramoliš, Jan/C-7481-2015; Kramoliš, Jan/M-2492-2019","Kramoliš, Jan/0000-0002-1687-8067; Stankova, Pavla/0000-0001-7068-8937",,,,,35,6,7,1,7,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

Adverse selection costs are estimated using three spread decomposition models and used as proxies of informed trading. We show that adverse selection costs are economically significant and substantially increase after the onset of the crisis. For example, adverse selection costs increased by an average of $0.962 ($0.884) for call (put) options using estimates from the model of George et al. (1991). When trading with superior information, informed traders prefer options that are near-the-money, of medium maturity (3090 days), and of low price volatility. Further analysis reveals that information asymmetry costs are positively associated with trade size and negatively associated with trading intensity.","[Li, Wei-Xuan] Stockton Univ, Sch Business, 101 Vera King Farris Dr, Galloway, NJ 08205 USA; [French, Joseph J.] Univ Northern Colorado, Monfort Coll Business, Campus Box 128, Greeley, CO 80639 USA; [Chen, Clara Chia-Sheng] Providence Univ, Dept Finance, 200 Sec 7,Taiwan Blvd, Taichung 43301, Taiwan",Stockton University; University of Northern Colorado; Providence University - Taiwan,"French, JJ (通讯作者)，Univ Northern Colorado, Monfort Coll Business, Campus Box 128, Greeley, CO 80639 USA.",liw1@stockton.edu; joseph.french@unco.edu; cschen2@pu.edu.tw,,"French, Joseph/0000-0002-6224-8365",Stockton University; Monfort College of Business Summer Research grant,Stockton University; Monfort College of Business Summer Research grant,"We are grateful for valuable comments by an anonymous referee and the editor, Jules van Binsbergen.

Political ecology, however, highlights that good governance and effective land management at the local level can offset the impact of population growth and development on environmental degradation. In this paper, we provide an innovative argument derived from political ecology to explain deforestation, but rather than pursing a bottom up approach to governance, we take a top down approach. We argue that the state can ease deforestation rates by weaning rural populations off of the consumption of biomass for their energy needs by expanding rural electrification access. Using a panel analysis of 158 countries for the years 1990, 2000, and 2010, we find that not only does rural electrification cause deforestation rates to decrease, but also that it is more robust in explaining deforestation than population growth or development. Our study provides two innovations to political ecology: it highlights that the state can help, rather than hinder, local populations with managing their local environments in a more sustainable way by providing them with (public goods-based) energy alternatives, and; it supplements political ecology's qualitative focus on environmental degradation with a generalized quantitative analysis of state-based initiatives on deforestation. Our results suggest that current global initiatives addressing deforestation specifically the Reduction of Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) agenda of the United Nations' Framework Convention on Climate Change should not only assist local land managers, but also work with the state to ensure universal access to electricity.

At that time, REDD+ was an idea regarding payment to countries (and possibly also projects) for reducing emission from forests, with funding primarily from carbon markets. The initiative has since become multi-objective in nature; the policy focus has changed from a payments for environmental services (PES) approach to broader policies, and international funding primarily originates from development aid budgets. This aidification of REDD+ has made the program similar to previous efforts using conditional or results-based aid (RBA). However, the experience of RBA in other sectors has scarcely been addressed in the REDD+ debate. The alleged advantages of RBA are poorly backed by empirical research. This paper reviews the primary challenges in designing and implementing a system of RBA, namely, donor spending pressure, performance criteria, reference levels, risk sharing, and funding credibility. It then reviews the four partially performance-based, bilateral REDD+ agreements that Norway has entered with Tanzania, Brazil, Guyana, and Indonesia. These agreements and the aid experience provide valuable lessons for the design and implementation of future REDD+ mechanisms.","[Angelsen, Arild] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Sch Business & Econ, As, Norway; [Angelsen, Arild] Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Bogor, Indonesia",Norwegian University of Life Sciences; CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR),"Angelsen, A (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Sch Business & Econ, As, Norway.;Angelsen, A (通讯作者)，Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Bogor, Indonesia.",arild.angelsen@nmbu.no,,"Angelsen, Arild/0000-0002-6037-6849",UNU-WIDER ReCom project,UNU-WIDER ReCom project,"The author thanks the UNU-WIDER ReCom project for the support in undertaking the project, and the guidance provided by Channing Arndt and Finn Tarp.

However, moral hazard may not arise, due to high risk aversion or market context. We study the relationship between disaster risk reduction and insurance coverage to assess the presence of moral hazard for two different natural hazards, using four econometric models on survey data from Germany and the United States. The results show that moral hazard is absent. Nevertheless, adverse risk selection may be present.

It finds that while all four strengthened women's formal land rights, only the reforms in Bolivia and Brazil resulted in a significant share and number of female beneficiaries. In both countries, strong national-level rural women's movements were the main advocates behind women's land rights in a context in which they formed part of the coalition that brought these regimes to power. In Bolivia, women have benefited principally through joint titling of land to couples in the country's massive land regularization programme. Brazil's reform has been the most redistributionary, and women have benefited through the priority given to female household heads as well as the mandatory joint allocation of land to couples in the agrarian reform settlements.","[Deere, Carmen Diana] Univ Florida, Ctr Latin Amer Studies, POB 115530, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Deere, Carmen Diana] Fac Latinoamer Ciencias Sociales FLACSO, Quito, Ecuador",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Deere, CD (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Ctr Latin Amer Studies, POB 115530, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",deere@ufl.edu,,,,,,,47,18,22,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

We also estimate the benefits and costs associated with a seasonal gas tax set to reduce vehicle trips during the winterinversion season and thereby lower health costs through concomitant decreases in the PM2.5 concentrations. We find a strong positive relationship between vehicle trips reduced and associated reductions in PM2.5 concentrations. Further, we estimate a mean gas price elasticity of approximately -0.3 in what we call a  high price variability environment. Incorporating these results, cost-benefit analysis suggests that the social net benefit for Cache Valley associated with the imposition of a seasonal gas tax during the winter-inversion season is highly dependent upon the type of benefit estimation method used.","[Moscardini, Leo A.; Caplan, Arthur J.] Utah State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, 4835 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University,"Caplan, AJ (通讯作者)，Utah State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, 4835 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",arthur.caplan@usu.edu,,,,,,,60,4,5,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Lessons from Mutual Fund Marketing and Distribution Expense,JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL AND QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PERFORMANCE; PERSISTENCE; COMPETITION; MANAGER; COSTS; FLOWS; TESTS; SIZE,"Theory predicts that capping brokers' compensation exacerbates the exploitation of retail investors. We show that regulated caps on mutual fund 12b-1 fees, effectively sales commissions, are associated with negative equity fund performance, but only after a structural shift toward maximum permitted levels of the fees around 2000. Past this break point, flow-performance sensitivity shifts from the middle-to the highest-performing funds, suggesting that the fee cap increases performance-chasing behavior by constraining brokers' incentives to learn about lower-ranked funds. The policy implication is that regulators must reevaluate the efficacy of caps on brokerage fees.","[Oh, Natalie Y.; Parwada, Jerry T.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Banking & Finance, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Tan, Eric K.

In order to explain agrarian processes in the country during the decade under Morales thus far (2006-2016), it examines the changing balance of agrarian class forces in Bolivian society and associated changes in the class composition of the ruling bloc between 2006 and 2010. It divides contestation over agrarian reform processes during this decade into two periods-one of insurgent contestation (2006-2009), and one of agro-capital-state alliance (2010-2016). The transformations in class alliances over these periods can be understood theoretically through Gramsci's concept of transformismo (transformism). In particular, this concept captures both the way in which leading layers of indigenous-peasant movements have been absorbed into the apparatuses of the state and thus decapitated, and the dialectic of transformation/restoration that characterizes Bolivia's ongoing process of change.","[Webber, Jeffery R.] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England",University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Webber, JR (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.",j.r.webber@qmul.ac.uk,,,,,,,49,35,37,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Three main results emerge. First, the intensive margin was the main reason for China's export growth, and the contribution of the extensive margin was limited. Second, intensive margin and product margin were mainly concentrated in developed countries and China's neighbours, but the market margin was more distributed in developing countries and China's neighbours.

The relationships between the BE elements and PJA under a road charging policy are established using a spatial econometric approach, which uses an integrated land use and transportation model (TRANUS model) and a spatial lag model (SLM). With the intent of further analyzing the differences in the PJA effects of road pricing on traffic analysis zones (TAZs) that contain different combinations of BE elements, a quantitative classification method combining factor and cluster analysis is applied. This will quantitatively categorize TAZs inside and outside the tolled areas. In exploring the relationship between changes in PJA and the road pricing policy, we found the spatial autocorrelation coefficient to be negative. This result suggests that we are unable to increase the PJA of all the regions through road pricing, but rather affect a redistribution of PJA between different regions. Results also indicate that the impacts of road charging on PJA are associated with urban BE elements. Moreover, such effects are the common result of specific characteristics of the BE. The higher the number of jobs, the better the public transportation conditions, and the better the street design (high densities of street and intersections), the less the region will be negatively influenced by a road charging policy, and vice versa. To avoid the negative effects of road pricing on PJA prior to the launch of such a policy, cities should improve public transportation networks and enhance the street design of the road pricing policy areas, especially the toll ring periphery area.

On one hand, economic freedom might provide an unregulated framework that contributes to the likelihood of crashes. On the other hand, economic freedom may mitigate regulatory uncertainty thus providing a level of transparency that reduces the likelihood of crashes. Results in this study provide strong support for the latter idea as countries with higher levels of economic freedom experience lower probabilities of market crashes and more positive skewness in asset returns. A closer examination of the data suggest that the components of economic freedom that contribute most to the reduction in crash risk is the level of free trade and, to some extent, the strength of property-right protection.

Now green industrial policy is gaining popularity as governments search for low-carbon solutions that also provide jobs at home. The strategic trade literature has largely ignored the issue of market failures related to green goods. I consider the market for a new environmental good (like low-carbon technology) whose downstream consumption provides external benefits (like reduced emissions). Governments may have some preference for supporting domestic production, such as by interest-group lobbying, introducing a political distortion in their objective function. I examine the national incentives and global rationales for offering production (upstream) and deployment (downstream) subsidies in producer countries, allowing that some of the downstream market may lie in nonregulating third-party countries. Restraints on upstream subsidies erode global welfare when environmental externalities are large enough relative to political distortions. Climate finance is an effective alternative if political distortions are large and governments do not undervalue carbon costs. Numerical simulations of the case of renewable energy indicate that a modest social cost of carbon can imply benefits from allowing upstream subsidies.","[Fischer, Carolyn] Resources Future Inc, 1616 P St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Fischer, Carolyn] FEEM, Venice, Italy; [Fischer, Carolyn] CESifo Res Network, Munich, Germany",Resources for the Future; Fondazione Mattei; Ifo Institut,"Fischer, C (通讯作者)，Resources Future Inc, 1616 P St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.;Fischer, C (通讯作者)，FEEM, Venice, Italy.;Fischer, C (通讯作者)，CESifo Res Network, Munich, Germany.",fischer@rff.org,"Fischer, Carolyn/M-4362-2016; Fischer, Carolyn/JCD-8689-2023","Fischer, Carolyn/0000-0001-6179-1377;","European Community's Marie Sklodowska-Curie International Incoming Fellowship, STRATECHPOL-Strategic Clean Technology Policies for Climate Change under the EC Grant [PIIF-GA-2013-623783]; US Environmental Protection Agency Grant [83413401]; Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research (MISTRA) INDIGO program","European Community's Marie Sklodowska-Curie International Incoming Fellowship, STRATECHPOL-Strategic Clean Technology Policies for Climate Change under the EC Grant; US Environmental Protection Agency Grant; Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research (MISTRA) INDIGO program","Fischer would like to acknowledge the European Community's Marie Sklodowska-Curie International Incoming Fellowship, STRATECHPOL-Strategic Clean Technology Policies for Climate Change, financed under the EC Grant Agreement PIIF-GA-2013-623783, and the hospitality of the Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei (FEEM).

We focus on partnered women's labour supply, household income and welfare, demand for childcare and government expenditure. Using Australian data, we estimate a joint, discrete structural model of labour supply and childcare demand. We introduce two methodological innovations - a more flexible quantity constraint that total formal and informal childcare hours are at least as large as the mother's labour supply and the explicit inclusion of maternal childcare in the utility function as a proxy for child development. We find that tax credits are more effective than subsidies in terms of increasing average hours worked and household income. However, tax credits disproportionately benefit wealthier and more educated women. Price subsidies, while less efficient, have positive redistributional effects.","[Gong, Xiaodong] Univ Canberra, IGPA, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Breunig, Robert] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia",University of Canberra; Australian National University,"Gong, XD (通讯作者)，Univ Canberra, IGPA, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",xiaodong.gong@canberra.edu.au; robert.breunig@anu.edu.au,,"Breunig, Robert/0000-0002-2220-3410; GONG, XIAODONG/0000-0002-5018-2637",Australian Government Department of Human Services (DHS),Australian Government Department of Human Services (DHS)(Australian Government),"This paper has benefited from comments and suggestions provided by two anonymous referees and the editor at Fiscal Studies and from comments by Patricia Apps, Richard Blundell, Anthony King and participants at the Econometric Society Australasia Meetings 2011 and the HILDA Conference 2011.

This paper empirically investigates the difference and relationship between the liquidities of CDS and corporate bond markets. The liquidity basis which is defined as the difference of liquidity between CDS and corporate bond are negative most of the time across different rating categories, implying more illiquid corporate bond market and the fact that CDS market moves quickly in reflecting credit quality changes. There exists significant Granger-causality from CDS liquidity to bond liquidity, and some bidirectional Granger-causality for some investment grade reference entities. The empirical tests are performed in the VAR system including the monetary policy variables and financial market variables. The relative bid-ask spread adopted by many researchers turns out to be less reliable as a measure of liquidity for CDS and corporate bond where the credit spread and liquidity risk are positively correlated.","[Kim, Kwanho] Chungbuk Natl Univ, Dept Econ, 1 Chungdae Ro, Cheongju 361763, South Korea",Chungbuk National University,"Kim, K (通讯作者)，Chungbuk Natl Univ, Dept Econ, 1 Chungdae Ro, Cheongju 361763, South Korea.",kimk@chungbuk.ac.kr,,,National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2010332-B00151],National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government),"This paper has greatly benefitted from valuable comments and suggestions received from two anonymous referees and the editor of this journal, Humid Beladi.

The Barnett formula used to calculate these grants is often criticised because it does not consider the DGs' spending needs. However, the feasibility of allocating block grants by needs assessment is often questioned, given the contestability of spending needs. This paper compares the formula used within England to assess the education spending needs of local authorities there with the equivalent Scottish formula, by using each formula in turn to calculate the relative spending needs of the UK territories. The rationale is to consider how similar the two formulae are in how they estimate the territories' relative spending needs for education, a major responsibility of the DGs. The results show that the English and Scottish education allocation formulae produce similar estimates of the territories' relative education spending needs. This suggests that it may be more feasible to allocate education resources to the UK's devolved territories based on needs assessment than some have suggested. The results also suggest some inequity in current patterns of education spending across the UK.","[King, David] Univ Stirling, Stirling, Scotland; [Eiser, David] Univ Strathclyde, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",University of Stirling; University of Strathclyde,"King, D (通讯作者)，Univ Stirling, Stirling, Scotland.",d.n.king@stir.ac.uk; david.eiser@strath.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [RES-062-23-2814],Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This research has been funded through Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) research grant RES-062-23-2814, 'Development of needs-based funding models for the devolved territories in the UK'.

What makes their involvement distinct from other investors is that hedge funds can trade across the securities of a firm, holding either long or short positions in each security. We analyze the choice of a restructuring proposal by a firm's manager in the presence of a hedge fund as a potential investor in the firm. We show that, under certain market conditions, there is an equilibrium where the firm's manager makes a proposal for which a hedge fund finds it profitable to short-sell the equity of the firm, buy the debt of the firm, and via its debtholdings lead the firm to a value-reducing outcome to gain on its short equity position. The necessary and sufficient market conditions under which the aforementioned equilibrium occurs are that the debt and equity markets are segregated and that other traders in the equity market are net buyers on average.","[Zachariadis, Konstantinos E.] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Olaru, Ioan F.] Graham Capital Management, Norwalk, CT USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Zachariadis, KE (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",,,,Paul Woolley Centre at the LSE,Paul Woolley Centre at the LSE,"This paper was circulated before under the title Trading and Voting in Distressed Firms.

Putting it more emphatically, we investigate the relationship between what a firm does and what a firm knows. Using a newly developed dataset matching information on patents and products at the firm level, we provide evidence concerning firms' technological and product scope, their relationships, the size-scaling and coherence properties of diversification itself. Our analysis shows that typically firms are much more diversified in terms of products than in terms of technologies, with their main products more related to the exploitation of their innovative knowledge. The scaling properties show that the number of products and technologies increases log-linearly with firm size. And the directions of diversification themselves display coherence between neighboring activities also at relatively high degrees of diversification. These findings are well in tune with a capability-based theory of the firm.","[Dosi, Giovanni; Moschella, Daniele] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Econ, Piazza Martiri della Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy; [Grazzi, Marco] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; University of Bologna,"Moschella, D (通讯作者)，Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Econ, Piazza Martiri della Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy.",gdosi@sssup.it; marco.grazzi@unibo.it; d.moschella@sssup.it,"Grazzi, Marco/A-6195-2012","Grazzi, Marco/0000-0002-4196-6122",Fondazione Cassa dei Risparmi di Forli; Italian Ministry of Education and Research [RBSI14JAFW]; European Commission [649186],"Fondazione Cassa dei Risparmi di Forli; Italian Ministry of Education and Research(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre)","We thank the participants at the Conference on Entrepreneurship, Innovation and Enterprise Dynamics organized by the OECD Working Party on Industry Analysis (WPIA), Paris, December 2014; the Finkt final conference in Rimini (2015); CAED conference in Istanbul (2015); XXII Organization Science Winter Conference Park City (2016) and participants to faculty seminars in Notre Dame University; and SPRU, University of Sussex.

For this purpose, the design rules out loss aversion and cognitive dissonance, identified by the literature as being the main psychological drivers of the bias. The sunk-cost fallacy is identified by comparing a low and a high sunk cost treatment, respectively, against a control group that does not incur a sunk cost. There is evidence of a weak manifestation of the sunk-cost fallacy, which is statistically significant only for the high sunk-cost treatment. However, strong evidence of the fallacy was found among the high-cognitive-ability subjects. Finally, although cognitive ability is predictive of status-quo bias, it was not found to reduce the sunk cost bias. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Most of the previous attempts to measure educational attainment have treated education as a categorical variable, whose mean is computed as a weighted average of the official duration of each cycle and attainment rates, thus omitting differences in educational achievement within levels of education. This aggregation into different groups may result in a loss of information, introducing, therefore, a potential source of measurement error. We explore here a more nuanced alternative to estimate educational attainment, which considers the continuous nature of education. This continuous approach allows us to impose more plausible assumptions about the distribution of years of schooling within each level of education, and to take into account the right censoring of the data in the estimation, thus leading to more accurate estimates of educational attainment and education inequality. These improved estimates may help to better understand the role of education on different aspects of development. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Considering the import of networked critical infrastructure, it is clear that understanding the characteristics of networks that make them vulnerable to disruption is a valuable endeavor. As recent research demonstrates, network vulnerability is a very relevant issue on the design and operation of any networked process in general, and transportation in particular, where the main interest is on identifying network elements that are singularly sensible to disruptions to their integrity. While there have been some suggestions from the literature that the configuration of the network may influence the vulnerability of individual elements, a systematic investigation of network topology and vulnerability has not been conducted. Furthermore, neither has there been an account of the relevance of coherence in the contents of the network, or in other words, the autocorrelation of flows. Accordingly, the objective of this paper is to investigate, from the perspective of the integrity of nodes, the vulnerability to disruption of individual network elements, while controlling for network topology and autocorrelation. Analysis is based on extensive numerical simulations for different network configurations and spatial autocorrelation levels, and the results obtained demonstrate that the proper evaluation of network vulnerability requires not only an understanding of its topology, but also of the distribution of flows.

ETFs revolutionized the asset management industry by taking market share from traditional investment vehicles such as mutual funds and index futures. Because ETFs rely on arbitrage activity to synchronize their prices with the prices of the underlying portfolio, trading activity at the ETF level translates to trading of the underlying securities. Researchers have found that although ETFs enhance price discovery, they also inject nonfundamental volatility into market prices and affect the correlation structure of returns.

Literature on learning organizations was reviewed to ascertain the sample organization's progress toward becoming a learning organization. The current research also tries to explore the relationship (if any) between learning organization dimensions and organizational performance. Design/methodology/approach - The study employed a survey method for collecting data from 204 respondents from the sample organization. The data were statistically analyzed and interpretations were made. Findings - The study reveals that the sample organization scores high on the various learning organization dimensions (seven dimensions of DLOQ), which in turn impact knowledge performance and financial performance. Learning organization practices and processes are prevalent in the sample organization and it is progressing well toward its vision of becoming a learning organization (mentioned in its HR vision).

Such surroundings not only create opportunities for development and market success but also generate significant risk. This risk applies to nearly all areas of management. Human resources management practice is also facing the issue of internal and external turbulences affecting the quality of HR processes. Human resources risk is an inherent part of company operations, whereas the social sub-system is an indispensable key factor for the smooth running of business entities. Therefore, HR risk should be managed, as any other risk type. The purpose of this study is to present the major areas of risk in human resources management based on the analysis and criticism of relevant literature. The aim of the empirical research was the identification of managers' opinions with regards to the meaning of human resources risk for company operations. To attain it, I employed the analysis of results of both international and national studies, including own studies based on a diagnostic survey (a questionnaire). Research has shown that HR risk is perceived both as a chance and a threat to the organization. Every stage of HRM may serve as a potential source of risk that may require taking personnel-related decisions. The results of the research indicate that despite managerial staff's awareness of HR risk, it is not considered meaningful to the operations of organizations. Polish managers, in particular, seem to underestimate the importance of HR risk for company operations. As far as Polish reality is concerned, contrary to market risks (competition) and legal risks which rank relatively high, personnel-related hazards seem to be undervalued, for they do not make their way into the list of top 10 risks threatening Polish organizations.","[Bombiak, Edyta] SledIce Univ Nat Sci & Humanities, 2 Konarskiego, PL-08110 Siedlce, Poland",,"Bombiak, E (通讯作者)，SledIce Univ Nat Sci & Humanities, 2 Konarskiego, PL-08110 Siedlce, Poland.",edyta.bombiak@uph.edu.pl,"Bombiak, Edyta/X-4019-2019","Bombiak, Edyta/0000-0002-0273-6228",,,,,32,6,6,0,7,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-269-9,STRATEGICA,,,2017,,,,,,,121,132,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0ZU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431586800009,0

Among them we can mention: information management, quantification of data or models manipulation. To this traditional approach, one more element could be added-indication of the conditions in which a better decision can be made. In this context, the cognitive neuroscience techniques can be very helpful. At the basis of this approach is the assumption that knowing the neurological grounds for decision making and decoding the decision-making process in the brain, we will be able to understand and take advantage of factors contributing to making the right decisions. In the presented research, we try to predict decisions on the basis of observations of brain signals activity during the time of the decision-making process. The data are registered with the use of electroencephalogram (EEG) due to its small size and low cost. The decisions made by participants are connected with the choice between two lotteries with different payoffs.

Scholars, policymakers, and opinion leaders are increasingly asking the hard question: what constitutes moral leadership? This article aims to provide a potential answer by using the case study research method to deconstruct the leadership model of Sir Ernest Shackleton, the commander of the Endurance expedition (1914-1916). On October 27, 1915, Shackleton ordered his crew of 27 men to abandon Endurance. Due to unfavorable weather conditions, the ship they had boarded in South Georgia for a most ambitious endeavor crossing Antarctica on foot - was crushed under ten million tons of ice, leaving them stranded at the South Pole. Through the end of August 1916, for over two years since sailing from England, Shackleton led his men through a series of critical decisions, eventually bringing all of them to safety. This article evaluates two of these decisions in depth, drawing several lessons about Shackleton's moral leadership and reflecting on his legitimacy/authority and the role of moral luck. It also examines the portability of his model beyond the extreme, specific context of the Endurance polar expedition. The conclusion is unequivocal: Sir Ernest Shackleton was a moral leader, a pragmatic utilitarian ready to make quick, critical choices, but nonetheless showing deep deontological concerns, and also a communitarian who placed the group's collective needs above personal goals while protecting his people's most essential human right - the right to life. The role of luck in the morality of his actions remains limited, while Shackleton's unique leadership model was perfectly suited for the particular context Endurance faced. Through this systematic assessment, Shackleton becomes a role model for current and future aspiring moral leaders.","[Burduja, Sebastian I.] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Econ & Int Affairs Dept, 6 Madrid St, Bucharest 011785, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Burduja, SI (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Econ & Int Affairs Dept, 6 Madrid St, Bucharest 011785, Romania.",tianu@post.harvard.edu,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,3,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-269-9,STRATEGICA,,,2017,,,,,,,159,171,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0ZU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431586800012,0

Mineral resources are a source of economic prosperity and progress for many countries of the world. As an example of this postulate is the modern history of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan is rich in mineral resources, including chrome, coal, copper, gold, iron ore, wolfram, and zinc. The economy is still closely linked with the other economies of the former Soviet Union and especially with the Russian Federation. However, since independence in 1991, foreign trade has been redirected toward markets outside the former Soviet Union. Nowadays, Kazakhstan takes one of the leading positions for the variety of mineral resources. Firstly, Kazakhstan has an abundant supply of accessible mineral and fossil fuel resources. Development of petroleum, natural gas, and mineral extraction has attracted most of the over $40 billion in foreign investment in Kazakhstan since 1993 and accounts for some 57% of the nation's industrial output (or approximately 13% of gross domestic product). Secondly, according to some estimates, Kazakhstan has the second largest uranium, chromium, lead, and zinc reserves, the third largest manganese reserves, the fifth largest copper reserves, and ranks in the top ten for coal, iron, and gold. This study seeks to provide a survey of the state of knowledge regarding mineral trade. I would like to focus only on Kazakhstan's foreign trade in mineral resources. The increase in price volatility and worries about the impact of rapidly growing but unstable mineral exports on the economic growth of developing countries have created a sustained interest in mineral trade flows and policies.","[Darken, Kelbet] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Science & Technology,"Darken, K (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",Kelbet.darken@yandex.ru,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,5,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",2475-8868,,978-1-60595-502-5,DESTECH TRANS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,182,186,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6SQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426941400029,0

The aim of this article is to analyze the effect of segregation of maize and soybeans in the Brazilian transport and storage logistics, especially genetically modified grains. In the context of the guidelines of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (CPB) as well as of the competitiveness in the international market, we develop a spatial equilibrium model in the form of a mixed complementarity problem. The competitiveness of Brazilian maize and soybeans on the international market is compromised by the inefficient logistics and slow responses to the demands of the CPB. The contribution of the paper is to evaluate how regulatory issues of a segment, in this case biotechnology, may interfere with logistic infrastructure projects.","[de Oliveira, Andrea L.

Firms are reluctant to create new products and services if they are going to be copied quickly. This principle applies across industries ranging from mobile devices to pharmaceuticals. As a counterpoint, and by synthesizing ideas and evidence from across a wide spectrum, this paper argues that a shift in outlook regarding intellectual property may be required to keep up with developments in technology and how markets operate. First, as described by Eric von Hippel, information spillovers are increasingly frequent: few trade secrets remain so for very long. Second, the availability of tools such as 3D printers and the Raspberry Pi means that the process of replicating or improving a product has become simpler. Finally, the ubiquity and unruly nature of the internet means that both information spillovers and the availability of advanced tools and knowledge are becoming increasingly prevalent. Under these circumstances, the paper argues that is increasingly difficult to maintain a traditional stance on intellectual property; rather, it is apropos to examine more open models of innovation, such as that of Lyon silk weavers in the 18th century. For example, a leading Lyonnaise silk weaver, Phillipe Lasalle, conducted his trade as if there were no genius without copying (Foray, 2006, p. 175). This paper also argues that in more a diffuse innovation paradigm, traditional modes of IP enforcement may act as an inhibitor by preventing this copying from taking place. Finally, the paper states that value extraction could alternatively be tied to voluntary payments and reliance on product ecosystems instead of IP enforcement.","[DeFeo, Christian; Harding, Jennifer; Wood, Robert] Loughborough Univ Technol, Loughborough, Leics, England",Loughborough University,"DeFeo, C (通讯作者)，Loughborough Univ Technol, Loughborough, Leics, England.",c.j.defeo@lboro.ac.uk; j.a.harding@lboro.ac.uk; r.l.wood@lboro.ac.uk,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,4,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-911218-31-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2017,,,,,,,80,87,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI0KF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404891000011,0

J.P.Morgan proposed the RiskMetrics methodology to calculate the market risk and introduced the concept of value at risk (VaR) in 1996. VaR becomes the essential tool in measuring market risk in the financial institutions. Previous research focused on VaR modelling of matured markets, however less attention had been paied at emerging markets, especially the Asian markets. As known the distributions of financial assets return such as stock equityare more likely skewed and thick. In this paper, three special distributions such as generalised hyperbolic distribution (GH), skew Student t distribution (ST), and normal inversed Gaussian distribution (NIG) are applied to measure market risk of the market with less attentions. We also poredict sample 1day-Var and Expected shortfall for 4 markets as Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE), Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE), The Korea Stock Composite Index (KOSPI) and Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange (HOSE). The final results show that the NIG outperforms three other models in most of cases. Malaysia is the best evidence that show the market could control the risk rather well than the others. Viet Nam is an interested case as showing the similar to others despite its market is more immature and inexperienced than most of ASIAN financial markets. All evidences (excepting Malaysia) look to be slightly conservative in risk management and they could certainly loss the advantage in investing. However, that situation relatively show ASIAN markets are more carefull in risk management prior to extreme events, especially after two financial crisis.","[Duc Tran Cong] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Business Adm, Tan Phong Ward, 19 Nguyen Huu Tho St,Dist 7, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Duc Tran Cong; Wang, Jo Yu] Feng Chia Univ, Fac Business Adm, Taichung, Taiwan",Ton Duc Thang University; Feng Chia University,"Cong, DT (通讯作者)，Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Business Adm, Tan Phong Ward, 19 Nguyen Huu Tho St,Dist 7, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.;Cong, DT (通讯作者)，Feng Chia Univ, Fac Business Adm, Taichung, Taiwan.",trancongduc@tdt.edu.vn; jywang@fcu.edu.tw,"Tran, Cong Duc/ABE-3243-2020","Tran, Cong Duc/0000-0003-0765-5571",,,,,13,0,0,3,3,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-11-7,,,,2017,,,,,,,240,250,,,,,,11,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO0GY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000490868000019,0

The author develops a model of optimal taxation for a federal system of governments in the tradition of Mirrlees (1971), where taxes can be fully nonlinear but informational asymmetries prevent the equalization of well being across workers due to informational rents. This article extends the large literature on federalism and tax competition by obtaining optimal tax formulas for the federal and state governments. The literature has mainly focused on inefficiencies that arise due to fiscal externalities when governments have access to restricted instruments (for example, allowing only linear taxes). Contrary to previous results in that literature, the author shows here that state governments will provide redistribution through taxes and that, in a symmetric equilibrium, the overall tax schedule that combines the actions of both the federal and state governments is the same as that of a unitary government. This implies that, under the conditions analyzed in the model, there is no reason to restrict income redistribution objectives to the federal government only, as commonly prescribed in the literature.","[Dvorkin, Maximiliano] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Dvorkin, M (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA.",,"Dvorkin, Maximiliano/I-5743-2016","Dvorkin, Maximiliano/0000-0003-2743-2383",,,,,20,2,4,0,2,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

Design/methodology/approach - The sample is comprised of 511 firm-year observations representing firms from 22 emerging markets. The authors regress sample firms' corporate governance ratings, reported by Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia (CLSA), on national societal value scores (Hofstede, 1980 variables for primary analysis and Schwartz, 1994 variables for sensitivity tests) and firm-level and country- level control variables. Findings - The authors find that national societal values are associated with corporate governance in emerging markets. Corporate governance is strong in firms from individualistic societies, and weak in firms from uncertainty avoiding and masculine cultures. Research limitations/implications - The authors extend the stream of literature that has established the link between formal institutions and corporate governance. The authors also extend the literature that examines how societal values influence corporate practices in emerging markets. Practical implications - The results suggest that informal institutions, in addition to formal ones, shape corporate governance in emerging markets. Corporate stakeholders need to be aware of the different societal values of each market and develop specific strategic plans that best suit both formal and informal institutions. Originality/value - The findings suggest that national societal values need to be considered in cross-country research on corporate governance.

Based on the DEA (data envelopment analysis) and Malmquist index, this paper studies the investment efficiency of urban infrastructure in 17 prefecture-level cities in Shandong Province from 2006 to 2015. The results show that the investment efficiency of urban infrastructure investment in Shandong Province has been developing well in the past 10 years. The driving force of growth mainly comes from technological progress, while comprehensive technical efficiency and scale efficiency growth are small. Therefore, in order to improve the efficiency of urban infrastructure investment, the government should make scientific decisions and continue to improve the level of technological innovation of the infrastructure, enhance the management level and maintenance level of the infrastructure, allocate resources reasonably and realize the scale effect of infrastructure investment.","[Gao, Yonghong] Shandong Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Foreign Studies, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yongchun; Wang, Suxia] Shandong Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China",Shandong University of Finance & Economics; Shandong University of Finance & Economics,"Gao, YH (通讯作者)，Shandong Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Foreign Studies, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China.",,,,national social science foundation project [16BGL045],national social science foundation project,This paper is a periodic result of the national social science foundation project (16BGL045),,9,0,0,0,2,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-437-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,32.0,,,,,,92,98,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6HK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426689600021,0

In order to compete in export markets, these mainly small and medium-sized enterprises require dynamic capabilities which are not possessed by all of them. Existing research has not fully researched dynamic capabilities which determine the success in the exportation of fresh fruit and vegetables. Based on seven indepth interviews, our contribution in this work is to determine what specific dynamic capabilities of the fruit and vegetable distributing companies contribute to an improvement in the export performance. The results of the conducted explorative and qualitative study show that four dynamic capabilities, the relationship management, the consumer orientation, the transparency and the communication along the value chain and brand management can help to solve most of the internal barriers and strategies and as a consequence influence positively in the export results.","[Garcia, Haydee Calderon; Kolbe, Diana] Univ Valencia, Valencia, Spain",University of Valencia,"Kolbe, D (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Fachbereich Mkt, Fak Wirtschaftswissensch, Ave Tarongers, Valencia 46022, Spain.",diakol@alumni.uv.es,"Kolbe, Diana/AAL-1390-2020","Kolbe, Diana/0000-0002-2905-7372",,,,,47,0,0,1,16,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

Each state is obliged to ensure food security to all its citizens. Poland's accession into the European Union gave rise to an increase in the food security of the country. Poland is a major manufacturer of agricultural commodities in the European Union. The country has great potential in terms of the area of agricultural land. However, there is a number of obstacles to the growth of production and yield. One of them involves an unfavourable agricultural structure and the dominance of small individual farms. Granted, there have been many favourable changes in Polish villages since the country's accession to the EU, but some options have not been employed yet. The main purpose of this paper is to present food security in Poland. It was found that Poland has generated surplus as regards food production. However, it was highly diversified, depending on the types of products. As a result of increase in food production and household income, in Poland, the percentage of food expenses in general expenditure is on a decline. Food self-sufficiency has been analysed in terms of agricultural production, followed by the presentation of the balance of foreign trade in agri-food products. Attention has also been devoted to the factors behind food security, including, inter alia, the economic availability of foods in the context of people's income and the percentage of food expenses.","[Golebiewska, Barbara; Stefanczyk, Joanna] Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Golebiewska, B (通讯作者)，Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Warsaw, Poland.",barbara_golebiewska@sggw.pl; j.k.stefanczyk@gmail.com,"Stefańczyk, Joanna/HLW-7375-2023; Stefańczyk, Joanna/GON-8364-2022; Gołębiewska, Barbara BG/F-3535-2019","Stefańczyk, Joanna/0000-0001-5258-4894; Golebiewska, Barbara/0000-0003-4073-5274",,,,,34,5,5,1,7,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2787-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2017,,,,,,,71,78,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BJ1CL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417392400009,0

This paper investigates the short-term health shock experienced by infants during the crisis and its long-term impact on human capital accumulation. Because no longitudinal data are available, the estimation of causal effects is performed using multiple cross-section surveys that are representative of the same population over time. The short-term and the long-term effects are estimated exploiting the heterogeneous impact of the crisis across and within birth cohorts. Results indicate that the Peruvian crisis significantly affected the health of infants, particularly that of children born to low-educated mothers. From 1988 to 1990 vaccination declined 12 percentage points and infant mortality increased 2.3 percentage points among children born to low-educated mothers. In the long run, the children who suffered the most severe health shocks during the economic downturn of the 1980s performed worse in school. They had 0.12 fewer years of formal education and their probability of completing primary education by age 15 was three percentage points lower in relation to similar children born after the crisis. The results have strong policy implications. Children in developing countries should be safeguarded against health shocks during economic crises to avoid a decline in the accumulation of human capital in the long-run. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

An additional objective is to define the position of rural women in the frame of the Slovak agribusiness environment. The data are obtained from our own research carried out through a questionnaire survey. This survey was implemented at 34 companies in which rural women are carrying out their own businesses. Results were analysed using statistical methods (Friedman test). Outcomes of the research state that rural women feel insufficient support both from the state and from the European Union. The majority of women-owned businesses belong to the category of micro-companies or small companies (according to number of employees). The legal form of business is first of all about individual farming.

The working hypothesis is that the current definition of State aid does not reflect only economic or legal considerations, and therefore, that it may not be fully explained by taking exclusively those factors into account. Instead, we may imply that it is influenced by objectives and priorities set by the EU Commission in relation to the State aid rules, together with the problems that the Commission had faced in enforcing those rules. In order to analyze the notion of State aid we turn our attention to policy issues in addition to economic and purely legal ones. The tests devised to define the different criteria of State aid are constantly departing from the original conception of aid as any subsidy that distorts the natural functioning of the market. In the same vein, the tests developed later depart more and more from an economic explanation and from the effects doctrine. Due to the large discretion granted to the Commission when specifying the rules for interpretation and application of EU State aid law we are faced with different approach of the Commission to State aid rules in individual sectors of the EU Internal Market. The latter reflects mainly the economic specific of these sectors. As one of the most apparent examples we may quote the priorities set by the Commission for granting of State aids in the agrarian sector. The recent development of the State aid concept in agriculture is reflected by the new Agricultural Block Exemption Regulation (ABER) and Community Guidelines for State aid in the agriculture and forestry sector applied from 1 July 2014","[Janku, Martin] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Law, Brno, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Janku, M (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Law, Brno, Czech Republic.",jankum@mendelu.cz,"Janku, Martin/JVO-0765-2024; Janku, Martin/M-3076-2018","Janku, Martin/0000-0002-0063-4690;",,,,,7,1,1,0,2,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2787-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2017,,,,,,,138,144,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BJ1CL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417392400018,0

It gives full play to the finance in promoting rural economic development with strengthening the guidance and support. However, some financial institutions are not strong enough to support agriculture, and the structure of financial support to agriculture needs to be optimized. The financial risk diversification and transfer function needs to be improved, and the financial environment and the construction of financial system need to be strengthened. In view of the above problems, it is suggested to construct a multi-level rural financial institution system with coordination and distribution of responsibilities, functional complement and efficient operation. It should closely integrate with the actual development of rural economy in Nantong; identify key areas and key links of financial support to agriculture. It also should make the innovation of rural financial products and improve the financial services. And it can strengthen the construction of agricultural insurance service system to speed up the formation of policy-based and commercial insurance institutions. It can build the agricultural insurance system with the significant security function. In order to better play the role of financial support on agriculture, it should strengthen the guidance and create a good environment for the rural financial system and credit.","[Jin, Feng] Yangzhou Univ, Business Coll, Yangzhou 225000, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Yangzhou University,"Jin, F (通讯作者)，Yangzhou Univ, Business Coll, Yangzhou 225000, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,2,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-437-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,32.0,,,,,,22,25,,,,,,4,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6HK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426689600006,0

To identify the moderating variables that strengthen the superstition for numbers, we take into account factors including the amount of information, change of tick size, Chinese festivals, and bear market effect. Furthermore, we examine whether the frequency of lucky (unlucky) numbers as the final digit of prices decreases (increases) for firms with higher trading by institutional investors. The results indicate that investors in the Taiwan Stock Exchange tend to avoid number 4. Our results also find that the effects of numerical superstitions on the frequency of the final digit decrease when the amount of information increases. Investors appear to be more likely to avoid unlucky number 4 in the following four conditions: when the tick size becomes smaller, when it is one week before Chinese New Year, when it is the seventh month in the lunar calendar, and when it is in a bear market. We further document that institutional investors are not affected by numerical superstition. Moreover, our results support the notion that informed traders buy and sell more (less) actively the stocks with a lower (higher) frequency of prices ending with 4. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Baltic States have achieved significant reduction of GHG emissions during 1990-2015, especially in energy sector which is the major sources of GHG emissions in Baltic States. During the period 1990-2013, Lithuania's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita increased by 56.8 per cent, while GHG emissions per GDP and GHG emissions per capita decreased by 66.7 and 47.8 per cent, respectively. The major reason for the decrease in per capita emissions are the structural changes in the energy sector. At the same period, Latvia's population decreased by 24.4 per cent, GDP per capita increased by 64.0 per cent, while GHG emissions per GDP and GHG emissions per capita decreased by 66.4 and 44.8 per cent, respectively. Latvia's economy grew rapidly in the period 2000-2007, with a GDP increase of 82.0 per cent. Economic growth rates and climatic conditions have been the most important drivers for GHG emissions trends in Latvia. Estonia's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita increased by 85.1 per cent, while GHG emissions per GDP and GHG emissions per capita decreased by 65.1 and 35.3 per cent, respectively. Such significant GHG emission reduction in Estonia was driven by restructuring of the economy and efficiency improvement in the energy industry and energy demand sectors. There is a significant decoupling of emissions from economic growth in all three countries however countries have very different energy supply balances and implemented various climate change mitigation policies.","[Mikalauskiene, Asta; Streimikiene, Dalia] Vilnius Univ, Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius University,"Mikalauskiene, A (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Vilnius, Lithuania.",,"Streimikiene, Dalia/AAD-7762-2020","Mikalauskiene, Asta/0000-0002-4301-2058",,,,,10,1,1,0,5,INTL INST SOCIAL & ECONOMIC SCI,PRAGUE,"TREBESOVSKA 2038/14, PRAGUE, 193 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87927-32-8,,,,2017,,,,,,,245,257,,10.20472/EFC.2017.007.015,0.0,,,13,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6MP,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426854900015,0

A distinctive feature of this methodology is the focus on prophylaxis and prevention of human resources risks.

In particular, we were interested in a better understanding of how farmers viewed the social benefits associated with cooperation. These social benefits have the potential to become valuable sources of social capital. Four valid and reliable measures of social benefits were identified. Social benefits that farmers may use to get by (bonding networks) had two dimensions: emotional support and social support. Social benefits that farmers may use to get ahead (bridging networks) also had two dimensions: tangible and intangible resource sharing. The desire to gain these social benefits from cooperation (except for emotional support) emerged as strong predictors of farmers' willingness to cooperate in a proposed new agricultural cooperative. Surprisingly, the expected economic benefits of cooperation did not have a significant effect on willingness to cooperate. Implications and suggestions for future research and cooperative development and management are also discussed.","[Morrow, J.

Consequently, some organizations try to manage complexity by transferring it into defined, controllable structures and processes, aiming at the ability to deliver the desired strategic outcomes in a predictable and reliable manner. Others trust a high degree of freedom at the shop-floor and team level allowing for quicker decisions and self-determined choice to successfully respond to unexpected events. Both solutions demand new procedures to manage the unexpected, focusing on the need to balance structure and flexibility. This conceptual article asks which structures make sense for organizations in complex or even chaotic environments. I will focus on the team and organizational level and foremost at the interaction between these two. By combining theoretical concepts of behavioral and organizational research, especially decision-making based on systems theory, situational awareness and sense-making, I aim to approach a more comprehensive discourse on ways of coping with the unexpected. Beyond common rational plan and command orientation, the article stresses the importance of a unique equilibrium of structure and autonomy for each given situation, organization and team. Furthermore, I will argue that one can make use of autonomy and enable autonomous decisions on the shop-floor level just because one can rely on unquestioned structures: pre-determined communication paths, hierarchies, structures of orders, knowledge of one's people and esprit de corps.","[Nachbagauer, Andreas G.

In the fifth chapter we lead discussion about the results of our research, based on which we can formulate conclusions, that the increasing rate of fiscal decentralization is followed by higher income inequality of population in the country, when we use Gini coefficient. On the other hand, using Palma index results shows us, that increasing fiscal decentralization in the countries leads to lower income inequality.

A cattle vaccine that significantly reduces the risk of E. coli contamination was developed and commercialized in Canada and internationally, however, adoption by cattle producers remained extremely low. Utilizing data from a survey of cow-calf producers in western Canada, this paper examines the factors affecting cattle producers' willingness to adopt the E. coli vaccine. Education, prior awareness of the vaccine, perception of who holds primary responsibility for E. coli risk reduction, and a producer's external ( versus internal) locus of control with respect to their ability to mitigate E. coli risks within the production environment are significant determinants of willingness to adopt. Adoption incentives are also evaluated, including policy interventions, market/supply chain incentives, production protocol, and producer reputation incentives. The analysis provides lessons for the development and commercialization of vaccines and other food safety intervention strategies that yield societal and supply chain benefits beyond the individual adopter.","[Ochieng, Brian J.; Hobbs, Jill E.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 51 Campus Dr, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A8, Canada",University of Saskatchewan,"Hobbs, JE (通讯作者)，Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 51 Campus Dr, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A8, Canada.",jill.hobbs@usask.ca,,"Hobbs, Jill/0000-0003-0357-6817",Farm Credit Canada (FCC) MSc.

According to the researchers conducted by the experts in the field, it can be argued thorough that agriculture is strongly affected by climate change. The consequences of this situation consist of reduced production, changed organoleptic qualities of agricultural products, decreased time of harvest etc. For all this, but also, to prevent accentuation of some undesirable repercussions, we must operationalize the appropriate measures for a reasonable adjustment to climate change disruptors of the existing natural environment. Analysing the results of other studies, we observe that these are very different. They vary especially because they are based on different methods of investigation and data processing, namely, mathematical models and scenarios made under specific conditions, requirements and statistical analysis, etc. Thus, the research methodologies started either from various economic analyzes based on the evaluation of the cost-benefit analysis or investigation of data and meteorological information.

In view of the fact that the EU and US differ considerably in their economic potentials, the signing of the agreement liberalising bilateral trade may cause a radical change in the conditions of competition both on regional markets and on the global market. Agricultural issues are one of the most difficult areas of the TTIP negotiations. The main aim of this paper is to identify the current role of the US in the foreign agri-food trade in Poland and to consider the strength of trade creation and diversion effects after signing the TTIP Agreement. The research was based on data of the European Statistical Office (Eurostat). A computable general equilibrium model of the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) was used to simulate the impact of the TTIP agreement on agri-food trade between Poland and its major trade partners, including the US. The importance of the US as Poland's trade partner was insignificant. In 2016 the share of the US in the structure of the total export of agri-food products from Poland amounted to 1.7%, whereas the share in the structure of import was as low as 1%. The significance of the US in agri-food trade with third countries was slightly greater. The establishment of the free trade zone between the EU and US may result in the effect of creation of the Polish-American agri-food trade but the impact of the TTIP agreement on Poland's trade with other main partners may be limited. Due to the small share of the US in the total agri-food turnover, no significant change in the dynamics of total export and import of agri-food products from/to Poland should be expected after signing the TTIP Agreement.","[Pawlak, Karolina] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Dept Econ & Econ Policy Agribusiness, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Life Sciences,"Pawlak, K (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Dept Econ & Econ Policy Agribusiness, Poznan, Poland.",pawlak@up.poznan.pl,"Pawlak, Karolina/ABE-9279-2020","Pawlak, Karolina/0000-0002-5441-6381",National Science Centre within the OPUS research project [2015/17/B/HS4/00262],National Science Centre within the OPUS research project,"The paper is funded by National Science Centre within the OPUS research project No. 2015/17/B/HS4/00262, titled Polish agri-food sector under the implementation of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership agreement (TTIP).",,18,0,0,0,2,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2787-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2017,,,,,,,272,279,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BJ1CL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417392400036,0

This paper analyses the impact on the domestic market of an Aflatoxin M1 outbreak in the Serbian dairy sector during 2013/2014 using a spatial price transmission approach. Monthly farm milk prices in Serbia for the period 2007/2014 were contrasted with leading dairy exporting countries New Zealand, USA and Germany, which did not have a food scare in their dairy sectors. To estimate the impacts a Markov-switching vector error-correction model was utilized. For all four dairy markets the model identified two price change regimes: standard and extreme. Although it was predictable, an extreme regime was not identified during the Aflatoxin M1 crises in Serbia because of some specific characteristics of its dairy production. The results suggest that the Aflatoxin M1 outbreak 'froze' the Serbian dairy market and temporally disconnected it from the world milk market. Farmer's prices fell below their long-run equilibrium levels. The total loss of the Serbian farm-level dairy sector during the crisis reached up to 96.2 million EUR. These 'missed opportunity' significantly slowed investment in the dairy sector.","[Popovic, Rade] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ Subot, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Segedinski Put 9-11, Subotica 24000, Serbia; [Radovanov, Boris] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ Subot, Dept Business Informat & Quantitat Methods, Segedinski Put 9-11, Subotica 24000, Serbia; [Dunn, James W.] Penn State Univ, Coll Agr Sci, Dept Agr Econ Sociol & Educ, 203 Armsby, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",University of Novi Sad; University of Novi Sad; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Popovic, R (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ Subot, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Segedinski Put 9-11, Subotica 24000, Serbia.",popovicr@ef.uns.ac.rs,,"Popovic, Rade/0000-0002-0879-1340","Ministry of Education; Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia [III 46009, III 46006]",Ministry of Education; Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia,"This study was supported by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia, Projects No. III 46009 and III 46006.",,36,16,20,1,18,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

Our results suggest that currently the most important external determinants of innovation propensity for the Russian firms are government support, regional economic situation, institutional climate and quality of human capital.

Therefore this paper addresses the need to understand city and location management, also termed communal marketing, as part of a process whereby its fundamental meaning and transformation are considered. As a result of this changing aspects, the design of city systems will play an essential role in shaping a sustainable, innovative and livable future and must be utilized more professionally in a focused and systematic way. Identity-oriented adaptive urban profiling was recently presented as a useful tool for municipals to enhance sustainable city development. It builds upon profile oriented marketing, while including elements of adaption management. Thus, city managers can increase their cities attractiveness by providing it with a clear profile that is recognized around the world on the one hand, while flexibly adapting to change if necessary. Here, this additional feature of the adaptive urban profiling model will be presented, that shall make the task of maintaining a stable profile while constantly adapting it, easier: the triple-bottom line. As the major domains of change are economic, social and environmental areas, these three domains are now integrated into the profile. Thus, if adaptations are necessary in one of the domains, the profile will still be recognizable via keeping the other two domains stable during this process. Thereby, the adaptive urban profiling model has now incorporated the three pillars of sustainable urban development. The city profile shall increase the uniqueness and visibility of competitive sustainable urban structures and provide solutions to optimize the urban living environment.

In general terms, we can say that mostly manufacturing companies place their manufacturing and production plants in countries where labour costs are lower, i.e. where human labour is cheaper. Piecework wage is, thus, connected with higher employees' productivity because it motivates them to achieve a higher wage. Then, the company faces increased personnel costs, but with higher production and profits from product sales. We can say that labour productivity of employees has an impact on economic growth of the company. However, if we look at this issue more widely, we do not only refer to economic growth of businesses individually, but rather to overall economic growth of the country, which includes results in the business sector, too. Hence, in the seemingly low increase in an individual's productivity we already see a noticeable effect on the development of the whole economy of that particular country in cumulative terms. The expected outcome of this article is the creation of groups of 28 member countries of the European Union, which are similar to each other according to selected indicators - reflecting economic growth and labour productivity in three different time periods.","[Rozkosova, Anna; Megyesiova, Silvia] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Econ Seat Kosice, Tajovskeho 13, Kosice 04130, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Rozkosová, A (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Econ Seat Kosice, Tajovskeho 13, Kosice 04130, Slovakia.",anna.rozkosova@student.euke.sk; silvia.megyesiova@euke.sk,"Megyesiova, Silvia/J-1056-2018","Megyesiova, Silvia/0000-0002-6815-5629",,,,,9,0,0,1,1,VYDAVATELSTVO EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"DOLNOZENSKA CESTA 1-B, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-4429-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,391,399,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP5LI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000556157800046,0

Using data unique to Korea, this study examines the effect of human resource investment in internal control on audit reporting lag (ARL). We employ quantitative and qualitative measures for the IC personnel, and the ARL is measured by the time between the fiscal year-end and the audit report date. We find an insignificant association between the quantitative measure (the number of IC personnel) and ARL. On the other hand, we find that the qualitative measure (the average experience of the IC personnel) reduces the audit time, thereby decreasing the ARL. This result highlights the importance of qualitative aspect in investments in IC personnel, which could be useful for firms that desire to reap the best result from the investment. Further analysis shows that investments in IC personnel at other departments as well as accounting and finance department increase audit efficiency.

However, different categories of professors respond to these challenges differently. It is important to recognise that Russian universities only started to face the need to assess the human capital and effectiveness of professors' labour in recent times. This may be why universities mostly use such methods to set material incentives for professors, underutilising the analytical potential of these instruments. This paper presents the results of an analysis of points received by professors from one Russian university as part of an on-the-job incentives scheme. This scheme provides a framework whereby professors receive points for different types of activities they engage in. The results are as follows. Firstly, female professors are higher performers, receiving greater scores for their activities than their male counterparts. Secondly, there are far fewer non-performing professors with zero points among women. Thirdly, women's work is more diversified - they engage in a greater spectrum of activities than men. Fourthly, the professional activities of female professors are seldom correlated to age, whereas men tend to become higher performers as they get older. There could be a number of reasons for these differences - from objective psychological traits of men and women to existing societal gender stereotypes. On the whole, our research showed that gender could be seen as one determinant of the effectiveness with which professors use their human capital. A university's resourcing policy can factor in gender specifics. This is particularly significant given external and internal transformations taking place in the Russian education system today. We suppose that gender differences should be one element used in forecasting the development of professors' human capital. Moreover, accounting for gender in assessments of human capital will, on the one hand, help bridge the gender gap within the university environment, while at the same time giving impetus to consolidate and improve a university's competitiveness.","[Shubat, Oksana; Bagirova, Anna; Novokshonova, Yuliya] Ural Fed Univ, Ekaterinburg, Russia",Ural Federal University,"Shubat, O (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, Ekaterinburg, Russia.",o.m.shubat@urfu.ru; a.p.bagirova@urfu.ru; j.e.novokshonova@urfu.ru,"Bagirova, Anna/M-7440-2013; Shubat, Oksana/M-7443-2013","Bagirova, Anna/0000-0001-5653-4093; Shubat, Oksana/0000-0002-0929-8144",Act 211 Government of the Russian Federation [02.A03.21.0006]; Graduate School of Economics and Management of Ural Federal University,Act 211 Government of the Russian Federation; Graduate School of Economics and Management of Ural Federal University,"The work was supported by Act 211 Government of the Russian Federation, contract No 02.A03.21.0006.

We find that 16.3 % of the population of 3433 firms going public in Europe from 1995 to 2009 become acquirers within 3 years of the IPO, while 16.8 % are targeted. Firms with more liquid stocks are more likely to acquire and complete a larger number of stock-financed acquisitions. More liquid firms are also more likely to be acquired, and at higher valuations.

Supplementary education of colleges in the trend of normalization, specification and utilitarianism reflects the problems existing in the development of higher education in contemporary China deeply. This paper analyzes the rational basis of existence of supplementary education of colleges from the perspective of functionalism through analysis on the supplementary education phenomenon of contemporary Chinese colleges; carries out reflection and summary of the existing problems; and puts forward that correct guidance, government specification and benign complementary mechanism are the basic paths of developing supplementary education of colleges. As a notable characteristic of contemporary Chinese education, supplementary education is the extension and supplement of formal education, and also the product of China's development in politics, economy and culture. From the history of higher education, remedial course can be traced back to the United States in the 17th century.([1]) There are many studies on the issue abroad; while the discussion about supplementary education in China mainly focuses on primary & secondary school education and preschool education, without much discussion about adult supplementary education. College stage is an important period of choosing the development mode in future with self-development as the premise and destination; and various forms of supplementary education which are freely selected other than formal college education constitute the basic pattern of supplementary education of contemporary colleges based on acquisition of various qualifications, demand of future vocation and realization of life goals. The structure of teachers in supplementary education has been developed to institutional professional team system from original informal employment system, and many college teachers and scientific researchers participate in the team. Current situation of supplementary education of colleges is as follows: any young person who is in need of learning can find suitable training school and related courses in the market. Thus, the development of supplementary education of colleges is in direct proportion to China's economic development and cultural industry updating to a certain extent. Supplementary education of colleges in China undergoes a process from weak initiation, imperfect system and single variety to rapid development, complete system and wide varieties, which has become a non-negligible education phenomenon. However, through complex phenomenon of supplementary education, we deeply realize the impediment to formal higher education, adult success and educational fairness. As an important functionalism of educational sociology school, its main research direction is to discuss macroscopic education from the perspective of sociology, so as to maintain social balance and promote social development. This paper carries out analysis on supplementary education phenomenon of colleges based upon functionalism, and then realizes its reasonable basis and existing problems rationally.","[Wu, Tingting] Xian Univ, Sch Humanities, Xian 710065, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Xi'an University,"Wu, TT (通讯作者)，Xian Univ, Sch Humanities, Xian 710065, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",,"wu, tingting/H-8032-2012; Wu, Tingting/IWM-4143-2023","Wu, Tingting/0000-0003-3437-8899",,,,,10,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-463-7,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,53.0,,,,,,676,680,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL5MW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000452213200137,0

Domestic fantasy films have gradually adopted the high-concept model in recent years. Under market operations, these films become new favorites of the box office. It is urgent to consider how to make excellent domestic fantasy films and guide them to walk towards the international market based on combining the teaching practice and revelations of genre films. The most important thing is to balance the relations between the native country and the world. Apart from setting foot on national culture and local characteristics, a higher emphasis should be paid to humanistic expressions and endow them with more universal values. Genre film is the product unique to the Hollywood film industry. Genre is a conventional and varying concept. [1] With fixed plot models and characterization, genre films simplify the process of appreciating films. Additionally, some familiar film techniques are applied in the film appreciation process to enhance the audience's sense of joys. Generally speaking, fantasy films reflect the nature of life based on exaggerating and transforming the world through allegories or legends. Both sci-fi films and magical & fantastic films fall in the category of fantasy films. The only difference is that the former upholds human technology and the latter believes in legends and mythologies. The difference mainly results from different cultural backgrounds. The fantasy film type is based on a fantastic space more superior than and exceeds the real space. It is the imitation of the fantasy world that differs from the real world. Apart from integrating the morals, etiquette and religious belief of the real world, it also meets the creator's fantasies about the reality. In the process of teaching genre films, the author found out students' interest in genre films are significantly higher than that of other films. Apparently, the fantastic world created by fantasy films has won great favor from young students through natural and casual expressions, intriguing plots, strongly expressive visual impact and extraordinary reality. With constant development of film-making techniques in recent years, magical visual special effect has been one highlight of numerous fantastic films. Since then, the audience has been expecting more from film stories, but also fresh role setting and imitations of the fantastic world. What we have seen as of today are challenges brought by technological revolutions to films. The emergency of fantasy films is particularly obvious-The progress in film-making technology has brought huge changes.","[Xin, Yang] Northwest Univ, Fac Liberal Arts, Xian 710127, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Northwest University Xi'an,"Xin, Y (通讯作者)，Northwest Univ, Fac Liberal Arts, Xian 710127, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",,"wu, yujia/ISB-0310-2023; wang, yingying/JSK-6741-2023",,,,,,10,0,0,1,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-463-7,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,53.0,,,,,,419,422,,,,,,4,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL5MW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000452213200083,0

Secondly, when government funds guide social funds to promote the home care service industry in the market-oriented way, it is necessary for the government to make clear the industrial plan for home care services and improve the government's tax incentives.","[Yu, Wenxiong] Wuhan Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Literature Law & Econ, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Liu, Lilin] Cent Southern China Elect Power Design Inst, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China",Wuhan University of Science & Technology,"Yu, WX (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Literature Law & Econ, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",,"li, yifang/JVM-8060-2024",,,,,,9,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-437-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,32.0,,,,,,445,449,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6HK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426689600092,0

In the era of big data, telematics has been overthrowing the traditional automobile insurance. Recently, both domestic and foreign insurance corporations are promoting UBI (Usage Based Insurance) to utilize the real-time data produced by telematics. However, the equivocal UBI premium rating standard plus the low efficiency of indemnities in China have been the barriers of establishing the new framework. Based on the relevant researches and practical applications, this paper will improve the rating criteria of UBI by implementing AEW-AHP method. Meanwhile, considering the specific situation in China, we created a service mechanism called ETAXI, which will perfect the telematics insurance framework. The main work of this paper is as follows: Initially, we choose urgent acceleration, deceleration, braking, sharp turn and fatigue driving behavior as the indices of UBI rating system. Aiming at tackle the flaw of subjectivity in previous papers, we proposed AEW-AHP (Advanced Entropy Weight and Analytic Hierarchy process) which is an improved entropy weight analytic hierarchy process. Accordingly, the rating standards are more objective. The AEW-AHP algorithm can draw the weights of related indices of driving behavior and set the score of the corresponding index in the UBI mechanism. Furthermore, this paper brought up a new type of claim service mechanism- ETAXI, which drastically improved the low efficiency of the claim process. With the help of the popularity of taxi apps, ETAXI made it possible to complete the claim process with high speed and timely evidence. By perfecting UBI rating mechanism and creating a highly efficient claim service mechanism, this paper constructed a new type of telematics insurance framework system.","[Zhang Yusheng; Lvu Peiyao] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Insurance, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Zhang, YS (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Insurance, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.",rayzys0617@163.com; peiyao@sas.upenn.edu,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,1,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,,,,,2017,,,,,,,477,486,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK8HD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000442810700033,0

The industry's response illustrates how the introduction of a lender of last resort can alter private behavior in ways that increase the likelihood that the lender will be needed.","[Carlson, Mark] Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA; [Wheelock, David C.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO USA; [Wheelock, David C.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Res, St Louis, MO USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Carlson, M (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",Mark.A.Carlson@frb.gov; David.C.Wheelock@stls.frb.org,"Wheelock, David/I-5757-2016","Wheelock, David/0000-0002-2702-8164; Carlson, Mark/0000-0002-9261-9702",,,,,52,12,13,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

We first synthesize the emerging literature that links land use policies and local fiscal incentives to urban sprawl. Next, we compile a panel dataset on various measures of urban sprawl for European countries using high-resolution satellite images. We document substantial variation in urban sprawl across countries. This variation remains roughly stable over the period of our analysis (1990-2012). Urban sprawl is particularly pronounced in emerging Central and Eastern Europe but is comparatively low in Northern European countries. Urban sprawl - especially outside functional urban areas - is strongly negatively associated with real house price growth, suggesting a trade-off between urban containment and housing affordability. Our main novel empirical findings are that decentralization and local political fragmentation are significantly positively associated with urban sprawl. Decentralized countries have a 25-30% higher sprawl index than centralized ones. This finding is consistent with the proposition that in decentralized countries fiscal incentives at local level may provide strong incentives to permit residential development at the outskirts of existing developments.","[Ehrlich, Maximilian V.] Univ Bern, Ctr Reg Econ Dev & CESifo, Bern, Switzerland; [Hilber, Christian A.

We find that state ownership is associated with lower liquidity after the 2008 financial crisis. Institutional ownership shows a weak influence on liquidity in the post-crisis period. During the financial crisis, however, liquidity declines could not be attributed to ownership structure. Our results imply that foreign investors have not yet played a significant role in driving stock market liquidity in Vietnam, which is counter to findings in the existing literature concerning liquidity in more developed markets.

Over 105 countries have adopted CDD projects in the hope that citizen empowerment translates to socio-economic development. But existing evidence is mixed, with some scholars arguing that CDD does not benefit the poor. This paper seeks to contribute to this literature by identifying any differentiated impact to the poor attributable to a CDD project in the Philippines. It draws on the literature on participatory budgeting to argue that participation of the socially excluded groups like the poor in the collective planning and budgeting determines the extent to which empowerment and democratization can be sustained. Using panel data collected in 2003 and 2010, the paper finds indications of elite control based on a decomposition of the profile of participants of village assemblies, which is a critical participatory institution in providing equal access to all members of the community to the deliberations and negotiations. The average participant of such village assemblies tend to be the less-poor household of the community with the participation of the poor dwindling over the years. The difference-in-difference impact estimation also reveals disappointing results for the poor. Although the project improved average household income among the poor, the project failed to enhance the social outcomes for the poor households such as participation in planning process, trust in the government and solidarity. This study adds to the existing literature showing that CDD may fail to effectively target the poor. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We use the model to solve for the optimal combination between fiscal consolidation, bail-ins, and bail-outs to restore debt sustainability. For non-systemic countries, only fiscal consolidation and bail-ins should be used, based on an ex-post assessment of their relative costs. Systemic crises raise significant new challenges. First, to reduce the spillovers associated with bail-ins, IFIs should be able to provide bail-outs. Second, to contain the moral hazard effects of bail-outs, IFIs should operate under a binding crisis-resolution framework that limits the provision of bail-outs to highly systemic countries, coupled with more stringent fiscal consolidation requirements.","[Sandri, Damiano] Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Sandri, D (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",dsandri@imf.org,,"Sandri, Damiano/0000-0002-3771-001X",,,,,38,1,1,2,9,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

So far, only little is known about the effects for politicians who bridge governments and corporations. Building on Burt's (1992) social capital theory, I predict that politicians who bridge governments and corporations have a significantly higher survival rate than those without bridging capital. The empirical results reveal robustly that German Federal ministers from 1949 to January 2015 with previous corporate key positions in non-political non-profit organisations or corporate executive or supervisory boards have a significantly higher survival rate than ministers without this qualification. However, German Federal ministers from 1990 to January 2015 do not significantly benefit from previous corporate key positions in terms of a higher survival rate so that the finding for the full sample is driven by the subsample from 1949 to January 1989.","[Scharfenkamp, Katrin] Univ Tubingen, Dept Human Resource Management & Org, Nauklerstr 72074, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Scharfenkamp, K (通讯作者)，Univ Tubingen, Dept Human Resource Management & Org, Nauklerstr 72074, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany.",katrin.scharfenIcamp@uni-tuebingen.de,,,,,,,78,1,2,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

Although studies have examined socioeconomic correlates of unintended fertility, the role of economic resources remains unclear. Wealth may provide an important context for whether a birth was intended or unintended. Moreover, staggering racial wealth disparities may contribute to racial/ethnic patterns of unintended childbearing. This study examines the linkages between wealth and unintended first births, drawing on data from the NLSY79 (N=1508). Results suggest that net wealth is negatively related to the probability of having an unintended first birth, controlling for a host of sociodemographic characteristics. We also use decomposition analysis to quantify wealth's contribution to racial/ethnic disparities in unintended childbearing. Second only to marital status, differences in net wealth account for 9-17% of racial/ethnic disparities in unintended childbearing. Our results suggest that wealth is a significant and heretofore overlooked correlate of unintended childbearing.","[Su, Jessica Houston] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Sociol, 455 Pk Hall, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; [Addo, Fenaba R.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Consumer Sci, Madison, WI USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Su, JH (通讯作者)，SUNY Buffalo, Dept Sociol, 455 Pk Hall, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",jhsu2@buffalo.edu; faddo@wisc.edu,"Su, Jessica/GLQ-8817-2022","Su, Jessica/0000-0003-3698-7807",NICHD NIH HHS [P2C HD047873] Funding Source: Medline,NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,67,8,10,0,14,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

A geographic information system (GIS) tool is used to conduct the accessibility assessment. The door-to-door approach is adopted to evaluate the multimodal (including roadways and HSR) travel time. Three accessibility indicators are selected, including the weighted average travel time (WATT), daily accessibility (DA), and potential accessibility (PA). The selected accessibility indicators are calculated by using the estimated travel time at the geographical level. The average accessibility scores of the counties in the PAM during peak and off-peak hours are estimated and compared. The results indicate that the building of the HSR corridor within the PAM will improve the accessibility at the megaregional level. However, the coefficient of variation results indicate that the inequality will also increase due to the new HSR corridor. The relationships between megaregional accessibility scores (i.e., WATT) and HSR services (such as headway and speed) are explored. Several policy implications are drawn in terms of enhancing the megaregional accessibility.","[Yu, Miao] Univ North Carolina Charlotte, USDOT Ctr Adv Multimodal Mobil Solut & Educ CAMMS, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, EPIC Bldg,Room 3366,9201 Univ City Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA; [Fan, Wei] Univ North Carolina Charlotte, USDOT Ctr Adv Multimodal Mobil Solut & Educ CAMMS, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, EPIC Bldg,Room 3261,9201 Univ City Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte,"Fan, W (通讯作者)，Univ North Carolina Charlotte, USDOT Ctr Adv Multimodal Mobil Solut & Educ CAMMS, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, EPIC Bldg,Room 3261,9201 Univ City Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.",myu6@uncc.edu; wfan7@uncc.edu,,"Fan, Wei/0000-0001-9815-710X","United States Department of Transportation, University Transportation Center through the Center for Advanced Multimodal Mobility Solutions and Education (CAMMSE) at The University of North Carolina at Charlotte [69A3551747133]","United States Department of Transportation, University Transportation Center through the Center for Advanced Multimodal Mobility Solutions and Education (CAMMSE) at The University of North Carolina at Charlotte","The authors want to express their deepest gratitude to the financial support by the United States Department of Transportation, University Transportation Center through the Center for Advanced Multimodal Mobility Solutions and Education (CAMMSE) at The University of North Carolina at Charlotte (Grant Number: 69A3551747133).",,34,24,31,5,63,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

The purpose of this paper is twofold: the first is the documentation of the preferred locations of foreign affiliates for the largest financial groups headquartered in emerging countries; and, second, is to identify some of the determinants associated with the location-specific advantages of these host countries. Design/methodology/approach The analysis of the internationalization process of these groups is based on a list of top financial groups ranked by total assets. In the empirical section, the factors that explain the choice of these locations by multinational firms are categorized as resources seeking, market seeking, efficiency-seeking variables and cultural variables. Findings There is empirical evidence that institutions prefer to invest in foreign locations that minimize some dimensions of the culture. Other factors like the role of efficiency variables, i.e. trade efficiency, political risk and government effectiveness, in host countries also have a strong impact on the determinants of the internationalization process. Originality/value The paper puts forward a framework for analyzing determinants of foreign direct investment of multinational financial groups from emerging economies.","[Outreville, J.

The results reveal higher patenting rates for Canada's ethnic minorities, particularly for Canadians with Korean, Japanese, and Chinese ancestry, and suggest that immigrants accounted for one-third of Canadian patents in recent years, despite making up less than one-quarter of the adult population. Human capital characteristics, in particular the share with a PhD and the shares educated and employed in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields, account for most of the ethnic minority advantage in patenting. Our results also point to larger patenting contributions by foreign-educated compared with Canadian-educated immigrants, which runs counter to current immigrant selection policies favouring international students.","[Blit, Joel; Skuterud, Mikal; Zhang, Jue] Univ Waterloo, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Blit, J (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",,,,Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) [430-2016-00143],Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),We thank Bill Kerr for sharing his data on patent inventor ethnicity.

The study exploits the mechanism that assigns the guarantees, which is based on a scoring system to assess eligibility. By using regression discontinuity techniques, the paper finds that, at the threshold between eligible and non-eligible firms, the program has a positive impact on bank loans to firms; however, the scheme has no impact on the interest rate charged by the banks, while it affects positively the likelihood that a firm becomes unable to repay its loans.

This shortage may arise in part from a sharp decline in undergraduate engineering and computing enrolment and graduation rates in Canada beginning in 2002. Even with a recent reversal in enrolment trends, the number of graduates in these fields remains well below the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average. In this article, we discuss the trade-offs inherent in numerous policies and programs that have been considered in Canada to increase the supply of new graduates in these fields. We suggest that many existing programs are easy to implement and short term in nature but may also have unintended consequences by altering human capital investment decisions. Moreover, many existing policies create incentives that lead to different responses depending on student gender, thereby making it hard to simultaneously reduce labour shortages and boost gender equality in the ICT workforce. We summarize evidence from the economics of higher education literature on student major choice to point to alternative, more long-term policies and programs in which students can learn about their preferences and ability.","[Ding, Weili; Lehrer, Steven F.] Queens Univ, Sch Policy Studies, Kingston, ON, Canada; [Ding, Weili; Lehrer, Steven F.] Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON, Canada; [Lehrer, Steven F.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Queens University - Canada; Queens University - Canada; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Ding, WL (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Sch Policy Studies, Kingston, ON, Canada.;Ding, WL (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON, Canada.",,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"This article was initially prepared for the Information and Communications Technology Talent Workshop, 21-22 March 2013, University of Ottawa.

Using a novel dataset of individual fund data and a fixed-effect quantile panel data regression, we find that fund flows to global equities outweigh other fund-specific factors, suggesting that, other things being equal, mutual funds' portfolio rebalancing could strongly determine the direction and magnitude of mutual fund flows. Moreover, there are signs that the return-chasing behaviours of fund managers and investors amplify fund flows' volatility in times of financial turbulence, resulting in a much stronger redemption of equity funds during market downturns. These findings underscore the importance of portfolio diversification and hedging strategies for fund managers and investors of mutual funds to avoid international financial contagion. They also draw an implication for introducing relevant macro-prudential tools to the asset management sector in Hong Kong to maintain financial stability. (C) 2018 Elsevier By.

The analysis focusses on the role of the U.S. in understanding changes in global integration over time, as well as changes in regional integration arising from China. Using daily stock returns from 1997 to 2016, the empirical results show an overall trend to improvements in financial integration over time with deviations from the trend occurring during periods of financial crises in Asia in 1997-98, the U.S. in 2007-10 and the recent European debt crisis.

The results show that aggregate CLCs issued by small U.S. banks have an economically and statistically significant explanatory power in describing state-level international trade. The relationship between the volumes of small bank commercial letters of credit and international trade is mostly driven by imports.

We hypothesize that this is more likely to occur in polities marked by relatively large poor and marginalized populations, where regulatory capture is more likely to occur. To test our intuition, we analyze subnational data on greenfield FDI in India, confirming that multinational investment in thirsty manufacturing sectors are negatively associated with improvements in potable water access.

This indicates how entrepreneurship may be a potential source of income for older workers, in a range of contexts. Further, we find that all the possible combinations of higher proportions of individuals with the latter features are necessary conditions.

The very act of metering is imbued with political and social expectations stemming from development organizations. The study utilizes a mixed-method approach, triangulating data from interviews, focus groups, surveys, participatory mapping, and participant observation over a period of two years. Data show that while metering regimes were designed by NGOs to ensure equal access, system sustainability and safety, and deforestation prevention (goals that community members supported), through both the meters' presence as technological constructs and due to the cost of water as gauged by the meters the practice placed undue pressure on certain groups, including large families, students, renters, and households with low incomes or seasonal income shortages. In short, water metering served to delimit true and equal access to safe water. This calls into question the utility of the ubiquitous practice and the continued proliferation of water metering in WatSan development, especially in areas that are water-rich and already have non-capitalocentric and/or locally-generated water management and conservation practices, policies, and trainings (whether formal or informal). This discussion is useful as a window into the unforeseen and hidden aspects of implementing power-laden development technologies, such as metering, and the ways in which individuals may eschew such systems in passive ways that go unchecked by monitoring and evaluation schemas. Additionally, the work critically interrogates the pairing of metering with systems that require water to remove waste from households (e.g., through flush toilets) and the appropriate design of these systems.

Drawing on in-depth qualitative interviews with key regional stakeholders, the article reveals how peripheral post-industrial places are constrained by their histories. This is found to be manifest in different ways, such as low aspirations, generational unemployment and a loss of identity which are in turn compounded by negative perceptions of place and opportunity. These issues culminate in institutional hysteresis at the local level and constrain entrepreneurial ambition. The article argues that the rigidity and reproduction of informal institutions continues to stymie economic resilience and growth. We conclude by reflecting on the implications for entrepreneurship in peripheral post-industrial places as well as with recommendations for policy.","[Gherhes, Cristian; Vorley, Tim] Univ Sheffield, Sch Management, Ctr Reg Econ & Enterprise Dev, Conduit Rd, Sheffield S10 1FL, S Yorkshire, England; [Williams, Nick] Univ Leeds, Ctr Enterprise & Entrepreneurship Studies, Sch Business, 17 Springfield Mt, Leeds LS2 9NG, W Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield; University of Leeds,"Williams, N (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Ctr Enterprise & Entrepreneurship Studies, Sch Business, 17 Springfield Mt, Leeds LS2 9NG, W Yorkshire, England.",n.e.williams@leeds.ac.uk,"Gherhes, Cristian/AAB-4245-2021; Williams, Nicholas/H-3408-2015","Gherhes, Cristian/0000-0003-2085-3580; Williams, Nicholas/0000-0001-6291-9483",,,,,76,31,31,3,55,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We show that countries may not always have an incentive to exchange their private information. However, for a sufficiently high degree of predictability of domestic environmental policy processes, the expected welfare from sharing information is greater than the expected welfare from keeping it private. The minimum degree of policy predictability for which information sharing occurs increases with the level of environmental risk. Intuitively, information exchange can help mitigate the perception of global uncertainty (both political and scientific) that surrounds transnational environmental problems and potentially improve welfare if policymaking processes are sufficiently aligned with evidence-based approaches (predictable).","[Kakeu, Johnson] Morehouse Coll, Dept Econ, 830 Westview Dr SW, Atlanta, GA 30314 USA; [Johnson, Erik Paul] Carthage Coll, Dept Econ, 2001 Alford Pk Dr, Kenosha, WI 53140 USA",Morehouse College,"Kakeu, J (通讯作者)，Morehouse Coll, Dept Econ, 830 Westview Dr SW, Atlanta, GA 30314 USA.",justin.kakeu@morehouse.edu; ejohnson11@carthage.edu,,"KAKEU KENGNE, JUSTIN JOHNSON/0000-0003-3354-1762",,,,,41,2,2,1,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The main macroeconomic indicators of financialization in the USA show structural breaks that can be dated around the period of the Great Recession. The reliance of households on the formal financial system appears to have weakened for the first time since the early 1980s. The financial sector has lacked the dynamism of the previous three decades, becoming more reliant on government. The state has increased its own indebtedness and supported large financial institutions via unconventional monetary policy measures. At the same time, state intervention has tightened the regulatory framework for big banks. The future path of financialization in the USA will depend heavily on government policy with regard to state debt and financial regulation, although the scope for boosting financialization is narrow.","[Lapavitsas, Costas] SOAS Univ London, London, England; [Mendieta-Munoz, Ivan] Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Lapavitsas, C (通讯作者)，SOAS Univ London, Dept Econ, Off 269,Thornhaugh St,Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England.",cl5@soas.ac.uk,"Mendieta-Muñoz, Ivan/AAC-5221-2020","Mendieta-Muñoz, Ivan/0000-0003-0018-5642",,,,,43,7,8,1,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1024-5294,1477-2221,,COMPET CHANG,Compet.

As a commodity crop that prospers in tropical environments, oil palm has become controversial for its role as a driver of deforestation and social conflict, especially in main producer countries in Southeast Asia. As suitable land for oil palm production in Southeast Asia is depleting, companies have begun to look to new production frontiers, such as Latin America. Colombia and Peru have the highest percentage growth in the sector in recent years, and the crop has become a dominant strategy for development in the Peruvian Amazon. Between 2000 and 2015, 40,000 hectares of old growth forest have been cleared for large oil palm plantations in Peru. Company-Community partnerships (CCPs) have been advanced as a potentially more socially and environmentally sustainable strategy, through their alleged capacity to provide greater productivity and more efficient land use on smallholder farms. This paper describes the social, political and deforestation impact of an oil palm CCP at the forest frontier in the Peruvian Amazon. An interdisciplinary and mixed methods research approach was employed, including long-term ethnographic work and visual measurement remote sensing of land use change on 2447 hectares of smallholder land in four villages/communities. The results show that the recent arrival of powerful private companies has caused a major socio-ecological shift on the ground, particularly through the CCP. On comparing participating farms to non-participating farms, we find significant deforestation 'spillage' out of the plantation into participating farms. A major underlying driver of the negative outcomes of the CCP is the neoliberal policy approach employed by the Peruvian government, which has outsourced basic rural public works to private companies. We conclude by discussing how a more socially and environmentally just oil palm production strategy in Peru and elsewhere might look. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, female investors perform similarly to male investors in abnormal default or abnormal loan return when investors have high levels of education or income or when investors work in finance or information technology industries.","[Chen, Jia; Liu, Yu-jane] Peking Univ, Guanghua Sch Management, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Jiajun] Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, 600 Guoquan Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Peking University; Fudan University,"Liu, YJ (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Guanghua Sch Management, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",jia.chen@gsm.pku.edu.cn; jiangjj@fudan.edu.cn; yjliu@gsm.pku.edu.cn,"Jiang, Jiajun/AAP-5186-2020","Jiang, Jiajun/0000-0001-5537-0373","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71673007, 71403010]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71673007 and grant number 71403010].

We construct proxies for positive (negative) informed trades and find that they are associated with a value premium (discount). We demonstrate that information asymmetries in the banking industry accentuate the price discovery role of option trades, especially negatively informed trades. The results are consistent with the arguments in Miller (1977), which contends that overvaluation is pronounced in securities that are short-sale constrained and highly informationally opaque. During the short-sale ban of financial stocks in 2008, negative informed trades have a positive effect on short interest, suggesting that value implications are the result of hedging-related behavior by market makers.

While most of the evidence suggests that family formation effects are small at best, and often nonexistent, recent research argues that policies that alter budget constraints considerably should have greater family formation impacts. We tested this hypothesis by investigating the Social Security Student Benefit Program (SSSBP), a program designed to provide large higher education subsidies for the children of disabled, retired, or deceased parents. Conditions for receipt of SSSBP created strong incentives to delay marriage. Utilizing data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1979, and a difference-in-differences model, we found that women potentially qualifying for the SSSBP were much less likely to marry before age 22 and were older when they had children, while the program did not influence the probability of women ever marrying or having children.

Overall, voucher students experienced an average achievement loss of 0.15SDs in mathematics during their first year of attending a private school compared with matched students who remained in a public school. This loss persisted regardless of the length of time spent in a private school. In English/Language Arts, we did not observe statistically meaningful effects.

The model further predicts that segments inside a conglomerate should become more related over time, which is consistent with the data.

However, projecting healthcare demand based on projected elderly does not consider changes in population health state over time. This paper proposes a new approach to forecast health variables using a stochastic health state function and the well-established Lee-Carter stochastic mortality model. With the estimated health state at each age over time, we project the hospitalization rate, healthcare demand, and financing cost for Singapore using historical life tables and hospital admission data. Our findings show that while hospital insurance claims increase owing to an aging population, improving health state could save costs from hospital insurance claims. This has policy implications: more attention should be given to preventive healthcare such as health screening to improve the overall health state of the population.","[Chia, Ngee Choon; Loh, Shu Peng] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Chia, NC (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Block AS2,Level 6,1 Arts Link, Singapore 117570, Singapore.",ecscnc@nus.edu.sg,,"CHIA, Ngee Choon/0000-0001-9688-1647",,,,,39,4,5,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

While the impacts of these interventions on poverty reduction and market participation by smallholders has been studied, little is known about their contributions to building climate resilience. This paper analyzes the compatibility of market systems and climate resilience approaches to agricultural development, using the United States government's Feed the Future program as an empirical case study. Drawing on case studies in Ethiopia and Honduras, the paper examines the synergies and tensions between market systems and climate resilience approaches. The study finds that the market systems interventions have contributed to climate resilience, but also evidence of significant limitations due to fundamental tensions between market system and resilience approaches in terms of what their goals are, who they target, and how they approach their objectives. This study has important implications for the design and implementation of climate resilience programs and policies, as well as the expectations that agricultural development programs will be able to build climate resilience.

It uses an unbalanced panel of 300 microfinance institutions (MFIs) from 107 developing countries from 2005 to 2015. Three key trends emerge from the results of a 2SLS regression. First, the adoption of formal microbanking practices raises interest rates compared with other forms of microlending. Second, large-scale lending lowers interest rates only for those MFIs that already hold legal banking status. Third, age of operation in excess of 8 years exerts a negative impact on interest rates, regardless of scale and charter type of MFI. Collectively, our results indicate that policies that incentivize mature MFIs to share their knowledge will be more effective in helping the nascent institutions to overcome their cost disadvantages compared with reforms to transform them into licensed banks. For MFIs that already hold permits to operate as banks, initiatives to increase loan sizes are key strategic pricing decisions, irrespective of the institution's age. This study is original in its differentiation of the impact on interest rates of regulations that promote formal banking principles, credit market extension vis-a-vis knowledge sharing between mature and nascent MFIs.","[Nwachukwu, Jacinta C.; Aziz, Aqsa; Tony-Okeke, Uchenna] Coventry Univ, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Asongu, Simplice A.] African Governance & Dev Inst, Yaounde, Cameroon",Coventry University; African Governance & Development Institute,"Nwachukwu, JC (通讯作者)，Coventry Univ, Fac Business & Law, Sch Econ Finance & Accounting, Priory St, Coventry CV1 5FB, W Midlands, England.",jacinta.nwachukwu@coventry.ac.uk,"Tony-Okeke, Uchenna/AAU-6850-2020; Simplice, Asongu/K-3436-2014","Simplice, Asongu/0000-0001-5227-5135; Aziz, Aqsa/0000-0001-7311-3979",,,,,43,3,3,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

However, extant empirical evidence is not consistent with the view that team-managed funds generate superior returns relative to individual-managed funds. We argue that the benefits of team management are likely to be manifested in the presence of strong board monitoring because the potential free-rider problems within team-managed funds are alleviated. Our findings, that smaller boards and boards with a higher proportion of independent directors are positively associated with performance in team but not individual-managed funds, are consistent with this view.

The main theoretical result is a new analytical representation of the expected payoffs of put and call options under the physical measure in terms of current option prices and a representative investor's preferences. This representation is then used to derive analytical expressions for a variety of ex-ante physical return moments, showing explicitly how moment premiums depend on current option prices and preferences. As an empirical application of our theoretical results, we provide option-implied estimates of the representative stock market investor's disappointment aversion using S&P 500 index option prices. We find that disappointment aversion has a procyclical pattern. It is high in times of high index levels and declines when the index falls. We confirm the view that investors with high risk aversion and disappointment aversion leave the stock market during times of turbulence and reenter it after a period of high returns.","[Brinkmann, Felix] Deutsch Bundesbank, Wilhelm Epstein Str 14, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany; [Korn, Olaf] Univ Gottingen, Chair Finance, Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Korn, Olaf] Ctr Financial Res Cologne CFR, Cologne, Germany",Deutsche Bank; University of Gottingen; University of Cologne,"Korn, O (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Chair Finance, Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.;Korn, O (通讯作者)，Ctr Financial Res Cologne CFR, Cologne, Germany.",felix.brinkmann@bundesbank.de; okorn@uni-goettingen.de,,,,,,,49,3,3,1,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1380-6645,1573-7144,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

Understanding their role in foreign aid giving is crucial since their decisions can influence aid effectiveness and thus economic development on the ground. Our study examines whether development ministers' personal characteristics are associated with aid budgets and aid quality. To this end, we create a novel database on development ministers' gender, political ideology, prior professional experience in development cooperation, education, and time in office over the 1967-2012 period. Results from fixed-effects panel regressions show that some of the personal characteristics of development ministers matter. Most notably, we find that more experienced ministers with respect to their time in the development office obtain larger aid budgets. Moreover, our results suggest that female ministers as well as officeholders with prior professional experience in development cooperation and a longer time in office provide higher-quality ODA.","[Fuchs, Andreas; Richert, Katharina] Heidelberg Univ, Heidelberg, Germany",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Fuchs, A (通讯作者)，Heidelberg Univ, Heidelberg, Germany.",mail@andreas-fuchs.net,"Fuchs, Andreas/H-3956-2019","Fuchs, Andreas/0000-0002-6309-5954",,,,,101,10,11,1,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

Those methods also have been used to estimate citizens' ideologies. Whereas studies evaluating Congress typically use a behavioral measure, roll call votes, to estimate where representatives stand on the left-right ideological spectrum, those of the public most often have relied on survey data of stated, rather than revealed, preferences. However, measures of individuals' preferences and, accordingly, estimates of their ideal points, may differ in important ways based on how preferences are elicited. In this paper, we elicit the same individuals' preferences on the same 10 issues using two different methods: standard survey responses measured on a Likert scale and a donation exercise wherein individuals are forced to divide $1.50 between interest groups with diametrically opposed policy preferences. Importantly, expressing extreme views is costless under the former, but not the latter, method. We find that the type of elicitation method used is a significant predictor of individuals' ideal points, and that the elicitation effect is driven primarily by Democratic respondents. Under the donation method, the ideal points of Democrats in the aggregate shift left, particularly for those Democrats who are politically engaged. In contrast, wealthy Democrats' ideal points shift to the right. We also document effects for Republicans and Independents and find that overall polarization is similar under both elicitation methods. We conclude with a discussion of our results, and the consequences and tradeoffs of each elicitation method.","[Haas, Nicholas; Morton, Rebecca B.] NYU, Dept Polit, 19 West 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Morton, Rebecca B.] NYU Abu Dhabi, Social Sci Expt Lab, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates",New York University; New York University Abu Dhabi,"Morton, RB (通讯作者)，NYU, Dept Polit, 19 West 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA.;Morton, RB (通讯作者)，NYU Abu Dhabi, Social Sci Expt Lab, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.",nsh276@nyu.edu; rebecca.morton@nyu.edu,"Haas, Nicholas/AAB-1929-2021","Haas, Nicholas/0000-0002-7218-932X",,,,,45,2,2,0,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUL,2018,176.0,1-2,,,SI,,79,106,,10.1007/s11127-018-0558-9,0.0,,,28,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,GM8GF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000438459400006,0

We experimentally investigate the robustness of this solution by introducing different channels of communication that naturally arise from group competitions. In the absence of communication, we confirm that output sharing can introduce sufficient free riding to offset over-harvesting and results in full efficiency. Allowing local communication within output-sharing groups substantially decreases this efficiency enhancement because it reduces free riding and boosts between-group competition. Yet the efficiency level is still significantly higher than that achieved when global communication is allowed among all appropriators in a conventional common pool resource without output sharing. The efficiency-reducing effect of local communication is mitigated when random partners instead of fixed partners are sharing output over time, and is nearly eliminated when random partners are formed with users who belong to different communication groups.","[Buckley, Neil J.] York Univ, Dept Econ, 4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada; [Mestelman, Stuart; Muller, R.

Using a targeted sample of adult grocery shoppers, we employ an incentive-compatible approach to elicit the willingness to pay for a variety of natural-labelled food products, along with their counterfactual, standard-labelled counterparts. We find that consumers are willing to pay 20% more on average for natural products. Using elicited information on consumer beliefs, we find that this premium decreases when natural signals no artificial flavors or preservatives, and increases when consumers believe that natural means GMO-free. Interestingly, for those indicating that the natural designation is meaningless, they are willing to pay about one-third less for products labelled this way.","[Butler, Julianna M.] Univ Delaware, Lerner Coll Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Newark, DE USA; [Vossler, Christian A.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Econ, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Vossler, Christian A.] Univ Tennessee, Howard Baker Jr Ctr Publ Policy, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA",University of Delaware; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Vossler, CA (通讯作者)，Univ Tennessee, Dept Econ, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.;Vossler, CA (通讯作者)，Univ Tennessee, Howard Baker Jr Ctr Publ Policy, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",butlerj@udel.edu; cvossler@utk.edu,"Vossler, Christian A/A-5453-2010",,,,,,29,9,11,2,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

A modern business performance measurement tool is the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) method. This method helps assess not only the financial situation of the enterprise, but also indicators, and evaluates non-financial indicators, which is important for achieving the maximum competitiveness of the enterprise. This paper points out the importance of non-financial indicators in small and medium-sized enterprises in Slovakia, using the BSC method as a strategic management tool. Three hypotheses were established and then verified using the method of proportionality of the given phenomenon in the population and the chi-square test of independence. Apartial objective of the study was to find out the existence of a statistically significant link between the use of the BSC method and the importance of non-financial indicators in small and medium-sized enterprises in Slovakia, as the BSC method attaches the same importance to both financial and non-financial indicators.

We examined 300 Australians' norms concerning parents' obligations to support adult children financially. Utilizing a quasi-experimental design, we investigated the extent to which respondents agreed that parents should support adult children, and the influence of situational factors. More respondents were in favor of assisting adult children than against, but there was no consensus as to what parents should do. Respondents generally agreed on factors that should be considered, then attempted to balance parental responsibility norms with adult independence norms. Parental help was more strongly endorsed when need was considered legitimate, and when the adult child was younger.

A linearly dependent background risk is a background risk that increases linearly in the chosen tradable outcome. In order to do this, we construct a parametric class of background risks that we label as risk-taking-neutral (RTN). These background risks have the property that they will not alter the decision made with respect to the market risk. As such, these RTN background risks provide a benchmark. In many situations, a background risk that is faced by an investor can be compared to one from the RTN class in order to predict qualitative changes in the investor's choice decision. As this benchmark is easily available, it is convenient to use to predict these changes.","[Franke, Guenter] Univ Konstanz, Constance, Germany; [Schlesinger, Harris] Univ Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Stapleton, Richard C.] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Konstanz; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; University of Manchester,"Franke, G (通讯作者)，Univ Konstanz, Constance, Germany.",guenter.franke@uni-konstanz.de; richard.stapleton1@btinternet.com,,,,,,,21,2,2,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

These laws established a federal land policy of preemption, under which squatters on public land obtained legal title to it in exchange for payment of a minimum (and low) price per acre. Preemption significantly liberalized the terms of land ownership in the U.S. We analyze roll call voting on the preemption acts in Congress from a distributive politics perspective. The key finding is that a member's region of the country consistently adds explanatory power on top of that provided by ideology or party: members of Congress from the original thirteen states were less supportive of preemption on Western lands, all else constant. Moreover, this effect is much stronger in the House of Representatives than in the Senate. This is inconsistent with explanations of a West-South coalition vs. the North often found in the historical literature, but is consistent with a distributive politics perspective based on rent seeking by Western landholders.","[Gailmard, Sean] Univ Calif Berkeley, Travers Dept Polit Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Jenkins, Jeffery A.] Univ Southern Calif, Sol Price Sch Publ Policy, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Southern California,"Jenkins, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Sol Price Sch Publ Policy, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",gailmard@berkeley.edu; jajenkins@usc.edu,,,,,,,35,10,10,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUN,2018,175.0,3-4,,,,,259,275,,10.1007/s11127-018-0518-4,0.0,,,17,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,GG9QZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000433037400004,0

Barriers to shareholder activism have historically been high but we document an unprecedented wave of block acquisitions by hedge fund and other investors with a total of 916 stakes reported in the period between 1998 and 2009. There is, on average, a positive stock price reaction to the announcement of activist investments, particularly for events involving hostile funds. The long-run returns on activism are positive only for events involving hostile funds. We find that activists have forced target firm managers to increase their payouts compared to peer firms, and there is some evidence of change in corporate governance. Finally, after 2006 there was a widespread adoption of poison pills by firms, particularly those targeted by activists, and a subsequent drop in investor activism. Our paper shows how U.S.-style activist investors are responsible for the import of corporate governance mechanisms from the U.S. into a foreign market.","[Hamao, Yasushi] Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY 10025 USA; [Hamao, Yasushi] Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Matos, Pedro] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",Columbia University; Tsinghua University; University of Virginia,"Hamao, Y (通讯作者)，Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY 10025 USA.;Hamao, Y (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",yasushi.hamao@yale.edu; MatosP@darden.virginia.edu,,,,,,,31,18,19,0,9,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0889-1583,1095-8681,,J JPN INT ECON,J.

Models like Schelling (1971) show that segregation can arise through white preferences for residing near minorities. Once the threshold or tipping point is passed, the models predict that all whites will leave. Our paper uses census-tract data for six cities in the United States from the 1930s and 1970-2010 to measure decadal, city-specific tipping points. We use a structural break procedure to estimate the tipping points and incorporate these in a regression-discontinuity design to estimate the impact on population trends for neighborhoods that exceed that threshold while controlling for city specific trends in migration. We find that the magnitude of white flight for neighborhoods that have tipped in 2000 has fallen to between 23% and 36% of the level seen in 1970. There was no discontinuity in white flight after accounting for migration trends during the Great Depression. Finally, we show that in-migration of minorities in tipped neighborhoods do not fill in the gap left by white flight.","[Kollmann, Trevor] Univ Wollongong, Ctr Contemporary Australasian Business & Econ Stu, Wollongong, NSW, Australia; [Marsiglio, Simone; Suardi, Sandy] Univ Wollongong, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Wollongong, NSW, Australia",University of Wollongong; University of Wollongong,"Kollmann, T (通讯作者)，Univ Wollongong, Ctr Contemporary Australasian Business & Econ Stu, Wollongong, NSW, Australia.",tmkollmann@gmail.com; simonem@uow.edu.au; ssuardi@uow.edu.au,"Marsiglio, Simone/K-2863-2012; suardi, sandy/JXY-3445-2024","suardi, sandy/0000-0002-0491-8957; Kollmann, Trevor/0000-0002-3473-6003",,,,,28,6,7,2,9,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",1051-1377,1096-0791,,J HOUS ECON,J.

The presented estimates show elastic demand, and small learning by doing along with modest learning spillovers in production. Our simulations show that, while the subsidies are an effective instrument to encourage the greater use of solar panels, they would exacerbate social surplus unless the value of mitigating CO2 emission is well above the ongoing market price.","[Myojo, Satoshi] Hosei Univ, Fac Econ, 4342 Aihara Cho, Machida, Tokyo 1940298, Japan; [Ohashi, Hiroshi] Univ Tokyo, Fac Econ, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138654, Japan",Hosei University; University of Tokyo,"Myojo, S (通讯作者)，Hosei Univ, Fac Econ, 4342 Aihara Cho, Machida, Tokyo 1940298, Japan.",myojo@hosei.ac.jp; ohashi@e.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [25780164, 15K03466]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K03466, 25780164, 15H03333] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We thank Toshihide Arimura, Akira Hibiki, Shigeru Matsumoto, an anonymous referee, and seminar and conference participants at the EARIE, NISTEP, Osaka University, and the University of Tokyo for their helpful comments.

While cities and, in particular, secondary towns, where most of the urban population in sub-Saharan Africa resides, affect agricultural practices in their rural hinterlands, this relationship is not well understood. To fill this gap, we develop a conceptual model to analyze how farmers' proximity to cities of different sizes affects agricultural prices and intensification of farming. We then test these predictions using large-scale survey data from producers of teff, a major staple crop in Ethiopia, relying on unique data on transport costs and road networks and implementing an array of econometric models. We find that agricultural price behavior and intensification is determined by proximity to a city and the type of city. While proximity to cities has a strong positive effect on agricultural output prices and on uptake of modern inputs and yields on farms, the effects on prices and intensification measures are lower for farmers in the rural hinterlands of secondary towns compared to primate cities.

This research is quantitative in nature, and the data is directly gathered through closed-ended questionnaires from 300 respondents. Besides predictors', four mediating variables have also been taken into consideration that contribute indirectly in job creation opportunities. Bootstrapping and Normal theory methods have been employed in order to examine the impact of predictors' and mediating variables. The result of this research confirmed that pharmaceutical industry plays a vital role in job creation in Pakistan. It is further concluded that the pharmaceutical industry has a direct and significant impact in job creation by providing indigenous and direct job opportunities in sales, marketing, and other supporting departments for both skilled and unskilled workers. Pharmaceutical industry also provides indirect job opportunities through other industries, which are very much linked with this industry, such as: pharmaceutical distributors, dealers, retailers, wholesalers, hotel industry, and event management industry. It is also determined that pharmaceutical industry is acting like knowledge and skills imparting institutions. Therefore, skilled-based training and organizational learning are major mediating variables that transform unskilled people into human assets, which further trigger the future job prospects. Since pharmaceutical industry is one of the biggest industries in Pakistan, providing plenteous opportunities of new jobs with consistent growth. Thus, mediating variables such as motivation and interpersonal influence also preceded an active role in new job creation.","[Ahmed, Rizwan Raheem] Indus Univ, Block 17, Karachi, Pakistan; [Vveinhardt, Jolita; Streimikiene, Dalia] Lithuanian Sports Univ, Sporto Str 6, LT-44221 Kaunas, Lithuania",Lithuanian Sports University,"Streimikiene, D (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Sports Univ, Sporto Str 6, LT-44221 Kaunas, Lithuania.",dalia.streimikiene@lei.lt,"Streimikiene, Dalia/AAD-7762-2020; Ahmed, Rizwan Raheem/B-9632-2016; Li, Wang/M-1612-2019; Vveinhardt, Jolita/AAB-6754-2020","Ahmed, Rizwan Raheem/0000-0001-5844-5502; Vveinhardt, Jolita/0000-0001-6231-9402",,,,,53,10,11,0,7,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,MAY,2018,20.0,48,,,,,454,469,,10.24818/EA/2018/48/454,0.0,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GL6OW,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000437308600004,0

This paper provides an assessment of two key dimensions: the global adoption of MDGs and state capacity. We do so by studying whether they facilitated convergence in income poverty measures, using cross-section and panel methods, with data on 89 developing economies for the period 1990-2013. We find that poverty headcount and gap measures tended to decrease faster in countries with initially higher income poverty. Such convergence accelerated after 2000, suggesting that MDGs adoption was instrumental to poverty reduction. However, this still leaves unexplained substantial variation in poverty reduction performance across countries. Such variation is explained by state capacity: countries with greater ability to administer their territories in 1990 experienced faster income poverty reduction and were more likely to have achieved the MDG target. This result is insensitive to robust regression methods and to a large set of controls (initial level of income, dependence on natural resources, education and health inputs, dependence on foreign aid, ethnic fractionalization, regional effects and a set of governance variables). As good governance and effective institutions are included in the Sustainable Development Goals, this result provides empirical justification for this move, suggesting that more effective states could be crucial to sustain the development progress achieved so far.

The sharing economy, which primarily involves the transformation of traditional market behaviors into collaborative consumption models, that ensure a more efficient and sustainable use of resources, is part of the circular economy and has generated business models that are compatible with it. This article discusses the possibility for the sharing economy to bring about profound changes in consumer behavior towards products and services and to highlight the factors that drive consumers' shift towards the sharing economy. For this purpose we developed and tested a model in which the change in consumer mindset has as the main direct determinants the satisfaction with the services of the sharing economy and the intention to access such products and services. The study uses data collected through a questionnaire, applied to a sample of 320 customers of Uber - a symbol of the sharing economy, and processed using structural equation modelling.

Relative prices move inversely with relative supply shifts which, in turn, depend on relative factor intensities.

We focus on the first generation of the French Enterprise Zone (EZ) initiative, implemented in 1997. Contrary to previous results from similar programs in France, we observe a strong positive impact of the EZ initiative on economic activity in the short run, and this finding is robust to several identification strategies. However, long-run estimates suggest that this program fails to propel self-sustaining economic development. After five years, the early positive results level off as the increase in business locations is partially offset by more frequent business discontinuations.

We use two household regional travel surveys over a decade apart, the 2000 and 2012 surveys, from the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC). Previous research, at the national scale, has highlighted changes among the Millennial cohort. We use these two regional datasets to examine the changing travel behavior among Millennials and to put these changes in context by comparing them with changes among other social groups of interest: women and minorities. We find that the travel behavior of young people did not change substantially between 2000 and 2012. Where there are changes, these pale in comparison to the changes among women and black residents. And finally, we find that the built environment factors appear to influence travel more in 2012 than in 2000.

To this end, this article first created a detailed list of 23 variables to measure city. level urban form of 100 major Urban Areas (UAs) in the United States and then applied factor analysis to construct five latent variables which describe urban form. Factor analysis is also used to define mediator variables reflecting citywide transportation network features and dependent variable of traffic safety. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is then used to investigate how city-level urban form, directly and indirectly (through mediators of transportation network features), affects traffic safety. Based on the statistical results, urban traffic is safer in UAs with more uniform job-housing balance among their different tracts, more polycentric design, and less low-density sprawl. In addition to spatial variation in employment and urban density that have significant direct effect on traffic safety, improving transportation network connectivity and increasing the supply of public transit facilities and upper-level transport infrastructures can decrease traffic fatalities indirectly, through encouraging the use of non-driving transport modes. It is estimated that a 10% increase in urban density as well as a 10% increase in even spatial distribution of employment can reduce the rate of fatal crashes by > 15%, on average. These findings demonstrate the importance of incorporating city-level land-use policies into the planning practices, in terms of traffic safety.","[Najaf, Pooya] Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 9201 Univ City Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA; [Thill, Jean-Claude; Zhang, Wenjia; Fields, Milton Greg] Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, Charlotte, NC USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte,"Najaf, P (通讯作者)，Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 9201 Univ City Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.",Pooya.najaf@gmail.com,"Zhang, Wenjia/AAK-1615-2020","Zhang, Wenjia/0000-0002-7211-4205; Thill, Jean-Claude/0000-0002-6651-8123",,,,,49,41,52,7,86,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Although incidents involving these shipments could be catastrophic, having link level information could be useful for designing appropriate emergency response network and responding to such episodes. We present a data-driven methodology that makes use of analytics to estimate the amount of crude oil on different rail-links in Canada until 2030. The resulting analyses facilitated identifying high-risk links around Canada based on the current practice of the railroad industry, and to suggest that incurring marginally higher transportation costs could reduce network risk. In addition, the availability of the proposed pipeline infrastructure would change the supply and demand location configurations over the forecast horizon, with the maximum changes to the current crude oil traffic flow pattern stemming from the completion of the Energy East pipeline project.","[Vaezi, Ali; Verma, Manish] McMaster Univ, DeGroote Sch Business, Hamilton, ON, Canada",McMaster University,"Verma, M (通讯作者)，McMaster Univ, DeGroote Sch Business, Hamilton, ON, Canada.",vaezia2@mcmaster.ca; mverma@mcmaster.ca,,"Verma, Manish/0000-0002-8878-0069",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [435-1178-2015],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"This research has been supported, in part, by a grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (435-1178-2015).

The results are stronger for firms with more complex tax haven structures and weakly governed firms. Furthermore, firms that respond to TIEAs by haven hopping (i.e., they move subsidiaries from affected to nonaffected tax havens) do not experience an increase in firm value.

We then analyze the effects of these taxes on urban spatial structure, showing that they reduce the extent of commuting and the level of housing consumption while increasing building heights, generating a more-compact city with a lower level of emissions per capita.","[Borck, Rainald] Univ Potsdam, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Potsdam, Germany; [Brueckner, Jan K.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92717 USA",University of Potsdam; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Borck, R (通讯作者)，Univ Potsdam, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Potsdam, Germany.",rainald.borck@uni-potsdam.de; jkbrueck@uci.edu,"Borck, Rainald/M-3077-2019","Borck, Rainald/0000-0003-0833-020X",,,,,37,36,38,0,15,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

We provide such understanding in three ways: by focusing on a specific entrepreneurial context (franchise systems), by developing a multi-faceted theoretical framework and by highlighting a contingency that may affect the networking-performance link. We combine knowledge and learning perspectives with a networking perspective to develop and test a multi-faceted framework on the effects of franchisee networking with peers within a franchise system ('peer networking') on franchisee unit performance. In particular, we argue that the performance benefits that franchisees draw from networking with their peers vary between low, medium and high performing franchisees. We use ordinary least squares (OLS) and Quantile Regression analyses to test our hypotheses with empirical data from a Dutch franchise system. Our results confirm that structural, resource and relational facets of franchisee peer networking affect unit performance, and that they benefit and harm low, medium, and high performing franchisees differently.","[Brand, Maryse J.; Croonen, Evelien P.

The transport and social exclusion framework is applied to determine whether transport poverty leads to inaccessibility, and how this impacts participation in daily activities and the wellbeing of recently landed refugees. A mixed methodological approach consisting of focus groups, survey data collection, and accessibility analysis provides a thorough and valid depiction of the topics investigated. The findings clearly depict evidence of subjective inaccessibility and its negative impact on participation in social and discretionary activities. At the same time, inaccessibility was not determined to be effecting participation rates in many mandatory activities such as daily English language classes or childcare-related tasks. Most of the respondents overwhelmingly felt that their transportation situation was having a strong negative impact on several dimensions of wellbeing, including loneliness and sadness. Despite the strong subjective and emotional responses to perceived inaccessibility, GIS-based accessibility scores show that the survey respondents had higher levels of objectively-measured access to destinations when compared to the broader population of Durham Region, indicating the importance of qualitative assessments of perceived access. Overall, the research confirms the validity of the transport and social exclusion framework and its usefulness in understanding participation and settlement outcomes among refugee migrants within a suburban, North American context.","[Farber, Steven] Univ Toronto, Dept Human Geog, 1265 Mil Trail, Scarborough, ON M1C 1A4, Canada; [Mifsud, Anika] Community Dev Council, Community Dev & Res, Durham 458 Fairall St,Unit 4, Ajax, ON L1S 1R6, Canada; [Allen, Jeff; Widener, Michael J.] Univ Toronto, Dept Geog & Planning, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada; [Newbold, K.

During the early years of the emerging combinatorial chemistry industry, the industry on which our empirical analysis focuses, spin-offs engaged in alliances with large and established partners, partners of similar type and size, and with public research organizations, often for different reasons. We seek to understand to what extent alliances of spin-offs with other firms (either large- or small- and medium-sized firms) affected their innovation performance and also how this performance may have been affected by their corporate or public research background. We find evidence that in general alliances of spin-offs with other firms, in particular alliances with large firms, increased their innovation performance. Corporate spin-offs that formed alliances with other firms outperformed public research spin-offs with such alliances. This suggests that, in terms of their innovation performance, corporate spin-offs that engaged in alliances with other firms seemed to have benefitted from their prior corporate background. Interestingly, it turns out that the negative impact of alliances on the innovation performance of public research spin-offs was largely affected by their alliances with small- and medium-sized firms.","[Hagedoorn, John] Royal Holloway Univ London, Egham, Surrey, England; [Hagedoorn, John] UNU MERIT, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Lokshin, Boris] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Malo, Stephane] Amer Univ Paris, Paris, France; [Malo, Stephane] EDC Paris Business Sch, Paris, France",University of London; Royal Holloway University London; Maastricht University; Maastricht University; The American University of Paris,"Hagedoorn, J (通讯作者)，Royal Holloway Univ London, Egham, Surrey, England.",John.Hagedoorn@rhul.ac.uk; b.lokshin@maastrichtuniversity.nl; smalo@aup.edu,"Hagedoorn, John/HNR-3048-2023","Lokshin, Boris/0000-0002-6524-6621; Hagedoorn, John/0000-0002-0751-5344",,,,,120,16,18,3,57,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Theoretically, the direction of this effect is not a priori directly clear as it balances the trade-off between protecting the economic interests of the domestic agricultural sector on the one hand and ensuring food availability for the society at large on the other. Our most important findings suggest that natural disasters generally raise agricultural trade controls to favor domestic farmers. These barriers are mainly provided by limiting imports in the aftermath of a natural event. However, the protection pattern differs among countries. To be more specific, floods and storms increase agricultural protection in high-income countries, while trade barriers in many LDCs are reduced during periods of extreme drought in an attempt to diminish food scarcity. Finally, it turns out that a large part of the change in agricultural protection caused by a natural disaster is explained by a number of commodity specific particularities (i.e., food vs. cash crops).

The cycle indicator is obtained by de trending the series of total formal employment (Mexican states) and nonfarm employment and industrial production (US). In general, our panel data model estimations suggest the existence of spatial autocorrelation and significant time-period fixed effects. Also, the estimates indicate a significant and positive effect of the ratio of foreign direct investment to gross domestic product (GDP), which may be supplementing the impact of international trade (driven by the most internationally integrated states) and a negative effect of the ratio of remittances to GDP (driven by less integrated states).

Using the 2013 origin/destination (O/D) passenger flow data instead of commonly used scheduled data, we compare the spatial configurations of the Chinese national urban system in both high-speed railway and airline networks. The results show that HSR-dominant cities and links are located mainly in the middle and eastern parts of China, offering regional connections, whereas air-dominant cities and links are evenly distributed across the whole of China and predominantly offer interregional connections. This is mainly because HSR networks are more focused on connections to cities with high socio-economic performance and are more restricted by the geographical distance between linked cities than the airline networks. Furthermore, HSR networks promote agglomeration economies within cities located along the trunk lines in specific regions, whereas airline networks contribute to more balanced urban development in China. These dimensions indicate that the configuration of urban systems in HSR networks differ largely from that of air networks when measured in terms of passenger flows.","[Yang, Haoran; Dijst, Martin; Witte, Patrick] Univ Utrecht, Dept Human Geog & Planning, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Dobruszkes, Frederic] ULB, DGES IGEAT, Fac Sci Brussels, Brussels, Belgium; [Yang, Haoran; Wang, Jiaoe] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jiaoe] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Dijst, Martin] LISER, Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg","Utrecht University; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Wang, JE (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.",wangje@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Dijst, Martin/ABF-5649-2021; Yang, Haoran/GXH-6567-2022; Wang, Jiaoe/AAD-5237-2020","Dijst, Martin/0000-0002-7666-3455; Yang, Haoran/0000-0001-5572-9390; Wang, jiaoe/0000-0003-1051-7727",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41722103],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),All the authors gratefully thank the reviewers and editors their insightful and constructive comments.

These mechanisms should be more prevalent in new political units. Since the creation of new political units is rarely exogenous, however, serious endogeneity issues would be an issue for empirical studies of this subject. To overcome these problems, I use a Danish local government reform which amalgamated some (but not all) Danish municipalities, thereby creating new political units in a way that is arguably quasi-experimental to study whether political budget cycles are larger in new political units. Contrary to theoretical predictions, political budget cycles seem to be of a smaller scale in the new municipalities, but only regarding budget cycles in budgetary overruns. The findings are of wider interest for discussions about the mechanisms behind context conditional political budget cycles.","[Aaskoven, Lasse] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Polit Sci, Oster Farimagsgade 5, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Aaskoven, L (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Polit Sci, Oster Farimagsgade 5, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",lasse.aaskoven@ifs.ku.dk,,"Aaskoven, Lasse/0000-0001-5489-9785",,,,,30,10,10,4,13,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

Business owners were severely capital-constrained, lacking in higher education, and training in skilled occupations. The median owner today, in contrast, is college educated, access to financing has expanded, and opportunities to serve corporate and public-sector clients are commonplace. Nearly 40% of all new firms created nationwide in 2015 were minority owned. Changing attitudes in mainstream society reduced traditional barriers. True equality of opportunity among small minority- and white-owned firms of similar size and scope has nonetheless not been achieved. This issue of Small Business Economics examines lingering barriers impeding the development of a more vibrant minority business community. Focusing on access to financing and government procurement markets, articles in this issue offer explicit analyses of enduring barriers, along with explanations of adoptive strategic firm behavior appropriate for reducing those barriers.","[Bates, Timothy] Wayne State Univ, Detroit, MI 48202 USA; [Bradford, William D.] Univ Washington, Business & Econ Dev, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Seamans, Robert] NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10003 USA",Wayne State University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; New York University,"Bates, T (通讯作者)，Wayne State Univ, Detroit, MI 48202 USA.",tbates7893@gmail.com; bradford@u.washington.edu; rseamans@stern.nyu.edu,"Bates, Timothy C/C-9637-2010",,,,,,79,43,91,0,50,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We find that female directorship significantly increases ROA and ROE, and significantly decreases Tobin's Q. We postulate that these relationships are affected by the attributes of female directors. To this end, we collect a set of nine different attributes of female directors capturing their monitoring capabilities and contribution to the board's human capital (demographic and board relational attributes). We find that the positive relationship between accounting performance and female directorship remains when we include these attributes, while the negative relationship between Tobin's Q and female directorship disappears. Interestingly, the different attributes of female directors do not uniformly affect accounting and market-based performance. We explain the different relationships between attributes and firm performance by the tradeoff between the benefits and costs of diversity on board effectiveness, particularly in a low investor protection environment.

Pricing errors from moderate nonlinearity can be large, and a version of a test for nonlinearity based on risk premiums rather than pricing errors has reasonable power properties after properly controlling for the size of the test.

Lean enterprise is focused on creating a maximal value for final customers while eliminating all kinds of waste and unnecessary costs, which significantly helps to increase the level of its competitiveness. It is about managerial decision-making, which can be in some cases contradictory (solving a local problem can cause a problem in another place). In this paper, we describe the KMS ATOM, which supports the innovation process in a lean enterprise. We show how the risk of wrong decisions due to contradictory effects can be eliminated by implementing a safety-critical system into the traditional IS. Our model is supported by Event-B modelling, a refinement-based formal modelling method, which is successfully used in important areas such as infrastructure, medicine, nuclear engineering and transportation (fire alarm systems, robotic surgery machines, braking systems in transportation, etc.). Nowadays, Event-B modelling is starting to be used for various management decision-making activities, and it is becoming a powerful competitiveness tool. This paper introduces a simple example of how Event-B modelling and its proof obligations can help improve and automate the decision-making process by eliminating potential threats of inefficient decisions.","[Burita, Ladislav; Hrusecka, Denisa; Pivnicka, Michal; Rosman, Pavel] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Burita, L (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic.",burita@fame.utb.cz; hrusecka@fame.utb.cz; pivnicka@fame.utb.cz; rosman@fame.utb.cz,"BURITA, Ladislav/ABC-6626-2021; Hrusecka, Denisa/H-6595-2012","BURITA, Ladislav/0000-0003-4779-631X; Hrusecka, Denisa/0000-0003-1459-0040",RVO project Modelling of effective production and administration processes parameters in industrial companies based on the concept Industry 4.0,RVO project Modelling of effective production and administration processes parameters in industrial companies based on the concept Industry 4.0,"The research related to this paper was supported by the RVO project Modelling of effective production and administration processes parameters in industrial companies based on the concept Industry 4.0, run by the Department of Industrial Engineering and Information Systems, Faculty of Management and Economics, Tomas Bata University in Zlin, Czech Republic.",,25,4,7,1,31,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

The analysis uses both household survey and qualitative interview data to answer the following questions: (1) what are the effects of spatial location on types of land use disputes experienced by households; (2) what types of boundary/border disputes are experienced by pastoralists within and between different ethnic groups; (3) what are the principal social and economic determinants of land use disputes; and (4) what factors determine the level of satisfaction by different parties in dispute settlement? We show that despite widespread land use changes in the area and the emergence of private enclosures on communal grazing lands, disputes around administrative borders trump all other determinants of conflict. We also find significant spatial and scale differences in the incidence of conflict, and that different types of conflict are taken to different conflict resolution institutions. Along these lines we also demonstrate that overall conflict and dissatisfaction with conflict resolution outcomes are more pronounced among the more mobile, livestock-dependent segment of the population than other groups. Finally, the article highlights the importance of understanding political and historical factors related to land rights and disputes as necessary for proposed land tenure programs in the area.

The risk of of the error occurrence is examined from the accountants' perspective. For this purpose, a questionnaire survey was used for data collection focusing on areas that are considered to be the most important by the accountants and the areas which are the most problematic. The receivables, expenses and revenues were indicated as the most significant. The areas of long-term assets, financial assets and inventories appear to be problematic due to tax impacts. Expenses, revenues, accruals and deferrals appear to be problematic due to issues with correct valuation.

This states that development projects typically incur major cost overruns and other implementation problems, which put in question the decision to launch them in the first place. Indeed, had these difficulties been known in advance, the projects might never have been tried. Flyvbjerg challenges the empirical validity of this principle and the sloppiness of Hirschman's own argument. This rejoinder, while accepting that Hirschman presents his argument less than well, argues that Flyvbjerg is too quick to dismiss it, and that by taking account of Hirschman's scholarship more broadly, much of his approach remains valuable.

Using original data on productive structures, growth determinants and Bolsa Familia conditional transfers (BFP) for the 184 municipalities of the Brazilian state of Ceara during 2003-10, we show that the positive impact of the transfers on local growth is in fact conditional on the direction of local economic structure transformation. Indeed, transfers did spur light manufacturing transformation activities only in the poorest and less-industrialized localities and did prompt informal activities in weakly productive services in all municipalities. Although we do not find support for the hypothesis of a redistribution trap, our estimations indicate that, on average, the growth impact of BFP transfers could have been twice as great during the period investigated in the absence of the adverse impact of social transfers on structural transformation. By promoting services and informal occupations, including in light manufacturing industries, the BFP could possibly cause a problem of job quality in the future. The medium-term impact of social transfers on poor regions' local productive structures should therefore be more fully acknowledged by policymakers, notably by associating policies promoting the development and modernization of local productive structures with transfers.

To do so, we estimate the effects of a homeownership support organization's attempt to help low- and moderate- income households purchase homes through a range of integrated services, including the provision of a second mortgage that allows for a low down payment with no mortgage insurance. Using client-level data from the homeownership support organization, Homewise, and controlling for income and other demographics, we first show that the organization's clients successfully avoid the savings barrier to home purchase a barrier which impedes many low-income households from obtaining a mortgage. We then combine Homewise administrative data with CoreLogic and Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data to compare the post-purchase behavior of participating households to those of similar households using a propensity score matching technique. Results indicate that Homewise's clients perform better on their loans than other similar borrowers in their region. For every 100 home purchasers, clients purchasing homes through Homewise have 6.3 fewer 30 day delinquencies in the first two years of their mortgage than a matched comparison group of purchasers, 2.3 fewer 60 day delinquencies, 1.8 fewer 90 day delinquencies, and 1.1 fewer 180 day delinquencies. These results show that with the correct combination of homeownership support services, low- and moderate income households can sustain a mortgage with a low-down payment.","[Stacy, Christina Plerhoples; Theodos, Brett] Metropolitan Housing & Communities Policy Ctr, Urban Inst, 2100 M St NW, Washington, DC 20037 USA; [Bai, Bing] Housing Finance Policy Ctr, Urban Inst, 2100 M St NW, Washington, DC 20037 USA",Urban Institute; Urban Institute,"Stacy, CP (通讯作者)，Metropolitan Housing & Communities Policy Ctr, Urban Inst, 2100 M St NW, Washington, DC 20037 USA.",cstacy@urban.org; btheodos@urban.org; bbai@urban.org,,,Urban Institute's Fleishman Innovation Fund,Urban Institute's Fleishman Innovation Fund,This work was supported in part by the Urban Institute's Fleishman Innovation Fund.,,48,5,5,0,13,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",1051-1377,1096-0791,,J HOUS ECON,J.

The main objective of the paper is to create a clear picture of the existing willingness of companies to adopt marketing strategies that should contribute to increasing food security by increasing the quality of wine and which should be based on the principles of sustainability. In this sense, the authors conducted some qualitative marketing research in which 15 managers from wine producing companies from Romania's wine-growing areas were interviewed. The research highlights the relationship between responsible consumption, food safety and sustainability, and the authors believe that such an association is relevant to the economic and social context of the European Union and other parts of the world. The novelty of this research refers to the analysis of the relationship between the responsible wine consumption and sustainability, to the identification of the opinions of the wine companies managers regarding the benefits and the limits of M2M and IoT technologies, to the emphasis of the marketing strategies and techniques considered innovative in the field of viticulture, as well as to the association of the concept of food safety by wine consumption to the aspects related to education and culture.","[Epuran, Gheorghe; Bratucu, Gabriel; Barbulescu, Oana; Neacsu, Nicoleta Andreea; Madar, Anca] Transilvania Univ Brasov, Fac Econ Sci & Business Adm, Brasov, Romania",Transylvania University of Brasov,"Epuran, G (通讯作者)，Transilvania Univ Brasov, Fac Econ Sci & Business Adm, Brasov, Romania.",epuran.gheorghe@unitbv.ro,"Epuran, Gheorghe/N-4395-2015","Epuran, Gheorghe/0000-0002-4959-102X",,,,,55,10,10,4,13,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2018,20.0,47,,,,,151,167,,,,,,17,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FZ8BI,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427829800010,0

This model highlights how the response of producer markups to market-level changes in that destination are intrinsically tied to the induced reallocation of export sales to that destination. I discuss how additional assumptions on the shape of demand (originally advocated by Alfred Marshall as his second law of demand) generate specific predictions for the response of those markups and induced product reallocations to increases in market size and competition in a destination: markups fall and market shares are reallocated towards better performing products. Recent evidence on French multi-product exporters strongly confirms this prediction for market share reallocations. The predictions for the markup responses are also consistent with the findings of the large empirical literature on pricing to market and incomplete pass-through.","[Melitz, Marc J.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Melitz, MJ (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",mmelitz@harvard.edu,,,,,,,21,2,3,1,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

This paper presents both cross-country and panel-data evidence on the causal factors driving the recent turnaround in Africa's growth and takes the unique approach of disaggregating the separate growth impacts of Africa's bilateral trade with: China, Europe, and America. The empirical analysis presented in this paper suggests that the primary and most robust causal factors driving Africa's recent growth turnaround are private sector and foreign direct investment. Although empirical evidence of the role of bilateral trade openness in Africa's recent growth emerges within a fixed effect estimation setting, these results are not as robust when endogeneity and other issues are fully accounted for. Among the three major bilateral partners, Africa's bilateral trade with China has been a relatively important factor spurring growth on the continent and especially so in resource-rich, oil-producing, and non-landlocked countries. The econometric results are not as supportive of growth inducing effects of foreign aid. These findings emerge after applying a variety of panel data specifications to the data, including the recent fixed effects filtered (FEF) estimator introduced by Pesaran and Zhou (2014) and the dynamic panel generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator, which allows for endogeneity between trade and growth.

Institutional, cultural and geographical factors, and country size are controlled for in the analysis. An instrumental variable approach has been adopted in order to address the endogeneity of corruption and openness to trade. The age of democracy and gravity-based predictors are chosen as the instruments for corruption and openness to trade, respectively. The estimates show that corruption negatively affects income per capita, productivity, and innovation, while it does not significantly impact income inequality (Gini). The control of corruption and the openness to trade affect output per worker through the total factor productivity. Both the control of corruption and openness to trade are statistically significant determinants of the 90/10 income gap. Landlockedness affects Gini Index directly, even after controlling for trade and corruption. These findings have important policy implications.

The most significant side effect is the enormous amount of foreign exchange reserves, which, due to the appreciation of the domestic currency, can get the CNB into more cumulative negative values than it already is.","[Cecrdlova, Andrea] Univ Econ Prague, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Cecrdlova, A (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.",,,,Grant Agency of the University of Economics (VSE IGS) [F5/2/2018],Grant Agency of the University of Economics (VSE IGS),The paper was carried out with the financial support of the Grant Agency of the University of Economics (VSE IGS F5/2/2018).,,23,0,0,0,0,INTL INST SOCIAL & ECONOMIC SCI,PRAGUE,"TREBESOVSKA 2038/14, PRAGUE, 193 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87927-77-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,92,104,,10.20472/EFC.2018.010.007,0.0,,,13,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2CO,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000505164900007,0

We extend two economy based Deidda (2006)'s banking model in which originally each economy hosts at least one operating bank. We introduce two GATS-defined modes of commercial banking liberalization namely the Commercial Presence mode and the Cross-Border mode. Additionally, we introduce the possibility of strategic behavior by competing banks in equilibrium. The extended model provides a causal link between the cost structure of the banking industry, the regime of competition in the liberalized banking sector and the rate of growth of the economy under alternative modes of liberalization. In particular, we show a threshold effect in terms of economic development: above certain economic development the banking sector operates competitively and supports an accelerating rate of growth, generating a bidirectional, self-reinforcing link between commercial banking liberalization and growth. The pace of growth is further increased, with respect to a scenario where such behavior is not present, by the presence of strategic behavior by competing banks in equilibrium.

A milestone in this process was the country's integration into the financial support mechanisms and the consequent total adoption of the policies imposed by the memoranda of understanding (MoU) between the country and its creditors. However, after three such MoUs and the corresponding adjustment programmes, country's economic and social status has not yet been normalized, and the root causes have not yet been addressed. The country and its economy are facing phenomena such as high public debt, intense social inequalities, financial deprivation, recession, declining of peoples' purchasing power, lack of liquidity, labyrinthian and volatile legislative framework as well as political instability. Taking into account all of these negative facts, it is easily understandable the economic downturn and the continuation of the crisis, with intense self-feeding characteristics. The causes of the crisis and the failure of the selected economic stabilization policies are a multidimensional and interrelated complex. Greek economy supported its growth over the past decades mainly on domestic consumption, having little presence in sectors with high added value and extrovert characteristics, focusing mainly on traditional business sectors with scarce innovation characteristics. The recipe chosen on the basis of the memorandum policies may not have been appropriate, since at macroeconomic level it was clearly confronting crisis results, but, in combating the deeper causes of it and in securing a sustainable path for economic growth and development, failed to bring the desired results. The absence of anti-cyclical policies that could break the vicious circle of recession, makes it increasingly difficult for the country to recover. In this study, we will try based on logical arguments, but also on a series of statistical data and indicators, from sources like the OECD, World Bank, Eurostat, World Economic Forum and Greek authorities, to analyse the course of Greek economy, evaluate the results of the selected policies and formulate some appropriate policy proposals.","[Galanos, George] Democritus Univ Thrace, Econ Dept, Komotini, Greece; [Koutoulakis, Manolis; Kotios, Angelos] Univ Piraeus, Piraeus, Greece",Democritus University of Thrace; University of Piraeus,"Galanos, G (通讯作者)，Democritus Univ Thrace, Econ Dept, Komotini, Greece.",galgeorg@unipi.gr,"Galanos, George/AAQ-4204-2021",,,,,,41,0,0,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",1431-1933,,978-3-319-93452-5; 978-3-319-93451-8,CONTRIB ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,83,108,,10.1007/978-3-319-93452-5_6,0.0,,,26,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BQ4NA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000591182600006,0

The rise in labor income is mainly due to the explosion in executive compensation over the same period-mostly because of the increase in executives being paid with stocks, options, and bonuses. The principal-agent model explains the reason for such compensation instead of a flat salary. Yet hundreds of papers in economics, finance, accounting, and management have reached no consensus on whether executive compensation is efficient or whether empirically it conforms to the prediction of the principal-agent theory. In this article, we argue that this lack of consensus is due to two issues: The first is a measurement issue, and the second is that the exact prediction of the principal-agent model depends on many objects unobservable to the econometrician. We illustrate how using theory-based estimation together with a model-motivated measure of total compensation can help overcome these issues. Finally, using a model-consistent measure of compensation and theory-based estimation, we conclude that executive compensation broadly conforms to the principal-agent theory; however, each situation and the variables used have to be carefully modeled, identified, and estimated.","[Gayle, George-Levi] Washington Univ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Gayle, George-Levi] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA; [Li, Chen] CUNY, Baruch Coll, Zicklin Sch Business, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Miller, Robert A.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Tepper Sch Business, Econ & Stat, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Washington University (WUSTL); Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Baruch College (CUNY); Carnegie Mellon University,"Gayle, GL (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.;Gayle, GL (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA.",,,,,,,,27,4,11,0,6,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

Moreover, we show that thanks to the KORUS-FTA, U.S. suppliers have gained significant welfare and trade value, which is particularly important for industries suffering from a shrinking domestic market.","[Heng, Yan; House, Lisa A.] Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, POB 110240, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Heng, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, POB 110240, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",yheng@ufl.edu,", Yan/Y-1828-2018; House, Lisa/V-5724-2017",", Yan/0000-0002-6337-8209; House, Lisa/0000-0002-1901-6550",Florida Department of Citrus,Florida Department of Citrus,We would like to thank Dr Andrew Muhammad in the Institute of Agriculture at University of Tennessee for sharing his expertise and two anonymous referees for their suggestions on earlier versions of the paper.

One significant impact of public subsidies may be identified in case of changing scope of private giving. There are robust evidence on the effects of public funding on nonprofit revenues, however, studies on crowding-out/in present inconsistent results. The results are strongly shaped by the research methods that are used. Although economic experts have striven to empirically test crowding theories, there is no comprehensive research of this type within the Czech Republic. The objective of this paper is to use a regression model to test whether government funding in the Czech Republic encourages or discourages private gifts. Our results demonstrate a crowding-out effect for public resources but not for other types of financing sources, such as revenues from the organization's own activity and commercial revenues. Answering these questions can contribute to the current knowledge and may have a real impact on both non-profit organisations and government representatives who make decisions about aid.","[Hladka, Marie; Hyanek, Vladimir] Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Publ Econ, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Hladká, M (通讯作者)，Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Publ Econ, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",Marie.Hladka@econ.muni.cz; hyanek@econ.muni.cz,"Hyánek, Vladimír/IYS-2069-2023; Hladka, Marie/T-4555-2019; Hladka, Marie/G-5687-2019",,,,,,34,1,1,1,5,OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE,PRAGUE 3,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2283-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,32,39,,,,,,8,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL8FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000456200200005,0

The ratios used in the profitability measurement are Return on Sales (ROS), Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE). The capital structure is characterised by the total debt ratio (DR) and long-term debt ratio (LDR). The method of the empirical study is panel analysis of data from financial statements of 372 companies listed in Warsaw in the years 1998 - 2016. As control variables, the size of the company and the rate of its growth were assumed. The results of the study indicate that the impact of the total debt share in the capital structure on profitability is negative. On the other hand, the dependence between profitability and long-term debt is positive. In addition, it has been found out that a greater size of a company results in higher profitability. A similar relationship is observed for the company growth rate. The limitations of the research are: a time-limited and number-limited research sample and lack of consideration in the study of external conditions (e.g. the general economic situation, the industry, internationalisation etc.).","[Jaworski, Jacek] WSB Univ Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland; [Czerwonka, Leszek] Univ Gdansk, Fac Econ, Gdansk, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; University of Gdansk,"Jaworski, J (通讯作者)，WSB Univ Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.",,"Jaworski, Jacek/AAK-7010-2021; Jaworski, Jacek/AFS-4868-2022; Czerwonka, Leszek/AAD-6013-2021","Jaworski, Jacek/0000-0002-6629-3497; Czerwonka, Leszek/0000-0002-8438-6443",,,,,34,0,0,1,12,INTL INST SOCIAL & ECONOMIC SCI,PRAGUE,"TREBESOVSKA 2038/14, PRAGUE, 193 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",2336-6044,,978-80-87927-53-3,PROC ECON FINAN CONF,,,2018,,,,,,,90,100,,10.20472/EFC.2018.009.007,0.0,,,11,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2CN,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000505163200007,0

I find cross-sectional evidence that the positive innovation outputs of customer firms increase their supplier profitability as measured by firm ROE. This result is robust to the inclusion of industry fixed effect, a control for both supplier and customer characteristics, such as ROE, advertisement expenditure, capital expenditure, firm age, industry concentration, institutional ownership, dividend yield, and a control for industry spillover or geographical spillover. To identify the causal effect of customer innovation outputs on supplier performance, I study an exogenous shock-State Street Bank and Trust Company v. Signature Financial Group, Inc.-and find that an increase in granted customer patents causes an improvement in future supplier performance. This effect is mainly driven by the demand channel and the knowledge diffusion channel from customers to suppliers. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We predict the characteristics of the future earthquakes in the Tianshui earthquake core area by considering the number and area of theasperity. Conclusions: the prediction results of the 4 asperities source models can basically reflect the destructionintensity of the Ms8.0 earthquake. The intensity of the source model of the double asperities is basically equal to the strength of the Wenchuan earthquake while the PGA of the three asperities is higher 0.5 than the Wenchuan earthquake. This anomaly is also possible. For example, the Lushan earthquake, the magnitude is Ms7.0withmaximum PGA is almost 1.0g. Under special site conditions, when the magnitude reaches a certain level, it is very likely that there will be a large peak acceleration and even a small magnitude acceleration.","[Li, Zongchao; Gao, Mengtan; Chen, Xueliang; Qiao, Sen; Wu, Jian] China Earthquake Adm, Inst Geophys, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",China Earthquake Administration,"Li, ZC (通讯作者)，China Earthquake Adm, Inst Geophys, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",,"Li, Zongchao/AAQ-2010-2021",,"Institute of Geophysics, China Earthquake Administration [DQJB18B20, DQJB17C08]; Earthquake Emergency Junior Key Found of CEA [CEA_EDEM -201816]","Institute of Geophysics, China Earthquake Administration; Earthquake Emergency Junior Key Found of CEA","This study was supported by the special fund of the Institute of Geophysics, China Earthquake Administration (Grant Number: DQJB18B20; DQJB17C08) and Earthquake Emergency Junior Key Found of CEA (CEA_EDEM -201816).",,1,1,1,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-574-0,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,66.0,,,,,,109,115,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1SI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448284700018,0

All accruals must ultimately reverse, but those reversals have different effects on earnings persistence. Management may communicate the private information by different kinds of accruals. Therefore, auditors that have inside information should be able to identify managers who use their reporting discretion accruals to signal private information to investors. Our results suggest that normal audit fees reflect audit effort to identify different kinds of accruals reversal, but positive abnormal audit fees impair audit quality.","[Lin, Fang-Chi] Tamkang Univ, Dept Accounting, New Taipei, Taiwan; [Lin, Yu-Cheng] Natl Kaohsiung Univ Appl Sci, Dept Accounting, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Chen, Chieh-Shuo] Natl Changhua Univ Educ, Dept Accounting, Changhua, Taiwan",Tamkang University; National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology; National Changhua University of Education,"Lin, YC (通讯作者)，Natl Kaohsiung Univ Appl Sci, Dept Accounting, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",linyc@gm.kuas.edu.tw,,"Lin, Yu-Cheng/0000-0002-7008-0961",,,,,39,3,4,5,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

While consumers, mostly in developed countries, are willing to pay significant premiums for the certification of such standards, it is not well understood how effectively these incentives are transmitted to producing countries. We study VSS-more in particular Fair Trade and Organic certification-in Ethiopia's coffee sector, the country's most important export commodity, using a unique census of transaction data at the export level and large-scale data at the production level. We find that transmission of export quality premiums to coffee producers is limited, with only less than one-third of this premium being passed on, and we find limited evidence of effects due to communal investments. Moreover, as quality premiums are small and average production levels in these settings are low, we estimate that these premiums would only lead to an increased income for coffee farmers of 22 USD per year even with a perfect transmission scenario, and therefore would have little impact on the welfare of the average coffee farmer. Given that the VSS studied are characterized by the highest premiums among VSS schemes, it can be assumed that even lower benefits from other VSS certification schemes trickle down to producers.

Johansen co-integration test results suggest the existence of the long-run equilibrium relationship between variables. Existence of the co-integration relationship indicates that capital, labor, and government expenditure on education are long-run determinants of GDP for the case of France. Granger causality test results suggest that there is a bidirectional long-run causality between GDP and gross capital formation. In addition, there are long-run unidirectional causalities which run from labor and expenditure on education to GDP and from labor and expenditure to capital. Results of the study suggest the existence of education-induced economic growth for the case of France.","[Ozatac, Nesrin; Taspinar, Nigar; El Rifai, Oubayda; Eren, Baris] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Via Mersin 10, Famagusta, North Cyprus, Turkey",Eastern Mediterranean University,"Taspinar, N (通讯作者)，Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Via Mersin 10, Famagusta, North Cyprus, Turkey.",nesrin.ozatac@emu.edu.tr; nigar.taspinar@emu.edu.tr; oubayda_rifai@yahoo.com; baris.eren@emu.edu.tr,"Eren, Baris Memduh/AAB-6863-2022; rifai, oubayda el/AAD-6613-2020; Taspinar, Nigar/D-5198-2017","Taspinar, Nigar/0000-0003-3012-4920",,,,,29,4,4,1,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-68762-9; 978-3-319-68761-2,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,61,70,,10.1007/978-3-319-68762-9_7,0.0,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL3UH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450036900007,0

The dysfunctions induced in the socio-economic structures after 1990 led to a strong fragmentation and isolation of most agricultural holdings. At the same time, for many management reasons, the agronomic research in Romania, i.e. lost touch with the mass of agricultural producers. Thus, the cooperation that should have occurred between most agricultural holdings and research units not only dwindled to disappearance, but also generated significant losses. In this context, it is appreciated that the return to the functional parameters of the Romanian research may result from: linking the research, as a priority, to the knowledge market; awareness of the fact that yield increases - per hectare or animal head - will still call for scientific and technical progress; taking the example of foreign, large-scale suppliers of progress factors, which cooperate with farmers in the most diverse forms; studying, assessing and enhancing the vectors of operationalization in the knowledge market, connecting producers and consumers of information; the involvement of information producers, research, the more active dissemination of their results, etc.","[Popescu, Gabriel] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Popescu, G (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",popescug2004@yahoo.co.uk,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,1,"INST AGRICULTURAL & FOOD ECONOMICS, NATIONAL RESEARCH INST-IAFE-NRI",WARSZAWA,"UL.

The country is consistently among the bottom three performers in respect of these indicators, lagging behind its neighbours in the Baltic Sea region. The authors demonstrate what specific elements of Latvian pension system make it an inappropriate instrument in poverty alleviation. In the absence of redistribution mechanisms in mandatory NDC and FDC pension pillars accompanied by relatively high tax burden on pensions, the only systemic element aimed at alleviation of poverty in the old age is the statutory minimum pension, which is not equal to the task. Delay with the introduction of the minimal income level (proclaimed in 2014) and termination of subsistence minimum calculation since 2014 have also contributed to the deterioration of the situation of the receivers of small amount pensions. Since fundamental changes in mandatory pension pillars (I and II) are hardly practicable, the solution may be found in development of the so called pillar 0 (social assistance) and pillar IV (housing programs, healthcare programs, other formal and informal forms of financial and non-financial support to the elderly), which are also drastically underdeveloped in Latvia.","[Rajevska, Olga] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia; [Rajevska, Feliciana] Vidzeme Univ Appl Sci, Valmiera, Latvia",University of Latvia; Vidzeme University of Applied Sciences,"Rajevska, O (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",olga.rajevska@lu.lv; feliciana.rajevska@va.lv,"Rajevska, Olga/I-1390-2016",,Post-Doc Latvia Project [1.1.1.2/VIAA/1/16/056]; National Research Programme [5.2.6 EKOSOC-LV],Post-Doc Latvia Project; National Research Programme,This paper has been prepared with the support from the Post-Doc Latvia Project No. 1.1.1.2/VIAA/1/16/056 and the National Research Programme 5.2.6 EKOSOC-LV.,,21,1,1,0,2,LODZ UNIV TECHNOLOGY PR,LODZ,"BIBLIOTEKA POLITECHNIKI LODZKIEJ-BUDYNEK B22, UL WOLCZANSKA 223, LODZ, 90-924, POLAND",,,978-83-7283-900-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,233,242,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9BP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470276200021,0

Using a social psychology approach, we develop a theoretical model in which different forms of perceived corruption can adversely influence the way individual taxpayers behave. We then apply this model to Indonesia, placing our empirical findings in the context of compliance risk management, identifying strategies to improve tax compliance, and exploring how to implement these strategies effectively. We shed light on the applicability of the traditional responsive regulatory approach (used by revenue authorities to deal with intentionally non-compliant taxpayers), which combines measures in attempting to achieve either voluntary or enforced compliance. While the empirical evidence is based on the Indonesian experience, we suggest that our model is sufficiently general and robust to be applicable to other developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region.","[Rosid, Arifin] Minist Finance Republ Indonesia, Directorate Gen Taxat, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Evans, Chris] Univ Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa; [Evans, Chris; Binh Tran-Nam] UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Binh Tran-Nam] RMIT Univ Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Ministry of Finance of Republic of Indonesia; University of Pretoria; University of New South Wales Sydney; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Rosid, A (通讯作者)，Minist Finance Republ Indonesia, Directorate Gen Taxat, Jakarta, Indonesia.",,"Evans, Christopher Charles/J-9165-2012; Rosid, Arifin/JFJ-7645-2023; Tran-Nam, Binh/K-8001-2017","Evans, Christopher Charles/0000-0002-2978-4772; Rosid, Arifin/0000-0002-0304-1575; Tran-Nam, Binh/0000-0001-5516-7762",,,,,76,11,12,0,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

DAB shows how changes in the profitability of a sector affect the profitability of a company in that sector. DAB can also be applied to whole market. Empirical evidence is presented using the data from companies listed in the Polish construction sector of the Warsaw Stock Exchange. The analysis concludes that there are significant similarities between market betas and accounting betas. It also demonstrates that accounting betas using Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Sales (ROS) are positively correlated with market betas and that there is a significant correlation between accounting betas with variance and semi-variance approaches. In addition, the paper identifies that the systematic risk on the Warsaw Stock Exchange is connected with the sensitivity of the company's profitability of assets (ROA) and sales (ROS) in comparison with profitability for the whole sector. The practical implication of this research is that investors, owners and managers can apply DAB using ROA to calculate the systematic risk of companies that are not listed on stock markets and consequently to identify the levels of risk associated with companies within the sector.","[Rutkowska-Ziarko, Anna] Univ Warmia & Mazury, Olsztyn, Poland; [Pyke, Christopher] Lancashire Sch Business & Enterprise, Preston, Lancs, England",University of Warmia & Mazury,"Rutkowska-Ziarko, A (通讯作者)，Univ Warmia & Mazury, Olsztyn, Poland.",aniarek@uwm.edu.pl; CPyke2@uclan.ac.uk,"Rutkowska-Ziarko, Anna/AAN-3632-2021","Rutkowska-Ziarko, Anna/0000-0001-6073-3386",,,,,20,5,5,0,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-76228-9; 978-3-319-76227-2,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,81,87,,10.1007/978-3-319-76228-9_8,0.0,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1UI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448435600008,0

From several literature studies that have been done by many economists only see the effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policy on output alone. No authors find the effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policy on prices. Though macroeconomic variables are not only output but there are many other macroeconomic variables. One such macroeconomic variable is price. The data in this study is in the form of time series from 1970-2015. Fiscal policy uses data of real government expenditure, monetary policy uses real money supply data, output use real GDP data, and prices using Consumer Price Index data (CPI). Data analysis techniques use Vector Auto Regressive (VAR), Impulse Response Function (IRF) and Forecast Error Variance Decomposition (FEVD). A policy is said to be effective if the FEVD method shocks one policy against output variability and the price is greatest compared to other policies. The conclusions of this study indicate that Fiscal Policy is more effective against output and prices in Indonesia compared to Monetary Policy. The effectiveness of Fiscal Policy compared to Monetary Policy can be seen from the contribution of shock Fiscal Policy to the variability of output and prices greater than Monetary Policy. Based on these conclusions, it is suggested to the government through the relevant ministries and Bank Indonesia always maintains the interaction and synergy between Fiscal Policy and monetary to macroeconomic variables.","[Satrianto, Alpon] Univ Negeri Padang, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Padang, Indonesia",Universitas Negeri Padang,"Satrianto, A (通讯作者)，Univ Negeri Padang, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Padang, Indonesia.",alpon.unp@gmail.com,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-581-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,57.0,,,,,,459,467,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM7OX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000468271400059,0

His thoughts were back to the challenges that his father had faced, including the investments on an integrated production system that contributed to the family's business growth. The production of cattle, sugarcane, and corn are all part of this integration system that has helped the Campanelli family to develop a successful business model. Currently, AgroPastoril Campanelli has three main production activities: beef, sugarcane, and corn. With these activities, a sustainable circle was created to guarantee more efficiency in economic, environmental and social terms. As Victor Campanelli says, 'there is a perfect synergy between sugarcane, moisture, corn, and cattle. Not just because of the better land and labor use, but also because of the inputs economy and the productivity improvement, both in agriculture and livestock'. However, the present time requires a new investment cycle, leading the whole family to consider new market opportunities, especially regarding farmer's new demands. What should we do and where should we invest? Should we improve efficiency or open new areas? Should we invest in new agriculture enterprises or start new business outside agricultural market? Those and other crucial questions were posed by Victor Campanelli thinking on potential growth strategies for AgroPastoril Campanelli.","[Scare, Roberto Fava; Farinha, Rodrigo Lourenco; Neves, Marcos Fava] Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Econ Business & Accounting Ribeirao Preto FEA, Av Bandeirantes 3900, BR-14020590 Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil; [Gray, Allan Wayne; Fullerton, Erin Chelsea] Univ Purdue, Agr Econ, 403 West State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Farinha, RL (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Econ Business & Accounting Ribeirao Preto FEA, Av Bandeirantes 3900, BR-14020590 Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.",rlfarinha@usp.br,"Neves, Marcos/J-8190-2012","Neves, Marcos/0000-0002-5693-7543",,,,,7,2,2,0,14,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

The aim of the article is to indicate periods of restrictive and expansionary monetary, fiscal and economic policy in the euro area in the context of policymix coordination. In the literature on the subject, research on equilibrium in the fiscal and monetary game was conducted, taking into account the priorities of the central bank and the government. Therefore, assuming that the central bank aims to minimize inflation and the government tries to maximize economic growth depending, among other things, on the budget deficit, it was shown in the literature that economic authorities according to the dominant strategies may choose restrictive monetary and expansionary fiscal policies (and vice versa) or both restrictive policies. Hence, this study highlights the context of monetary and fiscal game in relation to the direction (restrictiveness or expansiveness) of both policies. The study covered the years 1999-2017. To achieve the article's objective the following research methods were used: presentation of statistical data and the presentation of the methodology behind the classification of the periods (restrictive/expansionary) and discussion of the results. We note that the character of monetary and fiscal policy plays a significant role in the economies. In the studied period, it was rather the fiscal policy that was the dominant option of economic policy. We note that during the economic slowdown (2001-2002), the financial crisis (2008-2009) and as a consequence - the crisis of public finances in the euro area (2010-2011) dominated the expansionary fiscal policy against the restrictive monetary policy. In turn, in the years 2015-2017, the expansionary monetary policy dominated against the restrictive fiscal policy, which could have a positive impact on GDP growth.","[Stawska, Joanna] Univ Lodz, Lodz, Poland; [Mourao, Paulo Reis] Univ Minho, Braga, Portugal",University of Lodz; Universidade do Minho,"Stawska, J (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Lodz, Poland.",joanna.stawska@uni.lodz.pl; paulom@eeg.uminho.pt,"Stawska, Joanna Maria/AAD-1803-2019; Mourao, Paulo/D-9619-2011","Stawska, Joanna Maria/0000-0001-6863-1210; Mourao, Paulo/0000-0001-6046-645X",National Science Centre Poland; European Union [UMO-2017/26/D/HS4/00954],"National Science Centre Poland(National Science Centre, Poland); European Union(European Union (EU))","The study was financed from the funds of the National Science Centre Poland in the period between 2018-2021 - the research project called The coordination of the monetary and fiscal policies in the studies of the monetary -fiscal interactions based on the game theory - the case of the European Union countries, contract number: UMO-2017/26/D/HS4/00954.",,27,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,156,166,,,,,,11,Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BM5GU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000464906000016,0

Among many, one of the World Bank's recipes to achieve a higher position toward MDGs has been to undertake reforms for a better governance. While, the majority of researches' focus has been on one single aspect and its relationship with the environment, some studies, have simultaneously considered two governance dimensions. In this paper, we focus on the role of several aspects of governance on emissions. This provides us with a chance to explore the possible impacts of all aspects of governance on a more direct measure of emissions, that is different to previous researches which have focused on the indirect transmission and considered the maximum of two. Using the IV method within panel data analysis, we show that only one single aspect of governance, Control of Corruption, has a negative significant effect on emissions and its effect has a non-linear relationship. The non-linearity exists in both parametric and nonparametric analysis after controlling for endogeneity.","[Tarverdi, Yashar] Curtin Univ, Curtin Business Sch, Bankwest Curtin Econ Ctr, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia",Curtin University,"Tarverdi, Y (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ, Curtin Business Sch, Bankwest Curtin Econ Ctr, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",yashar.tarverdi@curtin.edu.au,,"Tarverdi, Yashar/0000-0003-4490-9008",,,,,77,19,19,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The green building residential area project controls the incremental construction through optimized design. The goal of low building operation energy consumption under ideal condition is achieved with low construction cost increment. Under the premise of ensuring good living comfort, the resources and energy consumption in the whole life cycle of the building are reduced, and the short-term recovery of the green building cost increment is realized. The box cover method is used to solve the cost distribution probability, and the cost is quantified. The special properties of building materials are described effectively, and the utilization of new green environmental protection building materials is studied combined with the cost analysis results. The actual situation of different ecological landscape space planning in different cost areas is described. The influence of the cost of different building materials is reflected, thus obtaining the binding influence relationship between building materials and cost.","[Wan, Keshu] Shandong Jianzhu Univ, Sch Management Engn, Jinan 250101, Shandong, Peoples R China",Shandong Jianzhu University,"Wan, KS (通讯作者)，Shandong Jianzhu Univ, Sch Management Engn, Jinan 250101, Shandong, Peoples R China.",wanksh@163.com,,,,,,,10,0,0,1,16,FRANCIS ACAD PRESS,LONDON,"35 IVOR PL, LOWER GROUND, LONDON, NW1 6EA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-912407-05-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,532,537,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL4HW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450396400115,0

Wines of Brasil - a Brazilian wineries network - was established in 2002 and remains active, while Vitrocristal (VtC) - a Portuguese network of glass producers - was established in 1994 and is already closed. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from 14 interviews, with network managers and representatives of companies with different sizes and participation times. Information obtained was compared with the life cycle model of Wegner et al. (2015) and enabled the authors to understand the dynamic development of each network and its current stage in the life cycle. Findings - The results allowed the authors to describe the development pattern of both business networks, showing that the Brazilian network is in the consolidation stage while the Portuguese one finished its activities in 2007 after a period of financial constraints due to the end of governmental support. Practical implications - The comparison of the two cases shows that the experience of the Portuguese business network may be useful for networks in emerging markets, as it displays several difficulties that the management of such networks may face during their life cycle. Originality/value - This study provides a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the dynamics of change in business networks. The cases confirm the life cycle stages proposed by Wegner et al. (2015) and shed more light on the development process of business networks, by describing how exogenous variables such as public support may affect cooperation.","[Wegner, Douglas] Unisinos Univ, Sch Business, Sao Leopoldo, Brazil; [Costa e Silva, Susana] Univ Catolica Portuguesa, Ctr Reg Porto, Dept Management & Strategy, Porto, Portugal; [De Rossi, Greice] Federacao Ind Estado Rio Grande do Sul, Euvaldo Lodi Inst IEL RS, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos (Unisinos); Universidade Catolica Portuguesa,"Wegner, D (通讯作者)，Unisinos Univ, Sch Business, Sao Leopoldo, Brazil.",dwegner@unisinos.br,"Silva, Susana/JMC-1783-2023; Silva, Susana C./E-2200-2014; Wegner, Douglas/O-2555-2015; Silva, Susana C./GQA-4346-2022","Silva, Susana C./0000-0001-7979-3944; Wegner, Douglas/0000-0001-8634-5971; Silva, Susana C./0000-0001-7979-3944",,,,,91,9,10,2,20,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Research findings show that Xiamen is able to cope with conventional flooding disasters in a rational way, but it is still at high risks in the face of extreme weather situations. Conventional idea of engineering disaster prevention fails to improve and sustain the city's ability to respond to disasters, which requires a transformation to conceptualize disaster prevention in the way of urban resilience.

Although risk preferences are likely important, existing research is silent about how social and risk preferences interact in such situations. In this paper we provide experimental evidence on this question. In a first experiment givers are not exposed to risk while beneficiaries' final earnings may be larger or smaller than the allocation itself, depending on the realized state of the world. In a second experiment, risk affects the earnings of givers but not of beneficiaries. We find that individuals' risk preferences are predictive for giving in both experiments. Increased risk exposure of beneficiaries tends to decrease giving whereas increased risk exposure of givers has no effect. We propose a simple non-linear generalization of a model allowing for other-regarding preferences, ex-post and ex-ante fairness, and risk aversion.

We employ for the first time a stochastic dominance efficiency (SDE) approach to construct optimal portfolios with and without commodities and we evaluate their comparative performance. SDE circumvents the necessity to posit a specific utility function to describe investor's preferences and it does not impose distributional assumptions on asset returns. We find that commodities provide diversification benefits both in- and out-of-sample. This evidence is stronger when commodity indices which mimic dynamic commodity trading, strategies are used. We explain our results by documenting that commodity markets are segmented from the equity and bond markets. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The supermajority requirement of treaty ratification in the US Senate also is blamed for allowing a minority of isolationists to block the will of the majority that supported the treaty. To determine the cause of the failure, I analyze the Senate debate over the treaty using the concepts of the supermajority core and supermajority winset. Using all 157 votes on the treaty, I estimate senatorial positions and the locations of both the status quo and the treaty on the same metric space. From this analysis, I find that isolationists were not influential enough to block the ratification. Instead, President Wilson's unwillingness to compromise is found to have played a critical role in the treaty's defeat. The treaty's defeat thus was not an indication of the power of isolationism. This study contributes to the growing body of literature that debunks claims about the dominance of isolationism in the interwar period. At the same time, the paper demonstrates how the core and winset concepts can be useful in answering substantive collective choice questions.","[Jeong, Gyung-Ho] Univ British Columbia, Dept Polit Sci, C425-1866 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Jeong, GH (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Dept Polit Sci, C425-1866 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada.",gyung-ho.jeong@ubc.ca,"Jeong, Gyung-Ho/JDV-6992-2023","Jeong, Gyung-Ho/0000-0002-7476-3241",,,,,34,0,1,3,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,DEC,2017,173.0,3-4,,,,,325,343,,10.1007/s11127-017-0481-5,0.0,,,19,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,FM2EY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000414798900005,0

Following studies of economic insecurity, we placed households at the center of our analysis to highlight the interconnected nature of wealth with multiple aspects of family structure. We investigated net worth by both gender and household structure, which includes variation by partnership status and the presence of other adult relatives and their roles within the household. We found that wealth disparities were largest among single adult households, but these varied by gender. Female single adult households held some of the lowest levels of net worth, but after accounting for key explanations of wealth inequality, single male households actually held greater wealth than two-adult partnered households. This relationship further depended on the presence of extended family members, where gender disparities were smaller among households with other relatives present.","[Maroto, Michelle; Aylsworth, Laura] Univ Alberta, Dept Sociol, 6-23 Tory Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H4, Canada",University of Alberta,"Maroto, M (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Sociol, 6-23 Tory Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H4, Canada.",maroto@ualberta.ca; laura.aylsworth@ualberta.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) Insight Development Grant [430-2014-00092],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) Insight Development Grant,This research was partially supported by a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) Insight Development Grant (#430-2014-00092).,,81,10,12,0,14,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

Using a discrete choice model and a data base that has not previously been exploited to study this problem, we investigate the effects of variations in electricity costs on the intensive and extensive re-location decisions of European firms. We find that electricity costs play a significant role in determining relocation destinations. This effect is asymmetric between firms moving into and out of a country, and between high and low energy intensity sectors. The findings of the paper have implications for the Pollution Havens Hypothesis, since they show the extent to which the effects of climate policy on domestic electricity costs can be expected to impact on firm relocation decisions both into and out of a country.","[Panhans, Matthew] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Lavric, Lucia] Encompass Econ, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Hanley, Nick] Univ St Andrews, Dept Geog & Sustainable Dev, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland",Duke University; University of St Andrews,"Hanley, N (通讯作者)，Univ St Andrews, Dept Geog & Sustainable Dev, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland.",matthew.panhans@duke.edu; lucia@encompassecon.com; ndh3@st-andrews.ac.uk,"Hanley, Nick/C-1759-2012","Hanley, Nick/0000-0002-1362-3499",,,,,39,8,9,1,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Little is known to which extent mergers of county-sized local governments reduce expenditures, and influence political outcomes. I use the synthetic control method to identify the effect of mergers of large local governments in Germany (districts) on public expenditures. In 2008, the German state of Saxony reduced the number of districts from 22 to 10. Average district population increased substantially from 113,000 to 290,000 inhabitants. I construct a synthetic counterfactual from states that did not merge districts for years. The results do neither show reductions in total expenditures, nor in expenditures for administration, education, and social care. There seems to be no scale effects in jurisdictions of more than 100,000 inhabitants. By contrast, I find evidence that mergers decreased the number of candidates and voter turnout in district elections while vote shares for populist right-wing parties increased.","[Roesel, Felix] Ifo Inst, Dresden Branch, Einsteinstr 3, D-01069 Dresden, Germany",Ifo Institut,"Roesel, F (通讯作者)，Ifo Inst, Dresden Branch, Einsteinstr 3, D-01069 Dresden, Germany.",roesel@ifo.de,,"Roesel, Felix/0000-0003-3260-0572",,,,,56,51,51,1,41,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

To fill this gap in the literature, in this article, we focus on how combinations of internal resources affect the survival chance of technology-based start-ups by using a unique dataset from a high-tech park in Beijing, China. Empirical results show that firms' interconnected internal resources exert a significant influence on these firms' survival chance. Our findings imply that the survival of new technology-based start-ups benefits from the synergetic effect of combining resources. In detail, the data support the hypothesis that the combined use of R&D resources, internal financial resources, and scientifically skilled employees, as posited by the RBV, has an amplifying effect on the chances to survive of high-tech start-ups.","[Yang, Chun; Bossink, Bart] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Sect Sci Business & Innovat, Fac Sci, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Yang, Chun] Tsinghua Univ, Inst Sci Technol & Soc, Sch Social Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Peverelli, Peter] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Business Res Inst, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tsinghua University; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Yang, C (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Sect Sci Business & Innovat, Fac Sci, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",yangchun09@gmail.com; b.a.g.bossink@vu.nl; p.j.peverelli@vu.nl,,"Peverelli, Peter/0000-0002-7246-2250; Bossink, Bart/0000-0001-9809-5121",,,,,88,26,30,3,52,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

This paper broadens the scope of empirical analysis, studying a wide range of products sold on a national online market. Using an algorithm that extracts data from charts, I obtain a novel source of data from online price trackers. I examine prices of goods sold on Amazon before and after two big-box stores (Target and Best Buy) announced a guarantee to match Amazon's prices. Employing both difference-in-difference and regression-discontinuity approaches, I robustly estimate a positive causal effect of six percentage points. The effect was heterogeneous, with larger price increases for initially lower-priced items. My results support anticompetitive theories which predict price increases for Amazon, a firm that did not adopt the guarantee, and are consistent with plausible mechanisms for the heterogeneous impact.","[Zhuo, Ran] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Littauer Ctr Publ Adm, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Zhuo, R (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Littauer Ctr Publ Adm, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",rzhuo@g.harvard.edu,,,,,,,25,3,3,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1821,1467-6451,,J IND ECON,J.

Food consumption will shape and be shaped by global change through interactions with bioenergy and afforestation, two critical issues in meeting international goals. We develop a model of food demand for staple and nonstaple commodities that evolves with changing incomes and prices. The model addresses a long-standing issue in estimating food demands, the evolution of demand relationships across large changes in income and prices. We discuss the model, some of its properties and limitations. We estimate parameter values using pooled cross-sectional-time-series observations and Bayesian Monte Carlo method and cross-validate the model by estimating parameters using a subset of the observations and test its ability to project into the unused observations. Finally, we apply bias correction techniques borrowed from the Earth system modeling community and report results. We find that the demand for food rises rapidly as income initially increases from zero. Demand for staples peaks at under $1000 per person per capita. Nonstaple food demands increase steadily with income. While staples are an inferior good at per capita incomes greater than $1000, we see no evidence that there is a range of per capita income for which staples are Giffen goods.","[Edmonds, James A.; Link, Robert; Waldhoff, Stephanie T.; Cui, Ryna] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Joint Global Change Res Inst, 5825 Univ Res Court,Suite 3500, College Pk, MD 20740 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory,"Edmonds, JA (通讯作者)，Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Joint Global Change Res Inst, 5825 Univ Res Court,Suite 3500, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.",,,"Cui, Ryna/0000-0002-1186-8230",Office of Science of the US Department of Energy through the Integrated Assessment Research Program; DOE [DE-AC05-76RL01830],Office of Science of the US Department of Energy through the Integrated Assessment Research Program; DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),This research was supported by the Office of Science of the US Department of Energy through the Integrated Assessment Research Program.

Several studies analyzed whether such standards deliver on their promise to improve the livelihoods of poor farmers, with mixed results. Here, we ask whether the design of standards could be improved such that farm households benefit more. An assessment of what particular features of standards hamper or facilitate participation requires a better understanding of farmers' preferences. Our contribution is twofold: First, based on a choice experiment we analyze how farmers evaluate actual and hypothetical features of standards. Data were collected from small-scale coffee producers in Uganda. Second, this is the first quantitative study on standards employing a gendered research design. A gender focus is important, because coffee and other certified export crops are often controlled by men. The choice experiment included features of standards aimed at reducing gender inequality and was conducted separately with male and female members of farm households. Results indicate that farmers have positive attitudes toward sustainability standards in general. While they dislike bans of productivity-enhancing inputs, agricultural training and special female support are appreciated. Many also see requirements that have to be met for certification as a welcome nudge to invest in better farm management and quality upgrading. Female farmers have a higher preference for standards than male farmers. Also within households, significant preference heterogeneity between women and men is found. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The empirical results show that an easing monetary policy can inspire confidence and stimulate economic growth. However, the effectiveness of a positive policy will be undermined if the channel of confidence is removed.

We use the staggered enforcement of insider trading laws across 27 countries as a shock to the source of information that leaves total information unchanged: enforcement reduces (increases) managers' (outsiders') contribution to the stock price. Consistent with the predictions of our theoretical model, enforcement increases investment-q sensitivity, even when controlling for total price informativeness. The effect is larger in industries where learning is likely to be stronger, and in emerging countries where outsider information acquisition rises most post-enforcement. Enforcement does not increase the sensitivity of investment to cash flow, a non-price measure of investment opportunities. These findings suggest that extant measures of price efficiency should be rethought when evaluating real efficiency.

The model comprises two productive sectors: in one sector, firms can finance investments through a bond market. In the other, firms rely on bank credit. Financial frictions limit banks' borrowing capacity. Aggregate shocks impact firms' productivity. From a welfare perspective, banks lend too much in high productivity states and too little in bad states, although financial markets are complete.

Theory suggests that these estimates should be sensitive to geospatial factors including resource scale, market extent, and the availability of substitutes and complements. Valuation meta-regression models addressing the quantity of non-market commodities sometimes incorporate spatial variables that proxy for a subset of these effects. However, meta-analyses of WTP for environmental quality generally omit geospatial factors such as these, leading to benefit transfers that are invariant to these factors. This paper reports on a meta-regression model for water quality benefit transfer that incorporates spatially explicit factors predicted by theory to influence WTP. The metadata are drawn from stated preference studies that estimate per household WTP for water quality changes in United States water bodies, and combine primary study information with extensive geospatial data from external sources. Results find that geospatial variables are associated with significant WTP variations as predicted by theory, and that inclusion of these variables reduces transfer errors.","[Johnston, Robert J.] Clark Univ, George Perkins Marsh Inst, 950 Main St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA; [Johnston, Robert J.] Clark Univ, Dept Econ, 950 Main St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA; [Besedin, Elena Y.] ABT Associates Inc, Environm & Nat Resources Div, Cambridge, MA USA; [Stapler, Ryan] Athenahealth, Watertown, MA USA",Clark University; Clark University; ABT Associates,"Johnston, RJ (通讯作者)，Clark Univ, George Perkins Marsh Inst, 950 Main St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.;Johnston, RJ (通讯作者)，Clark Univ, Dept Econ, 950 Main St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.",rjohnston@clarku.edu; elena_besedin@abtassoc.com; rstapler@athenahealth.com,,"Johnston, Robert/0000-0001-7523-2701",US EPA [EP-C-13-039],US EPA(United States Environmental Protection Agency),The authors acknowledge the assistance of Ann Speers and Anna Belova (Abt Associates) with portions of the analysis.

This paper presents a case study for examining the power of prevailing narratives of decentralized development to shape and ultimately constrain the operations of village seed banks in Telangana, India. This case demonstrates how visions of tradition, community, and self-reliance can serve to discount the materiality of seeds, the social complexity of village institutions, and even the voices of farmers. The goal of this research is not to criticize village seed banks, as they hold great potential, nor to vilify the narratives in question, but rather to encourage critical reflection on how the assumptions embedded in these narratives shape mechanisms for agricultural development. I argue for a shift away from framing tradition, community, and self-reliance as development solutions and propose an interrogative approach that turns these narratives into questions for engaging more effectively with rural livelihoods.

Banks choose the amount and maturity of their debt by trading off investors' preferences for short maturities with the risk of systemic crises. Pecuniary externalities make unregulated debt maturities inefficiently short. In calibrating the model to eurozone banking data for 2006, we find that lengthening the average maturity of wholesale debt from 2.8 to 3.3 months would produce welfare gains with a present value of euro 105 billion, while the lengthening induced by the NSFR would be too drastic.","[Segura, Anatoli] Bank Italy, Rome, Italy; [Suarez, Javier] CEMFI, Casado Alisal 5, Madrid 28014, Spain; [Suarez, Javier] CEPR, Washington, DC USA",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Suarez, J (通讯作者)，CEMFI, Casado Alisal 5, Madrid 28014, Spain.",suarez@cemfi.es,"Suarez, Javier/T-5311-2019","Suarez, Javier/0000-0002-2012-3900","AXA Research Fund; Spanish government [ECO2011-26308, ECO2014-59262]",AXA Research Fund(AXA Research Fund); Spanish government(Spanish Government),"The views expressed in this paper are our own and do not necessarily coincide with those of the Bank of Italy.

Using bank level panel data of more than 1300 commercial banks in 32 emerging economies during 2000-2013, we find that foreign owned banks take on more risk than their domestic counterparts. We further examine several factors that may potentially contribute to foreign banks' differentiated riskiness from four perspectives, namely, foreign banks' informational disadvantages, agency problems, the contagious effect of parent banks' financial conditions and the disparity between home and host markets. We find supportive evidence that these factors play a significant role in affecting foreign banks' risk-taking.

Using panel data covering the 1984-2012 period for more than 100 countries, we find that the effect of corruption on political stability depends on the youth bulge. Corruption is a destabilizing factor for political systems when the share of the youth population in the adult population exceeds a critical level of approximately 20%. The moderating effect of the youth bulge in the stability-corruption nexus is robust, controlling for country and year fixed effects, a set of control variables that may affect internal political stability, an alternative operationalization of the youth bulge, corruption, and a dynamic panel estimation method.","[Farzanegan, Mohammad Reza] Philipps Univ Marburg, Ctr Near & Middle Eastern Studies CNMS, Middle East Res Grp MACIE, Econ, Marburg, Germany; [Farzanegan, Mohammad Reza] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Farzanegan, Mohammad Reza] ERF, Cairo, Egypt; [Witthuhn, Stefan] Berghof Fdn, Tubingen, Germany",Philipps University Marburg; Ifo Institut,"Farzanegan, MR (通讯作者)，CNMS, Middle East Res Grp, Econ, Deutschhausstr 12, D-35032 Marburg, Germany.",farzanegan@uni-marburg.de,"Farzanegan, Mohammad Reza/AFM-2779-2022","Farzanegan, Mohammad Reza/0000-0002-6533-3645",,,,,111,51,55,5,38,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

Previous research has demonstrated an association between top management support (TMS) and IT value. We extend the concept of TMS with the imbrication metaphor to define the construct of TMT-IT imbrication, which allows us to account for a tighter and continuous entwining of the TMT and IT to create IT value. Our definition of the TMT-IT imbrication construct embraces four dimensions: involvement, participation, attention, and use. In addition, with the support of upper echelons (UE) theory, we explore certain managerial traits, competences, and team processes that may be antecedents of this imbrication. As a result, our work provides a variance model and various propositions rooted in the logic of UE that contribute to research on IT business value. (C) AEDEM.

Yet the underlying assumptions can vary in their accuracy among actors and across time and context. We focus on the pivotal politics model of lawmaking and argue that a full evaluation of the theory requires a granular analysis of its two primary components: the filibuster and veto pivots in Congress. We show that both types of pivots contribute to the success of pivotal politics in explaining postwar lawmaking, but that the relevance of each varies based on institution-specific contexts. Specifically, the filibuster pivot has little explanatory power before the 1970s, when norms of filibuster use were quite restrictive, while the veto pivot's explanatory power is limited to situations in which the president has sufficient public backing to be a force in the legislative process.","[Gray, Thomas R.] Univ Texas Dallas, Sch Econ Polit & Policy Sci, 800 West Campbell Rd, Richardson, TX 75080 USA; [Jenkins, Jeffery A.] Univ Southern Calif, Sol Price Sch Publ Policy, 650 Childs Way, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas; University of Southern California,"Gray, TR (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Dallas, Sch Econ Polit & Policy Sci, 800 West Campbell Rd, Richardson, TX 75080 USA.",thomas.gray1@utdallas.edu; jajenkins@usc.edu,,,,,,,18,2,2,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,SEP,2017,172.0,3-4,,,,,359,376,,10.1007/s11127-017-0450-z,0.0,,,18,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,FD8CQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000407753200004,0

We introduce country-specific institutional characteristics related to institutional quality, R&D infrastructure and training and test whether these variations change the effect of R&D intensity on firm value. Moreover, we calculate the marginal effect of R&D intensity on firm value for high and low-income countries separately, based on different degrees of competition. Our findings suggest that in developing countries the positive effect of R&D intensity on the market valuation of a firm exists primarily for firms in less competitive industries. In developed countries, however, the positive effect of R&D intensity on Tobin's Q is evident for all competition levels. The results are empirically robust after controlling for potential endogeneity and employing alternative country-level attributes.

We survey published empirical manuscripts to show that this issue is prevalent across various fields. We also prove that the bias in IV estimates, generated by divergences of the sample from population T/UT ratio, is a monotonic function of the difference between the sample and population T/UT ratios when the above conditions (1 and 2) are met.

We theoretically show that candidates' electoral promises about a free trade agreement are related to the economic interests of their districts, the types of constituency systems under which they compete with one another, and their ideologies. We empirically confirm the theoretical expectations, using as a case study the 2012 general election in Japan, where whether to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) talks was one of the biggest issues. The TPP tends to be opposed by voters working in the agricultural sector and those living in districts with a larger amount of cultivated land, whereas it tends to be supported by college-educated voters and those living in districts with more export manufacturers. Accordingly, candidates tend to oppose (support) the TPP when their districts have a larger stake in agriculture (export manufacturers) and a smaller (larger) number of college-educated voters. Further, proportional representation candidates are more supportive of the TPP; likewise, candidates and voters who prefer a small government and who emphasize the Japan-United States relationship tend to support the TPP.

However, little is known about the average impact of these titling processes on the well-being of these communities. In this paper we attempt to estimate the impact of collective land titling in territories inhabited by Afro-descendent communities in Colombia. We compare rural districts in titled areas with rural districts in untitled areas that are similar in all the relevant observable characteristics. We find that the collective titling process in the Choco region has caused an increase in average household per capita income, a decrease in extreme poverty, larger investments in housing, higher attendance rates among children in primary education, and a decrease in housing overcrowding. Our results suggest that collective land titling creates a more secure natural resource base and a longer time horizon for households in collective territories, which leads to investment in their private physical and human capital.","[Pena, Ximena; Camilo Cardenas, Juan; Matajira, Camilo] Univ Los Andes, Fac Econ, Bogota, Colombia; [Alejandra Velez, Maria] Univ Los Andes, Fac Adm, Bogota, Colombia; [Perdomo, Natalia] Prosperidad Social, Bogota, Colombia",Universidad de los Andes (Colombia); Universidad de los Andes (Colombia),"Peña, X (通讯作者)，Univ Los Andes, Fac Econ, Bogota, Colombia.",,"cardenas, juan-camilo/B-4658-2009","cardenas, juan-camilo/0000-0003-0005-7595",,,,,55,18,21,3,36,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0305-750X,,,WORLD DEV,World Dev.,SEP,2017,97.0,,,,,,27,48,,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.03.025,0.0,,,22,Development Studies; Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Development Studies; Business & Economics,EY4YS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000403984800003,0

With a sufficiently high conversion ratio, issuing CoCos can alleviate and even eliminate the inefficiencies arising from debt overhang and asset substitution.

While most studies focus on trade effects and organizational outcomes, very few studies look at the effect of standards on employees. Using a three-year matched employer employee panel dataset, this paper finds that the application of management standards improves working conditions in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Vietnam. Certified firms pay higher wages on average, implying that the adoption of standards could boost labor productivity. They are also more likely to offer formal contracts, illustrating that benefits from standards also have non-monetary aspects. These effects come from higher investment in employee training, adherence to national labor laws, and engagement of non-technical workforce. There is, however, no systematic impact of standards on the provision of fringe benefits, such as paid sick leave and health, social, unemployment, and accident insurance. The estimation accounts for endogenous matching of workers with firms and unobserved heterogeneity using an instrumental variable approach. The study reveals unexpected benefits from certification.

We combine nationally representative household data with objective drought and price information to quantify and investigate causes of vulnerability to poverty in Ethiopia. Previous estimates have relied on self-reported shocks and variation in outcomes within a survey, which is inadequate for shocks such as weather and prices that vary more across time than space. We used historical distributions of climate and price shocks in each district to simulate the probable distribution of future consumption for individual households and use these quantify vulnerability to poverty. We find that many Ethiopians are unable to protect their consumption against lack of rainfall and sudden increases in food prices. A moderate drought causes a 9% reduction in consumption for many rural households and recent high inflation has caused a 14% reduction in the consumption of uneducated households in urban areas. We also find that the vulnerability of rural households is considerably higher than that of urban households, despite realized poverty rates being fairly similar. This reflects the fact that the household survey in 2011 was conducted during a year of good rainfall but rapid food price inflation. The results highlight the need for caution in using a snapshot of poverty to target programs, as underlying rates of vulnerability can be quite different from the poverty rate captured at one point in time. The results also suggest that significant welfare gains can be made from risk management in both rural and urban areas. (C) 2017 The World Bank. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We find that liquidity is higher when stocks become eligible formargin trading and that this liquidity enhancement is driven by margin traders' contrarian strategies.

Many of these evaluations find no significant impacts on either employment or earnings. One reason is that urban labor markets appear to work reasonably well in many cases, with fewer market failures than is often thought. As a result, there is less of a role for many traditional active labor market policies than is common practice. The review discusses examples of job-creation policies that do seem to offer promise, and concludes with lessons for impact evaluation and policy is this area.","[McKenzie, David] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"McKenzie, D (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",dmckenzie@worldbank.org,,,,,,,59,89,100,4,50,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0257-3032,1564-6971,,WORLD BANK RES OBSER,World Bank Res.

By simulating the model, the role of the top management is investigated in guiding internal entrepreneurship in an intraorganizational ecology of strategic initiatives. The simulation study advances received strategy-process literature in three ways. First, it clarifies the role that slack resources play within a web of interacting variables. Second, the study indicates the behavioral features of the top management that are desirable to appropriately calibrate slack flows. More specifically, two constructs are described: (i) time to adapt core business expectations and (ii) time to react to change in expectations, which capture the top management's capability to produce accurate expectations and to buttress appropriate reaction to change in those expectations. Third, the article integrates the interaction among top managers' agency, evolutionary forces, and self-organization in the strategy process.","[Mollona, Edoardo] Univ Bologna, Dept Comp Sci & Engn DISI, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Mollona, E (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Comp Sci & Engn DISI, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",edoardo.mollona@unibo.it,"mollona, edoardo/AAS-5523-2020",,,,,,75,4,5,3,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Thus, the attainment of a bachelor's or graduate degree by a black worker usually provides important benefits at the individual level. However, an educational improvement of this type does not assure equal labor market outcomes relative to white workers with the same level of education. The labor earnings differential by race in Brazil is high even among individuals who completed at least a bachelor's degree. This paper investigates this labor earnings gap, emphasizing the unequal distribution of whites and blacks across fields of study. Evidence indicates that disparities in the distribution of racial groups across fields of study help explain 18% of the total median earnings differential in 2000 and 33% in 2010, accounting for most of the gap between white and black workers due to characteristic effects in this latter period.","[Reis, Mauricio] Inst Pesquisa Econ Aplicada, Av Presidente Antonio Carlos 51 1409, BR-20020010 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil",Instituto de Pesquisa Economica Aplicada (IPEA),"Reis, M (通讯作者)，Inst Pesquisa Econ Aplicada, Av Presidente Antonio Carlos 51 1409, BR-20020010 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.",mauricio.reis@ipea.gov.br,,,,,,,36,3,4,1,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Using data for licensed biopharmaceutical patents, we build a set of alternate patents that could have been licensed-in using topic modeling techniques. This provides a more sophisticated way of controlling for patent characteristics and analyzing the attractiveness of a licensor and the characteristics of the patent itself. We find that patents owned by licensors with technological prestige, experience at licensing, and combined technological depth and breadth have a greater chance at being chosen by licensees. This suggests that a licensor's standing and organizational learning rather than the quality of its patent alone influence the success of outward licensing.","[Ruckman, Karen; McCarthy, Ian] Simon Fraser Univ, Beedie Sch Business, 8888 Univ Ave, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",Simon Fraser University,"Ruckman, K (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Beedie Sch Business, 8888 Univ Ave, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",ruckman@sfu.ca; imccarthy@sfu.ca,"Ruckman, Karen/W-5412-2018","Ruckman, Karen/0000-0001-8798-6252; McCarthy, Ian/0000-0003-3330-0977",,,,,106,26,29,3,55,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

A debate has risen on the tenability of the publicly funded system of this type of care. In this paper we show the upward effect of the ageing of the Dutch population on care use will be mitigated by the downward effect of improving health and increasing education levels. Even so, long-term care will continue to grow in the coming years. According to our calculations, care use will increase by an average of 1.6% annually in the period 2014-2030. This increase stems from the demographic effects of increasing population size (+ 0.4%) and ageing (+ 1.6%), partly offset by a decreasing uptake rate ( the rate of care use per demographic group; -0.5%). The decrease of the uptake rate is mainly driven by the expectation that the elderly population will be better educated and have fewer physical disabilities. Future expenditure does not only depend on care use, but also on price levels. Extrapolating recent developments, prices are expected to increase. This may lead to an increase of expenditure by 3.5% annually in real terms. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The article focuses on the analysis of correlations between GDP growth and production of MT, MT exports and investments in MT in the Czech Republic after the accession to the European Union in 2004 during the economic crisis of 2009 and the post-crisis development until 2014. The results show that production and exports are directly related to fluctuations in GDP and the economic cycle, but domestic investment in machine tools did not show this dependence. It is necessary to capture new trends to increase the competitiveness of the MT industry. The course of recovery of Czech economy after the economic crisis of 2009 indicates signals of qualitative changes in the traditional field of machine tool production. Comparing the years 2013 and 2014, it shows that export MT (SITC 731) fell in 2014, although the total exports from the Czech Republic to Europe and to the world grew significantly.","[Povolna, Lucie; Svarcova, Jena] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Povolna, L (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic.",lucie.povolna@ujep.cz; svarcova@fame.utb.cz,"N'Dri, Amoin Bernadine/IWD-7811-2023; Povolná, Lucie/IZE-1916-2023","Povolná, Lucie/0000-0002-6237-699X; Svarcova, Jena/0000-0001-5910-3686",,,,,14,10,10,0,7,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

A framework for global institutional arrangements proposed here is the set of essential international public goods for a well-functioning world food system. These public goods include international natural resource management; trade and transboundary competition policy; research and innovation; handling large scale food emergencies; and transboundary food safety. Based on the framework, and institutional economics considerations, causes of current malfunctioning of global food governance are analyzed. It is proposed to redesign global food governance by establishing an international platform with policy clusters mapped along the set of global public goods. To support the platform with needed research-based evidence an International Panelon Food, Nutrition and Agriculture (IPFNA) is suggested, partly following the design of the Intergovernmental Panelon Climate Change (IPCC). Existing organizations and mechanisms would form building blocks of the strengthened and redesigned governance system. A gradual approach toward redesign is proposed. Some redesign in the suggested direction was triggered by the food crisis of 2008, as demonstrated by the reform of the Committee on Food Security (CFS) with its high level panel of experts, but more is needed.","[von Braun, Joachim] Univ Bonn, Dept Econ & Technol Change, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, Bonn, Germany; [Birner, Regina] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Agr Econ & Social Sci Trop & Subtrop, Stuttgart, Germany",University of Bonn; University Hohenheim,"von Braun, J (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Dept Econ & Technol Change, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, Bonn, Germany.",jvonbraun@uni-bonn.de,"von Braun, Joachim/AAA-7044-2020","von Braun, Joachim/0000-0001-6571-4838",,,,,48,27,29,1,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

First, we analytically show that the 1/N rule approaches the ex ante mean-variance efficient portfolio in the absence of mispricing. With mispricings, mean-variance strategies can overcome the difficulty brought by the imprecise parameter estimates and outperform 1/N by exploiting the mispricing. Second, with mispricings the 1/N rule is unlikely to outperform mean-variance strategies even when N is large, since mean-variance strategies have more opportunities to exploit mispricings. Third, minimum-variance strategies do not exploit mispricings and underperform the 1/N rule. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Understanding the travel patterns of taxis is important for addressing many urban sustainability challenges. Previous research has primarily focused on examining the statistical properties of taxi trips to characterize travel patterns, while it may be more appropriate to explore taxi service strategies on seasonal, weekly or daily time scale. Therefore, intra-urban taxi mobility is investigated by examining taxi trajectory data that were collected in Harbin, China, while 12-week corresponding to 12-month is chosen as the sampling period in our study. The multivariate spatial point pattern analysis is firstly adopted to characterize and model the spatial dependence, and infer significant positive spatial relationships between the picked up points (PUPs) and the dropped off points (DOPs). Secondly, the points of interest (POIs) are identified from DOPs using the emerging hot spot detection technique, then the taxi services and movement patterns surrounding POIs are further examined in details. Moreover, our study builds on and extends the existing work to examine the statistical regularities of trip distances, and we also validate and quantify the impacts posed by airport trips on the distance distributions. Finally, the movement based kernel density estimation (MKDE) method is proposed to estimate taxis' service ranges within three isopleth levels (50, 75 and 95%) between summer/weekday and winter/weekend from taxi driver's perspective, and season as well as temperature factors are identified as the significant effect within certain service range levels. These results are expected to enhance current urban mobility research and suggest some interesting avenues for future research.","[Zhang, Shen; An, Shi] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Transportat Sci & Engn, 73 Huang He St, Harbin 150090, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Tang, Jinjun] Cent South Univ, Sch Traff & Transportat Engn, Changsha 410075, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Haixiao] Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Sch Energy & Transportat Engn, Hohhot 010018, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yinhai] Univ Washington, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Harbin Institute of Technology; Central South University; Inner Mongolia Agricultural University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Tang, JJ (通讯作者)，Cent South Univ, Sch Traff & Transportat Engn, Changsha 410075, Hunan, Peoples R China.",shenzhang@hit.edu.cn; jinjuntang@csu.edu.cn; teacherwhx@126.com; yinhai@u.washington.edu; anshi@hit.edu.cn,"Wang, Yinhai/B-5396-2012; Yang, Yifan/JTV-1487-2023","Wang, Yinhai/0000-0002-4180-5628","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71403068, 51138003, 51329801, 51578198]; Hi-Tech Research and Development Program of China [2014BAG03B04]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Hi-Tech Research and Development Program of China(National High Technology Research and Development Program of China),"This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71403068, 51138003, 51329801 and 51578198), the Hi-Tech Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2014BAG03B04).",,41,77,80,6,124,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Median expectations tend to track objective inflation estimates over time, although responses display large dispersion. Medians also tend to differ between surveys, possibly reflecting survey design differences. Using a nationally representative Dutch sample, we evaluate the importance of three survey design features in explaining observed differences: mode (face-to-face vs. web), question wording ('prices in general' vs. 'inflation'), and the explicit opportunity to revise responses. We examine effects on item non-responses, revisions, reported inflation expectations and their deviation from the CPI inflation rate. We discuss implications of our findings for survey design.

As a result, the demand for HEVs in Canada has been on the rise, but the market share is still negligible. In this paper, the population of HEVs in the Windsor Census metropolitan area (CMA), Ontario, Canada for the year 2010 is considered to study the determinants that led to the observed spatial distribution of this class of vehicles across the different census tracts within the CMA. Vehicle-specific characteristics along with locational variables are employed in the analysis. Locational factors are based on census tract profile attributes (namely socio-economic factors) that were acquired from the 2011 Census National Household Survey (NHS). Other variables used in the analysis include mixed density index, average commuting distance and a measure of spatial clustering. Discrete choice modeling is used to explain the residential location of HEV owners in the CMA. Moran's I statistics analysis suggests that the spatial distribution of HEV owners exhibits a clustering pattern. This was also reinforced by the significance of the spatial term used in the choice model. Area-based socio-economic factors pertaining to the size of population, gender, type of occupation, education, size of household of the people living in an area, and income explain the spatial prevalence of HEVs. Also, areas housing long distance commuters as well as areas with mixed density tend to house HEV owners. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

By starting from an ethnographic perspective, data was gathered from urban cydists in Quito, Ecuador to understand the contemporary factors that influence cyclists' experiences. This approach seeks to challenge how technical data on cycling can be collected and visualized. To comprehend the quotidian experiences of moving in the city, 75 photo-diaries were distributed to urban cycling activists in Quito. This paper uses data returned by 26 individuals who identify with the subcultural group of cycling activists in Quito that has a thick description of their experiences and circulation patterns accompanied by photos taken by the participants. After gathering photo-diaries, the data was digitally mapped using Google Earth and then subsequently quantitative mapping approaches were used to digitize and analyze the objective environmental correlates of experiences of cyclists. Activists took photographs and used tags to label experiences. These experiences were then labeled positive, negative, or neutral. By relating the experience points and the routes taken in the urban area, results reveal the importance of centrality, the bicycle lane network, and green space for a positive experience, demonstrating how a mixed-methods approach to experience data can contribute to a greater understanding of cycling conditions in the urban context.

It distinguishes between different monetary policy news contained in press releases following a monetary policy decision. Employing a latent variable approach and event study methods, I find that medium- and long-term bond yields respond to changes in the communicated inflation and GDP forecasts as well as to the degree of pessimism expressed in press releases. Exchange rates mainly react to changes in the GDP forecast while stocks do not react to SNB communication on monetary policy announcement days. Additionally, short-term expectations about the future path of the policy rate are driven by the communicated inflation forecast. The results underline the role of qualitative news beyond quantitative forecasts in influencing market expectations and asset prices. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Given the historical destruction wrought by the oil-based accumulation process upon Venezuela's agricultural sector, the symbolic and social importance of an agrarian revolution could be seen as a yardstick with which to measure the progress of the Bolivarian Revolution in sowing the oil. Eschewing a policy focus on the role of food sovereignty and food security, the paper analyses how the dynamics of rentier-capital accumulation have played out in the agricultural sector. The paper argues that the macroeconomic framework of the Bolivarian Revolution has diminished the possibility of expanded domestic food production and instead reduced agrarian transformation to contradictory processes of ground rent appropriation.","[Purcell, Thomas F.] Leeds Beckett Univ, Polit & Int Relat, Leeds LS1 3HE, W Yorkshire, England",Leeds Beckett University,"Purcell, TF (通讯作者)，Leeds Beckett Univ, Polit & Int Relat, Leeds LS1 3HE, W Yorkshire, England.",t.f.purcell@leedsbeckett.ac.uk,"Purcell, Thomas Francis/I-3685-2019","Purcell, Thomas Francis/0000-0003-1825-0916",,,,,51,19,21,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

At the same time, there is a widespread perception that MNEs are less rooted in the local economy and are thus more likely to conduct offshoring. In this study, we investigate the latter claim by combining various Canadian firm-level data sets. We find that MNEs (both Canadian and foreign headquartered) are indeed more likely to offshore but suggest that it is not necessarily because they are less rooted in the Canadian economy. We also show different associations between offshoring and firm characteristics (including productivity) depending on the type of offshoring (e.g., intrafirm or interfirm offshoring) and the type of business activity offshored (e.g., certain types of service vs. goods production).","[Tang, Jianmin] Innovat Sci & Econ Dev Canada, Econ Res & Policy Anal Branch, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Van Assche, Ari] HEC Montreal, Dept Int Business, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal,"Van Assche, A (通讯作者)，HEC Montreal, Dept Int Business, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",ari.van-assche@hec.ca,"Van Assche, Ari/Z-1988-2019; JIANMIN, TANG/JBS-6054-2023","JIANMIN, TANG/0000-0001-6091-9682",,,,,31,1,2,0,4,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

In this paper the authors used a Bayesian estimation approach to estimate a quantile binary regression and the WTP distribution in the context of a contingent valuation PES application. Our results show that the use of other quantiles framed in the supermajority concept provides a reasonable interpretation of the technical nonmarket valuation studies in the PES area.

We find that a material portion of this performance differential is attributable to institutional investment in firms that participate in mergers and acquisitions after their initial public offerings (IPOs). Specifically, institutions not only tend to avoid underperforming firms, on average, but also invest heavily in IPO firms that subsequently become M & A participants, especially well performing bidders and targets. Superior returns among firms with high institutional ownership suggests the ability of institutional investors to identify and actively monitor newly public M & A participants.","[Anderson, Christopher W.] Univ Kansas, Sch Business, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Huang, Jian] Towson Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Towson, MD 21093 USA",University of Kansas; University System of Maryland; Towson University,"Huang, J (通讯作者)，Towson Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Towson, MD 21093 USA.",cwanderson@ku.edu; jhuang@towson.edu,"Huang, Jian/J-2221-2017",,,,,,56,17,17,2,26,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5398,1879-1727,,J EMPIR FINANC,J.

Theory predicts innovation, efficiency, profitability and financial status as the central channels through which firms can possibly achieve outstanding growth performance. The question is whether such high-growth performance is sustained over time and, if so, what are the factors enabling persistent high-growth patterns. Exploiting panels of Italian, Spanish, French and UK firms, we relate high growth, persistent high growth and other growth patterns to measures of efficiency, innovativeness, profitability and financial conditions. We find that high-growth firms are characterized by higher productivity and leverage, and that persistent high-growth firms do not systematically differ from other high-growth firms in none of the considered economic and financial dimensions. The findings are robust across countries, manufacturing and services.","[Bianchini, Stefano] Univ Strasbourg, BETA, 61 Ave Foret Noire, F-67085 Strasbourg, France; [Bianchini, Stefano; Bottazzi, Giulio; Tamagni, Federico] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Econ, Piazza Martiri 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy",Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna,"Bottazzi, G (通讯作者)，Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Econ, Piazza Martiri 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy.",bottazzi@sssup.it,"Tamagni, Federico/AAF-3143-2020","Tamagni, Federico/0000-0001-6476-6388; Bottazzi, Giulio/0000-0003-2565-4732",,,,,42,46,47,5,49,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Using a state panel data model and data for 2000 to 2014, we estimate the relationship between the business cycle and child poverty, and we examine how and to what extent the safety net is providing protection to at-risk children. We find compelling evidence that the safety net provides protection; that is, the cyclicality of after-tax-and-transfer child poverty is significantly attenuated relative to the cyclicality of private income poverty. We also find that the protective effect of the safety net is not similar across demographic groups, and that children from more disadvantaged backgrounds, such as those living with Hispanic or single heads, or particularly those living with immigrant household heads-or immigrant spouses-experience larger poverty cyclicality than those living with non-Hispanic white or married heads, or those living with native household heads with native spouses. Our findings hold across a host of choices for how to define poverty. These include measures based on absolute thresholds or more relative thresholds. They also hold for measures of resources that include not only cash and near-cash transfers net of taxes but also several measures of the value of public medical benefits.

We interpret the relationship between national saving and investment in the long run as reflecting a solvency constraint and focus on the short-term saving-investment relationship to assess the degree of capital mobility. We apply the Panel Autoregressive Distributed Lag (PARDL) model proposed by Pesaran et al. (1999) using data for 14 EU member countries from 1970 to 2013. Our empirical results suggest that there exists a close relationship between saving and investment in the long run that is consistent with the existence of a solvency constraint that is binding for each country in the long run. We also find that the parameter for the error-correction term is always highly significant, which supports the choice of an error-correction formulation. Moreover, we show that the parameter estimated for the error-correction term, i. e. the speed of adjustment to the long-run equilibrium, varies with the sample period considered. The estimated speed of adjustment becomes smaller in absolute terms as more recent data are included in the sample, which indicates that deviations from long-run equilibrium current accounts have become more persistent over time, signalling some degree of capital mobility.

CLM effects were identified through cross-state and time variation, as four states repealed the law over the period of study. Using microdata from Current Population Survey Fertility supplements 1990-2010 and state-level data from CDC Vital Statistics 1988-2012 we found that, in the states where CLM was first available but then repealed, the odds that teens would become new mothers increased. Births to teens younger than 18 were more responsive to availability of CLM than those to teens aged 18 or 19 or to women in their early twenties. The likelihood of becoming a mother increased where CLM was available in the years prior to its repeal. Teens were more responsive to information about availability of CLM about three years later than to knowing that it is available at the time of potential conception. To the extent that they reduce teen births CLM laws are socially desirable and states that still have CLM may be better off by not repealing the law.","[Grossbard, Shoshana] San Diego State Univ, Dept Econ, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Grossbard, Shoshana] IZA, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Vernon, Victoria] Empire State Coll, Dept Business Management & Econ, 325 Hudson St,6th Floor, New York, NY 10013 USA",California State University System; San Diego State University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Empire State College,"Grossbard, S (通讯作者)，San Diego State Univ, Dept Econ, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.;Grossbard, S (通讯作者)，IZA, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",shosh@mail.sdsu.edu; Victoria.Vernon@esc.edu,"Grossbard, Shoshana/IWV-0194-2023; Grossbard, Shoshana/I-7038-2012","Grossbard, Shoshana/0000-0002-4884-8225; Grossbard, Shoshana/0000-0002-4884-8225",,,,,24,5,5,0,10,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

We also compared a rate based policy with a cap-and-trade policy and found that the former leads to a greater reduction in the real GDP than the latter.

Dark exchanges and over-the-counter markets enable expert investors to hide their orders while originators carefully control the disclosure of fundamental information about the assets they source. We describe a simple model in which both forms of opacity- hidden orders and limited disclosure - complement one another. Costly investor expertise gives originators incentives to deliver assets of good quality. Keeping expert orders hidden generates the rents investors need to justify investing in expertise in the first place. Limiting disclosure mitigates the resulting adverse selection issues. Originators prefer to restrict the information they can convey to experts because it encourages the participation of non experts. This optimal organization of asset markets can be decentralized using standard financial arrangements. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We find heterogeneities in type of work. Those who work outside of family business have lower educational attainment than those working for family business. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that the absolute idiosyncratic volatility (the variance of the residual from an asset-pricing model) displays a positive and robust relationship to mispricing, which reflects an increasing role of noise traders. Previous literature has produced similar - or opposing - results. We deepen our understanding of the previous conflicting results by showing that (1) market volatility by itself is associated with mispricing, (2) absolute idiosyncratic volatility is associated with mispricing even when controlling for market volatility, (3) the strength of the association between absolute idiosyncratic volatility and mispricing depends on the level of market volatility, and (4) absolute and relative measures of idiosyncratic volatility have opposing associations with mispricing. Our findings contribute to the existing literature by reconciling the mixed results for the relationship between idiosyncratic volatility and mispricing displayed in the previous literature.

The programs built on a long historical relationship between the two regions, marked by their striking similarities in physical geography and natural resources, despite being 1,000s of miles apart on opposite sides of the Equator. The first program was for technical development assistance to Chile in the framework of the Alliance for Progress, and involved the three governments of Chile, California, and the United States. Water resources and river basin development planning were a primary emphasis, and led to building Chile's largest dual-purpose reservoir (Colbun). The second program was for graduate-level academic exchange and involved the two leading public university systems, the University of Chile and the University of California. This comprehensive program was funded for more than a decade by the Ford Foundation, with agriculture, natural sciences, and engineering the dominant fields. The third program was a separate effort to reform Chilean legal education, led by Stanford Law School and funded by the Ford Foundation. This Chile Law Program was a leading international example of the law and development movement in the 1960s, which overlapped closely with the early years of the law and society movement in the U.S. Both university and law school programs ended after the Chilean military coup in 1973. What were the impacts of these programs on water, law, and society in both Chile and California? What lessons can we learn today from those historical experiences? We answer these questions with an historical overview and synthesis of diverse documents and evidence. In focusing on water, law, and society, we aim to contribute to the interdisciplinary synthesis of different fields of development studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

If, on the one hand, the cumulative advantage inherent in a high-status position gives rise to greater competitive strength, on the other hand, some scholars have emphasized how occupancy of a well-defined market position, such as a high-status one, weakens competitive intensity by reducing the motivation to compete aggressively. By integrating both perspectives, this article proposes a dynamic account of the relationship between occupancy of a high-status position and development of capabilities. Despite being more complacent with exchange partners, occupants of a high-status position extend such position by entering in new exchange relationships with partners providing resources of higher quality. Yet, occupancy of a high-status position undercuts the development of capabilities within the boundaries of the firm, leaving the firm less able to use and integrate the resources provided by existing exchange relationships. Evidence comes from an examination of Formula One racing teams and their engine suppliers.","[Castellucci, Fabrizio] Bocconi Univ, Via Roentgen 1, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Podolny, Joel M.] Apple Inc, 20330 Stevens Creek Blvd, Cupertino, CA 95014 USA",Bocconi University; Apple Inc,"Castellucci, F (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Via Roentgen 1, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",fabrizio.castellucci@unibocconi.it; podolny@apple.com,"Castellucci, Fabrizio/G-9576-2014","Castellucci, Fabrizio/0000-0002-3253-3579",,,,,71,7,7,1,35,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

We explain this finding based on the dual notions that liquidity provision can influence reversals and that agents who act as de facto liquidity providers may be less active in past losers. Supporting these observations, we find that active institutions participate less in losing stocks and that the magnitude of monthly return reversals fluctuates with changes in the number of active institutional investors. Thus, we argue that fluctuations in liquidity provision with past return performance account for the link between return reversals and past returns.","[Cheng, Si] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Hameed, Allaudeen] Natl Univ Singapore Subrahmanyam, Singapore, Singapore; [Subrahmanyam, Avanidhar] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Anderson Sch Management, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Titman, Sheridan] Univ Texas, McCombs Sch Business, Austin, TX USA",Chinese University of Hong Kong; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Subrahmanyam, A (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Anderson Sch Management, Los Angeles, CA USA.",sicheng@cuhk.edu.hk; allaudeen@nus.edu.sg; subra@anderson.ucla.edu; sheridan.titman@mccombs.utexas.edu,"Hameed, Allaudeen/I-4476-2015","Cheng, Si/0000-0002-2109-7636",NUS Academic Research Grants,NUS Academic Research Grants,Hameed gratefully acknowledges financial support from NUS Academic Research Grants.,,61,39,41,1,26,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

Recent accelerations in the rate of reduction in under-five mortality have been cited as a cause for optimism. In this paper, we show that changes in mortality rates are subject to mean reversion. Hence, high rates observed recently for Sub-Saharan Africa make for an overly optimistic estimate of future reductions. Taking this into account in projecting mortality rates until 2030, we find that only very few countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are likely to attain the new targets while a majority of countries elsewhere are likely to attain the target or have done so already. We also show that while MDG4 has been rightly criticized as 'unfair' to Sub-Saharan Africa in the past, a relative target may have been more appropriate today and would be relevant for all countries. We also offer a discussion of likely challenges the region faces in making further inroads against preventable deaths. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Using the 2009 National Household Travel Survey, I investigate whether residence in a co-ethnic neighborhood affects the likelihood that ethnic minorities will form inter-household carpools, and if so, how such effects differ across race or ethnic groups. Inter-household carpooling requires arrangements and interactions between people living in geographical proximity, so it will likely reflect the social networks of a neighborhood. The results show that Hispanics and Asians who reside in their co-ethnic neighborhoods, regardless of immigrant status, are more likely to use inter-household carpools for non-work purposes than their counterparts living outside co-ethnic neighborhoods. In contrast, black neighborhood residency is not associated with the likelihood that African Americans will do inter-household carpooling, regardless of trip purpose. These differences across racial/ethnic groups suggest that the role of neighborhoods in promoting social ties as reflected by activities such as external carpooling is complex. Residence in a black neighborhood may be less of a choice than residence in a Hispanic or Asian neighborhood due to the long history of black segregation in the US. With less residential choice, the propensity to develop local social ties may be weaker. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

IPO misvaluation is measured using (i) an intrinsic value of the firm estimated using residual income valuation model and (ii) intensity of IPO issuance activity. The findings show that stock price and operating underperformance in the postissue are directly linked to the degree of IPOs' misvaluation. Specifically, the stock price and operating performance are found to be significantly and robustly different between hot markets IPOs and cold market IPOs 3years postissue. We also show that overvalued IPOs have lower long-run stock returns, but outperforming operating performance, than undervalued IPOs do.

Our data span the period December 14th 2007 - March 8th 2013 that encompasses several episodes of economic and financial turmoil since the collapse of the subprime credit market. Our contribution to the literature is twofold. First, we use an explicit multifactor model of equity returns extended with a sovereign risk factor. Second, we adopt a Smooth Transition Regression (STR) framework that allows for an endogenous definition of crisis periods and captures the changes in parameters associated with shift contagion. We find that the negative impact of the European sovereign debt crisis on banks' equity returns has been mostly confined to European banks, whereas U.S. banks appear to be unharmed by its direct impact and may even have benefited from it. Besides, we find some evidence of shift contagion across Europe. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To this respect, international institutions like the United Nations or the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development agree on the importance of innovation and entrepreneurship in sustainable economic growth and material and non-material welfare. In this context the concept of entrepreneurial ecosystem arises to illustrate the impact of framework conditions, such as public policies, culture or access to finance, to promote or disincentive the entrepreneurship initiative in a given location. Although the interaction of entrepreneurship and economic development has become a hot topic in the agenda of policy-makers and private investors, traditionally there has been a lack of understanding in this particular field, mainly due to the absence of a framework that gathers and quantifies the agents and its relationships as a necessary step to measure and evaluate the different inputs and outputs of the entrepreneurship performance in a certain region/city. Therefore, academic research on the entrepreneurship field has been mainly focused on the individual entrepreneurs concept, underestimating (i) the complexity of the interactions among different agents in each stage of the entrepreneurial process, and (ii) their evolution over time to evaluate the entrepreneurial outcome in a certain region. Given the need to progress to more quantitative approaches of the ecosystem's activity, the objective of the paper is to present a comparison of the most relevant frameworks that represent entrepreneurial ecosystems in order to identify the existing gaps to quantify entrepreneurial activity, and reflect on the efforts that could contribute to evaluate and monitor its progress. Entrepreneurship being a central part of the policy agenda in Europe, and in particular the notion of the app economy or web entrepreneurship among key entrepreneurship policy cornerstones for the EU, the paper can contribute to the debate in order to design improved frameworks to establish entrepreneurial ecosystems in specific locations (e.g. cities) as a way to foster economic and social development through entrepreneurship and innovation.","[Armuna, Cristina; Arenal, Alberto] Univ Politecn Madrid, Madrid, Spain; [Ramos, Sergio; Luis Gomez, Jose] Univ Nacl Educ Distancia, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED),"Armuña, C (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Madrid, Madrid, Spain.",,"Pereira, Fernanda/AID-4926-2022; Armuña, Cristina/ABF-7122-2020; Arenal, Alberto/JPL-1737-2023",,,,,,60,1,1,0,7,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-286-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,27,39,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393400003,0

It explains how these models embody the contagion and cascades that occur owing to the financial leverage and market concentration of the agents and the liquidity of the markets. This article also compares agent-based models to the standard economic approach to crises and shows the ways in which agent-based models overcome limitations of economic models when dealing with financial crises. In particular, this article demonstrates how agent-based models replace homogeneous, representative agents with heterogeneous agents and optimization with heuristics, and how such models move away from a focus on equilibrium, allowing non-ergodic dynamics that are manifest during financial crises to emerge.","[Bookstaber, Richard] Univ Calif, Off Chief Investment Officer, Oakland, CA 94607 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Bookstaber, R (通讯作者)，Univ Calif, Off Chief Investment Officer, Oakland, CA 94607 USA.",rbookstaber@gmail.com,,,,,,,55,11,12,6,31,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4809-0,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

This paper examines the factors determining vehicle ownership for urban and rural households in India. Separate nation-wide disaggregate vehicle ownership models for urban and rural areas in India are developed using readily available consumer expenditure survey dataset. A consumption based proxy variable is assumed to represent economic standard of households. Comparison between vehicle ownership behavior of urban and rural households show that rural households are more inclined to own private vehicle than urban households with same economic standards. Amongst households with regular salaried members, rural households' preference to own two wheelers is greater than that of urban households. While the presence of elderly member or children is considered, urban households showed more preference to own four-wheeler than rural households. As a first nation-wise study to understand the differences in vehicle ownership behavior in urban and rural areas of India, this study provides a lot of useful insights which could be valuable to various stakeholders.

There is currently a need for link-level, city wide modelling of cycling, both to ensure the needs of existing cyclists are catered for in planning, and to model the effects of changing infrastructure in shaping cyclist behaviour. Existing SpNA models treat cyclists and car drivers as if they make navigational decisions in a similar way, which in reality is not the case. This paper presents an SpNA model using hybrid betweenness, which fits cyclist flows in Cardiff, Wales using distance, angular distance, motor vehicle traffic and slope as predictors of route choice. SpNA betweenness is also shown to implicitly capture the effect of urban density on mode choice. As it handles route finding decisions of drivers and cyclists separately, the model presented is also applicable to road safety models examining the interaction between the two classes of road user. The model has low cost of data collection and is reproducible using publicly available network analysis software and open mapping data. Further avenues for modelling the effect of infrastructure on cycling are discussed. (C) 2016 The Author. Published by Elsevier Ltd.","[Cooper, Crispin H.

Pricing as one of the main four aspects in the marketing mix must be redefined and exploited more professional, even in service related industries. A more global and intensive competition leads to an interchangeability of products and services. In this environment, pricing and especially behavioral pricing is moving in the focus of market orientated corporate management policies. Due to the habituation to the internet, the convenient use of search engines and the communication between customers via rating platforms, a more price-related orientation is forced rapidly and represents a decisive success-factor. In general, the term pricing actions is used as a collective name for a wide variety of various measurements with differently distinctive price-political provisions and effects. In daily operational and tactical business, pricing actions mainly concentrate on limited sales promotions and diminished retail prices. Beside the description of such push-marketing measurements, this investigation rather concentrates on neuro-pricing strategies or better behavioral pricing strategies to produce added values for both, customers and sellers. This research discusses the importance of behavioral pricing as a key component of business strategy in general and analyses to which extend behavioral pricing strategies can be identified in German hospitality. Initially, the paper delivers a literature overview, reviews a thematic processing and introduces the main theories. Secondly, several determinants, tools and key instruments of behavioural pricing are introduced. Thirdly and with a focussed view on the research objects, a conceptual demarcation and classification of behavioral pricing methods and effects is performed. This investigation results in a model and a basic set up for a successful implementation of a behavioural pricing strategy.","[Corinth, Thomas] IST Hsch Management, Dusseldorf, Germany",,"Corinth, T (通讯作者)，IST Hsch Management, Dusseldorf, Germany.",,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,4,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-286-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,108,115,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393400011,0

Since the standard IRBC model under assumptions of flexible prices and perfect competition cannot replicate all the observed characteristics of international business cycles, a number of extended models with more realistic features have been developed in the past two decades. We introduce a noisy information structure into an otherwise standard international real business cycle model with two countries. When domestic firms observe current foreign technology with some noise, predictions of the model on international correlation can be very different from those of a standard perfect information model. We show that the model can explain: (i) positive output correlation both in complete and incomplete market models; (ii) consumption correlation smaller than output correlation with an introduction of information-constrained consumers; and (iii) observation of both positive and negative productivity-hours correlation in two countries.","[Guo, Zi-Yi] Wells Fargo Bank NA, Memphis, TN 38133 USA",Wells Fargo Company,"Guo, ZY (通讯作者)，Wells Fargo Bank NA, Memphis, TN 38133 USA.",,"guo, ziyi/JFS-6146-2023",,,,,,26,0,0,0,1,INTL INST SOCIAL & ECONOMIC SCI,PRAGUE,"TREBESOVSKA 2038/14, PRAGUE, 193 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87927-32-8,,,,2017,,,,,,,43,70,,10.20472/EFC.2017.007.005,0.0,,,28,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6MP,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426854900005,0

This implies relative price movements in commodities may have important consequences for economic growth and poverty reduction. Taking a long-run perspective, we examine the historical relation between a new aggregate index of commodity prices, economic activity, and interest rates. Initial empirical tests show that commodity prices present a downward trend with breaks over the entire industrial age, providing clear support for the Prebisch-Singer hypothesis. It would also appear that this trend has declined at a faster rate since the 1870s. Conversely, several GDP series such as World, Chile, China, UK, and US, trend upward with breaks. Such trending behavior in both commodity prices and economic activity suggests a latent common factor like technological innovation. To assess the relationships between economic series, we apply a stationary VAR (Vector Autoregression) to model movements around trends. Strikingly, there is evidence that commodity prices Granger cause income and interest rates, while interest rates Granger cause commodity prices. From these results and the related impulse response function analysis, the historical perspective provides some useful information for contemporary policy makers. For example, loose monetary policy has tended to support higher commodity prices. Moreover, commodity price movements have an asymmetric country effect on economic activity; periods of falling commodity prices will support GDP growth for commodity importers like the US but depress growth for commodity exporters such as Chile.

It builds on a new institutional theory framework and uses data gathered in the course of the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor to examine the institutional impacts and individual characteristics which influence the degree of environmental orientation of entrepreneurial activity, using a multilevel analysis. Our key findings are threefold: First, the results indicate that environmental orientation is frequently used as a source for securing legitimacy of entrepreneurial ventures. Second, we find lower degrees of environmental orientation among more educated entrepreneurs. Third, for many variables, such as age, gender and income, differences are observed when compared to earlier findings on the determinants of social entrepreneurship. Policy makers can learn from the analysis that policy measures should not only be designed specifically for environmental entrepreneurship, but also be adapted to the domestic economic circumstances, as, for example, environmental taxes only show significant effects on environmental orientation of entrepreneurial ventures in OECD countries. From a practitioner's perspective, this indicates that a lack of regulation can provide opportunities for environmentally oriented entrepreneurial ideas.","[Horisch, Jacob] Alanus Univ, Fac Human & Social Sci, Dept Business Econ, D-53347 Bonn, Germany; [Kollat, Jana; Brieger, Steven A.] Leuphana Univ Lueneburg, Inst Corp Dev, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany; [Brieger, Steven A.] Univ St Gallen, Ctr Leadership & Values Soc, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland",Leuphana University Luneburg; University of St Gallen,"Hörisch, J (通讯作者)，Alanus Univ, Fac Human & Social Sci, Dept Business Econ, D-53347 Bonn, Germany.",jacob.hoerisch@alanus.edu; jana.kollat@leuphana.de; brieger@leuphana.de,"Brieger, Steven/GVT-2961-2022","Brieger, Steven A./0000-0002-9894-7862; Horisch, Jacob/0000-0001-5825-1652",,,,,110,99,109,11,174,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The increasing loss of trust in the most important institutions of this sector throughout the crisis led to a gap between the perception of the financial industry representatives and that of the people outside it. At the same time, the crisis triggered the reconfiguration of the means used to maintain both financial, and price stability, and redesigned the role and strategy of central banks in using monetary policy tools, including communication. After 2008, central banks resorted to aggressive, sometimes unconventional monetary policies. Whether bringing interest rates close to zero or on negative territory, adopting quantitative easing measures or practicing forward guidance, central banks communicated more extensively as compared to the period prior to the crisis. While no consensus has been yet reached regarding the usefulness of these measures, researchers consider that some of them will become part of the usual toolkit used by central banks, which will further intensify their communication activity. This paper is a qualitative research that analyses, based on 20 semi-structured interviews, the perception of the National Bank of Romania's representatives - communication specialists and officials who were highly visible in the mass-media during that specific period - upon the loss of public trust in the central bank. At the same time, the interviews reflect the perception of the central bank's representatives upon the effects of making the monetary policy more transparent during the period considered, and examine to what extent the chosen communication decisions can be reversible after surmounting the financial crisis, in an emerging market where no other unconventional monetary policy measures had been used. Making the monetary policy more transparent during the crisis and the loss of public trust in central banks are some of the less approached topics of the academic literature related to the emerging European markets, such as Romania. Therefore, studying NBR's communication activity during a crisis could provide useful data for the researchers interested in the communication of central banks in this area. Furthermore, the results of the research provide a perspective upon the central bank's post-crisis communication, based on the assessment of the communication strategy applied - a subject that could be the topic of future research.","[Iacob (Bara), Raluca] Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, 30A Expozitiei Blvd, Bucharest 012104, Romania",National University of Political Studies & Public Administration (SNSPA) - Romania,"Iacob, R (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, 30A Expozitiei Blvd, Bucharest 012104, Romania.",raluca.iacob8@gmail.com,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,1,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-269-9,STRATEGICA,,,2017,,,,,,,245,255,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0ZU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431586800019,0

Nevertheless, important questions remain unexplored. For example, how does the gender of the headship affect household ability to reap the benefits of consumption economies of scale (CSE)? And how do these differences in CSE, based on the gender of the household head, change the poverty status in male-headed and female-headed households? This study, using Household Income and Expenditure survey 2009/10 data for Sri Lanka, attempts to uncover the differences in CSE associated with the gender of household headship. We use an Engel equivalence scale approach for this purpose. This analysis sheds new light on the existing debate on poverty and household headship in a different lens. Our results indicate that female-headed households enjoy greater CSE than their male-headed counterparts. However, we find that the poverty rate among the female-headed households are higher than that of their male-headed counterparts, even after CSE are allowed for.","[Jayasinghe, Maneka] Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Nathan, Qld, Australia",Griffith University,"Jayasinghe, M (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Nathan, Qld, Australia.",m.jayasinghe@griffith.edu.au,"Ratnasiri, Shyama/AAP-9863-2021","Jayasinghe, Maneka Savithri/0000-0002-3613-4073",Griffith Asia Institute,Griffith Asia Institute,"This article is provided as one of the outputs of the research project on the Impact of household characteristics on household consumption expenditure: evidence from Sri Lanka, funded by Griffith Asia Institute.

The paper investigates how government capital injection affects the bank's lending and equity risk, and how these effects vary across remaining privately owned and becoming government-owned. In particular, we argue that the strength of government ownership is useful in disciplining management of preferential access to debt financing for politically connected borrowing firms. It is shown that government capital injection leads to superior performance and greater safety for the bank remaining privately owned. The advantage of large capital is likely to be more pronounced to equity return, but less to safety for the government-owned bank. Moreover, political connection reinforces the increased return performance and safety. Government capital injection as such makes the bank less prone to risk-taking, thereby affecting the stability of the banking system.","[Jou, Rosemary; Tsai, Jeng-Yan] Tamkang Univ, Dept Int Business, New Taipei, Taiwan; [Chen, Shi] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China",Tamkang University; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Tsai, JY (通讯作者)，Tamkang Univ, Dept Int Business, New Taipei, Taiwan.",133400@mail.tku.edu.tw; chenshi@swufe.edu.cn; tsaijy@mail.tku.edu.tw,,,,,,,41,7,7,3,23,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

The economic crisis which had a domino effect primarily hit this sector and then there have been a significant changes in the structure of banking markets. Definining market shares has a significant role in estimating market power i.e. measuring the level of competition and dominant position of certain banking institutions. The aim of this paper is to identify the type of structures and estimate the intensity of competition in the banking sector of the Republic of Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and hence, a comparative analysis of market structures between these two countries. Dynamic series of reports of the central banks usually include only two valid measures of concentration - the Herfindahl-Hirschman index and concetration ratio of the leader bank or four leading banks. In order to have a complete picture of the structure of the banking market it is necessary to apply a group of indexes that determine the degree of concentration.. For the index calculating purposes in this paper the absolute and relative values of the most dominant items in the assets of the balance sheet of a bank are used, i.e. the amount of each individual loan and amount of the deposits in liabilities of every bank in 2016. In order to make reliable comparison of the structure of the analyzed sectors, in addition to measures of central banks CR4 and Herfindal-Hirschman index the following measures of concentration were applied: Gini coefficient, entropy coefficient and Lorenz curve. It has been found out that there is more market power in the banking sector in BiH than in Serbia and also the higher level of concentration.","[Kalicanin, Tijana] Belgrade Banking Acad, Belgrade, Serbia; [Hanic, Edin] Natl Bank Serbia, Belgrade, Serbia",,"Kalicanin, T (通讯作者)，Belgrade Banking Acad, Belgrade, Serbia.",tijana.kalicanin@bba.edu.rs; edin.hanic@nbs.rs,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,2,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2017,,,,,,,222,235,,,,,,14,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7PJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455302900013,0

One such theory is the theory of cognitive dissonance. In this study, the authors develop competing hypotheses based on agency theory and the theory of cognitive dissonance regarding the decision to record an impairment of goodwill. Using an archival research methodology, they test the hypotheses on a sample of 2,274 firm-year observations. The results are consistent with the theory of cognitive dissonance even after controlling for variables that have been found to be significant under agency theory.

The effects travel through social networks: individuals whose neighbors and family members experienced adverse circumstances also avoid risky investments.","[Knupfer, Samuli] BI Norwegian Business Sch, Oslo, Norway; [Knupfer, Samuli] CEPR, London, England; [Rantapuska, Elias; Sarvimaki, Matti] Aalto Univ, Sch Business, Helsinki, Finland; [Sarvimaki, Matti] VATT Inst Econ Res, Helsinki, Finland",BI Norwegian Business School; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Aalto University; VATT Institute for Economic Research,"Knüpfer, S (通讯作者)，BI Norwegian Business Sch, Oslo, Norway.;Knüpfer, S (通讯作者)，CEPR, London, England.",,"Sarvimäki, Matti/AAV-4938-2020; Knupfer, Samuli/C-9870-2014; Rantapuska, Elias/G-2399-2013","Sarvimäki, Matti/0000-0002-3039-4210;",Emil Aaltonen Foundation; Foundation for Economic Education; Helsinki School of Economics Foundation; NASDAQ OMX Nordic Foundation; OP-Pohjola Group Research Foundation,Emil Aaltonen Foundation; Foundation for Economic Education; Helsinki School of Economics Foundation; NASDAQ OMX Nordic Foundation; OP-Pohjola Group Research Foundation,"Samuli Knupfer is with BI Norwegian Business School and CEPR.

For countries in transition, such projects are primarily financed through bank loans, mainly due to the nature of the bank-oriented financial system and poorly developed capital markets. Municipal bonds have many advantages over bank loans for both the issuer and investors. From the issuer perspective, the advantages are mainly reflected through lower interest rates when compared to bank loans, creation of own repayment plans in accordance with the estimated possibilities, process transparency, community participation in the development of local government policies, etc. These advantages over traditional bank loans should stimulate and encourage local governments to consider municipal bonds as their preferred finance method for investment projects. The main purpose of this paper is to examine the preferences of local governments in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) when selecting the method of financing investment projects, with special focus on municipal bonds. The study was conducted on a basic dataset, consisting of local governments in BiH, with an expert sample consisting of 41 local government units. The research showed that the majority of respondents preferred municipal bonds over bank loans as a way of borrowing and financing. However, due to poorly developed capital market conditions, bank loans still continue to be the backbone of investment financing for local governments.","[Kozarevic, Emira] Univ Tuzla, Fac Econ, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg; [Bozic, Irena] Dept Budget & Finance, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Tuzla,"Kozarevic, E (通讯作者)，Univ Tuzla, Fac Econ, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg.",emira.kozarevic@untz.ba; irenab@tuzla.ba,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,2,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2017,,,,,,,76,94,,,,,,19,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7PJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455302900004,0

We are using the primary proper data records exclusively, sometimes sending these to other people in a direct way or sharing the information on social media. Many people do not know about the existence of hidden personal information. But what is the reason for the existence of such information? The manufacturers themselves can make a lot of money in the tens of billions by collecting the data records, then consolidation and sell of the information. They themselves do not know exactly what the clients do with this data. The motivation of the buyers is to assess, monitor and influence the behavior of their clients or to send information about new products selectively to them. At last, the range of new products, as well as the innovation process, are influenced by this knowledge, too. But is all of this for the benefit of the private person? Or only of businesses? What is new? As a result of the handling process relating to Meta Data drafted above, we think that the discussion about the ownership of data records has to take into account the influence on privacy as well as on the economy. We show that this influence may shift if all actors know about the purposes of the hidden data and know what to do if they want to have leverage in this business. In this paper, we discuss these facts by using a study on private data sets as an outcome of using mobile phones, searching machines, and discount coupons. Based on this study we suggested a new definition of privacy under different aspects like privacy protection, intimacy, tracking life activities or well-being. At last, we offer a solution for the discussion on the ownership of data records, especially concerning the future of privacy and the loss of trust concerning the handling Meta Data by companies. For companies, we offer several possibilities to retain the trust of their clients.","[Kuhn, Elvira; Burchard, Udo] Univ Appl Sci, D-54294 Trier, Germany",,"Kuhn, E (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci, D-54294 Trier, Germany.",kuhne@hochschule-trier.de,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,3,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-269-9,STRATEGICA,,,2017,,,,,,,755,766,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0ZU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431586800059,0

We have found that only the option-induced part (OOI) of the total TX order imbalance can predict future TX prices, and the OOI calculated from open-buy TXO, defined by Ni et al. (2008), provides incremental predictability. This finding shows that the price predictability stems from the information flow resulting from option transactions rather than from liquidity pressure. We conclude further that option transactions from foreign institutions provide the most significant predictability, out-of the-money option transactions in particular. These empirical results show that option transactions conducted by foreign institutions have played the primary role in conveying the information inherent in the TXO market to the TX market, foreign institutions being delta-informed traders.

Some studies describe how corruption greases the wheels of economy by overcoming bureaucratic constraints, inefficient provision of public services and rigid laws. Other studies argue that corruption only reduces economic performance. Based on the searches results of the theoretical literature and empirical studies, this contribution verificates the validity of hypotheses about the negative impact of corruption on economic growth of V4 countries in the period 1999 - 2015. The validity of the hypothesis of corruption's negative influence was verified on a panel data sample. The validity of the hypothesis of corruption's negative influence on economic growth for V4 countries was confirmed. Corruption negatively influences economic growth directly but also indirectly via transmission channels in V4 countries.","[Linhartova, Veronika; Stejskal, Jan] Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Studentska 84, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Linhartová, V (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Studentska 84, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic.",veronika.linhartova@upce.cz; jan.stejskal@upce.cz,,,,,,,24,1,1,0,0,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

Due to how economic value is perceived in the industrial systems of the 19th and 20th century, corporate bookkeeping systems do not explicitly account for knowledge. In centrally guided systems economic value was linked with material commodities created by physical labour, whereas in capitalist countries the value of immaterial assets was denied by accountancy foundations. While industrial systems have transformed into knowledge economies, bookkeeping systems still rely on concepts of industrial economies. Knowledge economies being complex systems and enterprises, as a consequence, struggle when processing service requests. Knowledge management activities are not targeted to mastering complexity, but in stead are focused on representing it. Representation of knowledge is often human-based suffering from randomness and limiting scalability in time and space. IT approaches focus on representation of logic in legacy systems that are closed and rigid and not very adequate to convey and maintain knowledge. Enterprise logic is represented in text documents, calculation sheets, flow charts and similar techniques that do no justness to the characteristics of complexity. So, our views of knowledge and knowledge management do not seem to be in a satisfactory shape and need revision. Old-fashioned concepts underlying bookkeeping systems need to be synchronised with the knowledge economy. At the same time, the value of knowledge needs to be capitalised. The current accumulation of inefficiencies offers an expected but much needed and excellent opportunity to induce a paradigm change to accomplish this. The paradigm of functional object-types delivers a broader and deeper view of knowledge relating it to complexity. It provides a theory how to characterise and structure complex logic and render knowledge usable and adaptable for the transformation function of an enterprise. In addition to scientific advances, the first practical results reveal that the paradigm, including its Match (TM) Technology instruments, yields unprecedented achievements that are unthinkable with classical business improvement approaches. It showcases formidable time reductions in the transformation model, lower development and maintenance costs and higher quality of enterprise logic. Its 7th generation application-by-specification development is revolutionary short and elastic.","[Lucardie, Larry] Knowledge Values, Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"Lucardie, L (通讯作者)，Knowledge Values, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",Larry.Lucardie@knowledge-values.com,,,,,,,17,1,1,0,1,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-911218-31-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2017,,,,,,,190,200,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI0KF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404891000024,0

Governments worldwide are faced with the challenge of transformation and the need to reinvent government systems in order to deliver efficient and cost effective services, information and knowledge through information and communication technologies (ICT). This paper outlines four different potential types or models in an e-government system that is useful to define scope of E-government studies: Government-to-Citizen (G2C); Government to-Business (G2B); Government-to-Government (G2G) and Government-to-Nonprofit (G2N). This paper also examines some examples in E-government practices and presents a general view on E-government implementation and local administration in contests of improving possibilities for better government services. The advent of new ICTs brought a lot of new assumptions about radical changes in our society. This paper proposed that that contemporary issues related to E-government in public administration are related to the changes at different levels, such as: citizenship (citizens becoming participants in governance); the nature of public service jobs (in terms of skills, work processes and job design); organizational changes (from a hierarchical to a more horizontal structure, to network or even virtual organizations); and the entire government (from classic bureaucracy to New Public Management and to network and digital governance). The paper concludes by analyzing concepts and theoretical framework in these issues given the broader context of structural initiatives for E-government implementation and the recommendations for further studies of E-government in public administration, as well as the diversity of factors of influence at local and national level.","[Lugavic, Zijad] City Tuzla, Dept Econ Dev & Social Act, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg; [Osmanbegovic, Edin] Univ Tuzla, Fac Econ, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Tuzla,"Lugavic, Z (通讯作者)，City Tuzla, Dept Econ Dev & Social Act, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg.",zijad.lugavic@tuzla.ba; edin.osmanbegovic@untz.ba,,,,,,,41,0,0,1,6,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2017,,,,,,,393,410,,,,,,18,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7PJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455302900024,0

Second, a cluster analysis is set out to define consumer groups according to their preferences. With regard to CSR, consumers in this study were most concerned with product quality, animal welfare and employee issues.

Firms should focus more on communicating what their firm's commitment comprises and should adapt their CSR activities and firm communication methods to the preferences of different target groups.","[Luhmann, Henrike; Theuvsen, Ludwig] Georg August Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Chair Management Agribusiness, Pl Goettinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Luhmann, H (通讯作者)，Georg August Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Chair Management Agribusiness, Pl Goettinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",henrike.luhmann@agr.uni-goettingen.de,,,,,,,71,4,4,0,21,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

However, since 2009, revenues in this sector have decreased at a rate of 14%, although the sector offered opportunities for growth. The mobile phone industry is one of the most turbulent industries. Companies have to adopt different strategies to improve their organizational effectiveness in such a turbulent environment. One of these strategies is an organizational diagnosis, which presents the assessment of the current situation of an organization in order to identify the most appropriate interventions for its future development. Therefore, the aim of this research is to diagnose the current organizational effectiveness of the companies in the Albanian mobile phone industry in order to recommend interventions for improving their performance. Two of the biggest companies in this industry, which make up nearly 60% of the market share, were objects of the study. The Organizational Diagnosis Questionnaire was distributed to the employees. The questionnaire was based on the Weisbord Six-Box model. The results of the questionnaire analysis were necessary to understand what the employees think of each component (informal aspect). To better understand the formal aspect, interviews were conducted with the managers of each company. Then the results were compared to find the existing gaps between the formal and informal aspect. The analysis concluded that the priorities of the companies were not clear for all the employees and that there was lack of collaboration between the working units. The employees of both the companies did not fully support the change. Despite these small problems, these companies lacked serious problems regarding work division, clarity of organizational goals, leadership style, reward system, conflicts between individuals and working units, helpful mechanisms and ability to change. However, the small problems should be resolved before they turn into more serious ones. In the conclusion of the research, several recommendations are presented to address these problems.","[Mamillo, Denisa] European Univ Tirana, Blvd Gjergj Fishta 70,H-1, Tirana 1023, Albania",European University of Tirana,"Mamillo, D (通讯作者)，European Univ Tirana, Blvd Gjergj Fishta 70,H-1, Tirana 1023, Albania.",denisa.mamillo@gmail.com,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,6,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-269-9,STRATEGICA,,,2017,,,,,,,231,243,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0ZU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431586800018,0

The area of grassland and area of maize silage have a high positive and significant correlation with milk production. The regression model (R-2 : 0.832) indicates the strong influence of these variables on milk production. Indeed data of twelve farms from an intensive production region show that fast grown farms get to limits due to the greening regulations on crop rotation and the nitrates limit of 170 kg/ha from manure of animal origin of the New Fertilizer Act. This will lead to increasing demand for land and the need of exporting nutrients to less intensive regions which will increase the costs of milk production.","[Meyer, Johannes; Theuvsen, Ludwig] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Chair Agribusiness Adm, Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Meyer, J (通讯作者)，Georg August Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Chair Agribusiness Adm, Gottingen, Germany.",johannes.meyer@agr.uni-goettingen.de; theuvsen@uni-goettingen.de,,,,,,,17,1,1,0,0,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2787-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2017,,,,,,,219,225,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BJ1CL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417392400029,0

From a macroeconomic perspective, the relationship between the unemployment rate and job vacancy rate is represented by the Beveridge curve as an indicator of how well workers are matching with job vacancies in the economy. Although the theory assumes a negative slope of the Beveridge curve, in practice one can find different kinds of shapes. Beveridge curve dynamics can be distinguished between movements on the curve and shifts of the curve. In general, movements on the curve reflect cyclical changes, while movements of the curve are associated with changes in frictional unemployment, i.e. improvement or deteriorations in labour market matching. During the previous period of transition Macedonia has been affected by persistent unemployment that caused substantial human capital depreciation on the supply side. In addition, we have witnessed significant sectoral shifts on the demand side manifested by increased share of employment in the service sector. Although the recent labour market development shows signals of slight improvement in the matching process, many employers still face difficulties to hire workers with required skills. The problem of mismatch between labour supply and demand in Macedonia has been widely recognised, but up to the present it has not been explored by using the Beveridge curve. The aim of this paper is to explore the dynamics in the matching process in Macedonia by econometrically assessing the shifts of the Beveridge curve. For this purpose we use a quarterly time series data for the job vacancy rate and unemployment rate. The results might be used for designing appropriate policy recommendations that can be undertaken in order to improve the outcomes of the Macedonian labour market.","[Nikoloski, Dimitar; Angeleski, Marjan; Rocheska, Slavica] Univ St Kliment Ohridski, Fac Econ Prilep, Bitola, Macedonia",St. Clement of Ohrid University of Bitola,"Nikoloski, D (通讯作者)，Univ St Kliment Ohridski, Fac Econ Prilep, Bitola, Macedonia.",dimitar.nikoloski@uklo.edu.mk; marjan.angeleski@uklo.edu.mk; slavica.roceska@uklo.edu.mk,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,1,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2017,,,,,,,685,698,,,,,,14,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7PJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455302900043,0

The northern Arctic region is considered an important center of hydrocarbon production. Oil volume in the Arctic tundra today is more than 2.5 billion tonnes. Russia prioritizes this production area on account of several processes. Field development in the northern Arctic is relevant and timely.

The authors have selected primary factors related to the northern Timan-Pechora Province conditions. Seven groups of factors were selected, matrices for each group were developed to identify prioritized external factors. At that stage, intercorrelation coefficients were defined to exclude dependent factors from the model. Expert analysis of matrices demonstrates anticipated probability of strategic factors and the degree of their potential effect when developing deposits. Qualitative assessment of factors was made with the analytic hierarchy process method.

Also, the aim of this paper is to determine the impact of the restructuring process on the efficiency and effectiveness of the company's business. The paper presents the problems that arise in the process of restructuring as well as from global flows, forms and models of business restructuring of the company. Unlike most developed countries and even developing countries, the restructuring processes in BiH are rather slow, but they represent the inevitability of most domestic companies, especially those that have a prospect for a successful business. The paper is based on the results of the research, the effects of restructuring of companies in the world and in BiH, as well as the comparative analysis of available literature. Special attention is paid to the effects of corporate restructuring in domestic and foreign ownership. Research findings show that through corporate restructuring strategies, they can lead to corporate healing and increased efficiency and effectiveness of the business. Also, it was found that the effects of restructuring of a company in foreign ownership are better than the effects of the restructuring of a company in domestic ownership.","[Omic, Jasmin] Belamionix Ltd, Brcko, Bosnia & Herceg",,"Omic, J (通讯作者)，Belamionix Ltd, Brcko, Bosnia & Herceg.",omic.jasmin@bih.net.ba,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,1,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2017,,,,,,,236,247,,,,,,12,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7PJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455302900014,0

The Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is a mathematical programming technique that measures the efficiency of a decision-making unit (DMU) relative to other similar DMUs with the simple restriction that all DMUs lie on or below the efficiency frontier. The motivation for this paper is the fact that most of empirical studies used the static DEA models to estimate the banking efficiency. A weakness of this traditional models is that the efficiency results are not intertemporal comparable and these models do not capture the effect of carry-over activities between two consecutive time periods. In order to overcome this problem we use the Dynamic DEA model for efficiency evaluation of banking sectors in selected CEE counties. We analyzed dynamic efficiency of the commercial banks. With the line with intermediation approach we chose labor, fixed assets and deposits as inputs and loans, net interest income and net fee and commissions as outputs. The results show that Slovenia banking sector was the most efficient and large banks in the banking sector were more efficient then medium-sized and small banks.","[Paleckova, Iveta] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Finance & Accounting, Univ Namesti 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Paleckova, I (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Finance & Accounting, Univ Namesti 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic.",paleckova@opf.slu.cz,"Paleckova, Iveta/J-6439-2015","Paleckova, Iveta/0000-0003-2381-0738",Czech Science Foundation [GACR 16-17796S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),Research behind this paper was supported by the Czech Science Foundation within the project GACR 16-17796S 'Affiliation with financial conglomerate as a determinant of performance and risk of banks'.,,27,0,0,0,4,EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"UNIV ECONOMICS, EKONOMICKA UNIVERZITA & BRATISLAVE, DOLNOZEMSKA CESTA 1, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-4362-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,203,+,,,,,,5,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI4MO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000411851600026,0

Firstly, we found the most pronounced correlation between the number of innovative products, works and services in the total amount of shipped goods, performed activities and technological innovation costs per one person. This demonstrates the need for planning and implementing state programs on raising intellectual capital in multicultural regions with traditional economics. Secondly, we have identified clear interdependence between the number of smaller enterprises per 1000 people and the share of Russian people in ethnically aboriginal regions. Therefore, the influence of the Russian nationality ensures formation of entrepreneurial culture in aboriginal regions and continuous development of intellectual capital. Thirdly, there is a correlation between life expectancy and population density in aboriginal regions. This demonstrates low level of life in the regions with low population density and strong influence of traditional economy. Creation of hi - tech companies and larger amounts of goods fabrication requires creation of local unions, developing the share of scientists and entrepreneurs and formation of government programs: these are the most important success factors. To achieve that we must create a cooperation program covering all parties participating in intellectual capital development in the region. State regulation of intellectual capital development must take into consideration peculiar features of social and cultural development of aboriginal region strongly influenced by traditional economy. This direction of regional development will be available only in case of equal dialogue between business and authorities. Suggested options for using traditional knowledge for developing intellectual capital can improve economic position of the region, create new workplaces and, therefore, improve the level of life of population in the regions strongly influenced by traditional economy.","[Popov, Evgeny; Vlasov, Maxim] Ural Fed Univ, Ekaterinburg, Russia; [Popov, Evgeny] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Econ, Ural Branch, Ekaterinburg, Russia",Ural Federal University; Institute of Economics of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences; Russian Academy of Sciences,"Popov, E (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, Ekaterinburg, Russia.",epopov@mail.ru; mvlasov@mail.ru,"Попов, Евгений Васильевич/H-3358-2015; Vlasov, Maxim/K-5206-2017","Vlasov, Maxim/0000-0002-3763-327X","Russian Science Foundation at Udmurt State University (Izhevsk, Russia) [15-18-00049]; Act 211 Government of the Russian Federation [02.A03.21.0006]","Russian Science Foundation at Udmurt State University (Izhevsk, Russia)(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)); Act 211 Government of the Russian Federation","The study was financially supported by the Russian Science Foundation at Udmurt State University (Izhevsk, Russia) project No15-18-00049.; The work was supported by Act 211 Government of the Russian Federation, contract No 02.A03.21.0006.",,15,0,0,0,3,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-911218-31-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2017,,,,,,,247,253,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI0KF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404891000031,0

Reducing methane emissions will both slow anthropogenic climate change and reduce ozone-related mortality. We estimate the benefits of reducing methane emissions anywhere in the world for ozone-related premature mortality globally and for eight geographic regions. Our methods are consistent with those used by the US Government to estimate the social cost of carbon (SCC). We find that the global short- and long-term premature mortality benefits due to reduced ozone production from methane mitigation are (2011) $790 and $1775 per tonne methane, respectively. These correspond to approximately 70 and 150 % of the valuation of methane's global climate impacts using the SCC after extrapolating from carbon dioxide to methane using global warming potential estimates. Results for monetized benefits are sensitive to a number of factors, particularly the choice of elasticity to income growth used when calculating the value of a statistical life. The benefits increase for emission years further in the future. Regionally, most of the global mortality benefits accrue in Asia, but 10 % accrue in the United States. This methodology can be used to assess the benefits of methane emission reductions anywhere in the world, including those achieved by national and multinational policies.","[Sarofim, Marcus C.] US EPA, 6207A,1200 Penn Ave NW, Washington, DC 20460 USA; [Waldhoff, Stephanie T.] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Joint Global Change Res Inst, College Pk, MD USA; [Anenberg, Susan C.] Environm Hlth Analyt LLC, Washington, DC USA",United States Environmental Protection Agency; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory,"Sarofim, MC (通讯作者)，US EPA, 6207A,1200 Penn Ave NW, Washington, DC 20460 USA.",Sarofim.marcus@epa.gov; Stephanie.waldhoff@pnnl.gov; susan.anenberg@airhealthanalytics.com,,"Anenberg, Susan/0000-0002-9668-603X; Sarofim, Marcus/0000-0001-7753-1676",U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,U.S. Environmental Protection Agency(United States Environmental Protection Agency),"The authors would like to thank Neal Fann, Amy Lamson, Bryan Hubbell, Jason West, and Steve Smith for reviews and comments on drafts of this paper.

Using sample set of the Czech households in the period 2009-2012, we analyse the motivations for deciding whether to move house or age in place. Our results show that elderly households prefer homeownership to rental housing and do move even less frequently than other Czech households. Primary motives for moving the house are family reasons. During the analysed period, however, financial reasons for moving come into the discussion. On the other hand, the quality of housing or (un) availability of services seems not to be an incentive for moving.","[Spalkova, Dagmar; Spalek, Jiri] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Spalková, D (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno, Czech Republic.",dasa@econ.muni.cz; jiri.spalek@econ.muni.cz,"Špalková, Dagmar/JWO-4070-2024; Špalková, Dagmar/H-6423-2013; Špalek, Jiří/J-9210-2012","Špalková, Dagmar/0000-0001-6977-1426; Špalek, Jiří/0000-0001-5832-4946",,,,,15,0,0,0,12,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",2336-1239,,978-80-210-8448-3,CURR TREND PUB SECT,,,2017,,,,,,,394,401,,,,,,8,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BH7FG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402427100051,0

Based on our analysis, we concluded that the US market is more efficient than the European one. The main reason is the fact that the capital market in Europe is too diverse. As the cluster analysis has shown, there are also EU member countries whose exchanges are as effective as those of the US, but also those that are lagging behind. The European Commission is therefore seeking to promote closer financial integration within the member countries and to build a Capital market Union, thereby encouraging the growth of investment activities between countries, creating new jobs and increasing employment, or expanding the possibilities of acquiring alternative funds for new companies. Capital market Union would support and promote deeper economic integration of the EU, as well as create a competitive environment for the world's largest stock exchanges.","[Suchy, Erik] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Banking & Investment, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Suchy, E (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Banking & Investment, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia.",erik.suchy@tuke.sk,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,2,"TECHNICAL UNIV KOSICE, FAC ECONOMICS",KOSICE,"RAMPOVA 1731-7, KOSICE, DZUNGL A-DZUNGL A 040 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-553-2906-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,725,732,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO1YB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000503056700074,0

This paper, however, cautions not to have too high expectations of transferring responsibilities for land administration and dispute resolution to local government bodies. Field research in Mbarara District in south-western Uganda brings out how decentralization has limited impacts in terms of localizing land services provision. Nonetheless, local land governance has transformed in important ways, as decentralization adds to institutional multiplicity, and fuels competition among state and non-state authorities, and about the rules they apply. Rather than strengthening local mechanisms for securing tenure, the reforms introduce new forms of tenure insecurity, fail to transform local conventions of dealing with land disputes and delegitimize local mechanisms for securing tenure. In practice, decentralization has had limited effects in securing tenure for the rural poor, yet reinforces the presence of the state at the local level in diverse ways.","[van Leeuwen, Mathijs] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, Ctr Int Conflict Anal & Management, POB 9108, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands; [van Leeuwen, Mathijs] Leiden Univ, African Studies Ctr, Leiden, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen; Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC,"van Leeuwen, M (通讯作者)，Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, Ctr Int Conflict Anal & Management, POB 9108, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands.;van Leeuwen, M (通讯作者)，Leiden Univ, African Studies Ctr, Leiden, Netherlands.",m.vanleeuwen@fm.ru.nl,,"van Leeuwen, Mathijs/0000-0002-1994-2626",,,,,69,16,17,1,25,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Employing basic and modified (extended) gravity models, and using data from the 2000 and 2010 Population Censuses and the 2005 Intercensal Population Survey, we test Long's (1985) hypothesis that in the early stages of population redistribution, economic development is positively related to a concentration of the population. Using per-capita GDP as a proxy for income and as an indicator of economic development, we find that migration in Indonesia is indeed directed towards more developed regions. This finding supports the notion that regional disparities in development are an important factor in interregional migration in Indonesia. In line with classical gravity models, our findings show that distance is negatively related to the size of migration flows. However, unlike previous studies of interprovincial migration in Indonesia, we find that the effect of distance has weakened over time. Artikel ini menelaah faktor-faktor penyebab migrasi antardaerah di Indonesia. Dengan menggunakan model gravitasi standar dan yang sudah dimodifikasi, serta menggunakan data dari Sensus Penduduk 2000 dan 2010 dan Survei Penduduk Antar Sensus 2005, penulis menguji hipotesis Long (1985) yang menyatakan bahwa pada tahap-tahap awal redistribusi populasi, pembangunan ekonomi berhubungan positif dengan konsentrasi populasi. Dengan menggunakan PDB per kapita sebagai representasi pendapatan dan indikator pembangunan ekonomi, penulis menemukan bahwa migrasi di Indonesia sesungguhnya diarahkan ke daerah-daerah yang lebih maju. Temuan ini mendukung pendapat bahwa disparitas regional pada pembangunan merupakan faktor yang penting dalam migrasi interregional di Indonesia. Sejalan dengan model gravitasi klasik, temuan kami menunjukkan bahwa jarak memiliki hubungan negatif dengan ukuran arus migrasi.

The concentration of farming activities referred to as an agro-cluster' generates opportunities for income and employment in a given region and its surrounding area. We analyse the link between poverty rates and agro-clusters by accounting for spatial spillovers. To quantify agroclusters, we employ one input-oriented and one output-oriented measure. Our analysis applies six spatial econometric specifications and focuses on 545 subdistricts of West Java, where about 10% of the population live in poverty. We find that the concentration of agricultural employment substantially reduces poverty in a subdistrict as well as in neighbouring subdistricts. We also find that specialisation in crop outputs has positive impacts on poverty reduction and that localisation externalities are fundamental to agriculture's success. These findings imply that policy interventions may be applied in a spatially selective manner because they will generate spatial-spillover effects on poverty reduction in surrounding areas.","[Wardhana, Dadan] Wageningen Univ & Res, Govt Bandung Regency, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Ihle, Rico; Heijman, Wim] Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research,"Wardhana, D (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ & Res, Govt Bandung Regency, Wageningen, Netherlands.",,"Wardhana, Dadan/ISS-0491-2023; Ihle, Rico/AAI-9565-2020; Wardhana, Dadan/ABD-3324-2020","Wardhana, Dadan/0000-0002-0554-0343; Ihle, Rico/0000-0002-7970-7054;",Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP); government of West Java,Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP); government of West Java,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the funding provided by the Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP).

During the planning process for this network the blueprint for American urban freeway systems was set in 1955 by a federal document called the Yellow Book. This provided about 100 maps of cities with planned urban freeway locations for the Interstate Highway System. A set of three basic network patterns were applied to these cities based on their size and location. In the half century since 1955 urban freeways in the Interstate System have expanded from a planned 2000 miles to over 16,600 miles, along with another 11,500 miles of non-Interstate freeways. The number of large metropolitan areas has increased tremendously while the monocentric commuting patterns of have been transformed. This paper eitplores how these urban freeway systems were applied to the country's urban geography of the 1950s and how they have adapted to changing populations and other transformations in American metropolitan areas in the last half century.

In this paper, the sudden stops of international capital flows and the return ratio volatility of Shanghai Stock Market are chosen as research objects, in order to analyze the impacts of sudden stops on stock market. After building statistical models, it is found that the sudden stops of capital inflow have a positive impact on the volatility of stock market. That is, if the inflow of international capital suddenly stops, or relatively large quantity of outflow appears, positive fluctuations in stock market will happen. But the inverse relationship does not exist. The high volatility of stock market can not cause sudden stops of international capital flows. Finally, relevant suggestions are put forward according to the conclusions of this study.","[Xing, Junwei] Liaoning Prov Party Sch CPC, Res Inst Prov Condit, Shenyang, Liaoning, Peoples R China",,"Xing, JW (通讯作者)，Liaoning Prov Party Sch CPC, Res Inst Prov Condit, Shenyang, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,3,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-382-1,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,48.0,,,,,,91,97,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI9GL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416078200019,0

This article explores the relative importance of government incentives in influencing automotive corporations' decisions to invest in Canada on the basis of a data analysis of investment incentives in Canada and the. United States, a case study of Toyota's decision to invest in the Woodstock assembly plant, and a series of interviews with industry and government stakeholders. Our article concludes that although locational costs are a major determinant of investment decisions, the corporate decision to build a new assembly plant is a multimillion-dollar long-term investment with considerable risks. In assessing the risks and estimated costs of these investments, we found evidence of major variances between companies in what determined their decision. Although incentives were usually important, our research points to the influence on investment decisions of soft factors, including the structural relationship between the home office and branch plant; leadership of branch plant operations; and relationships between actors, in particular between corporate actors at headquarters and the branch plant, different levels of government, and government and corporate actors. Finally, we show that institutional fragmentation, including competition within and between different levels and branches of government, can erode policy effectiveness when governments attempt to attract foreign capital.","[Yates, Charlotte] Univ Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada; [Lewchuk, Wayne] McMaster Univ, Sch Labour Studies, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Lewchuk, Wayne] McMaster Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, ON, Canada",University of Guelph; McMaster University; McMaster University,"Yates, C (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada.",,,,,,,,30,6,7,0,11,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

As the same time, the field where insurance fund is allowed to invest in becomes broader and broader. Therefore, asset and liability management of life insurance company becomes the focus of investigator. Early methods of asset and liability management conclude majorly cash flow matching, immunization strategy and gap analysis and so on. While these models could not obtain optimum solution on the whole level, so we turn to multi-objective programming. The result of multi-objective programming for the same question could be more than one, which affects the sensitivity analysis in some degree. Gravity model could obtain the only one optimum solution. Thus we consider do some research of gravity model. At first, we make analysis of asset and liability of insurance industry, laying a foundation for asset and liability management. Then we compare interest term structure of C-ROSS with Solvency II and make improvement of interest term structure of C-ROSS. Next we try to establish the asset and liability management model based on the gravity model. By the way, this model adopts improved model of interest term structure. The research results indicate that SW method has some advantages over 750 days method, which is closer to actual interest rate. Also, the gravity model is available on asset and liability management, therefore has certain theoretical value and practical significance. This model could help address the mismatching problems in the traditional method and minimize the enterprise risk of life insurance company.","[Zhang Lin; Cheng Yuqi] Hunan Univ, Sch Finance & Stat, Changsha 410079, Hunan, Peoples R China",Hunan University,"Zhang, L (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ, Sch Finance & Stat, Changsha 410079, Hunan, Peoples R China.",lindazhang0203@126.com; chengyuqi985@gmail.com,"xin, li/JCO-3925-2023",,,,,,7,0,0,0,1,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,,,,,2017,,,,,,,810,820,,,,,,11,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK8HD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000442810700055,0

This paper is a review and analysis of the implementation process of the Balanced Scorecard of China Resources Group, and summarizes its successful experiences and provides reference for other enterprises.","[Zhou, Min] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Science & Technology,"Zhou, M (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,9,0,0,1,10,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-437-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,32.0,,,,,,239,244,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6HK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426689600050,0

The study employs a Generalized Method of Moments technique using data from 53 African countries during the period from 2004 to 2011 to examine this linkage. Information sharing channels are theoretically designed to promote the formal financial sector and discourage the informal financial sector. The study uses two information sharing channels: private credit bureaus and public credit registries. The study found that both information sharing channels have a positive and significant impact on financial access. The study also found that public credit registries complement the formal financial sector to promote financial access.

As many people today are aware of the exhaustion of resources, ethical codes as well as working standards, CSR has become a strong competitive tool. Additionally, with the global increase in economy, e-commerce users have come to be regarded favourably in terms of environmental friendliness, with e-commerce becoming a popular tool of purchase. However, previous research offers little understanding about the relationship between CSR and e-commerce. To shed some light on this issue, two questionnaire surveys and interviews with seven managers of selected companies were conducted in the Czech Republic. The participants in the first study were e-commerce customers (N = 207), and the second study was aimed at SMEs in e-commerce (N = 63). The research shows that the implementation of CSR may influence sales positively. The findings also indicate that consumers prefer companies with CSR as well as the necessity of good implementation of CSR in the company process by managers. The most discussed issue of CSR by SMEs managers concerned working standards. The research also shows big differences between formal acceptance and certified SNIEs for CSR. CSR is not only a competitive advantage but also one of the ways to maintain sustainable corporate development with ethical codes and transparent corporate policy.","[Bartok, Otto] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Dept Management & Mkt, Zlin, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Bartok, O (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Dept Management & Mkt, Zlin, Czech Republic.",bartok@fame.utb.cz,"Bartók, Ottó/AAZ-8277-2020",,Internal Grant Agency of FaME [IGA/FaME/2018/002],Internal Grant Agency of FaME,The author would like to thank the Internal Grant Agency of FaME for providing financial support for this research.

This is not only the consequence of the inadequacy of mainstream macroeconomics, and specifically the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) workhorse model, to forecast such a huge event, or at least to detect the worrying tendencies towards it. Even more relevant is the choice to explicitly avoid the modeling of large crises (that for someone is a motivation for not attacking pre-crisis DSGE models focused on the analysis of small deviations from the steady-state), so denying the intrinsic nature of capitalism, a system that necessarily proceeds through cycles and (extended) crises. The replies of the DSGE approach to critics have led to extensions regarding for instance the role of financial frictions, heterogeneous agents, and bounded rationality (though typically in the form of quasirational expectations). The alternative paradigm of agent-based (AB) macroeconomics can take into account all these elements at once within an evolutionary modeling framework based on heterogeneity and interaction, so capable to endogenously reproduce complex dynamics, from small fluctuations to large crises, due to innovation and industrial dynamics, rising inequality and financial instability, and so on. The integration between AB macroeconomics and the (post-Keynesian) stock-flow consistent approach represents a promising way for the future development of this research field.","[Caverzasi, Eugenio; Russo, Alberto] Univ Politecn Marche, Piazza Roma 22, I-60121 Ancona, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University,"Russo, A (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, Piazza Roma 22, I-60121 Ancona, Italy.",eu.caver@gmail.com; alberto.russo@univpm.it,"Caverzasi, Eugenio/AFN-0951-2022; Russo, Alberto/AAG-8317-2020","Caverzasi, Eugenio/0000-0003-0194-8170",,,,,111,8,8,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Using two approaches - consolidating the minority owned affiliates with the parent or deducting equity investments in minority ownership from the parent's capital - we find that the effective capitalization ratios of small US bank holding companies (BHCs) are substantially lower than the reported ratios. Empirical evidence suggests that the effectively lower capitalization ratios are associated with higher riskiness at the BHC level. Capital adjustments following pro forma consolidation better capture the additional risks than capital adjustments in the form of equity deductions for investments in minority-owned affiliates. These findings have important implications for the regulation of bank capital. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this study was to describe and analyze the processes involved in young, married women's negotiations of control over cash inside the extended household in a contemporary rural Nepali setting. We conducted a grounded theory study of 42 households from the Plains of Nepal. Our study uncovered multiple ways in which junior wives and husbands in the extended household became secret allies in seeking financial autonomy from the rule of the mother-in-law to the wife. This included secretly saving up for a household separation from the in-laws. We argue these secret financial strategies constitute a means for junior couples to renegotiate the terms of Kandiyoti's (1988) 'patriarchal bargain' wherein junior wives traditionally had to accept subservience to their husband and mother-in-law in exchange for economic security and eventual authority over their own daughters-in-law. Researchers, activists and policy-makers concerned with women's economic empowerment in comparable contexts should consider the impact of intergenerational power relations on women's control over cash.

IP payments are used for profit shifting within a group of companies to lower their tax burden. One of the latest important developments in the use of IP boxes is the changing attitude of the OECD and its nexus approach, the application of which influences taxation within an IP box, especially the treatment of expenditures. This paper focuses on the situation regarding IP boxes after the implementation of the modified nexus approach, with an emphasis on changing the tax burden. These changes affect tax planning, thus managers need to know how they affect the overall tax burden of a company's investments. As a measure of these changes, the effective average tax rate (EATR) was selected. This study concentrates on three countries which have applied this approach: Hungary, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The results indicate that there is a new dependence after the application of the modified nexus approach: the structure of IP expenditures. The implementation of nexus approach makes the statutory income tax rate important also for IP income, and it causes a higher tax burden on IP income in the case of a small share of IP qualifying expenditures. A significant importance of the statutory corporate tax rate for the taxation of IP income is shown by changes in EATRs related to IP income after a reduction in corporate tax rates in Hungary and in the United Kingdom in 2017.","[Jedlicka, Vit] Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Business Econ & Management, Pardubice, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Jedlicka, V (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Business Econ & Management, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",vit.jedlicka@upce.cz,"Jedlička, Vít/HLH-1399-2023","Jedlička, Vít/0000-0002-8328-2351",,,,,27,4,4,0,11,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

We find that the impact of the legislation has fallen short of expectations both in terms of the volume of CSR expenditure generated and the activities to which it has been directed. In particular, we find that the legislation has had a negative corporate profitability which can impact on the willingness of companies to spend in this area. We conclude that greater care must be taken when implementing mandatory CSR if it is to be effective.","[Mukherjee, Abhishek; Duppati, Geeta] Freedom Inst Higher Educ, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Bird, Ron] Waikato Sch Management, Finance Discipline, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Bird, Ron] Univ Technol Sydney, IMR Program, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Technology Sydney,"Bird, R (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, IMR Program, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",ron.bird@uts.edu.au,"Duppati, Geeta/JJD-2659-2023; DUPPATI, GEETA/H-9504-2015; Mukherjee, Abhishek/AAC-9441-2019","DUPPATI, GEETA/0000-0002-7429-6057; Mukherjee, Abhishek/0000-0002-5401-5625",,,,,75,42,42,3,30,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1815-5669,,,J CONTEMP ACCOUNT EC,J.

Subjects were more risk taking for higher levels of measured electrodermal activity (skin conductance). In line with descriptive theories of risky choice, the effect was most pronounced for choices involving losses rather than gains. Taken together, our findings indicate that participants under time pressure rely on affect at the point of decision-making.

Findings The empirical results reveal that terrorism in the OPEC affects positively oil returns and negatively its volatility. Results also show that the different characteristics of the attacks are likely to have different impact on the return and volatility of oil prices. In overall terms, terrorism has a much larger positive impact on the return of oil prices and negative impact on its volatility if it targets the oil industry in the OPEC.

Design/methodology/approach The study is conducted in Assam, India, and uses a quasi-experiment design to gather primary data. Heckman two-stage procedure and type 3 Tobit model are used to evaluate the rural credit demand. Findings It is observed that, in general, rural households' credit demand is influenced by the ability and capacity to work, the value of physical assets of the borrowers as well as some other lenders' and borrowers' specific factors. But, the direction of causality of the factors influencing borrowers' credit demand is remarkably different across credit sources. Research limitations/implications The study recommends that it is possible to provide an efficient credit demand estimate through a correct theoretical and econometric framework. The possible limitation of the study can be due to the exclusion of the role of traditional community based organizations in rural Assam while evaluating the credit demand, and therefore, this limitation is left to future research. Originality/value The study contributes to the literature by assessing the probable differences among formal, semiformal and informal credit sources with respect to rural credit demand.","[Das, Tiken] Indian Inst Publ Hlth, Shillong, Meghalaya, India",,"Das, T (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Publ Hlth, Shillong, Meghalaya, India.",tikenhyd@gmail.com,"Das, Tiken/AAA-4731-2022","Das, Tiken/0000-0003-4597-4135",,,,,55,1,1,2,9,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Banks have adopted various measures to quicken their business activity and also save cost and time. That is why there has been large requirement of IT in the banking sector. The question arises whether this investment is enhancing the profitability of the bank or not. The purpose of this paper is to examine the presence of profitability paradox in Indian Banking Sector. Design/methodology/approach Data are collected from ten nationalized banks and three private sector banks from 2006 to 2013. The impact of IT expenditure on return on assets and profit efficiency is examined. Profit efficiency is determined using Stochastic Frontier Analysis. Data are collected from annual reports of the banks. Data on IT expenditure are collected through Right to Information Act 2005. Correlation and Panel Regression are used to investigate the relationship between IT expenditure and ROE or Profit Efficiency. Findings The findings of the paper confirm the presence of profitability paradox in the Indian Banking sector. Research limitations/implications Extension of this study to other developing countries of the world will help to identify if any common pattern is there among the developing countries as far as productivity or profitability paradox is concerned. Originality/value There are some studies on the impact of IT on the banking sector in USA and Europe. This type of study however is rare in the context of India or for that matter other developing countries. Therefore, this paper will add new dimension to the existing literature and pave the way for future research in this area.","[Gupta, Sangita Dutta] Inst Finance & Int Management, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Raychaudhuri, Ajitava; Haldar, Sushil Kumar] Jadavpur Univ, Dept Econ, Kolkata, India",Jadavpur University,"Gupta, SD (通讯作者)，Inst Finance & Int Management, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.",sangitadgpt@gmail.com; ajitava1@gmail.com; sushil.haldar@gmail.com,"Raychaudhuri, Ajitava/S-6318-2019; Gupta, Sangita Dutta/AAS-1800-2020",,,,,,48,27,27,3,19,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

The purpose of this paper is to assist MNEs to adapt to these markets, and adopt corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategy with social initiatives (SIs), relevant to stakeholders, including their employees and the communities they reside in. The current paper does this by examining the relationships between employee identification with the organization's SIs (SI-I) and their engagement in them (SI-E), alongside their perspective on the general importance of CSR (ICSR) and employee values to help with CSR (VCSR). The findings will better prepare managers in pre-emerging and emerging markets to design CSR strategy and SIs relevant to these markets and their communities. Design/methodology/approach Guided by social identity theory, this paper examines local employee identification of SI (SI-I) and engagement in SI (SI-E), in two MNE subsidiaries across varying emerging market levels in developing countries, utilizing a quantitative survey design. Structural equation modeling is utilized to analyze responses of N=544 employees in two South East Asian countries, namely, Indonesia (as an emerging country) and Vietnam (as a pre-emerging country), to determine any differences that may exist between the two countries. Findings The findings reveal that SI identification (SI-I) has a strong effect on employee engagement in SIs (SI-E) and also the importance they attach to organizations conducting CSR (ICSR). However, employee values to help with CSR activities (VCSR) has an effect on Vietnamese employees but not Indonesian employees. Likewise, SI-I mediates the effect between ICSR and SI-E for Vietnamese employees but not for Indonesian, suggesting differences exist between these two developing countries where the less developed country, Vietnam, is defined as pre-emerging and Indonesia as an emerging market (MSCI, 2016). Practical implications An awareness of the differences that may exist across employees in emerging markets will assist managers to design CSR strategy relevant to the level of market emergence of the host country, allowing for better CSR SIs identification and engagement in these countries. Originality/value The research model for this analysis utilizes constructs based on past Identification literature, while including new constructs for this study adapted from past literature, and underpinned uniquely by social identity theory in an International Business setting. The findings indicate differences between emerging and pre-emerging markets for particular constructs, which suggests the importance of considering the market level when implementing MNE CSR strategy. Limited research has been conducted examining the differences between emerging and pre-emerging markets, so further research is required to replicate these findings and provide insight into the differences that may exist for CSR SIs in emerging markets.","[Munro, Virginia; Rundle-Thiele, Sharyn] Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Nathan, Qld, Australia; [Arli, Denni] Griffith Univ, Dept Mkt, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University,"Munro, V (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Nathan, Qld, Australia.",munro.coms@gmail.com; d.arli@griffith.edu.au; s.rundle-thiele@griffith.edu.au,"Rundle-Thiele, Sharyn/S-5951-2019; Arli, Denni/AAK-4715-2021","Arli, Denni/0000-0002-6320-3994",,,,,133,25,27,1,31,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Our model matches the volatility of Taiwan's housing prices and housing transactions during 2011-2015, when the loan-to-value ratio was reduced and a transfer tax along with a property tax were collected. The calibration results indicate that imposing a residential property tax or raising interest rates effectively curbs speculative housing transactions and has prolonged effects on taming housing prices over time. Transfer tax imposition or a decrease in the loan-to-value ratio has short-lived effects on moderating housing markets.","[Chu, Shiou-Yen] Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Econ, Chiayi, Taiwan",National Chung Cheng University,"Chu, SY (通讯作者)，168 Univ Rd, Chiayi 62102, Taiwan.",ecdsyc@ccu.edu.tw,,"Chu, Shiou-Yen/0000-0002-6427-0451",,,,,21,10,10,3,13,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

Specifically, using institutional ownership to proxy for institutional monitoring, we find that aggregate institutional ownership is negatively associated with deviations from hypothesized leverage targets and the negative relationship is driven by long-term institutions that are better positioned to influence corporate debt policies due to the nature of such efforts. We also find that our results are more evident in firms with low information asymmetry, which provide greater monitoring benefits due to perceived lower monitoring costs. These findings are consistent with monitoring institutions actively seeking to maintain a certain debt level and thus suggest its existence. We show that reductions in leverage deviation lead to better future firm performance, indicating institutional monitoring is effective in creating shareholder value. Our results are robust after controlling for measures of internal governance and invariant to alternative proxies for institutional monitoring.","[Chung, Chune Young] Chung Ang Univ, Sch Business Adm, Coll Business & Econ, 84 Heukseok Ro, Seoul 156756, South Korea; [Liu, Chang] Hawaii Pacific Univ, Dept Financial Econ & Informat Syst, Coll Business, 900 Ft St Mall,Suite 600, Honolulu, HI 96813 USA; [Wang, Kainan] Univ Toledo, Dept Finance, Coll Business & Innovat, Toledo, OH 43606 USA",Chung Ang University; University System of Ohio; University of Toledo,"Chung, CY (通讯作者)，Chung Ang Univ, Sch Business Adm, Coll Business & Econ, 84 Heukseok Ro, Seoul 156756, South Korea.",bizfinance@cau.ac.kr; cliu@hpu.edu; kainan.wang@utoledo.edu,"Shingade, Sudam Shrikrushna/D-5452-2019",,,,,,66,11,11,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

Some stylized facts concern time series properties for each of the series but also across series. To achieve a useful and relevant dataset, we impute all missing values in the sample 1960-2015 using a new method based on postage stamps prices. This results in a balanced panel of annual figures from 1960 to and including 2015 for 47 countries. The key conclusion from our tour around various data properties is that differences across the country-specific series are substantially larger than their common properties. These differences concern features like peak inflation rates, years of peak inflation, correlation with worldwide inflation figures and country-specific persistence. In one word, there is no such thing as African inflation, and we recommend that models for inflation in an African country should be designed one by one. When we correlate inflation features in a cross section with country-specific conditions, we see that more democracy, less corruption, and less religious fractionalization associate with lower inflation rates.

The idea of 'the scheme' in African irrigation,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Irrigation; Schemes; Development; Africa; Malawi,WATER MANAGEMENT; LAND; INFRASTRUCTURE; PARTICIPATION; PARTNERSHIP; STATE,"Despite a growing recognition of the significance of farmer-led irrigation, externally engineered and induced schemes remain a popular model for irrigation development in sub-Saharan Africa. These have had a mixed record, and many have been widely critiqued. Nonetheless, schemes that were initiated under colonialism have been rehabilitated and new schemes are still being developed. This paper interrogates the continuing attraction of this model for irrigation, asking how and why it persists. Is the fact that engineering is so central to irrigation schemes another example of 'high modernism', as Scott might argue? Analysis of the history and current policy-making context of a new irrigation scheme in Malawi suggests a picture that is more complex, in which practical engineering considerations combine with narratives of modernisation and political imperatives to create momentum and lock-in. Understanding this, and why lessons from the past inadequately shape future-directed planning requires interrogation of the positionality of those involved, including state, donors and private sector actors and the political, economic and discursive fields in which they operate.

We characterize when an optimal environmental tax reform does not increase inequality, even if the tax system before the reform is optimal from a non-environmental point of view. If the tax system before the reform is calibrated to stylized dataand is thus non-optimalwe find that there is a large scope for inequality reduction, even if the government is restricted in its recycling options.","[Klenert, David; Schwerhoff, Gregor; Edenhofer, Ottmar; Mattauch, Linus] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Torgauer Str 12-15, D-10829 Berlin, Germany; [Klenert, David] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, POB 601203, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Klenert, David; Edenhofer, Ottmar] Tech Univ Berlin, Dept Econ Climate Change, Berlin, Germany; [Mattauch, Linus] Univ Oxford, Oxford Martin Sch, Inst New Econ Thinking, Oxford, England; [Mattauch, Linus] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Technical University of Berlin; University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Klenert, D (通讯作者)，Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Torgauer Str 12-15, D-10829 Berlin, Germany.;Klenert, D (通讯作者)，Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, POB 601203, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany.;Klenert, D (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Berlin, Dept Econ Climate Change, Berlin, Germany.",klenert@mcc-berlin.net; schwerhoff@mcc-berlin.net; edenhofer@pik-potsdam.de; linus.mattauch@ouce.ox.ac.uk,"Schwerhoff, Gregor/L-2365-2019; Edenhofer, Ottmar/E-1886-2013","Schwerhoff, Gregor/0000-0003-3644-3447; Edenhofer, Ottmar/0000-0001-6029-5208",,,,,43,33,34,6,49,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

In a market with insufficient liquidity, rapid changes in information induce selling pressure, therefore, this paper defines the prerequisite of a flash crash (large-scale decline in a short period of time) as when a market has insufficient liquidity and high price variability. Policy uncertainty provides an environment conducive to the occurrence of flash crashes. The paper examines the effect of economic policy uncertainty on the daily returns of the U.K. stock and foreign exchange markets. The results reveal that policy uncertainty is highly correlated with the risk of short-term, large-scale decline, which validates the theoretical inference of this paper. Although the timing at which extreme risks emerge is difficult to predict, this paper includes policy uncertainty as a factor to explain market conditions that can lead to flash crashes and remind traders to consider this factor when predicting the risk and value at risk of a market.

In this study, we derive a spatio-temporal dynamical model based on the Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) approach under the Musiela parametrization, which ensures an arbitrage-free model for electricity forward prices. The model is fitted to a unique data set of historical price forward curves. As a particular feature of the model, we disentangle the temporal from spatial (maturity) effects on the dynamics of forward prices, and shed light on the statistical properties of risk premia, of the noise volatility term structure and of the spatio-temporal noise correlation structures. We find that the short-term risk premia oscillates around zero, but becomes negative in the long run. We identify the Samuelson effect in the volatility term structure and volatility bumps, explained by market fundamentals. Furthermore we find evidence for coloured noise and correlated residuals, which we model by a Hilbert space-valued normal inverse Gaussian Levy process with a suitable covariance functional.

Four of the five studies illustrate how computable general equilibrium models are particularly well-suited, despite their relatively limited past use, to the analysis of natural resources.

The studies underscore the extreme vulnerability that the introduction of significant natural resource revenues and climate change can create in developing countries.

J,"Dubb, A",,,,"Dubb, Alex",,,The value components of contract farming in contemporary capitalism,JOURNAL OF AGRARIAN CHANGE,,,English,Article,,,,,,contract farming; outgrower; petty commodity production; political economy,,"Contract farming (CF) has generally been understood as, essentially, a market institution-by both (approving) mainstream and (critical) radical perspectives. Analyses of relations of production have, meanwhile, tended towards a problematic peasantist frame, where contracts undermine farmer autonomy in processes of flexible corporate agro-industrial restructuring. This paper argues that a materialist analysis of CF from within capital-labour relations offers a stronger conceptual foundation for re-synthesizing questions of market-power. It first argues that radical notions of peasant subsumation conceptually mirror Marx's formal subsumption of capital but underplay dynamics of real subsumption accompanying capitalism's wider development. Drawing on the petty commodity production concept, it then argues that CF's flexibility rests in its differential content. CF's fungibility to contradictory movements of integration and dispersion enables it to emphasize different methods of surplus appropriation under shifting conditions; each corresponding to a different dominant social tendency. On the one hand, conditions of market expansion inspire integration for relative surplus appropriation through raised productivity, and CF tends to act as a tool of proletarianization in the wider centralization of capital. On the other, conditions of contraction motivate the dispersal of unvalorized capital, prompting efforts to raise absolute surplus appropriation, and CF tends to act as a tool of differentiation to concentrate agricultural capital.","[Dubb, Alex] Univ Western Cape, Inst Poverty Land & Agr Studies, 2nd Floor,Main Hall,Robert Sobukwe Rd, ZA-7535 Bellville, Western Cape, South Africa",University of the Western Cape,"Dubb, A (通讯作者)，Univ Western Cape, Inst Poverty Land & Agr Studies, 2nd Floor,Main Hall,Robert Sobukwe Rd, ZA-7535 Bellville, Western Cape, South Africa.",alexander.dubb@gmail.com,"Dubb, Alex/N-7045-2019","Dubb, Alex/0000-0003-3625-1322",,,,,61,3,3,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

The findings of this paper are supported by a qualitative ethnographic study conducted in the Spanish region of Andalusia, where local and regional government interventions have promoted policies in recent years to foster cycling. Grounded in theories on corporality, this paper highlights the social perceptions of the agents involved in such interventions and stresses the need to combine approaches that promote infrastructure with those that focus on embodied enculturation. The conclusions reached offer proposals aimed at strengthening the promotion of cycling in this area, with a view to overcoming the limited and discontinuous character of training and education observed so far.","[Jordi-Sanchez, Mario] Univ Pablo de Olavide, Dept Antropol Social Psicol Basica & Salud Publ, Ctra Utrera Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain",Universidad Pablo de Olavide,"Jordi-Sánchez, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pablo de Olavide, Dept Antropol Social Psicol Basica & Salud Publ, Ctra Utrera Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain.",amjordi@upo.es,"Jordi Sanchez, Mario/J-3399-2017","Jordi Sanchez, Mario/0000-0003-3115-8540",Regional Ministry of Development and Housing of the Andalusian Regional Government [GGI3001IDIX],Regional Ministry of Development and Housing of the Andalusian Regional Government,"This research is part of the project named Sustainable Mobility in Andalusia: Cycling Practices and Discourses (CICLA project), which is supported by supported Regional Ministry of Development and Housing of the Andalusian Regional Government (Grant Number GGI3001IDIX) and led by Dr. Macarena Hernandez at the University of Pablo de Olavide.

Some argue institutional investors who invest both in stock and commodity markets demolish the borders between these two seemingly unrelated markets and increase correlations, a recent phenomenon known as financialization. Yet, some others argue recently correlations have decreased back to historical levels and the increase between 2008 and 2012 was merely due to a business cycle effect. Our results do not support one side at the expense of the other but rather shows that both factors are important in explaining the correlations between agricultural commodities and stocks. Furthermore, we find that CITs prefer to go back to their circle of competence under scarce liquidity and thus correlations decrease back to levels absent institutions. Hence, low liquidity is a significant obstacle inhibiting financialization to occur. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We argue that the human capital of an entrepreneur, who launches (alone or with other teammates) an equity crowdfunding campaign to finance her start-up, constitutes a set of signals of the start-up quality. The impact of each human capital signal on entrepreneur's success in equity crowdfunding depends on both signal fit with start-up quality and signal ambiguity. Empirical estimates on 284 entrepreneurs who launched equity crowdfunding campaigns indicate that only entrepreneurs' business education and entrepreneurial experience, two human capital signals that have both a good fit with start-up quality and a low degree of ambiguity, significantly contribute to entrepreneurs' success in equity crowdfunding.","[Piva, Evila; Rossi-Lamastra, Cristina] Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, Via Lambruschini 4-B, I-20156 Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan,"Piva, E (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, Via Lambruschini 4-B, I-20156 Milan, Italy.",evila.piva@polimi.it; cristina1.rossi@polimi.it,,,,,,,87,129,137,15,136,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Drawing on the more recent history and applying a range of methods, the papers in this special issue confirm the view that growth in agriculture is on average more poverty reducing than an equivalent amount of growth outside agriculture. They also add important nuances to this broad empirical regularity, uncover a series of structural conditions that affect this relation, and show that different mechanisms to finance public investment to boost sectoral growth (deficit financing, taxation or aid) can have widely different impacts on poverty, a widely-ignored issue so far. They do so by going beyond the traditional agriculture-nonagriculture dichotomy, also looking at the subsectors and the differential effects of prices versus productivity. They further distinguish between production for home and market consumption, between modern, outward oriented and informal domestically - focused firms, as well as between secondary towns and cities.

Our empirical evidence shows that mutual fund herding is associated with a poor information environment and low disclosure quality. More importantly, mutual fund herding amplifies stock price crash risk afterwards. The main finding is concentrated on buy-herding rather than sell-herding. To mitigate the endogeneity concern, we use the 2004 SEC mutual fund disclosure regulation change as an exogenous shock and the results hold.

These estimates are a novel contribution, as estimates for men and women are scarce in the literature and estimates across immigrants' origins and lengths of stay are as yet unavailable. Furthermore, we estimate the employment gap as the differential in the number of employed weeks in the year between immigrants and natives, which has not been done before - this contrasts with the employment probability gap usually estimated in the literature. We also estimate the immigrant-native earnings gap across gender, across the entire earnings distribution, across continents of nationality and across lengths of stay. Estimates across the earnings distribution are also a novel contribution, as these are also as yet unavailable in the literature. Our main conclusion is that both the immigrant-native employment and earnings gaps vary across gender, continents of nationality and lengths of stay. Immigrant women earn more than native women throughout the distribution. The earnings gap is positive throughout for females: smaller at the bottom, larger at the top and relatively constant in the middle of the distribution. In contrast, it increases monotonically across the distribution for males: it is negative at the bottom and positive at the top. In the main, immigrants from Africa, Asia and the Middle East, Central and South America, and Eastern Europe suffer larger employment and earnings penalties, which are reduced as their length of stay increases. In contrast, immigrants from North America have a more favourable labour market experience.","[Lemos, Sara] Univ Leicester, Leicester, Leics, England",University of Leicester,"Lemos, S (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Leicester, Leics, England.",sl129@leicester.ac.uk,,,Department for Work and Pensions,Department for Work and Pensions,"The author thanks Gianni De Fraja, Jonathan Portes and Jerzy Szroeter.

First, we document the expenditure life-cycle profile in the United Kingdom and show how differences in the consumption bundle of retirees and workers translate into different inflation experiences. Albeit different in given years, the inflation experienced by the two groups is not significantly different over a long time period. We also show how the distribution of household inflation evolved over time, with particular emphasis on the period around the latest financial crisis. Second, we estimate an Exact Affine Stone Index (EASI) demand system and compute the change in the cost of living and the substitution effect for both retirees and workers for the period 1990-2014. Finally, we show how pension income would evolve during that period under three alternative indexation measures for different cohorts of retirees. The indexation measure that results in the highest pension income depends on the time of retirement.","[Lluberas, Rodrigo] Univ ORT Uruguay, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Lluberas, Rodrigo] Banco Cent Uruguay, Montevideo, Uruguay",University ORT Uruguay,"Lluberas, R (通讯作者)，Univ ORT Uruguay, Montevideo, Uruguay.;Lluberas, R (通讯作者)，Banco Cent Uruguay, Montevideo, Uruguay.",rlluberas@bcu.gub.uy,,,,,,,27,2,2,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

After discussing a make-or-buy literature review on 7 prestigious academic journals, the most relevant determinants and theories supported from the literature are identified and illustrated within this framework. The results are subsequently outlined, our research work concluding with a reflection on the extent to which this paper can improve the academic understanding of make-or-buy approaches.

However, an analysis of 490 U.S. dollar-denominated bonds issued by 53 emerging market sovereigns during 1990-2015 reveals that after the financial crisis of 2008, launch spreads of sovereign bonds issued under U.K. law have been higher than those issued under U.S. law, by 130 basis points for BB + bonds and 175 basis points for B - bonds. This effect was not significant for investment grade bonds. On average, bonds issued under U.K. law had weaker ratings and shorter tenors post-crisis. The post-crisis impact of governing law on sovereign bond spreads is not explained by collective action clauses, or first-time bond issuances. Instead, the difference seems to be related to the perception that U.S. law offers stronger investor protection, and that the investor base for bonds issued under U.S. law is larger than that for bonds issued under U.K. law. The difference in spreads persists in the secondary market even after 180 days, perhaps because of the lack of liquidity, as investors tend to buy and hold these more attractive bonds on a longer-term basis.","[Ratha, Dilip; De, Supriyo; Kurlat, Sergio] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"De, S (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",sde@worldbank.org,"De, Supriyo/Y-2492-2019; Ratha, Dilip/AAY-6419-2021","De, Supriyo/0000-0002-2075-7655; De, Supriyo/0000-0002-1260-2207",Research Support Budget of the World Bank [P161148],Research Support Budget of the World Bank,"Views expressed in this paper are the authors' own, and not those of the World Bank Group.

We conceptualize the group as a community, and the city as a social space. Assimilation increases the productivity of migrants and, consequently, their earnings. However, assimilation also brings the migrants closer in social space to the richer native inhabitants. This proximity subjects the migrants to relative deprivation. We consider a community of migrants whose members are at an equilibrium level of assimilation that was chosen as a result of the maximization of a utility function that has as its arguments income, the cost of assimilation effort, and a measure of relative deprivation. We ask how vulnerable this assimilation equilibrium is to the appearance of a mutant a member of the community who is exogenously endowed with a superior capacity to assimilate. If the mutant were to act on his enhanced ability, his earnings would be higher than those of his fellow migrants, which will expose them to greater relative deprivation. We find that the stability of the pre-mutation assimilation equilibrium depends on the cohesion of the migrants' community, expressed as an ability to effectively sanction and discourage the mutant from deviating. 'Fhe equilibrium level of assimilation of a tightly knit community is stable in the sense of not being vulnerable to the appearance of a member becoming better able to assimilate. However, if the community is loose-knit, the appearance of a mutant will destabilize the pre-mutation assimilation equilibrium, and will result in a higher equilibrium level of assimilation.

Given these platforms do not incur significant costs that vary with transaction prices, their use of ad valorem fees has been questioned. In this paper, using a model that connects ad valorem fees to third-degree price discrimination, we evaluate the welfare consequences of banning such fees.

Part of this exemption was abolished in 2004 to boost the labor supply of low-income married women. In this study, I examine how the 2004 tax reform in Japan affected the work-hour distribution of married women. The reform created a new kink at 1.05 million yen on the budget line, which made the conventional income threshold of around 1 million yen more evident. First, I theoretically show that this change in the shape of the budget line due to the tax reform could influence even medium- to high-income wives presumed to be unaffected by the tax reform. More concretely, under certain conditions, there are cases in which some medium- to high-income wives reduce their income to just below the conventional threshold when they experience some exogenous shocks that could discourage them from working long hours. Relatively new decomposition methods, as well as quantile difference-in-differences estimations, all confirm that the tax reform increased the work hours among low-income married women. In addition, some medium- to high-income married women greatly reduced their income to just below the conventional income threshold in response to an increase in their husbands' income after the tax reform. This evidence indicates that this behavior of medium- to high-income wives could be due to an enhanced awareness of the conventional income thresholds. It also implies the importance of knowing and understanding the potential impact of the tax reform on those who are not the target of it, as well as the conditions under which the discontinuous income drop among medium- to high-income wives is likely to occur.","[Yokoyama, Izumi] Hitotsubashi Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 2-1 Naka, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868601, Japan",Hitotsubashi University,"Yokoyama, I (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 2-1 Naka, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868601, Japan.",izumi.yokoyama@r.hit-u.ac.jp,"Yokoyama, Izumi/T-8665-2017","Yokoyama, Izumi/0000-0003-4661-2670",[15K20998],,"This research is supported by the Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (15K20998, PI: Izumi Yokoyama).

The analysis was performed for 24 biotech companies in this branch considered during 2002-2014, based on several indicators available on the Thomson Reuters database. The financial performance was measured through the return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE) and the debt-to-equity ratio (DE). In order to capture the intellectual capital, the focus was on a designing a new indicator, proposed by the authors, respectively the efficiency of research and development expenditures (ECD), along with another proxy, previously attested by the literature and reflected through the market to-book ratio (MTB). The research methodology resides on applying the correlation method, robust regression, and structural equations modelling (SEM). The results reveal a significant negative relationship between ROA, ROE and MTB, which contradicts the literature and suggests that, for this particular type of companies, MTB isn't relevant to express the intellectual capital. MTB was positively correlated with DE. When we used the ECD, the results attested a strongly positive and significant relation with ROA and ROE, and a negative one with DE. Therefore, the applied tests confirm ECD as the most suitable indicator to appreciate the intellectual capital for the biotech companies in the pharmaceutical industry.","[Anghel, Ion] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Siminica, Marian; Cristea, Mirela; Sichigea, Mirela] Univ Craiova, Craiova, Romania; [Noja, Gratiela Georgiana] West Univ Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; University of Craiova; West University of Timisoara,"Sichigea, M (通讯作者)，Univ Craiova, Craiova, Romania.",mirelasichigea@gmail.com,"ION, ANGHEL/O-6775-2017; ANGHEL, Ion/AEI-4738-2022; Noja, Gratiela/X-2471-2019; Cristea, Mirela/AAP-8154-2020","Noja, Gratiela/0000-0002-9201-3057; Cristea, Mirela/0000-0002-6670-9798; Siminica, Marian/0000-0003-2944-4791",,,,,28,12,12,2,54,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,AUG,2018,20.0,49,,,,,631,646,,10.24818/EA/2018/49/631,0.0,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GO8SD,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440364100008,0

We develop a utility maximization model in which a bank manager faces the following two trade-offs: one trade-off is between the private benefits of control and costs of financial distress when loans under-perform, and the other is between the costs and benefits of screening loan credit quality (effort). In our model, the supply of loans, amount of junior debt issued, level of effort exerted by a manager, and manager's decision to exercise the clawback option are endogenously determined in the maximization of the manager's utility function. We find that the manager optimally exercises the clawback following a low realization of cash flows, thereby solving the trigger problem presented in CoCos. In the model, the debt to equity conversion from the COCLA is an endogenous decision, the regulatory capital adequacy ratio (CAR) is satisfied, and the bank does not face distress costs. From a practical perspective, the conversion rate for the COCLA that jointly maximizes the manager's expected utility and stock holders' pay offs is around 25%, a rate close to the typical percentage (30% 35%) that is often found in initial public offering clawback (IPOC) contracts used in the corporate world.

However, if a targeted intervention changes a household's utility maximization problem or influences decision-making, households might respond to the intervention in unintended ways with the potential to affect the wellbeing of non targeted members. Using panel data from a randomized controlled nutrition trial in Ghana, we evaluate household behavioral responses to the provision of small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNS) to mothers and their infants to prevent undernutrition. We find that targeted supplementation with SQ-LNS had a positive effect on household expenditures on food, including some nutrient-rich food groups, as well as on non-food goods and services. We also find a positive impact on labor income, particularly among fathers. We then explore intrahousehold spillover effects on the nutritional status of non targeted young children in the household. We find evidence that the targeted provision of SQ-LNS led to higher height-for-age z-scores among non-targeted children in the LNS group compared to the non-LNS group, though only among those with relatively taller mothers, which is an indicator of a child's growth potential. These findings support existing evidence and suggest that unintended behavioral responses and spillover are a real possibility in the context of nutrition interventions targeting nutritionally vulnerable household members. Thoughtfully considering this possibility in the design, analyses, and evaluation of targeted nutrition interventions may provide a more complete picture of overall effects. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

This paper intends to capture women's experiences in relation to this programme. The empirical data were collected in Musanze District using a household survey, semi-structured interviews, and focus group discussions. The main findings reveal that there is support of the general idea that women should benefit from the land tenure reform in Rwanda. However, there is some criticism towards parts of the land laws, and women have limited actual knowledge about land-related laws. With land titles, women mostly have a say on the land use decisions requiring each of the spounses' legal consents but not on the daily management of land and its produce. Finally, the paper reports the persistence of social norms and culturally biased gender ideologies affecting the effective implementation of land-related laws and policies. Therefore, the paper underscores the need to build the implementation of new laws and policies on a good understanding of customary practices to strengthen women's land rights in Rwanda.","[Bayisenge, Jeannette] Univ Rwanda, Ctr Gender Studies, Remera Campus,POB 5039, Kigali, Rwanda",University of Rwanda,"Bayisenge, J (通讯作者)，Univ Rwanda, Ctr Gender Studies, Remera Campus,POB 5039, Kigali, Rwanda.",jbayisenge@gmail.com,,"Bayisenge, Jeannette/0000-0002-8936-1982",Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA),Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA),"Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), PhD grant",,58,10,11,1,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Specifically, I find that the stock price response to earnings announcements increases with market volatility and decreases with earnings volatility. The results indicate that investor learning increases linearly with market uncertainty and decreases nonlinearly with firm-signal uncertainty.

An important question today is how to increase the reach and profitability of microfinance, in a context where subsidies are withdrawing to promote the viability and sustainability of microfinance institutions (MFIs). Efficiency analysis has found favor in this context and has attracted growing interest among professionals, partners, and researchers. Abundant empirical work has been conducted over the last ten years on this subject, in very different contexts and with different methodologies. The purpose of this article is to provide a meta-regression analysis on parametric and nonparametric estimations of Mean Technical Efficiency (MTE) in microfinance, using a data set of 262 observations from 38 studies. The results show that, in the microfinance industry, MTE scores have increased over time. However, with an MTE rate of approximately 61.1%, there is room for improving efficiency. MFIs use more resources than necessary for the results achieved in terms of outreach and revenue generated, Our results show heterogeneity of MTE according to the methodological approach of the studies. Studies with a larger number of variables (inputs and outputs) produced higher MTE scores than did those with a smaller number of variables. Studies using the variable returns to scale assumption resulted in higher MTE scores than those using constant returns to scale. In addition, those with a production approach had higher MTEs than did those using the intermediation approach, while studies of a large number of MFIs had lower scores than did those involving a small sample size. Moreover, research estimating social efficiency generated lower MTEs compared to those estimating financial efficiency. Studies using data from African MFIs obtained lower MTEs than did those on MFIs in Latin America and MENA, which confirms the poor performance of African microfinance. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Our main learning is a rather surprising fact that at a lower level of security expenditure in the violence affected area, an increase in security expenditures leads to an increase in violent incidents (rather than a decrease); and only at higher level of security expenditure in the area, an increase in security expenditure leads to a decline in violent incidents. For the analysis, we use a novel dataset on naxalite violence obtained directly from the police head-quarters of the three most affected states in India. The data consists of 64 districts spanning over years 2001 till 2013 and includes information on the annual number of violent incidents and the size of the security forces allocated specifically to curb the naxalite violence. We use negative binomial regression model with the number of violent incidents as the dependent variable and lagged size of security forces as the independent variable, while controlling for other relevant variables. Further, to address issues of potential reverse causality, we use a propensity score matching technique to infer the causal nature of such an association. We also argue that when the union government intervenes as a third party to support the state governments to fight the naxalites, the latter may be under-funding by free riding. However, despite such under funding, if the overall contribution is positive and continued, eventually the concentration of security forces in an area will overwhelm the naxalites and reduce the incidents. Lastly, we highlight that though the mainstream literature on civil wars has used per capita income as a proxy for security expenditures, it becomes inappropriate when a more direct measure of security expenditures is used.

We apply regime switching models to common factors proxying for the macroeconomic regime and show that the ensuing regime factor is relevant in forecasting the equity risk premium. Moreover, the relevance of this regime factor is preserved in the presence of fundamental variables and technical indicators which are known to predict equity risk premia. Based on multiple predictive regressions and pooled forecasts, the macroeconomic regime factor is deemed complementary relative to the fundamental and technical information sets.

IAP is associated with 1.6 million deaths worldwide annually. We assess the mechanisms behind the cooking fuel choice - in particular, firewood or LPG -, if the exposure to IAP due to firewood usage causes respiratory problems, and if this has implications for the probability to participate in the labor market. A small economic-theoretical model is proposed in which an individual maximizes utility generated by the fuel choice, consumption, health status, and the time dedicated to health and leisure, under financial and time constraints. For an empirical test, we use the 2002 Mexican Family Life Survey (MxFLS), estimating a trivariate recursive probit model. Our study finds that the usage of firewood as the household's fuel for cooking results in an increased prevalence of respiratory problems among women (but not among men), probably related to the traditional duties in the household. In the labor participation decision, we find a negative impact of respiratory problems on participation; hence, especially for women we find a strong causal channel from exposure to IAP to health problems to a reduction of labor force participation. A possible policy to break the circle of negative effects could involve the provision of improved firewood or LPG stoves that provoke less pollution and therefore reduces the health risks.

In so doing, the paper investigates the nature of the relationship Islamic interbank benchmark rate (IIBR) and its comparable conventional counterpart, London interbank offer rate (LIBOR). The dynamics of the two series are investigated to examine the stability of the spread between IIBR and LIBOR, referred to as 'Islamic premium' or 'piety premium'. The findings suggest that there are both long-term and short-term dynamic relationships between the two rates providing significant evidence of their convergence and co-movement. Our results also show that the existence of the IIBR-LIBOR spread is a reflection of the cost of funding and profit potential of the participating IIBR rate-setters. We find that, in addition to the determinants of the credit spreads, fundamental news of the panel banks are dominant factors driving the 'piety premium'. We argue that the Islamic banking industry is operating in a global context, where it is highly improbable that its rates can decouple from the global benchmarks. Given that Islamic banking products and their risk return profile are similar to conventional products, arbitrage activities force Islamic rates to converge with the global benchmark rates.

In this study, we attempt to explore the negative externalities of traffic congestion focusing on housing prices. We use a unique transportation dataset, the National Performance Management Research Data Set (NPMRDS), which contains information on every 5 min travel time across the extensive region to measure traffic congestion at the local level. In order to estimate the effect of traffic congestion on residential property values, we use a dynamic hedonic price model with a monthly panel dataset. Our findings show that while there is no significant relationship between congestion growth and housing price growth in rural and non-metro areas, the effects of congestion growth on housing price growth in urban and metro areas are obvious. We verify that traffic congestion functions as a disamenity in a local neighborhood. Transportation policies that aim to relieve traffic congestion should consider that severe traffic congestion may have an adverse effect on local property values.","[Jin, Jangik] Kyung Hee Univ, Grad Sch Tourism, Dept Real Estate, 1 Hoegi Dong, Seoul, South Korea; [Rafferty, Peter] Gannett Fleming Inc, 8025 Excelsior Dr, Madison, WI 53717 USA",Kyung Hee University,"Jin, J (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Grad Sch Tourism, Dept Real Estate, 1 Hoegi Dong, Seoul, South Korea.",jjin.realestate@khu.ac.kr; prafferty@gfnet.com,,,,,,,36,10,12,1,22,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Using a more comprehensive measure of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) incentives for short-termism, we uncover evidence that short-termism indeed played a role. Firms whose CEOs were contractually allowed to sell or exercise more of their stock and options holdings sooner had more subprime exposure, a higher probability of financial distress, and lower risk-adjusted stock returns during the crisis, as well as higher fines and settlements for subprime-related fraud.

Applying the proposed measure to Slovenian manufacturing and service firms in the 2006-2012 period suggests three dimensions of firms' financial constraints, i.e. liquidity, operational efficiency and profitability. Whereas the liquidity dimension is important for court-driven and law-based exits, the efficiency dimension is critical for firms' voluntary liquidation, while profitability is for the relative likelihood of being merged or acquired. These effects of financial constraints on firm exit processes tend to be intensified during the crisis period. The results also confirm that SMEs differ systematically from larger firms in terms of the sensitivity of the exit decision to financial constraints for all but merger and acquisition (M&A) exit routes.","[Ponikvar, Nina; Kejzar, Katja Zajc; Peljhan, Darja] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Kardeljeva Pl 17, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Kejzar, KZ (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Kardeljeva Pl 17, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",nina.ponikvar@ef.uni-lj.si; katja.zajc@ef.uni-lj.si; darja.peljhan@ef.uni-lj.si,"Peljhan, Darja/AAF-4483-2020","Peljhan, Darja/0000-0001-6566-237X; Ponikvar, Nina/0000-0003-3976-211X",,,,,73,17,18,0,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

To this aim, a set of graphical tools are introduced that allow one to evaluate the role of growth and recessions in the evolution of individuals' opportunities over time. These tools satisfy the ex post principle of equality of opportunity and represent an extension of the opportunity growth incidence curve, a framework proposed by the literature to evaluate growth according to the ex ante principle of equality of opportunity. This measurement framework is applied to evaluate the economic dynamic between 2009 and 2011 in Uganda.

Access for all demands both affordability and cost recovery, and utilities (and donors) increasingly require users to shoulder the greater burden of cost recovery. We argue that the electricity system is underpinned by a set of relationships among user, provider and the service itself: these relationships are mediated by the meter, the technology of commodification. Using a constant-comparison approach, and based on a year of interviews and document analysis, we compare postpaid and prepaid meter regimes in Unguja, Tanzania. We ask: what difference does the mode of payment make to the (residential) user, the utility, and to the prospects for meeting SDG 77 We find that the prepaid meter becomes reified with its automated monitoring and measurement mechanism, rendering the once-familiar meter reader obsolete, and shutting off the flow of electricity as soon as the customer's units have run down. Reification makes the utility more invisible to the customer, who now blames the meter rather than the utility for poor service or high bills. Our interviews reveal broad support for the prepaid meter, however, because economically vulnerable users expressed greater fear of debt than of the dark, and were willing to cede control of their consumption to the new meter. These findings undermine the common accusation of a culture of nonpayment in Africa. We also find that prepaid meters may incentivize the partial return to biomass-based fuels when cash is not available exactly the behavior that universal access to electricity is supposed to prevent. We conclude that, if access to electricity in sub-Saharan Africa becomes entirely contingent on payment prior to use, this is not fully compatible with a commitment to universal basic access.

This review is interlinked with a qualitative data analysis based on semi-structured interviews with representatives of ocean carriers, which are key actors determining empty container repositioning. Empirical evidence obtained from fieldwork in the Czech Republic, albeit limited, is used to illustrate empty repositioning management by ocean carriers in the Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) landlocked hinterlands, which have been neglected in research with a specific geographic scope. By addressing the research questions and conducting the analysis, the authors determine whether empty container repositioning is a problem only concerning equipment allocation by an ocean carrier or requires a collaborative resolution involving various parties engaged in container movements in landlocked hinterlands. This article confirms that most existing literature dealing with empty container repositioning ignores the actual dynamics of landlocked hinterlands as well as business practitioners' perspective. The authors' analysis of the empirical research complements and challenges the reviewed research studies. Based on the analysis, ocean carriers seem to be unwilling to revise their actual container management strategies focused on maritime repositioning, disregarding the potential and importance of intermodal repositioning approaches based on market collaboration. Regarding further research directions, the authors suggest the research replicability and its extension.","[Kolar, Petr] Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Logist, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067, Czech Republic; [Schramm, Hans-Joachim] Vienna Univ Econ & Business Adm, Inst Transport & Logist Management, Dept Global Business & Trade, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Schramm, Hans-Joachim; Prockl, Gunter] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Operat Management, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark",Prague University of Economics & Business; Vienna University of Economics & Business; Copenhagen Business School,"Kolar, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Logist, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067, Czech Republic.",petr.kolar@vse.cz,"Prockl, Günter/ACH-8945-2022; Schramm, Hans-Joachim/E-5108-2014; Schramm, Hans-Joachim/AAA-3433-2021","Prockl, Günter/0000-0001-9922-3092; Schramm, Hans-Joachim/0000-0001-9086-1493; Schramm, Hans-Joachim/0000-0001-9086-1493; Kolar, Petr/0000-0002-4610-6375","University of Economics, Prague Granting Agency [IP305026]","University of Economics, Prague Granting Agency","The research for this article was funded by the University of Economics, Prague Granting Agency, project no.

In this paper we analyze and discuss the solution concept for common coordination problems as incorporated in the theory of Team Reasoning (TR). Special consideration is given to TR's concept of opportunistic choice and to the resulting restrictions in using private information. We report results from a laboratory experiment in which teams were given a chance to coordinate on a particular pattern of behavior in a sequence of Hi-Lo games. A modification of the stage game offered opportunities to improve on the team goal through changing this accustomed pattern of behavior. Our observations throw considerable doubt on the idea of opportunistic team reasoning as a guide to coordination. Contrary to what TR would predict, individuals tend to stick to accustomed behavioral patterns. Moreover, we find that individual decisions are at least partly determined by private information not accessible to all members of a team. Alternative theories of choice, in particular cognitive hierarchy theory may be more suitable to explain the observed pattern of behavior.","[Lahno, Amrei] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Volkswirtschaftl Fak, Geschwister Scholl Pl 1, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Lahno, Bernd] Univ Konstanz, Fachbereich Philosophie, D-78457 Constance, Germany",University of Munich; University of Konstanz,"Lahno, A (通讯作者)，Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Volkswirtschaftl Fak, Geschwister Scholl Pl 1, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",amrei.lahno@econ.lmu.de; bernd.lahno@uni-konstanz.de,,,"Kate Hamburger Kolleg / Centre for Global Cooperation, University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany","Kate Hamburger Kolleg / Centre for Global Cooperation, University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany","Bernd Lahno's work on this project was supported by a fellowship at the Kate Hamburger Kolleg / Centre for Global Cooperation, University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany.",,27,1,1,0,0,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

We also investigate the heterogeneous effects of government subsidies with different intensities on firm survival, and find that moderate-intensity government subsidies exert a positive impact on firm survival, while high-intensity government subsidies increase the exit probabilities, the underlying mechanisms via subsidy-seeking investment and innovation incentive weakening are supported by empirical evidence. Furthermore, we explore the role of governance institutions in the subsidy-survival relationship, and find that the positive impact of government subsidies on firm survival is more pronounced in regions with better governance institutions.","[Mao, Qilin] Nankai Univ, Inst Int Econ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr China Econ, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Xu, Jiayun] Nankai Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr China Econ, APEC Study Ctr, Tianjin, Peoples R China",Nankai University; Nankai University,"Xu, JY (通讯作者)，Nankai Univ, APEC Study Ctr, 94 Weijin Rd, Tianjin 30071, Peoples R China.",xujiayun321@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn,"xu, jiayun/AAQ-1492-2020",,"Special Program of Talents Development for Excellent Youth Scholars in Tianjin, National Natural Science Foundation of China [71403135, 71773055]; Major Projects of the National Social Science Foundation of China [15ZDA057]; Humanities and Social Science of Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China [16YJC790114]; China Postdoctoral Science Special Foundation [2017T100056]","Special Program of Talents Development for Excellent Youth Scholars in Tianjin, National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Major Projects of the National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Humanities and Social Science of Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China; China Postdoctoral Science Special Foundation","Special Program of Talents Development for Excellent Youth Scholars in Tianjin, National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71403135, 71773055) and Major Projects of the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 15ZDA057).; Humanities and Social Science of Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China (Grant No. 16YJC790114), and China Postdoctoral Science Special Foundation (Grant No. 2017T100056).",,47,6,6,7,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Yet little is known about the reverse possibility, namely that well-being itself may influence unemployment propensity. Understanding the potentials of human well-being in relation to unemployment is important as many developed countries are currently facing high unemployment rates. As well-being is likely to be endogenous, we use British panel data and implement Lewbel's novel empirical approach for identification. We show that higher well-being implies a negative causal effect on the probability of being unemployed. The result holds for two very different well-being measures: life satisfaction and a 12-item scale of mental health. As such, it provides new empirical evidence on the causal link between well-being and unemployment propensity.

We implement a strand of univariate and panel unit root tests for linear and nonlinear models of 18 national stock indices from 1969 to 2016. Our major findings are as follows. First, we find strong evidence of nonlinear mean reversion of the relative stock price with the UK index as the reference, calling attention to the stock index in the UK, but not with the US index. Our results imply an important role of the local common factor in the European stock markets. Second, panel tests yield no evidence of linear and nonlinear stationarity when the cross-section dependence is considered, which provides conflicting results from those of the univariate tests. Last, we show how to understand these results via dynamic factor analysis. When the stationary common factor dominates nonstationary idiosyncratic components in small samples, panel tests that filter out the stationary common factor may yield evidence against the stationarity null hypothesis in finite samples. We corroborate this conjecture via extensive Monte Carlo simulations.","[Kim, Hyeangwoo] Auburn Univ, Dept Econ, 217 Miller Hall, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Kim, Jintae] Georgia Southern Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, 621 Coba Dr, Statesboro, GA 30458 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University; University System of Georgia; Georgia Southern University,"Kim, J (通讯作者)，Georgia Southern Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, 621 Coba Dr, Statesboro, GA 30458 USA.",gmmkim@gmail.com; jintaekim@georgiasouthern.edu,"Kim, Hyeongwoo/GNH-5819-2022","Kim, Hyeongwoo/0000-0002-9685-2579",,,,,35,0,0,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1062-9408,1879-0860,,N AM J ECON FINANC,N.

After two decades of interest, how are they being implemented? This paper is an update and re-assessment of the record of development and human rights agencies' involvement in human rights-based work on development policy. We find that some development agencies have adopted rights-based approaches and made systematic changes in practice, but the rhetoric has far exceeded substantive changes. Drawing on documentary evidence and the extensive literature, we analyze the factors constraining implementation in development agencies (political, conceptual and organizational), and document broader, more transformative changes among human rights NGOs. Their expanded work on development policy issues has featured new research and advocacy agendas, the embrace of new skill sets, significant new methodologies, and the formation of many new, specialized agencies that provide much of the dynamism in the human rights-development interactions. The findings suggest that we need a careful assessment of the extent of rights-based work among development funders and NGOs, and its impact; and they highlight the increasingly influential role that human rights NGOs play in framing and influencing important social, economic and environmental policies.

Entrepreneurs (e.g., franchisors) may make such disclosures to prospective business partners in order to signal profitability of partnering, attract financial and managerial resources, and develop their entrepreneurial networks. In practice, only a fraction of franchisors make financial performance representations (FPRs), an ex-ante voluntary information disclosure to prospective franchisees. We address gaps in the signaling, voluntary information disclosure, franchising, entrepreneurship, and small- and medium-enterprise (SME) literatures. We draw on signaling theory to develop a theoretical framework and investigate factors that influence a franchisor's disclosure decision. We evaluate hypotheses from our theoretical framework through econometric analyses of multi-sector panel data for the US franchising industry. We estimate a logit model and use lagged independent variables to address our dichotomous independent variable and potential endogeneity, respectively. Our results support the view that firms signal their quality through FPRs to attract potential business partners and expand their entrepreneurial networks. Beyond the extant literature, we find that rigorous partner qualification is another driver of voluntary information disclosure in franchising. Our findings also provide empirical support for the complementary role played by multiple quality signaling mechanisms used by franchisors and yield public policy implications for franchising.","[Sadeh, Farhad; Kacker, Manish] McMaster Univ, DeGroote Sch Business, Hamilton, ON, Canada",McMaster University,"Sadeh, F (通讯作者)，McMaster Univ, DeGroote Sch Business, Hamilton, ON, Canada.",sadehf@mcmaster.ca; mkacker@mcmaster.ca,,"Kacker, Manish/0000-0002-2221-4857","Franchise and Dealer Management Initiative (FDMI), McMaster University; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada","Franchise and Dealer Management Initiative (FDMI), McMaster University; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC))","We thank the Editor, two anonymous referees, Josef Windsperger, and Sreelata Jonnalagedda for their comments on a previous version of this article.

Observed and unobserved preference heterogeneity are analyzed using mixed logit choice models. The results show that there exists substantial willingness to pay to increase collection frequency and separate recyclable waste. A new issue is the focus on child labor in the waste management sector. Significant gender effects are found: women are more interested than men in increasing waste collection frequency and value the abolishment of child labor more highly, as do higher income households. As expected, respondents living in wealthier neighborhoods are more likely to pay higher service charges. Education indirectly influences preferences for waste separation. The study provides important insight into the social benefits of public investment decisions to improve the quality of solid waste management services in large cities in Ethiopia.","[Tarfasa, Solomon] Hawassa Univ, Dept Econ, Hawassa, Ethiopia; [Brouwer, Roy] Univ Waterloo, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Brouwer, Roy] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Dept Environm Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Hawassa University; University of Waterloo; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Brouwer, R (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON, Canada.;Brouwer, R (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Dept Environm Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",,"Brouwer, Roy/M-9437-2013","Brouwer, Roy/0000-0002-0525-2050",,,,,47,8,9,2,33,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Although empirical evidence demonstrating disparate treatment of minorities is vast, studies have inadequately explained why minority customers seeking financing are targeted for discriminatory treatment. We develop a theoretical framework explaining why profit-maximizing capital suppliers may choose to offer minority clients worse terms than those provided to comparable white customers. Our framework stresses search costs and reservation prices. We then test this by comparing the relative profitability of investing private equity in minority- and white-owned small firms, an approach advocated by Gary Becker. Using three empirical tests, we consistently find the financial returns derived from investing in minority firms exceed those of white-firm investments. Conducting Becker's test, in this instance, indicates that disparate treatment of minority clients does not result in loss of profitable investing opportunities for private equity funds but, instead, higher profits.","[Bates, Timothy] Wayne State Univ, Econ, Detroit, MI 48202 USA; [Bradford, William D.] Univ Washington, Business & Econ Dev, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Jackson, William E., III] Univ Alabama, Business Integr, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",Wayne State University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Bates, T (通讯作者)，Wayne State Univ, Econ, Detroit, MI 48202 USA.",tbates7893@gmail.com; bradford@u.washington.edu; wjackson@cba.ua.edu,"Bates, Timothy C/C-9637-2010",,E.

Furthermore, the VAR Granger causality tests indicate bidirectional feedback relations among the returns of cross-listed shares, while there is no consistent causality among different stocks within the markets. We also find that the cross-listed shares demonstrate strong volatility spillovers, which is driven by the covariance structure that is formed by variance and correlation terms. In addition, we report liquidity spillover effects and spillovers running from liquidity to volatility for some firms but no evidence that spillover effects run from volatility to liquidity.

On these data sets, we run non-parametric regressions to examine how the real exchange rate, the price differential, and the nominal exchange rate react to an overvalued real exchange rate over time. In line with the theory we develop, our regressions show the following: First, real exchange rates are mean-reverting. Second, prices converge. Third, price convergence implies purchasing power divergence and thus does not contribute to real exchange rate convergence. Indeed, when price adjustment is fast (as for our traded good price data sets), we even observe diverging nominal exchange rates. Our findings suggest that movements both away from and towards PPP may be less related to traded good price movements than is commonly thought.","[Eleftheriou, Maria; Muller-Plantenberg, Nikolas A.] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Econ Theory & Econ Hist, Fac Econ & Business Adm, E-28049 Madrid, Spain",Autonomous University of Madrid,"Müller-Plantenberg, NA (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Econ Theory & Econ Hist, Fac Econ & Business Adm, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",nikolas.mullerpl@uam.es,"/P-5153-2019; Eleftheriou, Maria/R-7295-2018","/0000-0003-1071-2901; Eleftheriou, Maria/0000-0002-8331-0252",,,,,32,0,0,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

Large fees are more common if targets face financial constraints or distress.

We correct for the endogenous selection of large termination fees and present evidence that managers negotiate large fees in exchange for higher premiums.

We apply a quantile cointegration model to gold and silver prices and to prices of the corresponding futures contracts. Whereas cointegration models, assuming a constant cointegrating vector, fail to detect a cointegration relationship between gold and silver, we are able to show that a nonlinear long-run relationship exits. The cointegrating vector is modelled as state-dependent and time-varying in our framework and the quantile cointegration estimates reveal substantial asymmetry in the relationship. The results suggest that the pronounced role of precious metals as investment opportunities particularly in bubble-like episodes and times of financial turmoil leads to comovement of gold and silver in these periods.

One concern is that households employed in energy-intensive sectors might be affected disproportionally because of (international) capital mobility. By assuming that workers cannot move freely between sectors, we can reproduce this concern: uniform climate policy causes more inequality between the sectors when capital is mobile than when it is not. However, we find that affected households can be relieved more effectively with sector-specific labour taxes than with sector-specific climate policy. The reason for this finding is that households benefit more directly from sector-specific labour tax cuts than from climate policy exemptions. Keeping climate policy uniform across sectors has the added benefit of creating incentives for long-term decarbonisation.

As a measure of firm performance, we use data envelopment analysis (DEA) to estimate the efficiency of a firm relative to the 'best practice' firms in its industry. We find that firms in industries with higher levels of strategic interaction are less efficient and the negative relation is more pronounced in industries where firms compete in strategic substitutes. This finding is consistent with the idea that there is significantly more cooperation (tacit collusion) under strategic complements than strategic substitutes. We also find that frontier efficiency methodology outperforms other measures of firm performance in explaining the relation between strategic interaction and firm performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We contribute to the early warning literature by constructing a dynamic competing risks hazard model that explores the joint determination of the probability of a distressed bank to face a licence withdrawal or to be bailed out. The underlying patterns of distress are analysed based on a broad range of bank-level and environmental factors. We find that institutions with inadequate capital, illiquid and risky assets, poor management, low levels of earnings and high sensitivity to market conditions have a higher probability to go bankrupt. Bailed out banks, on the other hand, face both capital and liquidity shortages, experience low earnings, and are highly exposed to market products; however, neither the managerial expertise, nor the quality of assets is relevant to the odds of bailout. We further document that large and complex banks are less likely to fail and more likely to be bailed out and also that authorities are more prone to provide support to a distressed bank, which is well-connected with politicians and political parties and less prone to let it go bankrupt. Importantly, our model outperforms the commonly used logit model in terms of forecasting power in all the in-and out-of-sample tests we conduct. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Motivated by a simple model, demand shocks are identified as returns to an index of oil producing firms which are orthogonal to unexpected changes in the VIX index, with supply shocks capturing the remaining variation in oil prices. Demand shocks are strongly positively correlated with market returns and economic output, whereas supply shocks have a strong negative correlation. The negative correlation of supply shocks and returns is strongest in industries that produce consumer goods, while the positive correlation of demand shocks is stronger for industries which use relatively large amounts of oil as an input.","[Ready, Robert C.] Univ Rochester, Simon Sch Business, Rochester, NY 14627 USA",University of Rochester,"Ready, RC (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Simon Sch Business, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",,,,,,,,25,181,184,13,98,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

Positive growth effects are particularly unlikely in countries resorting to debt-financed privatization. Furthermore, we note the lack of positive pension privatization effects on savings in Eastern Europe, with limited evidence of positive savings effects in Latin America.

We perform Bayesian estimations on several panels of countries. Our results show that higher ratio of the non-performing loans represents the most important industry-specific variable that is linked with a heightened rate of the sovereign risk. On the other hand, findings related to the size and depth of the banking sector, along with the capital adequacy ratio, are less clear-cut. Higher penetration of the foreign banks and higher degree of competition characterize a diversified structure of the banking industry that seems to be beneficial for the banking sector stability and is linked with lower sovereign risk.","[Bruha, Jan; Kocenda, Evzen] Univ Karlova, Fak Socialnich Ved, Prague, Czech Republic; [Bruha, Jan; Kocenda, Evzen] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Pod Vodarenskou Vezi 4, Prague 18208 8, Czech Republic; [Bruha, Jan; Kocenda, Evzen] CESifo, Mnichov, Germany; [Bruha, Jan; Kocenda, Evzen] IOS, Rezno, Germany",Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Theory & Automation of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Ifo Institut,"Bruha, J (通讯作者)，Univ Karlova, Fak Socialnich Ved, Prague, Czech Republic.;Bruha, J (通讯作者)，Czech Acad Sci, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Pod Vodarenskou Vezi 4, Prague 18208 8, Czech Republic.;Bruha, J (通讯作者)，CESifo, Mnichov, Germany.;Bruha, J (通讯作者)，IOS, Rezno, Germany.",jan.bruha@cnb.cz; evzen.kocenda@fsv.cuni.cz,"Bruha, Jan/E-7147-2016; Kocenda, Evzen/R-9674-2017","Kocenda, Evzen/0000-0003-4110-1169",,,,,32,0,0,3,12,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

The depiction and the measure of the contribution of gender to wage inequality within the public services reveal the existence of a systematic bias against women, which holds in all the French regions. To go beyond this simple statement, the comparison of the results obtained in the various regions requires to propose an index of intensity of the contribution of gender to wage inequality allowing to analyse them with a unified scale. The intensities determined in every category and in every sub-sector of public services show that regions of the South and from the East of France are those where women support the highest disparities.

Both the box plot and box map of the distribution of the crime are presented. To investigate the spatial effects, the global Moran's I statistic together with the Moran scatterplot were employed. The presence of statistically significant positive spatial autocorrelation (based on queen case contiguity weight matrix) was confirmed. The local indicators of spatial association (LISA) were used to identify the the local clusters. Since the statistically significant high-high clusters were confirmed for the 7 Hungarian regions, the low-low clusters occur across the 18 regions of the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia. The spatial outliers are represented by 2 Polish regions.

However, there are few theoretical researches about how to construct collaborative governance mechanism and how to design the collaborative governance system of cross-enterprise. Focused on the collaborative governance goal creating value together, and sharing benefits all, and based on the four basic theories of TEC, BRV, SNT and public governance, this paper creates the concept of collaborative governance mechanism of cross-enterprise, and analyzes the organic integrity between the five elements of the mechanism and collaborative governance goal. Based on the collaborative governance mechanism, this paper builds the framework of collaborative governance system of cross-enterprise, and discusses the innovative features of collaborative management control. This paper has made an important contribution to the basic research of collaborative governance theory, and the results after expanding can help decision-makers and managers to better achieve the collaborative governance goal of cross-enterprise.","[Fu Yuanlue] Xiamen Univ, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China",Xiamen University,"Fu, YLE (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.",,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71372073]; MOE Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences in Universities of China [16JJD790033]; Center for Accounting Studies of Xiamen University in China; d-AI Big Project of Yuanchuang Decision Intelligence Research Center of Xiamen University [XMUDIRC2017001],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); MOE Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences in Universities of China; Center for Accounting Studies of Xiamen University in China; d-AI Big Project of Yuanchuang Decision Intelligence Research Center of Xiamen University,"The author is grateful that this paper is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71372073), and by the MOE Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences in Universities of China (Grant No. 16JJD790033) and by Center for Accounting Studies of Xiamen University in China, and by d-AI Big Project (Grant No. XMUDIRC2017001) of Yuanchuang Decision Intelligence Research Center of Xiamen University.",,38,0,0,3,19,DALIAN UNIV TECHNICAL ELECTRONIC & AUDIO-VISUAL PRESS,DALIAN CITY,"NO.80 SOFTWARE PARK ROAD, HI-TECH ZONE, DALIAN CITY, LIAONING PROVINCE 116024, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89437-202-4,,,,2018,,,,,,,239,253,,,,,,15,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7UP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455659900036,0

We identify the German local level of government as functionally equivalent to a parliamentary setting, such that the directly elected mayor has competencies similar to a president in a mixed national polity. Our findings show that the party affiliation of the head of state is a key factor considered by party members in the legislature when forming coalitions: coalitions in the legislature are more likely to form if they include the party of the head of the executive branch. Furthermore, the policy preferences of the head of the executive branch matter for the legislators' behavior in the coalition formation process: the smaller the ideological distance between the position of a coalition and the position of the head of state, the more likely a coalition is to be formed.","[Gross, Martin] Univ Munich, Geschwister Scholl Inst Polit Sci, Oettingenstr 67, D-80538 Munich, Germany; [Debus, Marc] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim Ctr European Social Res, A5,6, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany; [Debus, Marc] Univ Mannheim, Sch Social Sci, A5,6, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany",University of Munich; University of Mannheim; University of Mannheim,"Debus, M (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Mannheim Ctr European Social Res, A5,6, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.;Debus, M (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Sch Social Sci, A5,6, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",martin.gross@gsi.uni-muenchen.de; marc.debus@uni-mannheim.de,"Gross, Martin/I-5379-2019; Debus, Marc/K-3954-2019","Gross, Martin/0000-0002-8836-3388; Debus, Marc/0000-0002-7151-7942",,,,,86,15,13,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JAN,2018,174.0,1-2,,,,,61,80,,10.1007/s11127-017-0489-x,0.0,,,20,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,FW2PE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000425145300004,0

Many occupations are sex-segregated, that is, generally considered as either masculine or feminine. This article reviews the gender gap in occupation, factors that lead to an occupational segregation-the tendency of men and women to work in different occupations and its consequences Accordingly, Social norms, discrimination, educational attainment, difference in endowments and difference in occupational preference between male and female contribute to occupational segregation and consequently leads to pay gap between genders, job dissatisfaction, turnover and stereotype. Globally, women face discrimination and devaluation at work. Compared to men, women are concentrated in less paid and part-time jobs with less promotion opportunities. Gender pay gap is the most significant effect of occupational segregation. Gender sorting into different occupations and industries widen the pay gap that has a drastic effect on the overall economy of a country. Gender stereotypes can prevent women from being hired and promoted into traditionally male-dominated occupations. Raising women employment to man level and closing the gender gap in occupation can have a higher impact on GDP and poverty reduction.","[Haile, Versavel Tecleab] Kaposvar Univ, Doctoral Sch Management & Org Sci, Kaposvar, Hungary",Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences; Kaposvar University,"Haile, VT (通讯作者)，Kaposvar Univ, Doctoral Sch Management & Org Sci, Kaposvar, Hungary.",versicho@gmail.com,,,,,,,64,0,0,1,16,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-9164-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,98,107,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO1EW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000495441500013,0

This was extended to rural areas of previously unaffected districts in 2007. The natural experiment provided by the step-wise implementation of the removal policy and five waves of nationally representative household survey data enables us to study the impact of the removal policy on utilization and household health expenditure. We find that the policy increased overall use of health services in the short term and the effects were sustained in the long term. The increases were higher for individuals whose household heads were unemployed or had no or less education. The policy also led to a small shift in care seeking from private to publicly supported facilities, an effect driven primarily by individuals whose household heads were either formally employed or engaged in farming. The likelihood of incurring any spending reduced, although this weakened slightly in the long term. At the same time, there was an upward pressure on conditional health expenditure, i.e., expenditure was higher after removal of fees for those who incurred any spending. Hence, total (unconditional) household health expenditure was not significantly affected. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

Promoted by international NGOs, SG models are inspired by indigenous savings and credit associations (ROSCAs). SG models however differ in that they prescribe lending the pooled savings to group members for an interest. The interest rate aims to (1) boost capital accumulation, (2) allocate scarce capital efficiently, and (3) remunerate and incentivize savers. This paper builds on a six-month fieldwork conducted in DR Congo consisting of direct observations of SG meetings and interviews with SG participants and practitioners. We study the gaps between SG practitioners' objectives and SG participants' perceptions and practices related to the interest rate. Our research pays particular attention to the local context and local norms that interfere with SG practitioners' objectives. Our analysis highlights three gaps. First, SG participants turn savings into credit for security purposes rather for rapid capital accumulation. Second, credit allocation decisions are guided by fairness and security concerns rather than efficiency. Third, SG participants often regard the accumulated interest as belonging to the group and to active borrowers rather than to passive savers. Our results invite development actors to pay greater attention to the potential risks of the SG approach for its participants. Despite the common appellation savings groups, this microfinance innovation builds upon credit and strongly encourages its members to go into debt. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

From an economic point of view, the austerity programs imposed in Greece since 2010 resulted in losses of retail sales, alongside with bankruptcies and mergers of retail chains. At the same time, technological development creates an environment for innovation in terms of operations and marketing and offers new opportunities to retailers. Additionally, consumers become more involved and active in the purchasing processes. However, Greek consumers are also experiencing a dramatic decline in their disposable income. The study examines the perception of Greek consumers of several marketing efforts based on Information & Communication Technology Systems (ICT) introduced by a Greek food retailer in Northern Greece. More specifically, it investigates the relationship between ICT related marketing efforts, such as loyalty programs, and analytics regarding food control systems and purchases and consumer characteristics such as gender, age, income, status and family size. The study reveals a number of relationships between marketing efforts and consumer characteristics/segments. However, since the relationships are found to be weak, marketing managers are advised to use advanced analytics systems, such as big data technologies, in order to enhance the efficiency of their marketing strategies and approaches. The weak relationships between the parameters examined indicate that marketing efforts have to focus in several consumer sub segments in order to achieve significant results. The study's sample population is consumers of one of the top food retailers in Greece. The findings contribute to the literature on the use of ICT on marketing strategies and the use of big data. Furthermore, they have practical implications for marketers in the retail food sector, as they reveal the need for a more focused approach to different consumer groups, in order to increase the efficiency of marketing efforts and to achieve maximum results.","[Malamidou, Konstantina; Spyropoulos, Theocharis Stylianos; Rotsios, Konstantinos] Perrotis Coll, Dept Int Business, Marinou Antipa 54, Thessaloniki, Greece",,"Rotsios, K (通讯作者)，Perrotis Coll, Dept Int Business, Marinou Antipa 54, Thessaloniki, Greece.",krotsi@afs.edu.gr,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,4,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2518-668X,,,KNE SOC SCI,,,2018,,,,,,,166,185,,10.18502/kss.v3i10.3537,0.0,,,20,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7SJ,,gold,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455399000011,0

Assessment of the level of confidence of individuals in their abilities and skills is well documented. However, the literature lacks an aggregate measure of investor confidence, with this required to test its implications on a macro level. The author introduces a simple measure of aggregate investor confidence by adopting a formal model of overconfidence. The applications of the measure suggest that, in aggregate, higher trading activity occurs when investor confidence soars, particularly for smaller stocks. Subsequently, the effect partially reverses, implying a correction to an initial overreaction. The newly introduced investor confidence index possesses better ability to predict trading activity than past returns, as used in prior studies. Additionally, investors tend to have a higher risk appetite when confident, as shown by increased investment in small stocks with higher risk.","[Meier, Chris] Macquarie Univ, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Meier, Chris] Mahidol Univ, Salaya, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand",Macquarie University; Mahidol University,"Meier, C (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",chris.meier@mq.edu.au,,,,,,,50,16,16,5,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

Analyses of correlations help to find an answer to important question whether different liquidity proxies capture various sources of market liquidity/illiquidity or not. The main research hypothesis states that correlations are stable in specified periods. The hypothesis is verified by applying equality tests of correlation matrices computed over non-overlapping subsamples. The dataset consists of daily proxies of four liquidity measures for 53 WSE-traded companies divided into three size groups. The whole sample covers the period from January 3, 2005 to June 30, 2015, and it includes three adjacent subsamples, each of equal size: the pre-crisis, crisis, and post-crisis periods. To calculate several liquidity measures based on intraday data it is essential to recognize a side initiating the transaction and to distinguish between buyer- and seller-initiated trades. In this paper, the Lee and Ready (J Financ 46(2):733-746, 1991) trade classification algorithm is employed to infer trade sides. The obtained empirical results concerning the stability of correlations between liquidity proxies in the whole group of companies are not homogeneous.","[Olbrys, Joanna] Bialystok Tech Univ, Bialystok, Poland",Bialystok University of Technology,"Olbrys, J (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Bialystok, Poland.",j.olbrys@pb.edu.pl,"Olbrys, Joanna/P-8237-2018","Olbrys, Joanna/0000-0002-0928-0040",National Science Center in Poland [2016/21/B/HS4/02004],"National Science Center in Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)","This research was supported by the grant from the National Science Center in Poland (No. 2016/21/B/HS4/02004).

However, despite the dynamics of the development of agricultural production in the development of rural territories, there are a number of acute problems that need to be resolved. The main among them is the problem of the discrepancy between a sufficiently high level of development of agriculture and the depopulation of the rural settlement network, as well as degradation of the social infrastructure of the village, accompanied by a decline in the level and quality of life of the rural population.

The analytical framework of this paper is developed within the confines of international political economy. The dependent variable is national interest, and the independent variables are international development cooperation (on a bilateral level) and shareholding in international lending institutions. The focus is on these variables because each directly affects the national sovereignty of the recipient country and alters its domestic structure. By examining the case of the United States (through the USAID) and its role in the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq, conflict-engaged countries and crucial to US interests, I conclude that international lending institutions mainly promote the national interest of the leading power within the institutions.","[Pistikou, Victoria] Univ Piraeus, Dept Int & European Studies, Piraeus, Greece; [Pistikou, Victoria] Univ Peloponnese, Ctr Int & European Polit Econ & Governance, Corinth, Greece",University of Piraeus; University of Peloponnese,"Pistikou, V (通讯作者)，Univ Piraeus, Dept Int & European Studies, Piraeus, Greece.;Pistikou, V (通讯作者)，Univ Peloponnese, Ctr Int & European Polit Econ & Governance, Corinth, Greece.",vpistikou@uop.gr,"Pistikou, Victoria/AAM-7188-2021","Pistikou, Victoria/0000-0002-3773-0109",,,,,57,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",1431-1933,,978-3-319-93452-5; 978-3-319-93451-8,CONTRIB ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,199,216,,10.1007/978-3-319-93452-5_11,0.0,,,18,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BQ4NA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000591182600011,0

Therefore, the basic understanding of the school travel in South Asian cities remains unclear. Thus, this study explored the travel decisions of schoolchildren in the Indian context by using primary data collected from Kanpur, a city in India. A multinomial logit framework was used to model the choice decisions of making trips to schools. The results indicated that the absence of a public transit system and the lack of good-quality school bus services resulted in the dependence of schoolchildren on other motorized modes, such as family vehicles and paratransit.

The results endorse this hypothesis: small size and value portfolios reflect changes in future investment opportunities. To test the hypothesis, the paper forecasts the equity premium using disaggregated portfolio returns with a partial least squares (PLS) regression approach. PLS is chosen as it is particularly suited to condense a large set of portfolios into a single index. The index portfolio obtained from the forecast performs well out of sample and hedges against future market risk, in addition to explaining future market returns in sample. Thus, the index portfolio may be viewed as an additional risk factor in the form of a Merton (1973) state variable. The index places larger weights on small size and value portfolios. This also provides a possible explanation for why equal-weighted portfolios typically perform better out of sample compared to factors implied by traditional mean-variance approaches and asset pricing models.

However, due to its distinct institutional environment, there is still an imbalanced credit allocation among state-owned firms and private firms, especially small and micro enterprises (SMEs). In fact, SMEs contribute significantly to China's repaid economic growth in a way that stimulates innovation and increases employment. As a result of policies and banks preference, SMEs may face many severe financial constraints compared with state-owned enterprises, which largely impedes their development and investment. It is believed that relationship finance can be a way to improve SMEs financial status as it more emphasis on invisible capital to control banks credit risk, such as the degree of familiarity with firms' operation, the ability to monitor firms' financial performance and evaluate the quality of financial reports, rather than visible capital like the amount of collateral they can provide. In the paper, we simply analyzed main factors associated with financing difficulties at first, which is followed by building an asymmetry model between banks and SMEs based on evolutionary game theory and analyzing how relationship finance can be formed. According to the proposed model, we believe relationship finance is the result of long-term behavioral evolution among banks and SMEs. Therefore, we conclude that in order to improve financing status of SMEs, both banks and SMEs should take efforts to adopt well-developed financial performance evaluation and behavior surveillance system.","[Tian Yunlin] Univ Wollongong, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Chen Ping] Northwest Minzu Univ, Sch Management, Lanzhou 730030, Gansu, Peoples R China",University of Wollongong; Northwest Minzu University,"Tian, YL (通讯作者)，Univ Wollongong, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",,,,Northwest Minzu University,Northwest Minzu University,"This work is supported by Professor Ping Chen of Northwest Minzu University, who is the corresponding author of this paper.

The change in regard to the IAS 39 is the new classification and measurement model based on the business model of the entity (at the portfolio level) and the characteristics of the contracted cash flow by individual financial asset. Credit loss represents the difference between all discounted contracted inflows payable to entities under the contract, and all discounted cash inflows that the entity is expecting. A new model relies on entities being able to make robust estimates of expected credit losses at the point at which there is a significant increase in credit risk. For this purpose, banks will need to decide how significant increase  and default will be defined in the context of the instruments (loans) they hold. The paper explores what are the main challenges in the field of data availability, impairment model, criteria for the allocation and macroeconomic factors when implementing the new standard in banks. The new model of impairment is likely to have a significant impact on the systems and processes of banks due to its extensive new requirements for data and calculations.","[Tominac, Sanja Broz; Vasicek, Vesna] Fac Econ & Business Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Tominac, SB (通讯作者)，Fac Econ & Business Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia.",sbroz@efzg.hr; vvasicek@efzg.hr,"Vasicek, Vesna/H-9685-2018",,,,,,10,0,0,0,11,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,233,239,,,,,,7,Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BM5GU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000464906000026,0

The two insurgencies arose, I argue, from frontier spaces in which the limits of state authority and legitimacy intersected with a profound crisis of authority and rule on the one hand, and the political economy of radical precarity on the other. Boko Haram and MEND share family resemblances-they are products of the same orderings of power-despite the obvious fact that one is draped in the language of religion and restoration (but as we shall see modernity) and the insistence that Nigeria should become transformed into a true Islamic state, while the other is secular and civic (and also modern) wishing to expand the boundaries of citizenship through a new sort of federalism. There are striking commonalities in the social composition of the armed groups and their internal dynamics; each is deposited at the nexus of the failure of local government, customary institutions, and the security forces (the police and the military task forces in particular). Each, nevertheless, is site specific; a cultural articulation of dispossession politics rooted in regional traditions of warfare, in particular systems of religiosity, and very different sorts of social structure and identity, and very different ecologies (the semi arid savannas of the north, and the creeks and forest of the Niger delta). In both cases state coercion and despotism and the ethico-moral decrepitude of the state figures centrally as does the politics of resentment that each condition generates among a large, alienated but geographically rooted group of precarious classes.

Agricultural means of production input was uneven. Crop farming layout in the basin has changed a lot. Although the number of livestock on hand at the end of the year has reduced sharply, output of livestock products has kept increasing. The paper also discusses major problems in the governance of agricultural non-point source pollution in Dianchi Lake basin. The overall governance idea was narrow and limited; pollution control was one-sided. The space for agricultural development in Dianchi Lake basin has shrunk and become fragments. The source of water diversion should be governed; the area of pollution treatment should be expand. Standards for the emission of agricultural pollution were not formulated.

To do this, general behavioral reward-risk models, which contain all the basic elements of the PT, are first set up. Two reward and risk measures, the upper partial moment and the lower partial moment, are subsequently used to create the various value functions. The technical difficulties arising during the behavioral maximization process are overpassed by adapting the Rubinstein [1982] algorithm. The results show that agents differentiate their behavior according to their type of preferences (S-shaped, reverse S-shaped, kinked convex, and kinked concave value function) but they seem to always prefer small capitalization and high positively skewed value stock portfolios. Probability distortion also affects the optimal solutions of the problem, independently of the employing weighting functional form; when subjective probabilities are employed the optimal weights of the most risky positively skewed assets seem to increase. Probability distortion has an additional important effect on optimal perspective values of the problem driving to a significant increase.","[Zervoudi, Evanthia K.] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece",Athens University of Economics & Business,"Zervoudi, EK (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Int & European Econ Studies, Patiss 76, Athens 10434, Attica, Greece.",zervoudiev@aueb.gr,,/0000-0001-7319-0552,,,,,28,4,4,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

Prior literature has argued that overlapping policies reduce the efficiency of emissions markets, absent other market failures. We extend the model of Fischer and Newell to incorporate knowledge spillovers for both advanced and conventional renewable energy technologies, as well as imperfections in demand for EE investments. EE undervaluation can justify interventions and raises the importance of fully pricing the social costs of electricity, making policies (like renewable subsidies) that lower electricity prices less desirable. Innovation market failures justify some technology policies, particularly correcting R&D incentives, but aggressive deployment policies seem unlikely to enhance welfare when placed alongside sufficient emissions pricing. Even with multiple market failures, emissions pricing remains the most cost-effective option for reducing emissions.

The ANP is a large protected area which comprises mainly cork oak woodlands. The visitors ranked cork oak reforestation programs delivering different sets of environmental (reforestation technique, biodiversity, forest surface) and social (jobs and recreation sites created) outcomes. We specify a novel latent class nested logit model for rank-ordered data to estimate the distribution of willingness-to-pay for each outcome. Our modeling approach jointly exploits recent advances in discrete choice methods. The results suggest that prioritizing biodiversity would increase certainty over public support for a reforestation program. In addition, a substantial fraction of the visitor population are willing to pay more for the social outcomes than the environmental outcomes, whereas the existing reforestation subsidies are often justified by the environmental outcomes alone.","[Oviedo, Jose L.] CSIC, Inst Publ Goods & Policies IPP, Madrid, Spain; [Yoo, Hong Il] Univ Durham, Sch Business, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Politicas y Bienes Publicos (IPP); Durham University,"Yoo, HI (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Sch Business, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England.",h.i.yoo@durham.ac.uk,"Oviedo, Jose L./F-7641-2016","Oviedo, Jose L./0000-0003-2043-5020",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [VEABA ECO2013-42110-P],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"Oviedo's involvement in this study was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (VEABA ECO2013-42110-P, I + D National Plan).",,68,9,10,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

More specifically, the purpose of our research is to disentangle the role of fundamental variables and market perception about variations on risk in order to explain the evolution of sovereign spreads in EMU during the recent crisis. Our results, in line with previous literature, show the importance of three groups of observable variables, namely, changes in risk-aversion of creditors, fiscal indebtedness and liquidity variables. In addition, our model includes unobserved components that are estimated through the Kalman filter as time-varying deviation from fixed-mean parameters of spread determinants. This shows the importance of expectations (market sentiments), amplifying (or reducing) the relative importance of the spread determinants over time through the time-varying behavior of the parameters around their steady-state estimates.

While there exists a plethora of studies on the interlinkages between international trade and income inequality, the existing literature on individual trade policy preferences has not considered the role of inequality in Shaping public opinion about international trade. By bringing these two separate strands of literature together, this study examines whether citizens associate income disparities with trade liberalization and, if so, how this linkage affects their attitudes toward international trade. Using data from a pcipulation-based survey-embedded experiment, this study identifies two key findings. First, individuals draw a link between skewed income distribution trends and international trade. Second, the perceived linkage between rising income inequality and trade liberalization is disconnected from the formation of trade policy preferences. These findings suggest that the association between rising income inequality and trade liberalization does not automatically lead citizens to endorse protectionist trade measures not because they are ignorant about the distributional effects of international trade. Rather, citizens fail to connect income inequality to foreign trade policy, because they may not perceive trade-induced inequality as unfair.","[Quynh Nguyen] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Comparat & Int Studies, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Haldeneggsteig 4,C43-1, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Quynh, N (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Comparat & Int Studies, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Haldeneggsteig 4,C43-1, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",quynh.nguyen@ingess.ethz.ch,,"Nguyen, Quynh/0000-0001-8466-7643",,,,,59,11,11,2,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

An important cost that is usually overlooked in measuring location affordability is the transportation or accessibility costs. In this paper, we present a modeling approach, driven by urban open data, to measure location affordability that incorporates both housing and transportation costs. We apply the developed model to assess housing affordability in Melbourne, Australia as a case study. Results suggest that neighbourhoods that appear to be affordable when only housing cost is considered are not necessarily affordable when transportation costs are taken into account. A negative correlation between housing affordability and transportation affordability is observed. We also identify the presence of a strong spatial clustering pattern in the affordability measure across the study area. A major methodological contribution of the paper is the inclusion of comprehensive private vehicle costs and public transportation expenses in the model that contributes to a more robust estimation and understanding of location affordability. The model also distinguishes between different trip purposes. Results suggest that plans and policies to improve housing affordability should be made in coordination with transportation infrastructure investment plans to ensure effective and equitable outcomes. Nevertheless, the focus of the paper is more on the measurement of affordability; rather than reviewing and recommending housing related policies.","[Saberi, Meead; Wu, Hongzhi; Amoh-Gyimah, Richard] Monash Univ, Inst Transport Studies, Dept Civil Engn, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Smith, Jonathan; Arunachalam, Dharmalingam] Monash Univ, Sch Social Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Monash University; Monash University,"Saberi, M (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Inst Transport Studies, Dept Civil Engn, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",meead.saberi@monash.edu,"; Smith, Jonathan/H-2837-2016","Wu, Hongzhi/0000-0002-4117-2795; Smith, Jonathan/0000-0002-6415-8179; Amoh-Gyimah, Richard/0000-0003-4571-8553; Saberi, Meead/0000-0002-6526-239X",Lord Mayor's Charitable Foundation Innovation Grant; Faculty of Arts and Faculty of Engineering at Monash University,Lord Mayor's Charitable Foundation Innovation Grant; Faculty of Arts and Faculty of Engineering at Monash University,This research is supported by a Lord Mayor's Charitable Foundation Innovation Grant and a seed grant jointly provided by the Faculty of Arts and Faculty of Engineering at Monash University.,,63,34,39,0,19,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Using structural vector auto regression estimates, Granger causality/block exogeneity wald test along with impulse response functions and forecast error variance decomposition analysis the study tests the proportion of term structure attributable to macro-economic shocks. The findings of the study show that short term rates are mainly influenced by the fiscal deficit present in emerging economies while long term rates get affected when market participants revise their expectation on yields. In addition, the output growth of the country is mainly depended on long and short rates and exchange rate fluctuations have a significant role in the fiscal deficit of the country.

However, there is hardly any knowledge about whether senior managers need to adjust their distribution of attention to exploitation and exploration in response to major changes in demand patterns in their industry. Drawing on the analysis of a panel data set of 86 firms in the information technology industry exposed to an economic recession and recovery, we find that successfully navigating an economic downturn demands more managerial attention to exploration, while leveraging the subsequent upswing requires more attention to exploitation. As such, this study contributes to the literature by providing a dynamic perspective on ambidexterity: that is, senior managers need to redistribute their attention to exploration and exploitation to effectively meet the changing environmental demands over time.","[Walrave, Bob; Romme, A.

This is particularly true in the domain of health insurance, where the general challenges of offering voluntary private health insurance are often exacerbated by poor underlying health services and a lack of public health programs. In an effort to identify new opportunities to expand health insurance protection to underserved markets, we analyze a rich data set from a micro health insurance program in Pakistan. Observing that pregnancy-related care accounts for 40 percent of all claims and 36 percent of the total claims amount, we focus much of our attention on understanding the role of pregnancy in micro health insurance. We find evidence of extensive adverse selection related to pregnancy claims, both with regard to original coverage purchase and with regard to renewal. In many countries, pregnancy health care is provided by or paid for by the government. We encourage consideration of this possibility, leaving the remaining health care needs for market-based health insurance.","[Yao, Yi] Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Schmit, Joan T.; Sydnor, Justin R.] Univ Wisconsin, Wisconsin Sch Business, Dept Actuarial Sci Risk Management & Insurance, 975 Univ Ave, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Peking University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Yao, Y (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",yao.yi@pku.edu.cn; jschmit@bus.wisc.edu; jsydnor@bus.wisc.edu,,,"School of Economics, Peking University","School of Economics, Peking University","We are grateful to Peter Wrede for making the data available and we appreciate Shiwei Qumu and Rui Wang for continuous support and assistance in data classification.

These issues become even more pressing when the debate turns to the links between regulation, deregulation and inequality. The recent experience of rising inequality in many countries has also brought to the fore predictable policy positions. A key aspect of labor regulation in developing countries, and one becoming more prominent in the era of rising inequality, is the minimum wage. The range of issues around regulation, minimum wage and informality was addressed by papers presented to a conference held in New Delhi on December 17-18, 2014.

A temporal incursion allows a better understanding of the way quality standards implemented by means of total quality management programs are reflected in final consumer's satisfaction as well as in organizations' long-term performance. Conceptual development of the model is intertwined with the pragmatic side, by presenting a case study of the mobile telecommunication sector in Romania. The quantitative research analyzes the influence of total quality management's (TQM) implementation in achieving the competitive advantage and the performance of enterprises in the telecom sector.

In this paper, we analyze the economic impact of natural resource technologies delivered by the Socio-environmental and Forestry Development Program-II (POSAF-II) in Nicaragua. We use cross-sectional data for 1,483 households, from 212 treated and control communities. Results obtained from propensity score matching (PSM), ordinary least squares (OLS), weighted least squares regression (WLS) based on PSM, and instrumental variables (IV) regression indicate that POSAF-II has had a positive impact on the total value of agricultural production of beneficiary farmers. An internal rate of return analysis supports the hypothesis that increasing household income while encouraging the sustainable use of natural resources through the implementation of suitable management programs can be complementary development objectives.

To answer to what extent the subsequent increase in biomass and profits was due to improved management, we isolate the effect of environmental variability. Projecting stock and harvest forward in the counterfactual scenario of no intervention, we show that the policy had a small positive impact on biomass, but a pronounced positive effect on profits. The main drivers of profit gains are increases in productivity and savings in fuel and labor costs.","[Diekert, Florian] Heidelberg Univ, Dept Econ, Heidelberg, Germany; [Diekert, Florian] Univ Oslo, CEES, Dept Biosci, Oslo, Norway; [Schweder, Tore] Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, Oslo, Norway",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; University of Oslo; University of Oslo,"Diekert, F (通讯作者)，Heidelberg Univ, Dept Econ, Heidelberg, Germany.;Diekert, F (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, CEES, Dept Biosci, Oslo, Norway.",,,"Diekert, Florian/0000-0002-5986-4060","NorMER, a Nordic Centre of Excellence for Research on Marine Ecosystems and Resources under Climate Change","NorMER, a Nordic Centre of Excellence for Research on Marine Ecosystems and Resources under Climate Change","We would like to thank Kristen Lund for invaluable input and effort.

This paper suggests a simple methodology that can separate the level from the volatility factors without directly estimating the volatility processes. This is made possible by exploiting features in the second order approximation of equilibrium models and using information in a large panel of data to estimate the factors. Augmenting the factors to a VAR shed light on the effects of the level and volatility shocks and their relative importance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we examine the key features of an optimal policy to manage environmental externalities that are both lagged and stochastic. We develop a two-period, two-polluter model and obtain closed-form solutions for optimal emissions levels under different combinations of damage functions and stochastic processes. These solutions show that it is not obvious whether greater control should be exerted on polluters that generate externalities with longer lags or on polluters that generate externalities with shorter lags. We find that the optimal ranking of polluters with respect to the length of the time lag associated with their externality will depend on (a) the discount rate, (b) conditional expectations of future states of the polluted resource, (c) persistence of the pollutant, and (d) initial conditions.","[Kuwayama, Yusuke] Resources Future Inc, 1616 P St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Brozovic, Nicholas] Univ Nebraska, Robert B Daugherty Water Food Inst, 2200 Vine St, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA",Resources for the Future; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Kuwayama, Y (通讯作者)，Resources Future Inc, 1616 P St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",kuwayama@rff.org,,,National Science Foundation [EAR 0709735],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The authors wish to thank Amy Ando, John Braden, Dallas Burtraw, Ximing Cai, Sahan Dissanayake, Dave Finnoff, Iddo Kan, Alan Krupnick, Chuck Mason, Ariel Ortiz-Bobea, Juan Robalino, Jay Shogren, Fred Sterbenz, Tom Tietenberg, Al Valocchi, Klaas van 't Veld, Guillermo Vuletin, Quinn Weninger, and three anonymous referees for valuable comments and suggestions.

Using an oligopoly model of vertical product differentiation, we examine how consumers' overestimation of the quality of intermediate-quality products affects firms' incentives to improve product quality. The firms non-cooperatively choose the quality of their product before choosing its price or quantity. Irrespective of the nature of second stage competition, Bertrand or Cournot, we find that quality overestimation by consumers increases profit of the intermediate-quality firm, and motivates it to raise its product's quality. In response, the high-quality firm improves its product quality even further but ends up with lower profit. Overall, average quality of the vertically differentiated product improves, which raises consumer surplus.

Yet, negative consequences of competitive environments have been reported and everyday experience suggests that competitive situations can be very stressful. It is, however, an open question whether or not economic competitions in the laboratory indeed elicit physiological stress reactions. Our study examined subjectively perceived stress and physiological changes induced by a well-established economic laboratory competition paradigm (first used in Niederle & Vesterlund, 2007) in a mixed-gender sample of 111 healthy participants. A mental arithmetic task was performed first under a piece rate (i.e., non-competitive) payment scheme and afterwards under a tournament condition. In a third round, participants decided how to be paid (i.e., piece rate or tournament). Our results indicate that compared to a control group, which performed only the non-competitive condition, the competitive game condition elicited subjective and physiological reactions that are indicative of mild stress, i.e., an increase in heart rate and a decrease of calmness and mood. Furthermore, reactions that are thought to reflect an active coping style were related to the self-selection into competition in the third round of the game. We speculate that real-life economic competitions might be even stronger stressors and the way how people cope with this kind of stress might be related to competitiveness in real-life economic contexts.

Previous research has demonstrated that in some cases, men and women adapt differently to livelihood stresses. We argue that looking only at an individual's sex is insufficient for understanding why they adapt the way they do. Instead, using the framework of intersectionality, we examine individuals' adaptation strategies and coping responses influenced not only by their sex but also their power and class. Using the case of a closed fishing season in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, India we employ interviews, seasonal activities calendars, and surveys to identify key variables that influence an individual's likelihood of employing reactive strategies that may threaten their longer term livelihood sustainability. We show that if we categorize individuals only by sex, then women are more likely to resort to reactive coping than men. However, this sex divide in reactive coping is driven by particular subsets of people who also lack power and/or capital. Furthermore, we find that power and class lead to different outcomes for men and women, with networked power most helpful to women above a certain financial threshold. This study highlights the necessity of examining gender and livelihood adaptations beyond the male versus female dichotomy: considering intersecting and locally relevant measures of power, class, and sex are pivotal in understanding why people adapt and cope the way they do. This understanding of adaptation options may also have implications for resource management decisions that do not force individuals to choose between long-term livelihood resilience and response to immediate stresses.

Especially for high-quality applicants who receive multiple competing offers, colleges are concerned about the probability that these students accept the offers of admission. As a result, applicants' contacts with admissions offices, such as campus visits, can be viewed positively by the officers as demonstrated interest in the colleges. We provide empirical evidence on the effects of demonstrated interest on admission outcomes. Specifically, we use unique and comprehensive administrative data, which include all contacts made by each applicant to the admissions office of a medium-sized highly selective university during two admission cycles. We find that an applicant who contacts the university is more likely to be admitted, and that the effect of the contact on the probability of admission is increasing in the applicant's Scholastic Assessment Test score, particularly when the contact is costly to make. We also use a numerical example to explore policies to reduce the inequity associated with the use of demonstrated interest in admission decisions, examining in particular the subsidization of costly demonstrated interest by low-income students.","[Dearden, James A.; Meyerhoefer, Chad D.; Yang, Muzhe] Lehigh Univ, Dept Econ, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [Li, Suhui] Math Policy Res, Hlth Div, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA",Lehigh University; Mathematica,"Dearden, JA (通讯作者)，Lehigh Univ, Dept Econ, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA.",jad8@lehigh.edu; eli@mathematica-mpr.com; chm308@lehigh.edu; muzheyang@lehigh.edu,"Dearden, James A/M-4964-2017","Yang, Muzhe/0000-0003-4167-0935",,,,,33,1,3,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1074-3529,1465-7287,,CONTEMP ECON POLICY,Contemp.

In addition, the bailout funds facilitated affected banks' faster return to their pre-crisis level of franchise value. Overall, the marginal benefit of TARP funds seems to have been greater for affected TARP banks.

Social capital, which reflects the level of cooperative norms in society, is likely to reduce opportunistic behavior (Jha and Chen 2015; Hasan et al., 2017) and, therefore, act as an informal monitoring mechanism. Consistent with our expectations, we find that banks in high social capital regions experienced fewer failures and less financial trouble during the 2007-2010 financial crisis than banks in low social capital regions. In addition, we find that social capital was negatively associated with abnormal risk-taking and positively associated with accounting transparency and accounting conservatism in the pre-crisis period of 2000-2006, indicating that risk-taking, accounting transparency, and accounting conservatism are possible channels through which social capital affected bank stability during the crisis.

The effectiveness of this innovative policy tool is crucial for understanding the role of the central bank in financial stability, but academic studies disagree on the empirical evidence of the TAF effect on Libor. We show that the disagreement arises from mis-specifications of econometric models. Regressions using the daily level of the Libor-OIS spread as the dependent variable miss either the permanent or temporary TAF effect, depending on whether the dummy variable indicates the events of the TAF or the regimes before and after an TAF event. Those regressions also suffer from the unit-root problem and produce unreliable test statistics. By contrast, regressions using the daily change in the Libor-OIS spread are robust to the persistence of the TAF effect and the unit-root problem, consistently producing reliable evidence that the downward shifts of the Libor-OIS spread were associated with the TAF. The evidence indicates the efficacy of the TAF in helping the interbank market to relieve liquidity strains. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Longitudinal evidence from a Dutch pension reform,PUBLIC CHOICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Pension reform; Political economy; Public opinion; Information,SOCIAL-SECURITY; WELFARE-STATE; RESPONSES; DECISION; STOCK; GO,"Governments often find it hard to pursue economic reforms, even if they eventually will benefit a majority of voters. The literature remains inconclusive about the reasons for this. Some scholars, on the one hand, stress the role of distributional conflicts between different classes, for instance dividing the young and the old in the case of pay-as-you-go pensions. Others have highlighted that resistance to reform is rather broad-based owing to the public's poor understanding of the need for reform. This paper attempts to disentangle the drivers of public acceptance of reform by means of a case study: the 2012 increase of the Dutch statutory retirement age from 65 to 67. We exploit a unique longitudinal dataset on the attitudes of Dutch households respecting pension reform in the 2003-2013 period. Our findings offer various new insights. First, we find that education, occupational status and psychological traits were the most systematic drivers of reform preferences, while age had a limited impact. Second, and significantly, we find that the year fixed effects were the main drivers of respondents' acceptance of reform. We interpret the pattern of the year coefficients as evidence of a collective learning process whereby households gradually updated their expectations and reform preferences in light of new information.","[Parlevliet, Jante] De Nederlandsche Bank, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Parlevliet, Jante] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",European Central Bank; De Nederlandsche Bank NV; University of Amsterdam,"Parlevliet, J (通讯作者)，De Nederlandsche Bank, Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Parlevliet, J (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",j.parlevliet@dnb.nl,,,,,,,64,16,17,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,OCT,2017,173.0,1-2,,,,,1,23,,10.1007/s11127-017-0447-7,0.0,,,23,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,FJ8CH,,"Green Published, hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412988600001,0

We find significant differences in transmission across commodities, with Chinese soybeans and soymeal and chicken price being the most integrated with world prices and rice being the least integrated.

We consider 15 art price indices namely: Contemporary, Drawings, France, Global index (Euro), Global index (USD), Modern art, Nineteenth century, Old Masters, Paintings, Photographies, Postwar, Prints, Sculptures, UK and US. We use quarterly data from 1998:1 to 2015: 1. We employ both standard and non-parametric single and joint variance ratio tests while accounting for small sample bias through the use of the wild bootstrapping. We show that the majority of the art markets are inefficient with the exception of the Old Masters that consistently prove efficient under both individual and joint variance ratio tests. To a lesser extent Contemporary, US and UK markets are also efficient.

We further find that the information structure is closely associated with global market and global geographical factors, and that each financial index's participation in the global market factor varies over time and presents dynamics.

However, due to demographic ageing, the need for long-term care is expected to increase while the informal care potential is expected to decline. From a budgetary perspective, informal care is often viewed as a cost-saving alternative to subsidised formal care. This view, however, neglects that many family carers are of working age and face the difficulty of reconciling care and paid work, which might entail sizeable indirect fiscal effects related to forgone tax revenues, lower social security contributions and higher transfer payments. In this paper, we use a structural model of labour supply and the choice of care arrangement to quantify these indirect fiscal effects of informal care. Moreover, based on the model, we discuss the fiscal effects related to non-take-up of formal care. Policy points Informal care is often viewed as a cost-saving alternative to subsidised formal care. This is because informal caregivers supply time and effort without being paid. This view neglects the indirect costs of informal care, such as reduced employment rates; since many family caregivers are of working age, they face difficulties reconciling informal care and market work. Formal care, on the other hand, enables informal caregivers to stay in the labour market. We quantify the indirect fiscal effects and show that an increase in formal care subsidies financed through a reduction in subsidies for informal care creates sizeable positive effects for the government budget.","[Geyer, Johannes; Haan, Peter] DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Haan, Peter] Free Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Korfhage, Thorben] RWI Essen, Essen, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Free University of Berlin; RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Geyer, J (通讯作者)，DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany.",jgeyer@diw.de; phaan@diw.de; thorben.korfhage@rwi-essen.de,"Geyer, Johannes/AAC-4919-2019","Geyer, Johannes/0000-0001-7851-4907","German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs Energy; Ministry of Innovation, Science & Research of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia","German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs Energy; Ministry of Innovation, Science & Research of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia","The authors thank participants of the health economics seminar at the University of Duisburg-Essen and two anonymous referees for useful comments.

A Relational Approach to Development Theory,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,African ethics; capabilities' approach; poverty; ubuntu; development theory; relational ethics,SOUTH-AFRICA; WATER; GENDER; ACCESS; CONTEXT,"Over the last two decades, the capabilities' approach has become an increasingly influential theory of development. It conceptualizes human wellbeing in terms of an individual's ability to achieve functionings we have reason to value. In contrast, the ethic of ubuntu views human flourishing as the propensity to pursue relations of fellowship with others, such that relationships have fundamental value. These two theoretical perspectives seem to be in tension with each other. While the capabilities' approach seems to focus on individuals as the locus of ethical value, an ubuntu ethic concentrates on the relations between individuals as the locus. In this article, we ask, to what extent is the capabilities' approach compatible with this African ethical theory? We argue that, on reflection, relations play a much stronger role in the capabilities' approach than often assumed. There is good reason to believe that relationality is part of the concept of a capability itself, where such relationality has intrinsic ethical value. This understanding of the ethical centrality of relations grounds new normative perspectives on capabilities, and offers a more comprehensive grasp of the relevance of relationships to empirical enquiry. We hope this provides an indication of the rich conversations that are possible when African and Anglo-American intellectual traditions engage one another, and whets the appetite of thinkers working in western traditions to engage with their colleagues in Africa and the global South more generally.

We compare the impact of aggregation with that of choosing a model for the conditional volatilities and correlations, the distribution for the innovations, and the method of forecast construction. We find that the level of temporal aggregation is most important. Daily returns form the best basis for VaR forecasts.

They reduce externalities generated from private vehicles and increase geographic mobility. However, unlike most private vehicles in the United States, they use diesel fuel and emit higher amounts of toxic pollutants. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency set emission standards for transit buses starting in 1988 that have been continually updated, but their public health and economic impacts are unclear due to scarce emissions data. I construct a novel panel dataset for the New York City (NYC) Transit bus fleet between 1990 and 2009 and examine the impact of bus pollution on infant health by using bus vintage as a proxy for emissions. I exploit the variation in vintage as older buses are retired and replaced with newer, lower-emitting buses forced to adhere to stricter emission standards. I then assign maternal exposure to bus vintage at the census block level. Findings suggest that maternal exposure to the oldest, unregulated buses is associated with modest reductions in birth weight and gestational age relative to newer buses that abide by emissions policies. I then conduct a back-of-the-envelope cost-benefit calculation and find net economic benefits of $53.3 million resulting from improved emission standards for the 2009 birth cohort in NYC. Since the treatment in this study clearly maps to federal emissions policies, these results are the first to provide credible evidence that transit bus emission standards had a positive effect on infant health.

Using Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) panel data covering the 2001 and 2007 to 2009 recessions and their aftermaths, we identify individuals whose jobless spells outlasted their UI benefits (exhaustees) and examine household income, program participation, and health-related outcomes during the six months following UI exhaustion. For the average exhaustee, the loss of UI benefits is only slightly offset by increased participation in other safety net programs (e.g., food stamps), and family poverty rates rise substantially. Self-reported disability also rises following UI exhaustion.

Only a part of this growth can be attributed to the ageing of the population. Rising long-term care costs threaten the sustainability of Dutch public finances: additional public revenues are needed to cover the additional spending. In this paper, we evaluate four alternative policies to finance the anticipated additional growth in long-term care above the rate implied by projected demographic growth. We analyse these financing alternatives using a macromodel, focusing on the long-term effects on economic growth and on the redistribution of costs and benefits between birth cohorts. We find a relatively large intergenerational redistribution of lifetime net benefits for a pay-as-you-go system and for an immediate one-time increase of the premium rate, while a cohort-specific savings system or a pensioner tax both have relatively small intergenerational effects. Labour supply and private consumption decline in all four financing alternatives, although the size and timing of these effects differ. Policy points Rising long-term care costs threaten fiscal sustainability. Alternative ways of financing lead to different redistributions of costs and benefits over the various generations. In the pay-as-you-go system and the collective savings fund, most current generations benefit while the younger and future generations have to contribute more. The pensioner tax and cohort-specific savings fund lead to only a small redistribution of net benefits. Economic effects, caused by behavioural responses to policy changes, should be taken into account when considering different financing alternatives.","[Wouterse, Bram; Smid, Bert] CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, The Hague, Netherlands; [Wouterse, Bram] Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands",CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Wouterse, B (通讯作者)，CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, The Hague, Netherlands.;Wouterse, B (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",b.wouterse@cpb.nl; b.c.smid@cpb.nl,,,Netspar,Netspar,"The authors acknowledge Nick Draper, Andre Nibbelink and Harry ter Rele for their support during the research and are grateful to Rob Luginbuhl for copy-editing the paper.

Research on mobile sources of pollution has foundered due both to inaccessibility of Chinese data on health outcomes and strong identifying assumptions. To address these, we collect daily ambulance call data from the Beijing Emergency Medical Center and combine them with an idiosyncratic feature of a driving restriction policy in Beijing that references the last digit of vehicles' license plate numbers. Because the number 4 is considered unlucky by many in China, it tends to be avoided on license plates. As a result, days on which the policy restricts license plates ending in 4 unintentionally allow more vehicles in Beijing. Leveraging this variation, we find that traffic congestion is indeed 22% higher on days banning 4 and that 24-hour average concentration of NO2 is 12% higher. Correspondingly, these short-term increases in pollution increase ambulance calls by 12% and 3% for fever and heart-related symptoms, while no effects are found for injuries. These findings suggest that traffic congestion has substantial health externalities in China but that they are also responsive to policy.","[Zhong, Nan] Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ & Sch Econ, Xiamen 361006, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Cao, Jing] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yuzhu] Beijing Emergency Med Ctr, Beijing 100031, Peoples R China",Xiamen University; Tsinghua University,"Zhong, N (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ & Sch Econ, Xiamen 361006, Fujian, Peoples R China.",nanzhong@xmu.edu.cn; caojing@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn,,,"National Science Foundation of China [71422013, 71173130]; Harvard Global Institute; Hang Lung Center for Real Estate; Tsinghua University Research Center for Green Economy and Sustainable Development; Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities",National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Harvard Global Institute; Hang Lung Center for Real Estate; Tsinghua University Research Center for Green Economy and Sustainable Development; Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This paper is supported by National Science Foundation of China (project codes: 71422013 and 71173130), Harvard Global Institute, Hang Lung Center for Real Estate, Tsinghua University Research Center for Green Economy and Sustainable Development, Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program, and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.

Thus, it allows an assessment of the contribution to inequality of different relevant variables. In short, the paper appraises the relative contributions of affluence, sectoral composition, demographic factors and climate. The analysis is applied to selected years of the period 1993-2007.

In Egypt, however, despite the fact that mobile penetration rate amounts to almost 100 %, MM services penetration rate is still quite low around 1 %, and more importantly with minimal impact on the Egyptian economy at large. Thus, this research paper examines the socioeconomic adoption factors of MM services in Egypt using a Nielsen syndicated survey of MM users. This survey was conducted in April 2015 on a sample of 953 mobile money users. The findings of the empirical study reveal that the profile of a mobile money user in Egypt is similar to his Kenyan counterpart; namely an affluent, university educated and male user. However, the theory of early adopters is not evident in Egypt's case. Urbanization plays no role in the socioeconomic adoption factors controlled for in the estimated model. The empirical model also shows that, according to the survey, the perception of Islamic financial rules does not contradict with the adoption of MM services in Egypt. Finally policy recommendations are provided for the regulator and the telecom operators, drawing from other successful case studies in this domain.","[Badran, Mona Farid] Cairo Univ, Fac Econ & Polit Sci, Giza, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Cairo University,"Badran, MF (通讯作者)，Cairo Univ, Fac Econ & Polit Sci, Giza, Egypt.",mona.badran@feps.edu.eg,,,,,,,27,5,7,0,15,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1309-4297,2147-4281,,EURASIAN BUS REV,Eurasian Bus.

To reconcile theory and reality, we extend the set of assets included in the Mundell-Fleming model to include both bonds and non-bonds. At a given policy rate, inflows may decrease the rate on nonbonds, reducing the cost of financial intermediation, potentially offsetting the contractionary impact of appreciation.

We find that a 2003 reform that empowered shareholders to approve or reject repricing proposals led to value increases in previous repricers. The likelihood of repricing becomes less sensitive to poor manager performance, but remains similarly sensitive to bad luck, after the reform. Average post-repricing changes in firm performance are positive only after the reform.
