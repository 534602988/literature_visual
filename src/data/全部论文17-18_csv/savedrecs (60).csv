Several studies have noted that there are methodological challenges to conducting economic evaluations of NGS tests. Objective: Our objective was to examine key methodological challenges for conducting economic evaluations of NGS tests, prioritize these challenges for future research, and identify how studies have attempted solutions to address these challenges. Methods: We identified challenges for economic evaluations of NGS tests using prior literature and expert judgment of the co-authors. We used a modified Delphi assessment to prioritize challenges, based on importance and probability of resolution. Using a structured literature review and article extraction we then assessed whether published economic evaluations had addressed these challenges. Results: We identified 11 challenges for conducting economic evaluations of NGS tests. The experts identified three challenges as the top priorities for future research: complex model structure, timeframe, and type of analysis and comparators used. Of the 15 published studies included in our literature review, four studies described specific solutions relevant to five of the 11 identified challenges. Conclusions: Major methodological challenges to economic evaluations of NGS tests remain to be addressed. Our results can be used to guide future research and inform decision-makers on how to prioritize research on the economic assessment of NGS tests.","[Phillips, Kathryn A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Clin Pharm, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Phillips, Kathryn A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Ctr Translat & Policy Res Personalized Med TRANSP, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Phillips, Kathryn A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, UCSF Philip R Lee Inst Hlth Policy, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Phillips, Kathryn A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehens Canc Ctr, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Deverka, Patricia A.] Amer Inst Res, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Marshall, Deborah A.] Univ Calgary, Dept Community Hlth Sci, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Wordsworth, Sarah; Buchanan, James] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Med Sci Div, Oxford, England; [Regier, Dean A.] Univ British Columbia, Canc Control BC, Sch Populat & Publ Hlth, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Christensen, Kurt D.] Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Boston, MA 02115 USA",University of California System; University of California San Francisco; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; UCSF Medical Center; UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center; American Institutes for Research; University of Calgary; University of Oxford; University of British Columbia; Harvard University; Brigham & Women's Hospital,"Phillips, KA (通讯作者)，Dept Clin Pharm, 3333 Calif St,Room 420,POB 0613, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",kathryn.Phillips@ucsf.edu,"Buchanan, James/H-7157-2019; Marshall, Deborah/J-7248-2015","Buchanan, James/0000-0003-2528-0638; Marshall, Deborah/0000-0002-8467-8008; Wordsworth, Sarah/0000-0002-2361-3040",National Human Genome Research Institute [R01 HG007063],National Human Genome Research Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)),This study was funded by a grant from the National Human Genome Research Institute (R01 HG007063) and consulting agreement with Illumina (no number).,,32,49,52,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP,2018,21.0,9,,,,,1033,1042,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.06.017,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GT9BF,30224106.0,"Green Accepted, hybrid, Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000444833500004,0

This is partly due to a lack of clinical and economic studies, with the latter increasingly challenged to examine patient preferences for health and nonhealth outcomes (e.g., false-positive rate). Objectives: To conduct a structured review of studies valuing patients' preference-based utility for NGS outcomes, to highlight identified methodological challenges, and to consider how studies addressed identified challenges. Methods: We searched MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (Ovid), and Web of Science for published studies examining outcomes from health care decisions informed by NGS. We focused our search on direct elicitations of preference-based utility. We reviewed included studies and qualitatively grouped and summarized stated challenges and solutions by theme. Results: Eleven studies were included. Most of them (n = 6) used discrete choice experiments to value utility. We categorized challenges into four themes: 1) valuing the full range of NGS outcomes, 2) accounting for accuracy and uncertainty surrounding effectiveness, 3) allowing for simultaneous multiple and cascading risks, and 4) incorporating downstream consequences. Studies found strong evidence of utility for NGS information, regardless of health improvement. Investigators addressed challenges by simplifying complex choices, by including health outcomes alongside nonhealth outcomes, and by using multiple elicitation techniques. Conclusions: The breadth and complexity of NGS-derived information makes the technology a unique and challenging application for utility valuation. Failing to account for the utility or disutility of NGS-related nonhealth outcomes may lead to overinvestment or underinvestment in NGS, and so there is a need for research addressing unresolved challenges.","[Regier, Dean A.; Weymann, Deirdre] BC Canc, Canc Control Res, Canadian Ctr Appl Res Canc Control, 675 West 10th Ave, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada; [Regier, Dean A.] Univ British Columbia, Sch Populat & Publ Hlth, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Buchanan, James; Wordsworth, Sarah] Univ Oxford, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Oxford, England; [Marshall, Deborah A.] Univ Calgary, Dept Community Hlth Sci, Calgary, AB, Canada",University of British Columbia; University of Oxford; University of Calgary,"Regier, DA (通讯作者)，BC Canc, Canc Control Res, Canadian Ctr Appl Res Canc Control, 675 West 10th Ave, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada.",dregier@bccrc.ca,"Buchanan, James/H-7157-2019; Marshall, Deborah/J-7248-2015","Buchanan, James/0000-0003-2528-0638; Wordsworth, Sarah/0000-0002-2361-3040; Marshall, Deborah/0000-0002-8467-8008",Canadian Centre for Applied Research in Cancer Control; Canadian Cancer Society Research Institute [2015-019789],Canadian Centre for Applied Research in Cancer Control; Canadian Cancer Society Research Institute(Canadian Cancer Society (CCS)),"Dr. Regier was supported by the Canadian Centre for Applied Research in Cancer Control, which receives funding from the Canadian Cancer Society Research Institute grant #2015-019789.

Despite this is crucial to design effective policies of formal elderly care, empirical evidence is scant due to the lack of credible identification strategies to account for the endogeneity of formal care. We propose a novel instrument, an index that captures individuals' eligibility status for the long-term care programs implemented in the region of residence. Our estimates, which are robust to a number of different specifications, suggest that higher formal care provision would lead to an increase in informal care utilization as well. In the context of current theoretical economic model of care use, this result points to the existence of a substantial unmet demand of care among older people in Europe.","[Carrino, Ludovico] Kings Coll London, Dept Global Hlth & Social Med, London, England; [Carrino, Ludovico; Orso, Cristina Elisa; Pasini, Giacomo] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Econ, Cannaregio 873, I-30121 Venice, Italy; [Pasini, Giacomo] NETSPAR, Networks Studies Pens Aging & Retirement, Tilburg, Netherlands",University of London; King's College London; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Tilburg University,"Pasini, G (通讯作者)，Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Econ, Cannaregio 873, I-30121 Venice, Italy.",giacomo.pasini@unive.it,"Pasini, Giacomo/E-7032-2014","Pasini, Giacomo/0000-0002-2052-3453; Carrino, Ludovico/0000-0002-5082-5508",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/P000487/1]; Fondazione Farmafactoring; ESRC [ES/P000487/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Fondazione Farmafactoring(Fondazione CarifeFondazione Caritro); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Economic and Social Research Council, Grant/Award Number: ES/P000487/1; Fondazione Farmafactoring, Grant/Award Number: Research Award 2015",,35,22,23,4,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,AUG,2018,27.0,8,,,,,1175,1188,,10.1002/hec.3665,0.0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GL4IN,29696714.0,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000437114300003,0

Despite oncologists' crucial role in guiding cancer care, current literature is sparse with respect to the oncologists' views on value. Here, we evaluated oncologists perceptions of the use and measurement of value in cancer care. Methods: We conducted in-depth, open-ended interviews with 31 US oncologists practicing nationwide in various environments. Oncologists discussed the definition, measurement, and implementation of value. Transcripts were analyzed using matrix and thematic analysis. Results: Oncologists' definitions of value varied greatly. Some described versions of the standard health economic definition of value, that is, cost relative to health outcomes. Many others did not include cost in their definition of value. Oncologists considered patient goals and quality of life as important components of value that they perceived were missing from current value measurement. Oncologists prioritized a patient-centric view of value over societal or other perspectives. Oncologists were inclined to consider the value of a treatment only if they perceived treatment would pose a financial burden to patients. Oncologists had differing opinions regarding who should be responsible for determining whether care is low value but generally felt this should remain within the purview of the oncology community. Conclusions: Oncologists agreed that cost was an important issue, but disagreed about whether cost was involved in value as well as the role of value in guiding treatment. Better clarity and alignment on the definition of and appropriate way to measure value is critical to the success of efforts to improve value in cancer care.","[Gidwani-Marszowski, Risha; Murrell, Samantha S.] VA Palo Alto Hlth Care Syst, Hlth Econ Resource Ctr, Palo Alto, CA USA; [Gidwani-Marszowski, Risha; Nevedal, Andrea L.; Timko, Christine; Asch, Steven M.] VA Palo Alto Hlth Care Syst, Ctr Innovat Implementat, Palo Alto, CA USA; [Gidwani-Marszowski, Risha; Asch, Steven M.] Stanford Univ, Div Primary Care & Populat Hlth, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Blayney, Douglas W.; Patel, Manali; Ramchandran, Kavitha] Stanford Univ, Div Med Oncol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Patel, Manali] VA Palo Alto Hlth Care Syst, Palo Alto, CA USA; [Patel, Manali] Stanford Univ, Ctr Hlth Policy, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Patel, Manali] Stanford Univ, Ctr Primary Care & Outcomes Res, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kelly, P.

However, it is unclear whether patient perspectives were solicited during development or validation of the included patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures. Objective: To examine the pedigree of a sample of measures included in the COA Compendium. Methods: PROs included in chapters 1 or 2 of the COA Compendium were extracted and three reviewers independently searched PubMed and Google to identify information on measure pedigree. Data on method and stage of measure development where patient engagement took place were documented. Results: Among the 26 evaluated PRO measures, we were unable to identify information on development or validation on nearly half the sample (n = 12). Among the remaining 14 measures, 5 did not include any evidence of patient engagement; 2 engaged patients during concept elicitation only; 1 engaged patients during psychometric validation only; and 6 engaged patients during both concept elicitation and cognitive interviewing. Measures either previously qualified or submitted for qualification were more likely to include patient engagement. Conclusions: For the FDA Pilot COA Compendium to fulfill its purpose of fostering PFDD, it needs fine-tuning to reflect today's standards, improving transparency and facilitating clear identification of included measures so that the level of patient engagement, among other factors, can be properly assessed. Suggested improvements include identifying clinical trials that correspond to the COA Compendium's use in drug development; more clearly identifying which measure is referred to; and including only those measures that already qualified or undergoing qualification.","[Oehrlein, Elisabeth M.; Perfetto, Eleanor M.; Love, T.

Methods The PRIME Diabetes Model, a patient-level, discrete event simulation model, was used to project long-term clinical and cost outcomes for patients with type 1 diabetes from the perspective of a German healthcare payer. Simulated patients had a mean age of 21.5 years, duration of diabetes of 8.6 years, and baseline glycosylated hemoglobin of 7.39%. Regular human insulin and rapid-acting analog insulin regimens reduced glycosylated hemoglobin by 0.312 and 0.402%, respectively. Compared with human insulin, hypoglycemia rate ratios with rapid-acting analog insulin were 0.51 (non-severe nocturnal) and 0.80 (severe). No differences in non-severe diurnal hypoglycemia were modeled. Discount rates of 3% were applied to future costs and clinical benefits accrued over the 50-year time horizon. Results In the base-case analysis, rapid-acting analog insulin was associated with an improvement in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 1.01 quality-adjusted life-years per patient (12.54 vs. 11.53 quality-adjusted life-years). Rapid-acting analog insulin was also associated with an increase in direct costs of (sic)4490, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of (sic)4427 per quality-adjusted life-year gained vs. human insulin. Sensitivity analyses showed that the base case was driven predominantly by differences in hypoglycemia; abolishing these differences reduced incremental quality-adjusted life expectancy to 0.07 quality-adjusted life-years, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of (sic)74,622 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Conclusions Rapid-acting analog insulin is associated with beneficial outcomes in patients with type 1 diabetes and is likely to be considered cost effective in the German setting vs. regular human insulin.","[Valentine, William J.; Pollock, Richard F.] Ossian Hlth Econ & Commun GmbH, Baumleingasse 20, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland; [Van Brunt, Kate] Eli Lilly & Co, Windlesham, Surrey, England; [Boye, Kristina S.] Eli Lilly & Co, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA",Eli Lilly; Eli Lilly,"Pollock, RF (通讯作者)，Ossian Hlth Econ & Commun GmbH, Baumleingasse 20, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland.",pollock@ossianconsulting.com,,"Pollock, Richard/0000-0002-9873-7507",Eli Lilly and Company,Eli Lilly and Company(Eli Lilly),The study was funded by Eli Lilly and Company.,,42,4,4,0,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

Methods: A systematic search for relevant studies on rare diseases was conducted in PubMed and Embase (until December 2016). In addition, annual treatment costs of nononcological OMPs in Germany were analyzed with respect to five explanatory variables: total prevalence of disease, prevalence with added benefit, availability of alternative treatments for the same indication, extent/probability of treatment benefit, and evidence for a treatment effect on mortality. Results: A total of nine studies with specific estimates of the budget impact of OMPs for a total of 11 countries were identified; one study addressed specifically ultrarare diseases. Annual per-capita spending for OMPs ranges from (sic)1.32 in Latvia to (sic)16 in France. Per-patient annual treatment costs vary between (sic)27,811 and (sic)1,647,627 in Germany. On the basis of the German data set, the regression analysis shows that log prevalence has a significant inverse relationship with log annual treatment cost. In this model, doubling the prevalence leads to a 43% decrease in annual treatment cost. Conclusions: Despite per-patient annual treatment costs ranging up to several hundreds of thousands of euros for some OMPs, percapita spending for OMPs is relatively small. In this study an inverse relationship between prevalence and annual treatment costs was found.","[Schlander, Michael] Inst Innovat & Valuat Hlth Care, Wiesbaden, Germany; [Schlander, Michael] Heidelberg Univ, German Canc Res Ctr, Heidelberg, Germany; [Dintsios, Charalabos-Markos] Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, Inst Hlth Serv Res & Hlth Econ, Med Fac, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Gandjour, Afschin] Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Frankfurt, Germany",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Helmholtz Association; German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ); Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf; Frankfurt School Finance & Management,"Schlander, M (通讯作者)，German Canc Res Ctr, Div Hlth Econ, Neuenheimer Feld 280,TP4, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",m.schlander@dkfz.de,"Gandjour, Afschin/I-8963-2019",,BioMarin (London),BioMarin (London),Parts of this study were financially supported by BioMarin (London) under an unrestricted educational grant policy.,,55,29,31,1,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAY,2018,21.0,5,,,,,525,531,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.10.015,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GF7VC,29753348.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000432175400006,0

However, this system is unlikely to be sustainable in the medium to long term. This study investigates the feasibility and acceptability of healthcare financing reform by examining households' willingness to pay (WTP) for a contributory national health insurance scheme. Using the contingent valuation method, a pre-tested interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from 1187 heads of household in Jeddah province over a 5-month period. Multi-stage sampling was employed to select the study sample. Using a double-bounded dichotomous choice with the follow-up elicitation method, respondents were asked to state their WTP for a hypothetical contributory national health insurance scheme. Tobit regression analysis was used to examine the factors associated with WTP and assess the construct validity of elicited WTP. Over two-thirds (69.6%) indicated that they were willing to participate in and pay for a contributory national health insurance scheme. The mean WTP was 50 Saudi Riyal (US$13.33) per household member per month. Tobit regression analysis showed that household size, satisfaction with the quality of public healthcare services, perceptions about financing healthcare, education and income were the main determinants of WTP. This study demonstrates a theoretically valid WTP for a contributory national health insurance scheme by Saudi people. The research shows that willingness to participate in and pay for a contributory national health insurance scheme depends on participant characteristics. Identifying and understanding the main influencing factors associated with WTP are important to help facilitate establishing and implementing the national health insurance scheme. The results could assist policy-makers to develop and set insurance premiums, thus providing an additional source of healthcare financing.","[Al-Hanawi, Mohammed Khaled; Alsharqi, Omar] King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Hlth Serv & Hosp Adm Dept, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; [Al-Hanawi, Mohammed Khaled; Vaidya, Kirit] Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Econ Finance & Entrepreneurship Grp, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Onwujekwe, Obinna] Univ Nigeria Enugu Campus, Dept Hlth Adm & Management, Coll Med, Enugu, Nigeria",King Abdulaziz University; Aston University; University of Nigeria,"Al-Hanawi, MK (通讯作者)，King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Hlth Serv & Hosp Adm Dept, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.;Al-Hanawi, MK (通讯作者)，Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Econ Finance & Entrepreneurship Grp, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",mkalhanawi@kau.edu.sa,"Onwujekwe, Obinna/O-6232-2014; Al-Hanawi, Mohammed Khaled/AAB-2455-2020","Al-Hanawi, Mohammed Khaled/0000-0002-8419-2219","King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia","King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia","This work is supported by King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia in the form of a PhD scholarship for MA.",,52,33,34,1,11,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

Objectives: To analyze data from the Comparison of Acute Treatments in Cancer Hemostasis (CATCH) trial to describe the impact of rVTE and bleeding events on health-related quality of life. Methods: The three-level EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D) data were collected monthly for up to 7 months in patients starting anticoagulation for newly diagnosed VTE. Analyses were designed to describe the impact of rVTE and bleeding on EQ-5D scores while controlling for effects of covariates such as background and clinical variables and longitudinal changes. A repeated-measures model with specification of the variance-covariance matrix to characterize the intrapatient correlation was used to estimate the utility values. The impact of an rVTE or a bleeding event was assumed to be reflected in the utility value when it occurred within 2 weeks from a planned data collection point. Results: Data were available from 883 patients. A total of 76 rVTE and 159 bleeding events occurred during follow-up. rVTE had a significant impact on EQ-5D scores, with a decrement of 0.075 on the basis of our reference case (male, no metastasis, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score = 1, Western European), but different patients might have different decrements. Bleeding events had a smaller (nonstatistically significant) impact on EQ-5D scores. Conclusions: This data set study has quantified the decline in EQ-5D scores associated with experiencing rVTE or bleeding events in cancer patients. These results indicate the net gain in quality of life and impact on costeffectiveness of secondary VTE prevention.","[Lloyd, Andrew J.] Acaster Lloyd Consulting Ltd, 3 Kings Meadow, Oxford OX2 0DP, England; [Dewilde, Sarah] Serv Hlth Econ, Brussels, Belgium; [Noble, Simon] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Reimer, Elisabeth] Leo Pharma AS, Ballerup, Denmark; [Lee, Agnes Y.

Our experiment randomized 690 participants into a control group that received a $30 payment unconditionally or one of 3 incentive groups that received a payment for attending the gym at least 9 times over the first 6 weeks of membership. Two incentive treatment arms offered monetary payments of $30 and $60. The third incentive treatment, motivated by the endowment effect, offered a physical item worth $30. All three incentives had only small impacts on attendance during members' first 6 weeks and no effect on their post-incentive visit trajectories.

The need for the relevant analytical framework for assessing the economic value of such technologies has been recognized. Objectives: To present a modified difference-in-differences (DID) cost-effectiveness methodology that facilitates visualization of a new health technology's learning curve. Methods: Using the Premier Perspective database (Premier Inc., Charlotte, NC), we examined the impact of physicians adopting a bipolar sealer (BPS) to control blood loss in primary unilateral total knee arthroplasties on hospital lengths of stay and total hospitalization costs when compared with two control groups. In our DID approach, we substituted month-from-adoption for the calendar-month-of-adoption in both graphical representations and ordinary least-squares regression results to estimate the effect of the BPS. Results: The results clearly demonstrated a learning curve associated with the adoption of the BPS technology. Although the reductions in length of stay were immediate, the first postadoption year costs increased by $1335 (extrahospital controls) to $1565 (within-hospital controls). Importantly, and also consistent with a learning curve hypothesis, these initial higher costs were offset by subsequent cost savings in the second and third years postadoption. Conclusions: The presented modified DID approach is a suitable and versatile analytical tool for economic evaluation of a slowly diffusing medical device or health technology. It provides a better understanding of the potential learning effects associated with relevant interventions.","[Kuznietsova, Victoria] Medtron Aduanced Energy LLC, Portsmouth, NH USA; [Kuznietsova, Victoria; Woodward, Robert S.] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Econ, Peter T Paul Coll Business & Econ, 10 Garrison Ave, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Woodward, Robert S.] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Hlth Management & Policy, Coll Hlth & Human Serv, Durham, NH 03824 USA",University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire,"Kuznietsova, V (通讯作者)，Univ New Hampshire, Dept Econ, Peter T Paul Coll Business & Econ, 10 Garrison Ave, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",victoria.kuznietsova@gmail.com,,,"Medtronic Advanced Energy, LLC, Portsmouth, NH","Medtronic Advanced Energy, LLC, Portsmouth, NH","This study was funded by Medtronic Advanced Energy, LLC, Portsmouth, NH.

We have made some adjustments to these classical models in such a way as to reduce this unwanted variance. The nature of estimated parameters and their variance was examined experimentally on artificial data as well as on real world datasets. These experiments show that the variance of estimated parameters was reduced considerably. Other parameter properties based on these experiments are also described.

Further, people tend to base more of their intellectual labour on rapidly increasing volumes of online data, content and computing resources, and the lack of corresponding scaling in availability of the human brain resources poses a bottleneck in the intellectual labour.

The Web, Internet of Things and Internet of Brains will be connected employing the same kind of semantic structures, and work in interoperation. Applying Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs), psychology and behavioural science, we discuss the feasibility of a possible decion making infrastructure for semantic transfer of human thoughts, thinking processes, communication directly to the Internet.","[Fensel, Anna] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Comp Sci, Semant Technol Inst STI Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria",University of Innsbruck,"Fensel, A (通讯作者)，Univ Innsbruck, Dept Comp Sci, Semant Technol Inst STI Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.",,,"Fensel, Anna/0000-0002-1391-7104",project DALICC - Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) within the program Future ICT,project DALICC - Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) within the program Future ICT,"This work has been partially funded by project DALICC, supported by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) within the program Future ICT.",,23,0,0,0,9,UNIV POLITECNICA VALENCIA,VALENCIA,"CAMINO VERA S-N, VALENCIA, 46022, SPAIN",,,978-84-9048-689-4,,,,2018,,,,,,,167,175,,10.4995/CARMA2018.2018.8338,0.0,,,9,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BN2ZN,,"Bronze, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000477974500020,0

The next we relax the assumption about no cross-sectional dependence and so we allowed the existence of the common factors influence all analyzed stocks. We found that both factors have the statistically significant impact on the return. The next the variance is negatively correlated with the return and skewness is positively correlated with the return. It means that the investors prefer volatility and negatively skew financial stocks which could imply the speculative behavior of the investors during the period 11.12.2007 to the 29.11.2016.","[Fryd, Lukas] Univ Econ Prague, Dept Econometr, Winston Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Fryd, L (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Dept Econometr, Winston Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067, Czech Republic.",xfryl00@vse.cz,,,"research grant VSE, Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, University of Economics, Prague [IGA F4/78/2018]","research grant VSE, Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, University of Economics, Prague","We gratefully acknowledge the support of this project by the research grant VSE IGA F4/78/2018, Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, University of Economics, Prague.",,15,0,0,0,0,"MATFYZPRESS PUBL HOUSE, FAC MATH & PHYSICS",PRAHA 8,"CHARLES UNIV PRAGUE, SOKOLOVSKA 83, PRAHA 8, 186 75, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7378-372-3,,,,2018,,,,,,,109,113,,,,,,5,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BO2PI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000507455300020,0

Initially, the silver economy was mainly related to manufacturing activities and to adapting existing products to the needs of older people. Nowadays, more and more often the silver economy is treated as the possibility of using the aging process of the population to focus development in which the change in the age structure of the population and the increase in the activity of seniors will be the source of economic development. It should be assumed that the increase in the activity of older people is conditioned by a better satisfaction of their needs and promotes higher quality not only of their lives but of the whole society. Currently, among the prospective sectors of the silver economy, apart from health, construction, housing, there is a lot of recreation, especially tourism and leisure time management. Nevertheless, there is little room in literature for recreation as a sector, favourable for the development of the silver economy. The main goal of the article is to indicate that recreation is an important segment of the silver economy, and the areas particularly well suited for the development of the silver economy are health resorts. The article will be divided into three parts. The first part will present a review of the literature concerning the silver economy and its segments, with particular emphasis on the location of subjects related to recreation and leisure for seniors. In the second part, the spa will be presented as a recreation space for seniors. The third part will be a case study of Kolobrzeg - the largest health resort in Poland.

Commodity bundles are elements of the space M(K) of signed Borel measures on a compact space K of commodity characteristics. Ostroy and Zame provide two sufficient conditions for core equivalence: It is sufficient that markets are physically thick, so that there are many suppliers of every commodity, or that markets are economically thick, so that consumers are sufficiently willing to substitute commodities with a similar composition for each other. The sufficient conditions in Ostroy and Zame (1994) all imply that there are many more agents than commodities, an idea of Aumann that was formalized and discussed in Tourky and Yannelis (2001) and Greinecker and Podczeck (2016). We generalize the framework in Ostroy and Zame (1994) and weaken their sufficient conditions to not imply the presence of many more agents than commodities. In particular, we drop the requirement that K is metrizable from the basic model, the requirement of an uniform bound on endowments from the condition of physically thick markets, and the requirement that preferences are weak*-continuous from the condition of economically thick markets. Core equivalence still holds, showing that many more agents than commodities are not needed for core equivalence in models of commodity differentiation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A Test of Health State Reference Dependency Using Self-assessed Health and an Efficient Discrete Choice Experiment,HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,health state valuation; prospect theory; discrete choice experiment; EQ-5D,CONJOINT-ANALYSIS; DUTCH TARIFF; PREFERENCES; DESIGNS; EQ-5D; ISSUES,"Health state valuations of patients and non-patients are not the same, whereas health state values obtained from general population samples are a weighted average of both. The latter constitutes an often-overlooked source of bias. This study investigates the resulting bias and tests for the impact of reference dependency on health state valuations using an efficient discrete choice experiment administered to a Dutch nationally representative sample of 788 respondents. A Bayesian discrete choice experiment design consisting of eight sets of 24 (matched pairwise) choice tasks was developed, with each set providing full identification of the included parameters. Mixed logit models were used to estimate health state preferences with respondents' own health included as an additional predictor. Our results indicate that respondents with impaired health worse than or equal to the health state levels under evaluation have approximately 30% smaller health state decrements. This confirms that reference dependency can be observed in general population samples and affirms the relevance of prospect theory in health state valuations. At the same time, the limited number of respondents with severe health impairments does not appear to bias social tariffs as obtained from general population samples.

An important example for which these conditions are verified is the popular test of common conditionally heteroskedastic features proposed by Engle and Kozicki (1993). As Dovonon and Renault (2013b) show, the Jacobian matrix for this model is identically zero at the true parameter value, resulting in a highly nonstandard limiting distribution that complicates the computation of critical values. We first show that the standard GMM bootstrap fails to consistently estimate the distribution of the overidentification restrictions test under lack of first-order identification. We then propose a new bootstrap method that is asymptotically valid in this context. The modification consists of adding an additional term that recenters the bootstrap moment conditions in a way as to ensure that the bootstrap Jacobian matrix is zero when evaluated at the GMM estimate.

HIV/AIDS education significantly increases HIV/AIDS knowledge but has a limited effect on testing take-up. However, when HIV/AIDS education is combined with either home-based VCT or CCT for facility-based VCT, take-up increases substantially by about 63 and 57 percentage points, respectively. We also demonstrate evidence of persistence in test-taking behavior, where past HIV testing does not dampen demand for testing. Lastly, we find suggestive evidence that home-based VCT could be more effective at detecting HIV-positive cases relative to CCT for facility-based VCT. Our findings highlight the importance of geographic accessibility in the testing decision and persistence in demand for HIV testing.

This paper investigates how the importance of genetic health transmission mechanisms varies by environmental conditions in the case of pediatric asthma, the single most common chronic health condition among American children. Using a sample that includes approximately 2000 adoptees and a large number of similar biological families, I find that the relative importance of genetic transmission differs strongly by socioeconomic status (SES). In high SES families, parent-child asthma associations are approximately 75% weaker among adoptees than biological children, suggesting a dominant role for genetic transmission. In lower SES families, parent-child asthma associations are virtually identical across biological and adoptive children, suggesting a negligible role for genetic transmission. A potential interpretation of this difference is that as environmental conditions affecting asthma improve among higher SES children, an increasingly large share of asthma variation is due to genetics.

Existing economic evaluations of interventions to manage frailty have limited time horizons, but even in older populations there may be important longer-term differences in costs and outcomes. This paper reports on the development of a cost-effectiveness model to predict publicly funded health and aged care costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over the remaining lifetime of frail Australians and a model-based cost-utility analysis of a physiotherapy-based intervention for frail individuals. Methods A cohort-based state transition (Markov) model was developed to predict costs and QALYs over the remaining lifetime of a frail population. Frailty is defined using the phenotypic definition of frailty, and the model comprises health states that describe frailty status, residential status, the experience of bone fractures and depression, and death. Model input parameters were estimated and calibrated using the Dynamic Analyses to Optimise Ageing dataset, supplemented with data from the published literature. Results The cost-effectiveness model was subject to a range of validation approaches, which did not negate the validity of the model. The evaluated physiotherapy-based frailty intervention has an expected incremental cost per QALY gained of Australian $8129 compared to usual care, but there is a probability of 0.3 that usual care is more effective and less costly than the intervention. Discussion Frailty reduces quality of life, is costly to manage and it's prevalence is increasing, but new approaches to managing frailty need to demonstrate value for money. The value of the reported cost-effectiveness model is illustrated through the estimation of all important costs and effects of a physiotherapy-based frailty intervention, which facilitates comparisons with funding decisions for other new technologies in Australia.","[Karnon, Jonathan; Afzali, Hossein Haji Ali; Putro, Gregorius Virgianto Arpuji Anggoro; Thant, Phyu Win; Dompok, Ameline; Cox, Ingrid; Chikhwaza, Owen Henry; Wang, Xian; Mwangangi, Mercy Mukui; Farransahat, Matahari] Univ Adelaide, Sch Publ Hlth, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Karnon, Jonathan; Afzali, Hossein Haji Ali; Cameron, Ian] Univ Adelaide, Ctr Res Excellence Frailty & Hlth Ageing, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Cameron, Ian] Univ Sydney, Sydney Med Sch, Edward Ford Bldg A27,Fisher Rd, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Adelaide; University of Adelaide; University of Sydney,"Karnon, J (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Sch Publ Hlth, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.;Karnon, J (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Ctr Res Excellence Frailty & Hlth Ageing, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",jonathan.karnon@adelaide.edu.au,,"Farransahat, Matahari/0000-0001-9069-9043; Karnon, Jonathan/0000-0003-3220-2099; Thant, Phyu Win/0000-0003-0713-8291; Hajiali Afzali, Hossein/0000-0002-0198-8394; Cox, Dr. Ingrid/0000-0001-5130-4088",NHMRC Centre for Research Excellence in Frailty and Healthy Ageing [ID 1102208],NHMRC Centre for Research Excellence in Frailty and Healthy Ageing,Hossein Haji Ali Afzali is part-funded by the NHMRC Centre for Research Excellence in Frailty and Healthy Ageing (ID 1102208).

J,"Kauer, L",,,,"Kauer, Lukas",,,Long-term Effects of Managed Care,HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,managed care; cost savings; sustainability; visit to a provider,CHOICE HEALTH PLAN; SUPPLY-SIDE; MEDICAID; PERFORMANCE; COMPETITION; EFFICIENCY; INSURANCE,"Managed care (MC) plans have been introduced to curb the ever increasing health care costs. Many previous studies on effectiveness lacked a long-term perspective; hence, the sustainability of (possible) savings remains unclear. Moreover, because of their incentives, MC plans are susceptible to under-provision of care. Most of these possibly negative effects can only be observed in the long-term. This paper analyzes the long-term effects of MC plans on cost savings, mortality, and the use of service, using administrative data from a large Swiss health insurer. The identification is based on a propensity-score matching approach, where individuals who enter an MC plan are compared over 10years to individuals who remain in a standard fee-for-service plan. Cost savings are substantial and sustainable, and the mortality rate is lower in MC plans. Cost savings are driven by fewer consultations and fewer days in hospital care, although the probability of visiting a provider at least once per year is similar or even higher for persons in MC plans.

Objective This study uses a stated-preference survey to better understand who participates in rewards-based physical activity programmes, and to quantify stated uptake by active and insufficiently active employees. Methods The survey was fielded to a national sample of 950 full-time employees in Singapore between 2012 and 2013. Participants were asked to choose between hypothetical rewards programmes that varied along key dimensions and whether or not they would join their preferred programme if given the opportunity. A mixed logit model was used to analyse the data and estimate predicted uptake for specific programmes. We then simulated employer payments based on predictions for the percentage of each type of employee likely to meet the activity goal. Results Stated uptake ranged from 31 to 67% of employees, depending on programme features. For each programme, approximately two-thirds of those likely to enrol were insufficiently active. Conclusion Results showed that insufficiently active employees, who represent the majority, are attracted to rewards-based physical activity programmes, and at approximately the same rate as active employees, even when enrolment fees are required. This suggests that a programme with generous rewards and a modest enrolment fee may have strong employee support and be within the range of what employers may be willing to spend.","[Ozdemir, Semra; Bilger, Marcel; Finkelstein, Eric A.] Duke NUS Med Sch, Programme Hlth Serv & Syst Res, 8 Coll Rd,Level 4, Singapore 169857, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Finkelstein, EA (通讯作者)，Duke NUS Med Sch, Programme Hlth Serv & Syst Res, 8 Coll Rd,Level 4, Singapore 169857, Singapore.",semra.ozdemir@duke-nus.edu.sg; marcel.bilger@duke-nus.edu.sg; eric.finkelstein@duke-nus.edu.sg,"Ozdemir, Semra/HLQ-7417-2023; Ozdemir, Semra/GXW-0913-2022","Ozdemir, Semra/0000-0001-7556-1601; Finkelstein, Eric/0000-0001-6443-9686; Bilger, Marcel/0000-0002-2872-6597",Singapore Ministry of Health's Health Services Research Competitive Research Grant [HSRG/022/2012],Singapore Ministry of Health's Health Services Research Competitive Research Grant,This study was supported by the Singapore Ministry of Health's Health Services Research Competitive Research Grant (HSRG/022/2012).,,26,3,3,1,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

In a controlled study of 160 ICDS centers serving over 4000 children, we randomly assign workers to either fixed bonuses or payments based on the nutritional status of children in their care, and also collect data from a control group receiving only standard salaries. In all three study arms mothers receive nutrition information. We find that performance pay reduces underweight prevalence by about 5 percentage points over 3 months, and height improves by about one centimeter. Impacts on weight continue when incentives are renewed and return to parallel trends thereafter. Fixed bonuses are less expensive but lead to smaller and less precisely estimated effects than performance pay, especially for children near malnutrition thresholds. Both treatments improve worker effort and communication with mothers, who in turn feed a more calorific diet to children at home. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

We show a preliminary fixpoint uniqueness argument which provides sufficient assumptions on the best replies of a nice game for the existence of exactly one Nash equilibrium. Then we examine the necessity and sufficiency of the conditions on the utility functions for such assumptions to be satisfied; in particular, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for the isotonicity and concavity\chain-concavity of best reply functions. We extend the results on Nash equilibrium uniqueness to nice games with upper unbounded strategy sets and we present dual results for games with isotone convex\chain-convex best reply functions. A final extension to Bayesian games is exhibited. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Decision analytic model synthesising data from a multicentre, prospective cohort study (DUTY) and the wider literature to estimate the short-term and lifetime costs and healthcare outcomes (symptomatic days, recurrent UTI, quality adjusted life years) of eight diagnostic strategies. We compared GP clinical judgement with three strategies based on a 'coefficient score' combining seven symptoms and signs independently associated with UTI and four strategies based on weighted scores according to the presence/absence of five symptoms and signs. We compared dipstick testing versus laboratory culture in children at intermediate risk of UTI. Results: Sampling, culture and antibiotic costs were lowest in high specificity DUTY strategies (1.22 and 1.08) compared to clinical judgement (1.99). These strategies also approximately halved urine sampling (4.8% versus 9.1% in clinical judgement) without reducing sensitivity (58.2% versus 56.4%). Outcomes were very similar across all diagnostic strategies. High-specificity DUTY strategies were more costeffective than clinical judgement in the short- (iNMB = 0.78 and 0.84) and long-term (iNMB = 2.31 and 2.50). Dipstick tests had poorer costeffectiveness than laboratory culture in children at intermediate risk of UTI (iNMB =-1.41). Conclusions: Compared to GPs' clinical judgement, high specificity clinical rules from the DUTY study could substantially reduce urine sampling, achieving lower costs and equivalent patient outcomes. Dipstick testing children for UTI is not costeffective. Copyright (C) 2017, International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).

We report on a methodology for determining criteria and weights that was developed and piloted in New Zealand and enables extensive participation by members of the general population. Methods: Stimulated by a preliminary ranking exercise that involved prioritizing 14 diverse technologies, six focus groups discussed what matters to people when thinking about technologies that should be funded. These discussions informed the specification of criteria related to technologies' benefits for use in a discrete choice survey designed to generate weights for each individual participant as well as mean weights. A random sample of 3218 adults was invited to participate. To check test retest reliability, a subsample completed the survey twice. Cluster analysis was performed to identify participants with similar patterns of weights. Results: Six benefits-related criteria were distilled from the focus group discussions and included in the discrete choice survey, which was completed by 322 adults (10% response rate). Most participants (85%) found the survey easy to understand, and the survey exhibited test-retest reliability. The cluster analysis revealed that participant weights are related more to idiosyncratic personal preferences than to demographic and background characteristics. Conclusions: The methodology enables extensive participation by members of the general population, for whom it is both acceptable and reliable. Generating weights for each participant allows the heterogeneity of individual preferences, and the extent to which they are related to demographic and background characteristics, to be tested.

We use twin data for Finnish men and women matched to register-based individual information on employment and earnings. The twin data allow us to account for the shared environmental and genetic factors. The quantity of alcohol consumption was measured by weekly average consumption using self-reported data from three surveys (1975, 1981 and 1990). The average of an individual's employment months and earnings were measured in adulthood over the period 1990-2009. The models that account for the shared environmental and genetic factors reveal that former drinkers and heavy drinkers both have almost 20% lower earnings compared with moderate drinkers. On average, former drinkers work annually approx.1 month less over the 20-year observation period. These associations are robust to the use of covariates, such as education, pre-existing health endowment and smoking.

Market access and coverage decisions are, however, often based on surrogate end points, biomarkers, or intermediate end points, which aim to substitute and predict patient-relevant outcomes that are unavailable because of methodological, financial, or practical constraints. We provide a summary of the present use of surrogate end points in health care policy, discussing the case for and against their adoption and reviewing validation methods. We introduce a three-step framework for policymakers to handle surrogates, which involves establishing the level of evidence, assessing the strength of the association, and quantifying relations between surrogates and final outcomes. Although the use of surrogates can be problematic, they can, when selected and validated appropriately, offer important opportunities for more efficient clinical trials and faster access to new health technologies that benefit patients and health care systems.","[Ciani, Oriana; Taylor, Rod S.] Univ Exeter, Sch Med, Inst Hlth Res, Evidence Synth & Modelling Hlth Improvement, St Lukes Campus, Exeter EX1 2LU, Devon, England; [Ciani, Oriana] Bocconi Univ, Ctr Res Hlth & Social Care Management, Milan, Italy; [Buyse, Marc] Int Drug Dev Inst, Louuain La Neuue, Belgium; [Buyse, Marc] CluePoints Inc, Cambridge, MA USA; [Drummond, Michael] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Rasi, Guido] European Med Agcy, London, England; [Rasi, Guido] Univ Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy; [Saad, Everardo D.] Dendrix Res, Sao Paulo, Brazil",University of Exeter; Bocconi University; International Drug Development Institute; University of York - UK; University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Ciani, O (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Sch Med, Inst Hlth Res, Evidence Synth & Modelling Hlth Improvement, St Lukes Campus, Exeter EX1 2LU, Devon, England.",o.ciani@exeter.ac.uk,"Buyse, Marc/J-4658-2013; Rasi, Guido/AAC-8172-2021; Taylor, Rod/R-9581-2019; Ciani, Oriana/D-1455-2015","Rasi, Guido/0000-0002-2191-1386; Taylor, Rod/0000-0002-3043-6011; Ciani, Oriana/0000-0002-3607-0508",University of Exeter Medical School,University of Exeter Medical School,"O.

In this study, we estimate the effect of learning using the example of two minimally invasive treatments of abdominal aortic aneurysms: endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and fenestrated EVAR (fEVAR). The analysis is based on the administrative data of over 40,000 patients admitted with unruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm to more than 500 different hospitals over the years 2006 to 2013. We examine two patient outcomes, namely, in-hospital mortality and length of stay using hierarchical regression models with random effects at the hospital level. The estimated models control for patient and hospital characteristics and take learning interdependency between EVAR and fEVAR into account. In case of EVAR, we observe a significant decrease both in the in-hospital mortality and length of stay with experience accumulated at the hospital level; however, the learning curve for fEVAR in both outcomes is effectively flat. To foster the consideration of learning in health technology assessments of medical devices, a general framework for estimating learning effects is derived from the analysis. (c) 2017 The Authors.

Our first result is to obtain a generalized characterization of the Euler condition for this broader class of utility functions: in our model, the Euler rule features a supplementary term aiming at compensating the consumer for variations in the preference for variety along the consumption level. We are then also able to demonstrate that in our generalized framework, the economy's balanced growth path displays both endogenous markups and a strictly positive growth rate of the number of available varieties (being the engine of growth). Finally, we show that under endogenous markups, the economy's growth rate and firms' market power can display a negative correlation, as opposed to the standard result obtained in the CES framework.

We offer specific results for two rules used for parliamentary elections at the national level: Borda (Black, 1958), used for national elections to special reserved seats for Hungarian and Italian ethnic minorities in Slovenia, and the unique and little known electoral system used for legislative elections on the Pacific Island state of Nauru, the Dowdall rule. When voters are required to provide a complete ranking of all candidates, we find that Borda does not, in general, operate as a majoritarian system in that a supermajority of roughly 2/3rd is required to guarantee electing a candidate of choice. In contrast, we find that, as district magnitude increases, the Threshold of Exclusion for the Dowdall rule tends to zero, in the same way as do list systems of proportional representation (PR). However, in contrast to the case for list PR rules, TE for Dowdall can still be relatively close to 1/2 for small district magnitudes.

It allows gathering more robust evidence regarding effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of new technologies without delaying market access. Nevertheless, the literature suggests that ending reimbursement and provision of a technology when it proves not to be effective or cost-effective in practice may be difficult. Objectives: To investigate how policymakers and the general public in the Netherlands value removing a previously reimbursed treatment from the basic benefits package relative to not including a new treatment. Methods: To investigate this issue, we used discrete-choice experiments. Mixed multinomial logit models were used to analyze the data. Compensating variation values and changes in probability of acceptance were calculated for withdrawal of reimbursement. Results: The results show that, ceteris paribus, both the general public (n = 1169) and policymakers (n = 90) prefer a treatment that is presently reimbursed over one that is presently not yet reimbursed. Conclusions: Apparently, ending reimbursement is more difficult than not starting reimbursement in the first place, both for policymakers and for the public. Loss aversion is one of the possible explanations for this result. Policymakers in health care need to be aware of this effect before engaging in conditional reimbursement schemes.","[van de Wetering, E. J.; Brouwer, Werner B.

Empirical evidence suggests that people's preferences are affected by ambiguity. Health economic analyses generally ignore ambiguity preferences and assume that they are the same as preferences under risk. We show how health preferences can be measured under ambiguity, and we compare them with health preferences under risk. We assume a general ambiguity model that includes many of the ambiguity models that have been proposed in the literature. For health gains, ambiguity preferences and risk preferences were indeed the same. For health losses, they differed with subjects being more pessimistic in decision under ambiguity. Utility and loss aversion were the same for risk and ambiguity. Our results imply that reducing the clinical ambiguity of health losses has more impact than reducing the ambiguity of health gains, that utilities elicited with known probabilities may not carry over to an ambiguous setting, and that ambiguity aversion may impact value of information analyses if losses are involved. These findings are highly relevant for medical decision making, because most medical interventions involve losses.","[Attema, Arthur E.] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Hlth Policy & Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Bleichrodt, Han] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Bleichrodt, Han] Erasmus Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Bleichrodt, Han] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [L'Haridon, Olivier] Univ Rennes 1, Rennes, France",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Australian National University; Universite de Rennes,"Attema, AE (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Hlth Policy & Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",attema@eshpm.eur.nl,"Attema, Arthur E./D-9723-2013; L'Haridon, Olivier/GYU-3062-2022","Attema, Arthur E./0000-0003-3607-6579; L'Haridon, Olivier/0000-0001-8786-4765",,,,,68,14,15,3,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,NOV,2018,27.0,11,,,,,1699,1716,,10.1002/hec.3795,0.0,,,18,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GV7QD,29971896.0,"Green Submitted, Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000446323300005,0

In most contexts, private supply chains will be key to effective and efficient preventative supplementation. With established vendors, we conducted a 60-week market trial for a food-based micronutrient supplement in rural Burkina Faso with randomized price and non-price treatments. Repeat purchases - critical for effective supplementation - are extremely price sensitive. Loyalty cards boost demand more than price discounts, particularly in non-poor households where the father is the cardholder. A small minority of households achieved sufficient supplementation for their children through purely retail distribution, suggesting the need for more creative public-private delivery platforms informed by insights into household demand persistence and heterogeneity.

Activating mutations can be identified via single-gene testing or next-generation sequencing (NGS). Objectives: To evaluate the budget impact of NGS instead of single-gene testing for tissue-based molecular assessment of aNSCLC from the US health care payer perspective. Methods: An annual cohort of newly diagnosed patients with nonsquamous aNSCLC in a hypothetical 1-million-member health care plan was evaluated using a Markov model over 5 years. Epidemiology and testing rates (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, MET, HER2, and RET) were from the literature. Treatments were determined by available genetic information. Safety, progression, and survival with targeted therapy or chemotherapy were from randomized clinical trials. Single-gene testing and first-line and maintenance treatment costs were from RED BOOK and Medicare fee schedules; NGS testing, adverse event, and progression costs to payers were from the literature. Results: Three hundred sixteen testing-eligible patients with aNSCLC were expected annually, of whom 179 undergo genetic testing. Of 57 patients expected to have activating mutations, single-gene testing identified 35, whereas NGS identified 54. NGS, instead of single-gene testing, decreased expected testing procedure-related costs to the health plan payer by $24,651. First-line and maintenance treatment costs increased by $842,205, offset by a $385,000 decrease in second-line treatment and palliative care costs. Over 5 years, total budget impact was $432,554 ($0.0072 per member per month). Conclusions: NGS is expected to identify more patients with activating mutations, thereby better enabling selection for targeted therapy and clinical trial enrollment. The budget impact to US payers is expected to be minimally cost-additive.","[Yu, Tiffany M.; Tradonsky, Alison; Arnold, Renee J.

We use a nonparametric fuzzy regression discontinuity design, exploiting the statutory retirement age in urban China as a source of exogenous variation in retirement. In contrast to previous results for developed countries, we find that in China retirement increases healthcare utilization. This increase can be attributed to deteriorating health and in particular to the reduced opportunity cost of time after retirement. For the sample as a whole, income is not a dominating mechanism. People with low education, however, are more likely to forego recommended inpatient care after retirement. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

ISPOR's Economic Evaluation of Vaccines Designed to Prevent Infectious Disease: Good Practices Task Force wrote guidelines for three analytic methods and solicited comments on them from external reviewers. Cost-effectiveness analyses use decision-analytic models to estimate cumulative changes in resource use, costs, and changes in quality- or disability-adjusted life-years attributable to changes in disease outcomes. Constrained optimization modeling uses a mathematical objective function to be optimized (e.g. disease cases avoided) for a target population for a set of interventions including vaccination programs within established constraints. Fiscal health modeling estimates changes in net present value of government revenues and expenditures attributable to changes in disease outcomes. The task force recommends that those designing economic analyses for new vaccination programs take into account the decision maker's policy objectives and country-specific decision context when estimating: uptake rate in the target population; vaccination program's impact on disease cases in the population over time using a dynamic transmission epidemiologic model; vaccination program implementation and operating costs; and the changes in costs and health outcomes of the target disease(s). The three approaches to economic analysis are complementary and can be used alone or together to estimate a vaccination program's economic value for national, regional, or subregional decision makers in high-, middle-, and low-income countries.","[Mauskopf, Josephine] RTI Hlth Solut, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Standaert, Baudouin] GSK Vaccines, Wavre, Belgium; [Connolly, Mark P.] Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; [Connolly, Mark P.] Global Market Access Solut LLC, Geneva, Switzerland; [Culyer, Anthony J.] Univ York, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Garrison, Louis P.] Univ Washington, Comparat Hlth Outcomes Policy & Econ CHOICE Inst, Dept Pharm, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Hutubessy, Raymond] World Hlth Org, Geneva, Switzerland; [Jit, Mark] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med & Publ Hlth, Fac Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, London, England; [Pitman, Richard] ICON, Abingdon, Oxon, England; [Revill, Paul] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Severens, Johan L.] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Hlth Policy & Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Severens, Johan L.] Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Research Triangle Institute; GlaxoSmithKline; University of Groningen; University of York - UK; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; World Health Organization; ICON plc; University of York - UK; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Mauskopf, J (通讯作者)，RTI Int, RTI Hlth Solut, 3040 Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",jmauskopf@rti.org,"Jit, Mark/HDM-7797-2022","Jit, Mark/0000-0001-6658-8255; Revill, Paul/0000-0001-8632-0600; Mauskopf, Josephine/0000-0002-6098-5548",World Health Organization [001] Funding Source: Medline,World Health Organization(World Health Organization),,,81,78,80,2,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,OCT,2018,21.0,10,,,,,1133,1149,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.08.005,0.0,,,17,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GW4GZ,30314613.0,"Green Accepted, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000446871600001,0

It is demonstrated via three robust counterexamples, that in this setting the law of one price fails, thus showing, contrary to longstanding belief in the literature, that price dispersion in large market games is extremely robust. Most importantly, it is established that even in economies with a continuum of small agents and infinitely many atoms (all of whom can arbitrage prices if they so wish), and an infinite number of markets per commodity, the set of equilibria and the resulting market structure is influenced, both by strategic behaviour, and private ownership of posts.

Methods: Case study that describes key methodological and data challenges that were encountered or are likely to emerge in future work, describes the pros and cons of approaches considered by the study team, and summarizes the solutions that were implemented. Results: Major methodological challenges included defining whole genome sequencing, structuring an appropriate comparator, measuring downstream costs, and examining clinical outcomes. Discussions about solutions addressed conceptual and practical issues that arose because of definitions and analyses around the cost of genomic sequencing in trial-based studies. Conclusions: The MedSeq Project provides an instructive example of how to conduct a cost analysis of whole genome sequencing that feasibly incorporates best practices while being sensitive to the varied applications and diversity of results it may produce. Findings provide guidance for researchers to consider when conducting or analyzing economic analyses of whole genome sequencing and other next-generation sequencing tests, particularly regarding costs.","[Christensen, Kurt D.; Green, Robert C.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, EC Alumnae Bldg,Suite 301,41 Ave Louis Pasteur, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Christensen, Kurt D.; Green, Robert C.] Harvard Med Sch, EC Alumnae Bldg,Suite 301,41 Ave Louis Pasteur, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Phillips, Kathryn A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Clin Pharm, Ctr Translat & Policy Res Personalized Med TRANSP, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Phillips, Kathryn A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Philip R Lee Inst Hlth Policy, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Phillips, Kathryn A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Helen Diller Family Comprehens Canc Ctr, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Green, Robert C.] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Green, Robert C.] Partners HealthCare Personalized Med, Boston, MA USA; [Dukhovny, Dmitry] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Pediat, 3181 Sw Sam Jackson Pk Rd, Portland, OR 97201 USA",Harvard University; Brigham & Women's Hospital; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; UCSF Medical Center; UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center; Harvard University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Broad Institute; Partners Healthcare System; Oregon Health & Science University,"Christensen, KD (通讯作者)，Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, EC Alumnae Bldg,Suite 301,41 Ave Louis Pasteur, Boston, MA 02115 USA.;Christensen, KD (通讯作者)，Harvard Med Sch, EC Alumnae Bldg,Suite 301,41 Ave Louis Pasteur, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",kchristensen@bwh.harvard.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health [U01-HG006500, K01-HG009173, R01-HG007063]",National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),"This study was supported by National Institutes of Health grants U01-HG006500, K01-HG009173, and R01-HG007063",,68,11,11,0,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP,2018,21.0,9,,,,,1054,1061,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.06.013,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GT9BF,30224109.0,"Green Published, Green Accepted, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000444833500007,0

Although this is a paradigm shift, the German approach is limited to some few specific technologies for which reimbursement is requested. As physicians encounter this regulatory instrument, the aim of the study was to understand physicians' decision making regarding the adoption of new medical technologies and to identify their perspectives on the evidence base and financing with additional reimbursement systems. Methods: From April to August 2017, semistructured interviews with chief and senior physicians of vascular surgery and cardiology in inpatient care in Germany were conducted (N = 23). The interviews were carried out by one researcher in one-to-one appointments or via telephone. Data were analyzed inductively to identify factors and generate thematic categories using qualitative content analysis. Results: We identified 52 factors in eight categories influencing physicians' adoption of new technologies. The evidence base for new technologies was criticized (e.g., lack of available studies). Physicians' knowledge of the regulation of market approval and innovation payments varied. They recommended the utilization of new technologies in certain specialist centers and the facilitation of observational studies. Conclusions: Physicians saw the need for the new approach and supported its aim. However, its design and implementation appeared to be questionable from their medical perspective. The provision of summarized information on the benefit of technologies might be a possibility to assist physicians' decision making.","[Felgner, Susanne; Ex, Patricia; Henschke, Cornelia] Tech Univ Berlin, Dept Hlth Care Management, Str 17,Juni 135,H80, D-10623 Berlin, Germany",Technical University of Berlin,"Felgner, S (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Berlin, Dept Hlth Care Management, Str 17,Juni 135,H80, D-10623 Berlin, Germany.",susanne.felgner@tu-berlin.de,"Henschke, Cornelia/ABD-2513-2020","Henschke, Cornelia/0000-0001-5261-2330",Berlin Centre for Health Economics Research by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [01EH1604A]; Cusanuswerk scholarship,Berlin Centre for Health Economics Research by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; Cusanuswerk scholarship,We are grateful to the clinicians who took part in the interviews free at charge.

We specify a Markov queuing model and use data collected from administrative records to estimate the link between two proxy indicators of across-sector complexity of discharge arrangements and post-operative length of stay in hospital for older people undergoing hip replacements. The results suggest that the number of local authorities involved in care planning and commissioning of social care services for discharges from a given hospital is significantly positively correlated with longer post-operative lengths of stay. A particularly strong effect is found between variability through time in the number of authorities involved in discharges from a given hospital and lengths of stay. The results suggest that improving information systems and joint assessment processes used during the discharge of patients with social care needs is likely to achieve significant efficiency gains in the health care system as a whole.

For this model we introduce a sequential majority procedure (SMP) which uses the majority rule as much as possible. The ordering of the issues is assumed to be exogenous. The definition of SMP is given in Section 2. In Section 4 we construct an intuitive relevance relation for our model, closely related to conditional entailment, for our model. While in Dietrich (2015), the relevance relation is given exogenously as part of the model, we insist that the relevance relation be derived from the agenda. We prove that SMP has the property of independence of irrelevant issues (III) with respect to (the transitive closure of) our relevance relation. As III is weaker than the property of proposition-wise independence (PI) we do not run into impossibility results as does List (2004) who incorporates PI in some parts of his analysis. We proceed to characterize SMP by anonymity, restricted monotonicity, limited neutrality, restricted agenda property, and independence of past deliberations (see Section 3 for the precise details). SMP inherits the first three axioms from the Majority Rule. The axiom of restricted agenda property guarantees sequentiality. The most important axiom, independence of past deliberations (IPD), says that the choice at time (t + 1) depends only on the choices in dates 1,...,t and the judgments at (t + 1) (and not on the individual judgments in dates 1,..., t). Also, we use this occasion to point out that Roberts (1991) characterization of choice by plurality voting may be adapted to our model. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

A rigorous analysis of the first-order asymptotic properties of the estimator, under some assumptions on the evolution of the spatial design matrix, is available in Lee (2004), but very little is known about its exact or higher-order properties. in this paper we first show that the exact cumulative distribution function of the estimator can, under mild assumptions, be written in terms of that of a particular quadratic form. Simple examples are used to illustrate important exact properties of the estimator that follow from this representation. In general models a complete exact analysis is not possible, but a higher-order (saddlepoint) approximation is made available by the main result. We use this approximation to construct confidence intervals for the autoregressive parameter. Coverage properties of the proposed confidence intervals are studied by Monte Carlo simulation, and are found to be excellent in a variety of circumstances. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

First, semi-Fishburn relations are defined by assuming convexity and coherence, a newly considered topological property. We show that lower and upper semi-Fishburn relations admit the existence of a minimal element and a maximal element, respectively. Then axiom of balance is stated and we prove that a binary relation has a continuous SSB representation if and only if it is a balanced (lower and upper semi-)Fishburn relation. The relationship between the above definitions and the original axioms of (algebraic) SSB representation is fully discussed. Finally, by applying this theory to probability measures, we show the existence of a maximal preferred measure for an infinite set of pure outcomes, thus generalizing all available existence theorems of (algebraic) SSB representation. Note that by using this framework to, e.g., finitely additive measures, one may develop a non-probabilistic variant of SSB representation as well. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The same issues apply to spatial DPD (SDPD) models with short panels. In this paper, a unified M-estimation method is proposed for estimating the fixed-effects SDPD models containing three major types of spatial effects, namely spatial lag, spatial error and space-time lag. The method is free from the specification of the distribution of the initial observations and robust against nonnormality of the errors. Consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed M-estimator are established. A martingale difference representation of the underlying estimating functions is developed, which leads to an initial-condition free estimate of the variance of the M-estimators. Monte Carlo results show that the proposed methods have excellent finite sample performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Asymptotic properties of the new estimator are discussed. We consider a multinomial probit model to illustrate this approach and subsequently consider simulation studies in a variety of discrete choice models with and without dynamics in terms of lagged dependent variables and serially correlated errors.

Because of the low incidence rates of this disease worldwide, few clinical trials evaluating drug treatments have been conducted. Objectives: To conduct the first network meta-analysis simultaneously comparing all available drugs used in acromegaly treatment so as to provide more robust evidence in this field. Methods: A systematic review was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and Cochrane Collaboration recommendations (PROSPERO database under the registration number CRD42017059880). The electronic searches were conducted in PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Randomized controlled trials comparing any drug for the treatment of acromegaly head-to-head or versus placebo were included. Outcomes concerning the efficacy and safety of treatments were evaluated. The statistical analyses were performed using Aggregate Data Drug Information System version 1.16.8 (drugis.org, Groningen, The Netherlands). Results: The initial search retrieved 2059 articles. Of these, 10 randomized controlled trials were included in a qualitative analysis and 7 in a quantitative analysis. The network meta-analysis for the efficacy outcome (number of patients achieving insulinlike growth factor 1 control) showed that pegvisomant and lanreotide autogel were statistically superior to placebo (odds ratio [95% credible interval] 0.06 [0.00-0.55] and 0.09 [0.01-0.88]). No further differences were found. The probability rank indicated that pegvisomant and pasireotide have the highest probabilities (33% and 34%, respectively) of being the best therapeutic options. No major side effects were noted. Conclusions: Pegvisomant is still a good option for acromegaly treatment, but pasireotide seems to be a promising alternative. Nevertheless, other important key factors such as drug costs and effectiveness (real-world results) should be taken into account when selecting acromegaly treatment.","[Leonart, Leticia P.; Ferreira, Vinicius L.; Tonin, Fernanda S.; Pontarolo, Roberto] Univ Fed Parana, Grad Program Pharmaceut Sci, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; [Fernandez-Llimos, Fernando] Univ Lisbon, Res Inst Med iMed ULisboa, Fac Pharm, Dept Social Pharm, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade Federal do Parana; Universidade de Lisboa,"Pontarolo, R (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Parana, Dept Pharm, St Pref Lothario Meissner 632, BR-80210170 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.",pontarolo@ufpr.br,"Pontarolo, Roberto/G-6948-2014; iMed.ULisboa, PEPSocPh/B-4101-2014; Tonin, Fernanda S./AAE-3435-2022; Tonin, Fernanda S/O-2050-2017; Fernandez-Llimos, Fernando/B-8931-2008","Tonin, Fernanda S./0000-0003-4262-8608; Tonin, Fernanda S/0000-0003-4262-8608; Fernandez-Llimos, Fernando/0000-0002-8529-9595",Brazilian Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES),Brazilian Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),We thank the Brazilian Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) and Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) for providing scholarships.,,57,10,11,1,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL,2018,21.0,7,,,,,874,880,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.12.014,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GM6VJ,30005760.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000438314900015,0

The Case of an Upper Middle-Income Country in Asia,APPLIED HEALTH ECONOMICS AND HEALTH POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,OVARIAN-CANCER; SCORING SYSTEM; QUALITY; WOMEN; RISK; SUSCEPTIBILITY; SERVICES; CARRIERS; STATE; CARE,"Objective Previous studies showed that offering BRCA mutation testing to population subgroups at high risk of harbouring the mutation may be cost effective, yet no evidence is available for low- or middle-income countries (LMIC) and in Asia. We estimated the cost effectiveness of BRCA mutation testing in early-stage breast cancer patients with high pre-test probability of harbouring the mutation in Malaysia, an LMIC in Asia. Methods We developed a decision analytic model to estimate the lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) accrued through BRCA mutation testing or routine clinical surveillance (RCS) for a hypothetical cohort of 1000 early-stage breast cancer patients aged 40 years. In the model, patients would decide whether to accept testing and to undertake risk-reducing mastectomy, oophorectomy, tamoxifen, combinations or neither. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) from the health system perspective. A series of sensitivity analyses were performed. Results In the base case, testing generated 11.2 QALYs over the lifetime and cost US$4815 per patient whereas RCS generated 11.1 QALYs and cost US$4574 per patient. The ICER of US$2725/QALY was below the cost-effective thresholds. The ICER was sensitive to the discounting of cost, cost of BRCA mutation testing and utility of being risk-free, but the ICERs remained below the thresholds. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that at a threshold of US$9500/QALY, 99.9% of simulations favoured BRCA mutation testing over RCS. Conclusions Offering BRCA mutation testing to early-stage breast cancer patients identified using a locally-validated risk-assessment tool may be cost effective compared to RCS in Malaysia.","[Lim, Ka Keat] Duke NUS Med Sch, Hlth Syst & Serv Res, 8 Coll Rd, Singapore 169857, Singapore; [Lim, Ka Keat] Natl Clin Res Ctr, Healthcare Stat Unit, 3rd Floor,MMA House,124 Jalan Pahang, Kuala Lumpur 53000, Malaysia; [Yoon, Sook Yee; Teo, Soo Hwang] Subang Jaya Med Ctr, Canc Res Malaysia, Outpatient Ctr, 2nd Floor, Subang Jaya 47500, Selangor, Malaysia; [Taib, Nur Aishah Mohd; Teo, Soo Hwang] Univ Malaya, Dept Surg, Fac Med, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Shabaruddin, Fatiha Hana] Univ Malaya, Dept Pharm, Fac Med, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Dahlui, Maznah] Univ Malaya, Julius Ctr, Dept Social & Prevent Med, Fac Med, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Woo, Yin Ling] Univ Malaya, Dept Obstet & Gynaecol, Fac Med, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Thong, Meow Keong] Univ Malaya, Dept Paediat, Fac Med, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn] Naresuan Univ, CPOR, Dept Pharm Practice, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, Muang, Phitsanulok, Thailand; [Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn] Monash Univ Malaysia, Sch Pharm, Subang Jaya 47500, Selangor, Malaysia; [Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn] Monash Univ Malaysia, Asian Ctr Evidence Synth Populat Implementat & Cl, Hlth & Well Being Cluster, Global Asia 21st Century Platform GA21, Subang Jaya 47500, Selangor, Malaysia; [Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Pharm, Madison, WI 53706 USA",National University of Singapore; Universiti Malaya; Universiti Malaya; Universiti Malaya; Universiti Malaya; Universiti Malaya; Naresuan University; Monash University; Monash University Sunway; Monash University; Monash University Sunway; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Chaiyakunapruk, N (通讯作者)，Naresuan Univ, CPOR, Dept Pharm Practice, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, Muang, Phitsanulok, Thailand.;Chaiyakunapruk, N (通讯作者)，Monash Univ Malaysia, Sch Pharm, Subang Jaya 47500, Selangor, Malaysia.;Chaiyakunapruk, N (通讯作者)，Monash Univ Malaysia, Asian Ctr Evidence Synth Populat Implementat & Cl, Hlth & Well Being Cluster, Global Asia 21st Century Platform GA21, Subang Jaya 47500, Selangor, Malaysia.;Chaiyakunapruk, N (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Sch Pharm, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",limkk@u.duke.nus.edu; sookyee.yoon@cancerresearch.my; naisha@um.edu.my; fatiha.shabaruddin@um.edu.my; maznahd@ummc.edu.my; ylwoo@ummc.edu.my; thongmk@um.edu.my; soohwang.teo@cancerresearch.my; nathorn.chaiyakunapruk@monash.edu,"Taib, Nur Aishah Mohd/B-2370-2010; Lim, Ka Keat/ABG-1329-2021; Woo, Yin Ling/GPX-0086-2022; Teo, Soo-hwang/H-2353-2014; Teo, Soo Hwang/KAM-3140-2024; Dahlui, Maznah/F-9665-2010; Thong, Meow-Keong/B-9960-2010; Yoon, Sook Yee/AAH-1182-2021; Dahlui, Maznah/B-8976-2010","Taib, Nur Aishah Mohd/0000-0001-8419-0478; Lim, Ka Keat/0000-0002-2340-4097; Woo, Yin Ling/0000-0003-1742-1066; Teo, Soo Hwang/0000-0002-0444-590X; Thong, Meow-Keong/0000-0002-7288-7910; Dahlui, Maznah/0000-0003-4923-9410; Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn/0000-0003-4572-8794",,,,,43,10,11,0,12,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

Estimates from the European Healthcare Fraud and Corruption Network calculate an approximate a,notsign56 billion annual loss to Europe as a result of corruption. To promote understanding of the complexity and interconnection of corrupt activities, we aim to present healthcare-related corruption typologies of the European Union and European Healthcare Fraud and Corruption Network. We subsequently link them to the typology of individual and institutional corruption introduced by Dennis Thompson in the context of investigating misconduct of US Congressional members. According to Thompson, individual corruption is the personal gain of individuals performing duties within an institution in exchange for nurturing private interests, while institutional corruption pertains to the failure of the institution in directing the individual's behaviour towards the achievement of the institution's primary purpose because the institutional design promotes the pursuit of individual goals. Effective anti-corruption activities not only require the enactment of anti-corruption laws but also the monitoring and, where appropriate, revision of institutional frameworks to prevent the undermining of the primary purposes of health systems or institutions. To gain further understanding of the similarities and differences of the three typologies, prime examples of corrupt activities in the health sector in the European Union and USA (along with their potential remedies) are provided. Linking corruption cases to Thompson's typology revealed that many corrupt activities may show elements of both individual and institutional corruption because they are intertwined, partly overlap and may occur jointly. Hence, sanctioning individual actors only does not target the problem.","[Sommersguter-Reichmann, Margit] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Dept Finance, Graz, Austria; [Wild, Claudia] Ludwig Boltzmann Inst Hlth Technol Assessment, Vienna, Austria; [Stepan, Adolf] Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Management Sci, Vienna, Austria; [Reichmann, Gerhard] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Dept Informat Sci & Informat Syst, Graz, Austria; [Fried, Andrea] Transparency Int Austrian Chapter, Vienna, Austria",University of Graz; Ludwig Boltzmann Institute; Technische Universitat Wien; University of Graz,"Sommersguter-Reichmann, M (通讯作者)，Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Dept Finance, Graz, Austria.",margit.sommersguter@uni-graz.at,,"Sommersguter-Reichmann, Margit/0000-0002-0501-8416",Brocher Foundation,Brocher Foundation,"Adolf Stepan was partly funded by the Brocher Foundation.

This paper analytically studies how it affects welfare in general equilibrium. First, we examine the exogenous impact of a longevity increase on welfare in a canonical Diamond model. We find that a longevity increase does not necessarily increase welfare. Second, we study the impact of a longevity increase on welfare when longevity improvements are costly. We show the existence of economies in which welfare is maximized when longevity is at its minimal level. We provide numerical illustrations of our results. They highlight that the age at which longevity improves and the cost of such improvements are important to determine the welfare impact of a longevity increase. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This paper shows that testing for the absence of socioeconomic health inequality is equivalent to testing if the conditional expectation of health on income is a constant function that is equal to average health status. In consequence, any test for parametric specification of a regression function can be used to test for the absence of socioeconomic health inequality (subject to regularity conditions). Furthermore, this paper illustrates how to test for this equality using a test for parametric regression functional form and applies it to health-related behaviors from the National Health Survey 2014.","[Khaled, Mohamad A.] Univ Queensland, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Makdissi, Paul; Yazbeck, Myra] Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, 120 Univ 9008, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Tabri, Rami V.] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Yazbeck, Myra] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",University of Queensland; University of Ottawa; University of Sydney; University of Queensland,"Makdissi, P (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, 120 Univ 9008, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",paul.makdissi@uottawa.ca,"Makdissi, Paul/AAE-6032-2019; Tabri, Rami/JHT-3634-2023","Makdissi, Paul/0000-0001-6594-8706; Tabri, Rami/0000-0003-4117-0498; Khaled, Mohamad/0000-0003-3830-1768",,,,,24,5,5,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,MAY,2018,27.0,5,,,,,887,896,,10.1002/hec.3637,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GB3YG,29383773.0,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428996100008,0

There are several benefits of using this methodology. First, a dynamic lagged dependent econometric model is suitable to address persistence in per capita output. Second, the generalized method-of-moments estimator uses dynamic properties of the data to generate appropriate instrumental variables to address joint endogeneity of the explanatory variables. Third, we allow the measurement error to include unobserved country-specific effect and random noise. We include two gender-disaggregated measures of human capitaleducation and health. We find that gender gap in health plays a critical role in explaining economic growth in developing countries. Our results provide aggregate evidence that returns to investments in health systematically differ across gender and between low-income and high-income countries.","[Mandal, Bidisha; Batina, Raymond G.; Chen, Wen] Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Hulbert 103F,POB 646210, Pullman, WA 99164 USA",Washington State University,"Mandal, B (通讯作者)，Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Hulbert 103F,POB 646210, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",bmandal@wsu.edu,,,,,,,28,8,9,1,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,MAY,2018,27.0,5,,,,,877,886,,10.1002/hec.3636,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GB3YG,29315964.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428996100007,0

The agents in each group share the same set of goods even though they may have conflicting preferences. For two groups, we characterize the cardinality of the groups for which a positive approximation of the maximin share is possible regardless of the number of goods.

Although it may appear evident that occupation can affect health, there are multiple possible sources of selection that can generate a strong association, other than simply a causal effect of occupation on health. We link job characteristics to German panel data spanning 29years to characterize occupations by their physical and psychosocial burden. Employing a dynamic model to control for factors that simultaneously affect health and selection into occupation, we find that selection into occupation accounts for at least 60% of the association. The effects of occupational characteristics such as physical strain and low job control are negative and increase with age: late-career exposure to 1year of high physical strain and low job control is comparable to the average health decline from ageing 16 and 6months, respectively.","[Ravesteijn, Bastian; van Kippersluis, Hans; van Doorslaer, Eddy] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Ravesteijn, Bastian] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Hlth Care Policy, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ravesteijn, Bastian] Univ Paris 05, LIRAES EA4470, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France; [van Doorslaer, Eddy] Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [van Kippersluis, Hans; van Doorslaer, Eddy] Tinbergen Inst, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Universite Paris Cite; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Tinbergen Institute,"Ravesteijn, B (通讯作者)，Harvard Med Sch, Dept Hlth Care Policy, Boston, MA 02115 USA.;Ravesteijn, B (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 05, LIRAES EA4470, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.",ravesteijn@hcp.med.harvard.edu,"Ravesteijn, Bastian/HSH-3231-2023","van Doorslaer, Eddy/0000-0003-2692-1433",Commonwealth Fund; Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking [115621]; European Union's Seventh Framework Program [FP7/2007-2013]; National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health [R01AG037398]; NWO [016.145.082],Commonwealth Fund; Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking; European Union's Seventh Framework Program(European Union (EU)); National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); NWO(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"The Commonwealth Fund; the Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking, Grant/Award Number: 115621; European Union's Seventh Framework Program, Grant/Award Number: FP7/2007-2013; National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health, Grant/Award Number: R01AG037398; NWO, Grant/Award Number: 016.145.082",,40,33,36,1,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,FEB,2018,27.0,2,,,,,E69,E86,,10.1002/hec.3563,0.0,,,18,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA7NO,28901590.0,"Green Published, Green Submitted, hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428523400006,0

While small enterprises consider entrepreneurial activity as a key source of growth in the market, the importance of innovation in large enterprises is reflected in their contribution to long-term sustainability of business through the process of continuous adjustment to changes in the environment. One of the ways to achieve this is the consolidation of the advantages of small businesses (creativity, flexibility, innovation, market recognition) with market power and financial resources of a large enterprise. In order to describe the process of entrepreneurial activity of already existing enterprises the term corporate entrepreneurship is used in literature. As the basic dimensions, that is, manifest forms of the concept of corporate entrepreneurship we can mark oft innovations and ventures and self-renewal activities. Although the literature emphasizes the importance of entrepreneurial activity of all enterprises, regardless of their size, in Serbia, entrepreneurial orientation is still most often associated with newly established, small enterprises. According to previously mentioned, the aim of this paper is to identify, on the basis of a sample of 208 companies, the current state of entrepreneurial activity within them and to assess whether there are differences in the level of these activities between small, medium and large enterprises in Serbia. The analysis was carried out for the total level of corporate entrepreneurship, but also for its individual dimensions. In order to test the statistical significance of the differences between the three groups of companies, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used, while the Tukey post-hoc test was carried out to identify the specific groups among which differences exist. The results of the conducted testing indicate that there are statistically significant differences in the level of entrepreneurial activities between small and medium-sized enterprises, especially when it comes to innovations and ventures. The ratio of the level of innovations and ventures from one side to the size of the enterprise on the other side can be presented by U-curve, which implies that innovations and ventures are the most represented in the case of large and small enterprises, while their level is the lowest in the middle ones. On the other hand, self-renewal activities are decreasing with the growth of enterprise size. The importance of measuring the level of entrepreneurial activities is especially important for economic policy-makers. More precisely, identifying the dimensions that represent the cause of the low level of entrepreneurial activity in each of the observed groups of enterprises can be the first step in creating incentive strategies for their improvement.","[Anicic, Zorica] Univ Belgrade, Fac Econ, Kamenicka 6, Belgrade, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Anicic, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Fac Econ, Kamenicka 6, Belgrade, Serbia.",zorica@ekof.bg.ac.rs,"Economics, University of Belgrade Faculty of/AAZ-4804-2020","Economics, University of Belgrade Faculty of/0000-0003-3420-1399",,,,,24,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,843,854,,,,,,12,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BP4BP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000550734100090,0

We derive the asymptotic properties of the test statistics and show that the tests have good size and reasonable power in finite sample cases. Using our mutual excitation tests, we empirically characterize the dynamics of financial flights in forms of flight-to-safety and flight-to-quality. The results indicate that mutually exciting jumps and risk-off trades mostly occur in periods of high market stress. Flight-to safety episodes (from stocks to gold) arrive more frequently than do flight-to-quality spells (from stocks to bonds). We further find evidence that reverse cross-excitations or seeking-return-strategies exhibit significant asymmetry over the business cycle, reflecting the fact that investors appear to be selling gold rather than bonds to invest in stocks during good market conditions.

In this paper, we use agent-based modeling (ABM) in order to analyze how local defaults of supply chain participants propagate through the dynamic supply chain network and interbank networks and form avalanches of bankruptcy. We focus on the linkage dependence among agents at the micro-level and estimate the impact on the macro activities. Combining agent-based modeling with the network analysis can shed light on understanding the primary role of banks in lending to the wider real economy. Understanding the linkage dependency among firms and banks can help in the design of regulatory paradigms that rein in systemic risk while enhancing economic growth.","[Namatame, Akira] Natl Def Acad, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan",National Defence Academy - Japan,"Namatame, A (通讯作者)，Natl Def Acad, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan.",akiranamatame@gmail.com,,,,,,,20,1,1,0,12,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1860-949X,1860-9503,978-3-319-70942-0; 978-3-319-70941-3,STUD COMPUT INTELL,,,2018,753.0,,,,,,255,265,,10.1007/978-3-319-70942-0_18,0.0,,,11,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BL5QD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000452452200018,0

However, sustainability 's multiple facets and kinds of expression seem to be more visible at the lower levels of the global system, where the search for sustainability phenomenon - fuelled by the (media intermediated) positive interplays between the increased accountability of firms and the proliferation of highly informed customers - has led to the disruption of industries and ways of life. Thus, concepts and practices such as: sustainable travel, fashion, fisheries or consumption; green products, processes, buildings, or jobs; eco-friendly energy, materials, cars, or cities have redefined industries and/or created new ones, while changing peoples' lives. But: what is the aggregate effect of all these transformation, their cumulative impact?; what positive and/or negative spillovers have they generated and to whom? - these are the questions this paper ultimately aims to answer to. The main objective of the paper is to find out how are countries positioning themselves against the requirements of global sustainability, and what is the measure of their real progress towards them. Based on the analysis of a series of internationally renowned reports and indexes - such as: The Global Sustainable Competitiveness Index (SolAbility, 2017), The Sustainable Development Goals Index (Sustainable Development Solutions Network & the Bertelsmann Stiftung, 2018), and the Sustainable Society Index (Sustainable Society Foundation, 2016) - the paper will compare and contrast data and indicators across countries, in order to identify and benchmark the progress different groups of countries have made towards sustainability, as well as the main challenges ahead of them.","[Ogrean, Claudia] Lucian Blaga Univ Sibiu, Sibiu, Romania",Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu,"Ogrean, C (通讯作者)，Lucian Blaga Univ Sibiu, Sibiu, Romania.",claudia.ogrean@ulbsibiu.ro,"OGREAN, CLAUDIA A/C-6678-2008",,"Romanian Ministery of Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI, within PNCDI III [PN-III-P1-1.1-MC-2018-1332]","Romanian Ministery of Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI, within PNCDI III","This work was supported by a mobility grant of the Romanian Ministery of Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI, project number PN-III-P1-1.1-MC-2018-1332, within PNCDI III.",,14,0,0,0,4,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,142,152,,,,,,11,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BP4BP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000550734100016,0

This is the effect of significant benefits that they achieve as a result of presenting attitudes, which are open to the environment. Increase of the importance in relation to open innovation results directly from the benefits that these enterprises get from the environment's exploration. Furthermore, innovative development - as emphasized in many researches - would be impossible without the use of open innovation models. Hence, it is reasonable to state that open innovation is one of the main determinants of this development. This is particularly important for small and medium-sized enterprises due to their limited resources. In the majority of situations, the environment acts as a buffer to fill in existing gaps. Therefore, these enterprises are mainly focused on the exploration of the environment. The aim of this article is to show the relation between open innovation and innovative development, as well as perform its overall characterization. The research took place in 2016 among the selected (at the high level of innovation development) small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the framework of the research project.

Then the distance (or similarity) between this reference outcome and each of the fuzzy outputs is used for the ordering of the outputs of a model. In many cases, however, the benchmark is represented by a fuzzy number i.e. when an expert estimate of the benchmark is given, or when predictions of future values are considered. This paper investigates the consequences of using fuzzy benchmarks for the ordering of fuzzy numbers. The paper studies if and how the use of a fuzzy benchmark with different cardinality may affect the final ordering of fuzzy numbers with respect to a chosen distance/similarity of fuzzy numbers. Different sets of fuzzy numbers representing different outputs of models (e.g. fuzzy net present values) are ordered by several distances/similarities of fuzzy numbers while the definition of the fuzzy benchmark changes cardinality-wise. Based on the analysis of the results and their graphical summaries we identify distances/similarities suitable for use with fuzzy benchmarks.","[Talasek, Tomas; Stoklasa, Jan] Palacky Univ Olomouc, Dept Appl Econ, Krizkovskeho 12, Olomouc, Czech Republic; [Stoklasa, Jan] Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Sch Business & Management, Skinnarilankatu 34, Lappeenranta, Finland",Palacky University Olomouc; Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT,"Talásek, T (通讯作者)，Palacky Univ Olomouc, Dept Appl Econ, Krizkovskeho 12, Olomouc, Czech Republic.",tomas.talasek@upol.cz; jan.stoklasa@upol.cz,"Stoklasa, Jan/O-5858-2016; Talášek, Tomáš/E-3464-2017","Talášek, Tomáš/0000-0001-8632-4599",Internal Grant Agency of Palacky University Olomouc [IGA_FF_2018_002],Internal Grant Agency of Palacky University Olomouc,Supported by the grant No. IGA_FF_2018_002 of the Internal Grant Agency of Palacky University Olomouc.,,11,0,0,0,0,"MATFYZPRESS PUBL HOUSE, FAC MATH & PHYSICS",PRAHA 8,"CHARLES UNIV PRAGUE, SOKOLOVSKA 83, PRAHA 8, 186 75, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7378-372-3,,,,2018,,,,,,,573,578,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BO2PI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000507455300099,0

This aspect differentiates options from other derivatives. Since pricing and hedging of plain vanilla options under the conditions of Gaussian distribution (or a so called Black-Scholes model) is already well documented, it commonly serves as a benchmark for developing of new approaches and methods, which, in fact, aims on options with more complex payoffs (exotic options) and/or probability distributions that fit empirical observations about the market prices better, but for which no analytical formula is available. Obviously, being able to compare the results of the novel model with theoretically correct one is a crucial step of model testing. In this contribution we focus on numerical pricing of options.

These findings should be considered when designing the experiment focusing on fallacious reasoning to avoid biased data.","[Vrbova, Lucie; Jirinova, Katerina; Bacova, Katerina; Lorencova, Hana] Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Vrbova, L (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",lucie.vrbova@vse.cz; katerina.jirinova@vse.cz; katerina.bacova@vse.cz; hana.lorencova@vse.cz,,,,,,,21,1,1,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,794,800,,,,,,7,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BP4BP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000550734100085,0

To complement our reduced form analysis, we use both intra-village and inter-village variation in rainfall shocks between 2009 and 2012 to identify the impact of agricultural income on the adoption of contraceptives by Ugandan women and their husbands. Our results indicate that women in Uganda, along with their husbands, use contraceptives strategically to postpone childbirth during negative shocks. Our baseline coefficient estimate reveals that a 0.10 log-point adverse rainfall shock increases the demand for contraceptives by 3.8 percentage points. This translates to a 6.7% increase in the likelihood of contraceptives demand. Results from the two-stage least-square instrumental variable estimation for the impact of income complements the strategic birth control story from the reduced form estimates of this paper. More importantly, we find suggestive evidence-linking preventive childbirth decisions to food insecurity during drought.

METHODS: We leveraged a representative 5% national sample of all fee-for-service dual enrollees in the United States (2004-2007) to evaluate the impact of the removal of caps on the number of reimbursable prescriptions per month (drug caps) under Part D on 1) prevalence and 2) average days' supply dispensed for antidepressants, antihypertensives, and lipid-lowering agents overall and by race (white and black). RESULTS: The removal of drug caps was associated with increased use of lipid-lowering medications (days' supply 3.63; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.57-5.70). Among blacks in capped states, we observed increased use of lipid-lowering therapy (any use 0.08 percentage points; 95% CI 0.05-0.10; and days' supply 4.01; 95% CI 2.92-5.09) and antidepressants (days' supply 2.20; 95% CI 0.61-3.78) and increasing trends in antihypertensive use (any use 0.01 percentage points; 95% CI 0.004-0.01; and days' supply 1.83; 95% CI 1.25-2.41). The white-black gap in the use of lipid-lowering medications was immediately reduced (-0.09 percentage points; 95% CI -0.15 to -0.04). We also observed a reversal in trends toward widening white-black differences in antihypertensive use (level -0.08 percentage points; 95% CI -0.12 to -0.05; and trend -0.01 percentage points; 95% CI -0.02 to -0.01) and antidepressant use (-0.004 percentage points; 95% CI -0.01 to -0.0004). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the removal of drug caps under Part D had a modest impact on the treatment of hypercholesterolemia overall and may have reduced white-black gaps in the use of lipid-lowering and antidepressant therapies.

During periods of economic instability, policy makers typically reallocate resources and execute linear cuts in different areas of public spending, including healthcare. Objectives The aim of this paper was to examine whether and how per capita public healthcare expenditure (PHE) in the Italian regions was related to the all-cause mortality rate (MR) between 1999 and 2013 and to determine which expenditure item most affected mortality in the short and very short term. Methods We conducted a pooled cross-sectional time series study. Secondary data were extracted from 'Health for All', a database released periodically by the Italian National Institute of Statistics. PHE is subdivided into directly provided services (DPS), pharmaceutical care, general practitioner care, specialist medical care, privately delivered hospital care, other privately delivered medical services, and psychiatric support and rehabilitation. We used a fixed-effects regression to assess the effects of PHE items on the MR after controlling for a number of socioeconomic and supply variables. Results Higher spending on DPS was associated with a lower MR. Other expenditure variables were not significantly associated with the MR. Conclusions The results highlight the importance of medical services and goods provided directly by public services (i.e. hospital-based general and specialized wards and offices, emergency departments, etc.). DPS represents the driving force of the system and should be considered a determinant of the health of the Italian population. Our results suggest that the context and financing methods of a healthcare system should be carefully analysed before linear cuts are made or resources are reallocated.","[Golinelli, Davide; Toscano, Fabrizio] Univ Siena, Dept Mol & Dev Med, Postgrad Sch Publ Hlth, Via A Moro 2, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Bucci, Andrea] Marche Polytech Univ, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Ancona, Italy; [Golinelli, Davide; Lenzi, Jacopo; Fantini, Maria Pia] Alma Mater Studiorum Univ Bologna, Dept Biomed & Neuromotor Sci, Bologna, Italy; [Nante, Nicola; Messina, Gabriele] Univ Siena, Dept Mol & Dev Med, Siena, Italy",University of Siena; Marche Polytechnic University; University of Bologna; University of Siena,"Toscano, F (通讯作者)，Univ Siena, Dept Mol & Dev Med, Postgrad Sch Publ Hlth, Via A Moro 2, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",ftoscanomd@gmail.com,"Golinelli, Davide/GRE-6837-2022; Bucci, Andrea/AAP-2500-2020; Golinelli, Davide/JAC-4321-2023; Golinelli, Davide/AEE-6114-2022; Toscano, Fabrizio/AAS-5997-2021; Bucci, Andrea/ADT-3035-2022; Golinelli, Davide/Q-8059-2016; Messina, Gabriele/F-3554-2011; Bucci, Andrea/HOC-7068-2023; LENZI, JACOPO/W-4835-2017","Golinelli, Davide/0000-0001-7331-9520; Bucci, Andrea/0000-0001-9872-9761; Golinelli, Davide/0000-0001-7331-9520; Golinelli, Davide/0000-0001-7331-9520; Messina, Gabriele/0000-0002-2409-4369; Toscano, Fabrizio/0000-0001-6886-580X; NANTE, NICOLA/0000-0002-2040-9562; LENZI, JACOPO/0000-0003-2882-4223",,,,,42,23,23,0,12,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

We find that in utero exposure to terrorism early in pregnancy, as measured by the number of bomb casualties in the mother's province of residence in the first trimester of pregnancy, has detrimental effects on birth outcomes: in terms of average birth weight (lower), prevalence of low birth weight (higher) and fraction of normal babies (lower). While our findings are robust to a host of potential threats to validity, they seem to be driven by exposure to a relatively large number of bomb casualties. Focusing on the deadliest ETA terrorist attack, the Hipercor bombing of 1987 in Barcelona, we find substantial effects on birth outcomes. We then attempt to assess the mechanisms at stake by presenting evidence suggesting that exposure to bomb casualties decreases self-reported health and increases smoking among women, but not among men. While exposure to terrorism during conception does not affect total fertility, there seems to be a compositional change: during bombing periods, those women who conceive are more likely to be married, and married women tend to have better birth outcomes, on average. In addition, we find that exposure to bomb casualties increases fetal deaths. Thus, we interpret our estimated negative effects on health at birth as providing lower bounds to the true effects of in utero exposure to terrorism. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this model, an outcome is determined by an endogenous regressor, which in turn is first caused by an instrument. We study the triangular model with random coefficients and additional exogenous regressors in both equations, and establish non-identification of the joint distribution of random coefficients. This implies that counterfactual outcomes are not identified either. Non-identification continues to hold if we confine ourselves to the joint distribution of coefficients in the outcome equation or indeed any marginal, except the one on the endogenous regressor. Nonidentification prevails as well, if we focus on means of random coefficients, implying that IV is asymptotically biased. Based on these insights, we derive bounds on the joint distribution of economically relevant functionals, e.g., counterfactual outcomes, and suggest an additional restriction that allows to point identify the distribution of random coefficients in the outcome equation. We extend the model to cover the case where the regressors and instrumentshave limited support, and analyze semi-and nonparametric sample counterpart estimators in finite and large samples, and we provide an application to consumer demand.

Bogomolnaia and Moulin (2001) proved that for n = 3, the probabilistic serial mechanism is characterized by the three axioms of ordinal efficiency, envy freeness, and weak strategy-proofness. We show that this characterization does not extend to problems of arbitrary size; in particular, it does not hold for any n >= 5. A number of general characterizations of the probabilistic serial mechanism have been obtained in the recent literature by replacing weak strategy-proofness with various invariance axioms while retaining ordinal efficiency and envy-freeness. We show that weak strategy-proofness is in fact logically independent of all invariance axioms used in these characterizations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This has previously been treated as a pure measurement error problem. In contrast, this paper argues that the individual-level precision of such data may reflect the structure of the underlying decision process. We estimate a semiparametric double index model on data specifically collected for this purpose and show that stock market participation decisions exhibit little variation in economic model primitives when individuals provide error-ridden belief statements. In contrast, beliefs and risk preferences predict strong variation in stock market participation for individuals who report precise expectations measures. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, lack of information on the cost of trauma care is an impediment to the evidence-based planning for such initiatives. In this study, we aim to bridge this gap in evidence by estimating the unit cost of an outpatient consultation, inpatient bed-day of hospitalization, surgical procedure and diagnostics for providing trauma care through secondary-and tertiary-level hospitals in India. Methods We undertook an economic costing of trauma care in a secondary-care district hospital and a tertiary-level teaching and research hospital in North India. Cost analysis was undertaken using a health system perspective, employing a bottom-up costing methodology. Data on all resources-capital or recurrent-on delivery of trauma care during the period of April 2014 to March 2015 were collected. Standardized unit costs were estimated after adjusting for bed occupancy rates. Sensitivity analysis was performed to account for the uncertainties due to differences in prices and other assumptions. Results The cost of trauma care in the tertiary care hospital was INR 9585 (US$147.4) per day-care consultation; INR 2470 (US$37.7) per bed-day hospitalization (excluding ICU), INR 12,905 (US$198.5) per bed day in ICU and INR 21,499 (US$330.8) per surgery. Similarly, in the secondary-care hospital, the cost of trauma care was INR 482 (US$7.4) per outpatient consultation, INR 791 (US$12.2) per bed day of hospitalization, INR 186 (US$2.9) per minor surgery and INR 6505 (US$100.1) per major surgery. Conclusion The estimates generated can be used for planning and managing trauma care services in India. The findings may also be used for undertaking future research in estimating the cost effectiveness of trauma care services or models of care.","[Sangwan, Ankur; Prinja, Shankar; Bahuguna, Pankaj] Post Grad Inst Med Educ & Res, Sch Publ Hlth, Hlth Econ, Sect 12, Chandigarh 160012, India; [Aggarwal, Sameer] Post Grad Inst Med Educ & Res, Dept Orthoped, Chandigarh, India; [Jagnoor, Jagnoor; Ivers, Rebecca] Univ Sydney, George Inst Global Hlth, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh; Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh; University of Sydney; George Institute for Global Health","Prinja, S (通讯作者)，Post Grad Inst Med Educ & Res, Sch Publ Hlth, Hlth Econ, Sect 12, Chandigarh 160012, India.",shankarprinja@gmail.com,,"Sangwan, Ankur/0000-0002-5132-0536; jagnoor, Jagnoor/0000-0002-5276-9095; Ivers, Rebecca/0000-0003-3448-662X; Bahuguna, Pankaj/0000-0001-9952-6077",,,,,37,15,15,1,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

They propose that planning be based on service utilization to incorporate preferences or other socioeconomic factors. We show that the analysis is based on inappropriate considerations of the nature of healthcare demand, a misrepresentation of need-based approaches and misunderstanding publicly funded healthcare system objectives. We explain how current levels of utilization emerge from workload and income interests of providers that underlie utilization-based models and are incompatible with public goals of maximizing health gains.

However, research on DCE response rates is lacking. Our analysis is motivated by a social exchange theory of survey response.

In 1999, the UK government implemented minimum wage legislation, increasing hourly wages to at least 3.60 pound. This policy experiment created intervention and control groups that can be used to assess the effects of increasing wages on health. Longitudinal data were taken from the British Household Panel Survey. We compared the health effects of higher wages on recipients of the minimum wage with otherwise similar persons who were likely unaffected because (1) their wages were between 100 and 110% of the eligibility threshold or (2) their firms did not increase wages to meet the threshold. We assessed the probability of mental ill health using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire. We also assessed changes in smoking, blood pressure, as well as hearing ability (control condition). The intervention group, whose wages rose above the minimum wage, experienced lower probability of mental ill health compared with both control group 1 and control group 2. This improvement represents 0.37 of a standard deviation, comparable with the effect of antidepressants (0.39 of a standard deviation) on depressive symptoms. The intervention group experienced no change in blood pressure, hearing ability, or smoking. Increasing wages significantly improves mental health by reducing financial strain in low-wage workers.

Methods: A lifetime Markov model was constructed to combine data from the Skin Awareness Trial and other published sources. The model incorporated a health system perspective and the cost and health outcomes for melanoma, squamous and basal cell carcinomas, and benign skin lesions. Key model outcomes included Australian costs (2015), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), life-years, and counts of skin cancers. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken to address parameter uncertainty. Results: The mean cost of the intervention was A$5,298 compared with A$4,684 for usual care, whereas mean QALYs were 7.58 for the intervention group and 7.77 for the usual care group. The intervention was thus inferior to usual care. When only survival gain is considered, the model predicted the intervention would cost A$1,059 per life-year saved. The likelihood that the intervention was cost-effective up to A$50,000 per QALY gained was 43.9%. The model was stable to most data estimates; nevertheless, it relies on the specificity of clinical diagnosis of skin cancers and is subject to limited health utility data for people with skin lesions. Conclusions: Although the intervention improved skin checking behaviors and encouraged men to seek medical advice about suspicious lesions, the overall costs and effects from also detecting more squamous and basal cell carcinomas and benign lesions outweighed the positive health gains from detecting more thin melanomas.

Methods: The 2011 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey was used as the data source. The ADHD cohort consisted of patients aged 0 to 17 years with a diagnosis of ADHD, whereas the non-ADHD cohort consisted of subjects in the same age range without a diagnosis of ADHD. The annual incremental total cost of ADHD is composed of the incremental direct expenditures and indirect costs. A two-part model with a logistic regression (first part) and a generalized linear model (second part) was used to estimate the incremental costs of ADHD while controlling for patient characteristics and access-to-care variables. Results: The 2011 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey database included 9108 individuals aged 0 to 17 years, with 458 (5.0%) having an ADHD diagnosis. The ADHD cohort was 4.90 times more likely (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.97-8.08; P < 0.001) than the non-ADHD cohort to have an expenditure of at least $1, and among those with positive expenditures, the ADHD cohort had 58.4% higher expenditures than the non-ADHD cohort (P < 0.001). The estimated adjusted annual total incremental cost of ADHD was $949.24 (95% CI $593.30$1305.18; P < 0.001). The adjusted annual incremental total direct expenditure for ADHD was higher among preschoolers ($989.34; 95% CI $402.70-$1575.98; P = 0.001) than among adolescents ($894.94; 95% CI $428.16-$1361.71; P < 0.001) or children ($682.71; 95% CI $347.94$1017.48; P < 0.001). Conclusions: Early diagnosis and use of evidence-based treatments may address the substantial burden of ADHD.

Objectives: To evaluate the costeffectiveness of such a spacing strategy based on the data of the STRASS trial. Methods: This is a cost-utility analysis of the STRASS trial, a French multicenter 18-month equivalence randomized open label controlled trial that included patients at stable dose for at least 1 year, in remission for at least 6 months. Effectiveness was assessed in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs involved in the study period were assessed from a payer perspective. The decremental cost-effectiveness ratio (DCER) was calculated in the complete cases sample (n = 98). Several sensitivity analyses were conducted and the impact of missing data on DCER estimate was investigated. An acceptability analysis was performed. Results: In the spacing arm, TNF-blockers were stopped for 34.1% of the patients, tapered for 43.2%, and maintained at full dose for 18.2%. The spacing strategy was associated with less QALYs gain (mean difference of-0.158; 95% confidence interval [CI]-0.085 to-0.232) and reduced costs (mean difference of- 8,440; 95% CI-6,507 to-10,212). The estimated DCER of the spacing strategy over the maintenance at full dose was 53,417 saved per QALY lost (95% CI 32,230 to 104,700). Conclusions: The spacing strategy appears cost-effective, but the acceptability of such a QALY loss reported to the cost avoided remains to be evaluated, because no consensual threshold has been determined for willingness to accept as compared with willingness to pay.

Here, we describe and discuss different experiences of integrating patients as full patient research partners (PRPs) in outcomes research from multiple perspectives (e.g., researcher, patient, and funder), drawing from three real-world examples. These diverse experiences highlight the strengths, challenges, and impact of partnering with patients to conceptualize, design, and conduct research and disseminate findings. On the basis of our experiences, we suggest basic guidelines for outcomes researchers on establishing research partnerships with patients, including: 1) establishing supportive organizational/institutional policies; 2) cultivating supportive attitudes of researchers and PRPs with recognition that partnerships evolve over time, are grounded in strong communication, and have shared goals; 3) adhering to principles of respect, trust, reciprocity, and co-learning; 4) addressing training needs of all team members to ensure communications and that PRPs are conversant in and familiar with the language and process of research; 5) identifying the resources and advanced planning required for successful patient engagement; and 6) recognizing the value of partnerships across all stages of research. The three experiences presented explore different approaches to partnering; demonstrate how this can fundamentally change the way research work is conceptualized, conducted, and disseminated; and can serve as exemplars for other forms of patient centered outcomes research. Further work is needed to identify the skills, qualities, and approaches that best support effective patient researcher partnerships.","[Kirwan, John R.] Univ Bristol, Bristol Royal Infirm, Acad Rheumatol Unit, Bristol, Avon, England; [de Wit, Maarten] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Med Humanities, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Frank, Lori] Patient Ctr Outcomes Res Inst, Washington, DC USA; [Haywood, Kirstie L.] Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Royal Coll Nursing Res Inst, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Salek, Sam] Univ Hertfordshire, Sch Life & Med Sci, Hatfield, Herts, England; [Brace-McDonnell, Samantha] Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Barbic, Skye P.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Occupat Sci & Occupat Therapy, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Alonso, Jordi] CIBERESP, IMIM Inst Hosp Mar Invest Med, Barcelona, Spain; [Guillemin, Francis] Univ Lorraine, Fac Med, Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; [Bartlett, Susan J.] McGill Univ, Div Clin Epidemiol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Bartlett, Susan J.] McGill Univ, Div Rheumatol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Bartlett, Susan J.] McGill Univ, Div Respirol, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Bristol Royal Infirmary; University of Bristol; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; University of Warwick; University of Hertfordshire; University of Warwick; University of British Columbia; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERESP; Hospital del Mar Research Institute; Universite de Lorraine; McGill University; McGill University; McGill University,"Bartlett, SJ (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Ctr Hlth, Div Clin Epidemiol, Royal Victoria Hosp, 687 Pine Ave West,Ross 4-31, Montreal, PQ H3A 1A1, Canada.",Susan.bartlett@mcgill.ca,"Barbic, Skye/AAW-4044-2020; Alonso, Jordi/A-5514-2010; Bartlett, Susan J/J-9864-2012; Bartlett, Susan J/AAD-4103-2020","Alonso, Jordi/0000-0001-8627-9636; Bartlett, Susan J/0000-0001-9755-2490; Bartlett, Susan J/0000-0001-9755-2490; Haywood, Kirstie/0000-0002-5405-187X; Barbic, Skye/0000-0002-7076-2452; Kirwan, John/0000-0002-6617-3217",,,,,30,93,97,0,25,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR,2017,20.0,3,,,,,481,486,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.10.003,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,EO1HZ,28292494.0,"hybrid, Green Accepted, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000396450600020,0

This study improved on previous research by using the probability of a resident in a county covered by workplace CIALs, taking into account the state, county, and city legislation. The county-level probability of being covered by a CIAL is merged into two large nationally representative US surveys on smoking behaviors: Tobacco Use Supplement of the Current Population Survey (2001-2010) and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (2000-2006) based on the year of the survey and respondent's geographic location to identify respondents' CIAL coverage. This study estimated several model specifications of including and not including state or county fixed effects, and the effects of workplace CIALs are consistent across models.

We show that the Gaussian case is an exception in that a SVAR model whose error vector consists of independent non-Gaussian components is, without any additional restrictions, identified and leads to essentially unique impulse responses. Building upon this result, we introduce an identification scheme under which the maximum likelihood estimator of the parameters of the non-Gaussian SVAR model is consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. As a consequence, additional economic identifying restrictions can be tested. In an empirical application, we find a negative impact of a contractionary monetary policy shock on financial markets, and clearly reject the commonly employed recursive identifying restrictions.

The majority of the studies examined focus on the most controversial cutbacks that came into force in mid-2012. The conclusions drawn, in general, are inconclusive. The consequences of this new policy of healthcare austerity are apparent in terms of access to the system, but no systematic effects on the health of the general population are reported. Studies based on indicators of premature mortality, avoidable mortality or self-perceived health have not found clear negative effects of the crisis on public health. The increased demands for co-payment provoked a short-term cutback in the consumption of medicines, but this effect faded after 12-18 months. No deterioration in the health of immigrants after the onset of the crisis was unambiguously detected. The impact of the recession on the general population in terms of diseases associated with mental health is well documented; however, the high levels of unemployment are identified as direct causes. Therefore, social policies rather than measures affecting the healthcare system would be primarily responsible. In addition, some health problems have a clear social dimension, which seems to have become more acute during the crisis, affecting in particular the most vulnerable population groups and the most disadvantaged social classes, thus widening the inequality gap.","[Lopez-Valcarcel, Beatriz G.; Barber, Patricia] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Dept Quantitat Methods Econ & Management, Campus Tafira, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35320, Spain",Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,"Lopez-Valcarcel, BG (通讯作者)，Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Dept Quantitat Methods Econ & Management, Campus Tafira, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35320, Spain.",beatriz.lopezvalcarcel@ulpgc.es,"Barber, Patricia/B-4788-2017; Valcarcel, Bea G/A-9891-2010","Barber, Patricia/0000-0001-8904-8358; Valcarcel, Bea G/0000-0002-5571-3257",Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain [ECO2013-48217-C2-1],Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain(Spanish Government),"This paper forms part of the research funded by Grant ECO2013-48217-C2-1 under the National Programme for Research, Development and Innovation to Address the Challenges of Society: National Plan for Scientific Research and Technical Innovation 2013-2016'' funded by the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain (http://invesfeps.ulpgc.es/en).

Costly drugs can be subject to Market Access Agreements (MAAs), which are financial (Commercial Agreements [CAs]) or outcomes-based (Payment for Performance Agreements [P4Ps] or Coverage with Evidence Development agreements [CEDs]). Outcomes in outcomes-based MAAs are assessed through changes in surrogate endpoints (SEPs) or patient-relevant endpoints (PEPs). In May 2015, we reviewed published and grey literature on MAAs between manufacturers and large, institutionalised payers from all geographical areas, and classified the schemes into CAs, P4Ps and CEDs, as well as by therapeutic area and country. Outcomes-based MAAs were further categorized by the endpoint used. Overall, we identified 143 MAAs, 56 (39.2 %) of which were pure CAs, 53 (37.1 %) were CEDs, and 34 (23.8 %) were P4Ps. Among the CEDs, 49 were PEP CEDs and four were SEP CEDs; of the 34 P4Ps, 29 were SEP P4Ps for 30 drugs, and five were PEP P4Ps for at least six drugs; and among 87 outcomes-based MAAs (CEDs + P4Ps), PEP CEDs were the most common (56.3 %), followed by SEP P4Ps (34.1 %). The high proportion of SEPs used in P4Ps contrasts with the high proportion of PEPs used in CEDs. CEDs employ PEPs and it appears that they are used to reduce uncertainty about a drug's clinical outcomes and/or real-life use, and thus allow payers to align a product's value with price. We argue that P4Ps do not reduce uncertainty about real-life effectiveness and can only constitute an outcome guarantee for payers if they are based on PEPs or validated SEPs.","[Toumi, Mondher; Jaroslawski, Szymon] Aix Marseille Univ, Dept Publ Hlth, Res Unit EA 3279, 27 Bd Jean Moulin, F-13385 Marseille, France; [Sawada, Toyohiro] Astellas Pharma Inc, Chuo Ku, 2-5-1 Nihonbashi Honcho, Tokyo 1038411, Japan; [Kornfeld, Asa] Creativ Ceut, 215 Rue Faubourg St Honore, F-75008 Paris, France",Aix-Marseille Universite; Astellas Pharmaceuticals,"Toumi, M (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, Dept Publ Hlth, Res Unit EA 3279, 27 Bd Jean Moulin, F-13385 Marseille, France.",Mondher.Toumi@univ-amu.fr,,,,,,,51,15,15,0,15,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

We consider a network with n complementary nodes, i.e. nodes that need to be connected to generate a positive payoff. This network may face intelligent attacks on links. To study how the network should be designed and protected, we develop a strategic model inspired by DziubiiIski and Goyal (2013) with two players: a Designer and an Adversary. First, the Designer forms costly protected and non-protected links. Then, the Adversary attacks at most k links given that attacks are costly and that protected links cannot be removed by her attacks. The Adversary aims at disconnecting the network shaped by the Designer. The Designer builds a protected network that minimizes her costs given that it has to resist the attacks of the Adversary. We establish that in equilibrium the Designer forms a minimal 1-link-connected network which contains only protected links, or a minimal (k + 1, n)-link-connected network which contains only non-protected links, or a network which contains one protected link and r(n 1) (k+ 1)/2] non-protected links. We also examine situations where the Designer can only create a limited number of protected links and situations where protected links are imperfect, that is, protected links can be removed by attacks with some probabilities. We show that if the available number of protected links is limited, then, in equilibrium, there exists a network which contains several protected and non-protected links. In the imperfect defense framework, we provide conditions under which the results of the benchmark model are preserved. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We propose a microfounded test to empirically discriminate between habit and taste formation in intertemporal preferences. Moreover, we show that 'novelty consumption' and endogenous preferences can explain the persistent correlation between economic development and obesity. By empirically studying the German reunification, we find that East Germans consumed more novel Western food and gained more weight than West Germans when a larger variety of food products became readily accessible after the fall of the Wall.

The research data were gathered through in-depth interviews, questionnaires, and document analysis. In 2010, Wang et al. devised five key elements that signal the preparedness of an organization for implementing innovation in its services. The five core elements include investment strategy, risk tolerance, success of innovation, IT experiences, and inter-organizational collaborations. This research demonstrates that the Center for Education and Training of Indonesian Ministry of Manpower, (Pusdiklat Kemnaker), which has made use of e-Learning method (as the initial stage of innovation) in its trainings on the basics of manpower, has not been well-prepared in using such a method, notwithstanding the fact that the method is already in use. The implementation of e-Learning method is impeded by a string of challenges, such as unstable internet connection, leader's role, and so forth. Innovation is a requisite for modernizing public administration, but it carries its own risks and does not guarantee a fruitful end. As such, it is of utmost importance to identify and prevent obstacles from hampering innovation. Innovation in public administration faces more complex challenges than that in private sectors. In part, it depends not only on the attitudes or traits of civil servants but also on their environments. According to Giedraiyte, innovation in public sector is generally hindered by such factors as inadequate funding and human resources, regulations, unsupportive management, insufficient incentives for staff, unpredictable response from users, differing risk culture, and resistance. This research concludes that there are two main factors hindering innovation in the Center for Education and Training of Indonesian Ministry of Manpower (Pusdiklat Kemenaker), namely inadequate human resources and budgeting.","[Ilona, Vetty; Jannah, Lina Miftahul] Univ Indonesia, Dept Adm, Fac Adm, Depok, Indonesia",University of Indonesia,"Ilona, V (通讯作者)，Univ Indonesia, Dept Adm, Fac Adm, Depok, Indonesia.",vetty04@yahoo.com; linamjannah@yahoo.com,"Jannah, Lina Miftahul/GXF-6278-2022","Jannah, Lina Miftahul/0000-0002-0827-0369",,,,,10,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-427-9,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2017,167.0,,,,,,84,94,,,,,,11,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Political Science; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration; Government & Law,BJ6IT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426719600013,0

The problem of women under-representation in high leadership positions is more noticeable on the regional government bureaucracy. Meanwhile, implementation of the merit system in civil service management persistently is pursued. One of them is the open selection method to high leadership positions that provides greater opportunities to women to reach high positions in bureaucracy. This paper focused on why the merit system that be used in career development and job promotion, cannot drive the increasing number of women civil service to held high leader position is. This study was conducted using qualitative method. Interviews were conducted against women civil service who structural position in the provincial government of DIY and Bali. Interview also conducted toward key person related to civil service career development in National Civil Service Agency and Local Civil Service Agency of the Province of DIY and Bali. Secondary data was also collected to support the argument of this study. Finding of this research show that when the merit system is applied in organizations with a masculine culture, gender inequity can be occurred. This is supported by the perception of women that occupy high leader position, which states that to achieve their current position, necessary struggle more than men peer. This shows that the merit system sometimes cannot be applied in conjunction with the policy of equity, including gender equity.

We re-examine this issue in several ways. We study the nine states that adopted caps during the third reform wave, from 2002 to 2005.

Using data from the 1990 to 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and a difference-in-difference approach, we find that the enforcement of MMLs is associated with a 2% to 6% decline in the probability of obesity. We find some evidence of age-specific heterogeneity in mechanisms. For older individuals, MML-induced increases in physical mobility may be a relatively important channel, while for younger individuals, a reduction in consumption of alcohol, a substitute for marijuana, appears more important. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that MMLs may be more likely to induce marijuana use for health-related reasons among older individuals, and cause substitution toward lower-calorie recreational highs' among younger individuals. Our estimates suggest that MMLs induce a $58 to $115 per-person annual reduction in obesity-related medical costs.

In order to support the recognizing of changes by the implementation teams, the changes need specific visualization means. In this paper, we use the modern cases of transformation of ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems to the Best of Breed solutions and an architecture modeling language ArchiMate to propose a framework for visualization of changes. The framework includes a new abstraction called Gap of Changes, artifacts, principles and means for visualization. The new abstraction is defined on a metamodel that makes it reusable in different enterprise and software architecture description languages.

However, statistics show, that also small and mediumsized companies are increasingly able to internationalise and do so. In a construction setting this is often related to participation or even initiation of building projects. In particular, Swedish building companies have a potential competitive advantage in the booming market for sustainable building, energy efficiency and energy renovation. This paper studies two cases of Chinese sustainable building projects in the Beijing region where a small Swedish consultancy company participate. The main aim is to study how culture influence in two selected energy efficiency building projects involving Swedish and Chinese partners?The framework of understanding draws primarily on culture theory, yet also more indirectly on small business, organization and management theories. The method is based on interview and project documents. Interviews is done with representatives from Swedish and Chinese companies collaborating in two Chinese projects. One project is creating new office premises for a Chinese client, the other is a green hotel project. Both projects are designed, build according to EU green building norms and also eventually obtain this certificate. The projects are interrelated and can be seen as first a potential niche, second a ( larger) market for the Swedish company in China. Cultural similarities and differences transcend national distinctions and extend into company cultures related to the companies' different roles in the project. The pattern found is thus more of a multiple configuration of cultures than a dual culture clash. Nation, company and sector cultures interact and certain culturally based interpretations serve to confirm existing understanding of sustainable building projects. It is discussed how small companies are constrained by their cultural ballast, cultural capital. They continually base decisions on situational judgment within frames posited by their cultures, limited resources and network dependencies.","[Koch, Christian; Li, Haixi; Zhao, Yimin] Chalmers Univ Technol, Construct Management, Gothenburg, Sweden",Chalmers University of Technology,"Koch, C (通讯作者)，Chalmers Univ Technol, Construct Management, Gothenburg, Sweden.",kochch@chalmers.se; haixi@student.chalmers.se; zyimin@student.chalmers.se,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,3,POLYTEKNISK FORLAG,LYNGBY,"ANKER ENGELUNDS VEJ 1, LYNGBY, 2800, DENMARK",,,978-87-502-1125-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,329,339,,,,,,11,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering,BJ6NU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426878400030,0

Newly educated engineers quickly enter into management positions with responsibility for HSE, so our educational institutions ought to prepare their students for this kind of responsibility. One should therefore expect HSE to be part of the official educational strategy when educating construction engineers. This paper 1) examines how aspects of HSE are included in the learning outcomes of the bachelor education of construction engineers in Norway, and 2) assess the emphasis on HSE topics in these learning outcomes. The investigation is limited to the HSE requirements under the provision of the Working Environment Act. Descriptions of learning outcomes were collected from five educational institutions in Norway, and the documents were subjected to content analysis. We found that the inclusion and emphasis on HSE in learning outcomes vary among the different educational institutions in Norway. The paper argues that not all educational programmes in construction engineering have HSE high on their official educational agenda. Furthermore, based on our analysis of learning outcomes, we suggest that the educational programmes consider adopting a more holistic approach to HSE. The paper provides a starting-point for further research on how the engineering educations can contribute to improve HSE performance in the construction industry.","[Asgard, Tina] Western Norway Univ Appl Sci, Dept Business Adm, Bergen, Norway; [Laedre, Ola; Lohne, Jardar] NTNU, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Trondheim, Norway",Western Norway University of Applied Sciences; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Åsgård, T (通讯作者)，Western Norway Univ Appl Sci, Dept Business Adm, Bergen, Norway.",tas@hvl.no; ola.ladre@ntnu.no; jardar.lohne@ntnu.no,"Lohne, Jardar/HGA-4028-2022; Laedre, Ola/AAA-6499-2021","Laedre, Ola/0000-0003-4604-8299",,,,,33,1,1,0,8,POLYTEKNISK FORLAG,LYNGBY,"ANKER ENGELUNDS VEJ 1, LYNGBY, 2800, DENMARK",,,978-87-502-1125-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,537,548,,,,,,12,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering,BJ6NU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426878400049,0

The study answers three research questions; 1) How do cost development in the early phase and implementation phase of a construction project relate to each other?, 2) What are the causes for cost development in the early phase of a construction project? and 3) What are the causes for cost development in the implementation phase of a construction project? The research method consists of a literature review, document analysis and two semi-structured in-depth interviews. The selected documents are primarily pre-project reports, cost estimate reports, government documents and evaluation reports from 12 projects. The informants were projects managers that had valuable knowledge regarding the history of the project. The results from the document analysis shows that cost development in Norwegian public construction projects does occur both in the early phase and in the implementation phase. The development occurs as cost increase or cost saving. The paper concludes that slow project progress stood out as a main cause of cost development in the early phase. In the implementation phase, increased need for planning, increased project scope, extended building time and the occurrence of unplanned developments were the main causes. The main cause for cost saving could be traced to a fortunate development in the market situation and from the systematic index regulation of remaining costs.","[Danielsen, Daniel Andre; Torp, Olav; Engebo, Atle; Laedre, Ola; Lohne, Jardar] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Transport Engn, Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Danielsen, DA (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Transport Engn, Trondheim, Norway.",daniel.a.danielsen@ntnu.no; Olav.torp@ntnu.no; atle.engebo@ntnu.no; ola.ladre@ntnu.no; jardar.lhone@ntnu.no,"Laedre, Ola/AAA-6499-2021; Torp, Olav/AAQ-6143-2020; Lohne, Jardar/HGA-4028-2022","Laedre, Ola/0000-0003-4604-8299;",,,,,24,1,1,1,4,POLYTEKNISK FORLAG,LYNGBY,"ANKER ENGELUNDS VEJ 1, LYNGBY, 2800, DENMARK",,,978-87-502-1125-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,79,92,,,,,,14,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering,BJ6NU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426878400008,0

It is one of the main reasons to deal with the youth unemployment problem and to realize the actuality and consequences. Also, one of the EU's priorities of development is to reduce youth unemployment. National labour force surveys (Hoffman, 2011) show that since 2008 the youth unemployment rate has risen in all the EU countries (Hjuza & Borbejs-Pece, 2012). The current economic instability in the context of youth's prospects and opportunities in the labour market is uncertain (Balan, 2014). Youth unemployment has also a negative effect on economic growth and productivity. The aim of the paper is to identify the importance of unemployed youths and draw the society's attention to the consequences.

Nevertheless, the scientists have for decades not been able to agree on the number of small states in the world, so most of them have simply decided to omit this problem from their research, focusing mainly on strategies and specificities of small states, that either derive from their smallness or not. Most classifications usually agree that the number of small states in the world is between a half and two-thirds of all states.

Using primary data extracted from survey, open-ended questionnaires and online interviews, factors that discouraged DGT employees to disclose alleged bribery in their workplace are explored. This study focuses on the respondents who identified as not intending to report. It appears that this group, which comprises around 20% of the responses (total 131), reveals the influence of structural and cultural barriers to any intention to disclose alleged bribery in their workplace. Planned Behaviour Theory, especially subjective norms and Hofstede's cultural dimensions were used to analyse the findings. As a common understanding, an organization includes structure and culture. However, many Indonesian public institutions' strategies and policies improvement are focused at the organizational structure, without considering the culture embedded in the organization. This study identifies elements of the Indonesian national culture - ewuh-pakewuh, asal bapak senang, jalan tengah and gotong royong. The effect of these cultural norms on individuals' intention to disclose alleged bribery is investigated. Findings also indicate that fear of retaliation and disbelief in the existing system are important structural barriers to individuals' intention to report alleged bribery, especially if the reporting channel does not assure anonymity. Overall, respondents value maintaining harmony and relationship over the task. Deeper explanations on the influence of subjective norms rooted in Indonesian culture are also elaborated.","[Suyatno, Bitra; Armstrong, Anona F.] Victoria Univ, Law & Justice Coll, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Thomas, Keith] Victoria Univ, Coll Business, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Victoria University; Victoria University,"Suyatno, B (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ, Law & Justice Coll, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",bitra.suyatno@live.vu.edu.au; Anona.Armstrong@vu.edu.au; keith.thomas@vu.edu.au,"Armstrong, Anona/AFW-6439-2022",,,,,,55,3,3,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,115,128,,,,,,14,"Business; Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BJ8SW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428762800014,0

The amount, the extent, and the scope of the construction OC studies are investigated and their relationships and positions to other OC studies in other industries are described. (Methodology) This study follows a bibliometric research approach integrated with an unsupervised learning based analysis of selected core studies. The study uses both well-established bibliometric methods and novel unsupervised learning approach to uncover theoretical themes of OC studies based on citation patterns and semantic text. Accordingly, the construction related OC studies are to be identified. (Findings) Related to vast field of OC studies, the research of OC focused in the construction sector tend to be rare. The construction related OC studies have focused on topics, such as knowledge management, leadership, innovation, firm performance, and characterization of OC. The semi-qualitative machine aided methodology was found to support coarse qualitative analysis of the extensive dataset. Together with human interpretation the results seem to be credible. (Limitations) The semi-automatic methodology of the Bibliographic coupling (BC) and the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) creates the results without human effort. This may lead to the wrong interpretations without proper analysis of the results. Also the use of limited phrase search may exclude some relevant studies outside the research data. Although the impact is insignificant compared to the found data amount. (Originality) The research is based on vast dataset with somewhat new methodologies compared with the traditional literature studies. First, it was possible locate the construction OC studies in the broad scientific field of OC and to identify some interesting research clusters. Secondly, the methodology itself represents an interesting and modern way to do mixed-method interpretation of the dataset in the construction sector.","[Teravainen, Ville] YIT Construct Ltd, Helsinki, Finland; [Suominen, Arho] VTT Tech Res Ctr Finland Ltd, Espoo, Finland; [Kahkonen, Kalle] Tampere Univ Technol, Tampere, Finland",VTT Technical Research Center Finland; Tampere University,"Teräväinen, V (通讯作者)，YIT Construct Ltd, Helsinki, Finland.",ville.teravainen@yit.fi; arho.suominen@vtt.fi; kalle.e.kahkonen@tut.fi,"Suominen, Arho/AAA-5918-2022; Kahkonen, Kalle Esa Eelis/G-4335-2014","Suominen, Arho/0000-0001-9844-7799; Kahkonen, Kalle Esa Eelis/0000-0002-8986-7721",,,,,52,0,0,0,4,POLYTEKNISK FORLAG,LYNGBY,"ANKER ENGELUNDS VEJ 1, LYNGBY, 2800, DENMARK",,,978-87-502-1125-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,428,441,,,,,,14,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering,BJ6NU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426878400039,0

Standards serve an instrumental purpose in the built environment reducing complexity by promoting similarity across time and space. However, differences in practices and perceptions of involved actors can make standardisation a complex endeavour itself, limiting its effectiveness as a mode of governance. Science and technology studies (STS) approaches are used to study standards in the inspection process. Standardisation is understood in this study as performative and a process of power, understanding, and emerging interests. The empirical material stems from a case study of a pier facility management process at the port of Gothenburg. Ten semi-structured interviews were conducted with actors involved in the inspection process - asset managers, structural engineers, inspectors and a document controller. Additional observations made during pier inspections and project meetings at the port were used to develop the context of the study. The analysis shows the multiple demands and interpretations present among involved actors prior to an attempt to standardise the pier inspection process. Asset managers and structural engineers voice a preference for guidelines that support ideal ways of working implemented using a checklist. Alternatively, inspectors wish to receive a common terminology. More strategically, the symbolic value of an ISO type standard matches a perceived need by the port management for credibility to satisfy customer demands. Simultaneously, a standard is expected to give clear directives to hired consultants, make the process more cost efficient and ensure a stable quality. The variety of interpretations and demands observed in this study underlines the social character of asset and facility management and the uses of standards. It is suggested to reflect on socio-technical conditions in standard design.","[Beemsterboer, Sjouke; Hallgren, Johanna; Olsson, Rickard; Koch, Christian] Chalmers Univ Technol, Gothenburg, Sweden",Chalmers University of Technology,"Beemsterboer, S (通讯作者)，Chalmers Univ Technol, Gothenburg, Sweden.",sjouke@chalmers.se,"Beemsterboer, Sjouke/AAZ-1011-2020",,,,,,13,0,0,0,2,POLYTEKNISK FORLAG,LYNGBY,"ANKER ENGELUNDS VEJ 1, LYNGBY, 2800, DENMARK",,,978-87-502-1125-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,33,43,,,,,,11,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering,BJ6NU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426878400004,0

While prior studies on supply chain integration mostly concern continuous exchanges in manufacturing industries, there is less research on discontinuous exchanges in project-based supply chains. This knowledge gap has resulted in an increased interest for partnering as supply chain integration in project-based supply chains and there is a conceptual and practical framework developed for understanding partnering as a multidimensional construct including four dimensions of supply chain integration: strength, scope, duration and depth of integration. This framework is useful for investigating separate projects but fails to acknowledge the program perspective including inter-project coordination and the interdependence between different projects and supply chains in the same program. The purpose of this study is to investigate how SCI may be achieved across projects within the same program. Findings are drawn from a case study of Stockholm Royal Seaport. Each stage of Stockholm Royal Seaport can be studied as a program including a multitude of interdependent and parallel projects performed within a limited timeframe and a limited area. The findings suggest that supply chain integration between projects is as important as within projects and the theoretical implications suggest an additional dimension to the multidimensional partnering framework when taking a program perspective. Partnering as supply chain integration has a width dimension on program management level that is more challenging to manage since formal procurement and contracting mechanisms are put in place mainly at the project level, not the program level.","[Gustavsson, Tina Karrbom; Bengtsson, Susanna Hedborg] KTH, Dept Real Estate & Construct Management, Stockholm, Sweden; [Eriksson, Per Erik] Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Business Adm Technol & Social Sci, Lulea, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology; Lulea University of Technology,"Gustavsson, TK (通讯作者)，KTH, Dept Real Estate & Construct Management, Stockholm, Sweden.",tina.karrbom@abe.kth.se; susben@kth.se; pererik.eriksson@ltu.se,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,1,POLYTEKNISK FORLAG,LYNGBY,"ANKER ENGELUNDS VEJ 1, LYNGBY, 2800, DENMARK",,,978-87-502-1125-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,253,261,,,,,,9,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering,BJ6NU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426878400023,0

Nitrogen fertilizer is one of the most important factors affecting the acquired yield and its quality. The aim of this paper is to describe the nitrogen fertilization impact on winter wheat yield and yield components under two soil tillage systems and after two forecrops. Field trials were carried out at Research and Study farm 'Peterlauki' of Latvia University of Agriculture (56 degrees 30.658 degrees C N and 23 degrees 41.580 degrees C E) in 2014/2015 and 2015/2016. Researched factors were (1) crop rotation (continuous wheat and wheat/oilseed rape (Brassica napus ssp. oleifera), (2) soil tillage (traditional soil tillage with mould-board ploughing at a depth of 22-24 cm and reduced soil tillage with disc harrowing at a depth below 10 cm), and (3) nitrogen fertilizer rate (N0 or control, N60, N90, N120(90+30), N150(90+60), N180(90+60+30), N210(90+70+50), and N240(120+60+60). Results showed that the nitrogen fertilization significantly increased winter wheat grain yield after both forecrops and in both soil tillage variants. Grain yield significantly increased until the nitrogen fertilizer rate N180. Nitrogen fertilizer significantly affected all tested yield components. Values of yield components increased enhancing N-rate of N150 - N180. The forecrop had a significant impact on wheat yield and 1000 grain weight (both increased when wheat was sown after oilseed rape). Yield and grain number per ear were significantly higher when conventional tillage was used, but number of ears per m(2) - when the reduced tillage was used.","[Litke, Linda; Gaile, Zinta; Ruza, Antons] Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,"Litke, L (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia.",linda_litke@inbox.lv,"Gaile, Zinta/O-3016-2015","Gaile, Zinta/0000-0003-2840-1263",project 'Determination of maximal fertiliser norms for crops',project 'Determination of maximal fertiliser norms for crops',Research is financed by the project 'Determination of maximal fertiliser norms for crops' which is carried out within the framework of 'State and European Union investment for encouragement in agriculture'.,,20,11,11,5,26,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-4031,,,RES RURAL DEV,,,2017,,,,,,,54,61,,10.22616/rrd.23.2017.049,0.0,,,8,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Environmental Sciences; Geography, Physical",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,BJ4WJ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000425532800008,0

Research is focused around main producing sectors of economy such as agriculture, fisheries and forestry. With the aim of establishing clear ties between Latvia and its major import markets, the statistics of foreign trade was analysed using frequency analysis. The research shows that Latvian major import markets, although, similarly with its export markets, are located in the Baltic Sea region and have some differences. Major import markets are usually countries with bigger internal market, than Latvia's. Import does follow the pattern of export markets in its separation into East and West groups with similar characteristics. Major difference, however, is differentiation of markets, where majority of high quality goods are being imported from a wider variety of markets, in contrast to export, where consolidation was a major pattern. This shows a rather close competition on world markets for potential clients, and a way for further economic change in Latvian industrial structure and operations.","[Berjoza, Antons; Paiders, Juris] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Berjoza, A (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",antons.berjoza@inbox.lv; jpaiders@inbox.lv,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,2,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-4031,,,RES RURAL DEV,,,2017,,,,,,,148,155,,10.22616/rrd.23.2017.062,0.0,,,8,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Environmental Sciences; Geography, Physical",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,BJ4WJ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000425532800021,0

The pecking order theory predicts that firms holding more tangible assets are less prone to asymmetric information problems and reduce the agency cost. Generally the supply of bank loans is expected to be higher for firms with higher collateral. In the empirical literature, this relationship is not always confirmed. We analyse this phenomenon from three points of view: meta-analysis of literature, country level data and case of Poland. This study provides a systematic analysis of the empirical literature on the usage of bank debt by conducting a meta-analysis. In particular the problem of publication selection bias is discussed. We explore the sources of heterogeneity among studies including moderator variables in random- and fixed effects regressions. Our results indicate that there is an evidence of publication selection.

The article presents the structural form of a system of economical equations in each one equation there is more than one endogenous variable. It shows the transition from the structural form to the form of the system of economical equations, where each equation has only one endogenous variable. The system of equations was developed for the rural regions of Russia. Baseline data were obtained from the database of the State Statistics Committee of Russia.

Such approaches accentuate the socially constructed and discursive nature of competitive strategy. However, as yet little attention has been given to narrative approaches within the specific context of construction management. This paper discusses the way in which a narrative approach can provide new insights into the competitive strategy of Turkish contractors. The rationale for focusing on Turkish contractors is that they have followed a different trajectory from their international competitors. Turkish contractors consistently demonstrate a high propensity for risk by operating in markets, which others perceive to be politically instable and hostile. The central argument of the narrative approach is that individuals - and by extension practitioners involved in strategy-make sense of the world by telling stories. Such stories are mobilized to constitute an overall sense of coherence and direction with direct material implications. Narratives of competitive strategy typically connect the past, present and future by linking events and actors through a projected plotline. Drawing on this 'narrative turn', the current paper focuses on the deconstruction of a formal sector-level narrative derived from the grey literature. The source in question portrays four decades of strategic development by Turkish Contractors as a formal narrative. The narrative demonstrating the internationalization trajectory of Turkish contractors as an 'epic story' is positioned as a strategy text, which provides coherence and direction for further action. The research demonstrates what events, actors and actions are prioritized by the plot structure, and what narrative building blocks are emphasized. The findings illustrate how a narrative approach provides an alternative understanding of competitive strategy to that currently represented in the construction management literature. More importantly, it conceptualizes strategy as a temporal, emergent and dynamic narrative temporally developed on broader discourses.","[Duman, Dilek Ulutas; Green, Stuart D.; Larsen, Graeme D.] Univ Reading, Sch Built Environm, Reading, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Duman, DU (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Sch Built Environm, Reading, Berks, England.",dilek.ulutasduman@pgr.reading.ac.uk; s.d.green@pgr.reading.ac.uk; g.d.larsen@pgr.reading.ac.uk,,,,,,,36,0,0,0,7,POLYTEKNISK FORLAG,LYNGBY,"ANKER ENGELUNDS VEJ 1, LYNGBY, 2800, DENMARK",,,978-87-502-1125-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,451,462,,,,,,12,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering,BJ6NU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426878400041,0

Politicians have tried to steer the housing market towards the provision of affordable housing, but have not succeeded. After 1993, the responsibility for regulating the price of housing transferred to the market, which is more interested in building for high-income earners. Despite several reports focusing mostly on productivity levels in the production of housing, little has changed. When problems persist without any significant change, it is necessary to look for fundamental, structural explanations. The study reported here offers a political-historical perspective of the Swedish housing market and its impact on the price of housing. The methodology encompasses an overview and analysis of governmental reports covering political actions to stimulate the production of housing. The findings reveal that prices depend on a malfunction in political control and unclear roles of the actors in the construction sector. It is difficult to control the price of housing because of the many actors involved, each of whom has different knowledge, practices and approaches that are not always conductive to innovation, lifecycle thinking or applying 'lessons learned'. Problems such as lack of cooperation and weak commitment among actors, a fragmented construction process and the absence of a holistic approach force up the price of new housing. This study argues for further empirical work to investigate and clarify the roles that actors have or should have in housing projects. The findings might then suggest the political incentives needed to stimulate the industry to provide affordable housing for average-income earners.","[Welin, Lennart; Bildsten, Louise] Lund Univ, Div Construct Management, Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Welin, L (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Div Construct Management, Lund, Sweden.",lennart.welin@construction.lth.se; louise.bildsten@construction.lth.se,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,5,POLYTEKNISK FORLAG,LYNGBY,"ANKER ENGELUNDS VEJ 1, LYNGBY, 2800, DENMARK",,,978-87-502-1125-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,494,504,,,,,,11,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering,BJ6NU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426878400045,0

In particular, the combination of environmental, economic and social ambitions asks for complex solutions and require multidisciplinary competences. Likewise, construction sector related educations are facing similar challenges requiring them a crossing of barriers between traditional disciplines. Whereas most educations focus on technical and economic subjects, the social aspects of sustainability are often lagging behind. However, studies of implementation of sustainable solutions underline the importance of including all the actors concerned in the process and above all the users, but the different professionals of the sector often lack tools to do so. Engaged in the creation of a summer school gathering construction and facilities management students from three Scandinavian countries, we aim at planning and implementing such tools within our respective educational programs. Building on the stream of Project-based learning (PBL), where students acquire a deeper knowledge through active exploration of real-world challenges and problems, we intend to develop cases integrating issues related to implementations of sustainable solutions within facilities management. Such issues have been identified in a literature review and in a one-day workshop gathering more than 40 participants active in the sector. The challenge is to create a pedagogical platform which includes both theory and practice-oriented contributions and to build on their complementarity to enable the students to learn how to face and possible solve such issues. Moreover, the project offers the possibility to compare and reflect over the different educations in term of sustainability in facilities management as well as to explore the professional and cultural differences between the Nordic countries from your study that will be of interest to the reader.","[Buser, Martine] Chalmers Univ Technol, Construct Management, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Store-Valen, Marit] NTNU, Trondheim, Norway; [Olsen, Erling Buus; Lauridsen, Kathrine Amtkjaer] VIA Univ Coll, Horsens, Denmark; [Straub, Mattias] Kobenhavns Erhvervsakad, Copenhagen, Denmark",Chalmers University of Technology,"Buser, M (通讯作者)，Chalmers Univ Technol, Construct Management, Gothenburg, Sweden.",buser@chalmers.se; marit.valen@ntnu.no; erol@via.dk; kaal@via.dk; mats@kea.dk,"Støre-Valen, Marit/I-5541-2019",,,,,,17,1,1,0,1,POLYTEKNISK FORLAG,LYNGBY,"ANKER ENGELUNDS VEJ 1, LYNGBY, 2800, DENMARK",,,978-87-502-1125-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,69,78,,,,,,10,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering,BJ6NU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426878400007,0

While undergraduate degrees deliver sufficient professional and expertise substance for entry level positions, ultimately it is the postgraduate qualification which sets students apart and in turn assists with rapid career advancement. In ensuring that graduate students exceed the desired entry level of professional skills, the education institution needs to provide a linking passage between undergraduate and postgraduates studies. This blending passage offers a significant opportunity for students to further develop their overall expertise and skill set. Moreover, this blending passage needs to closely align with the specific professional requirements together with the potential for the graduate to seek possible career progression and advancements. Accordingly, postgraduate studies need to align with these specific professional requirements. The blending passage is an innovative approach which maximizes non-traditional learning and provides incentives to further augment the student's career. This rapprochement will be aligned with the relevant professional bodies that will also carefully consider the students' professional competencies. This paper will investigate three prominent Australian universities and their Engineering undergraduates' belief in the importance of further education and their desire to further develop their specialist expertise through postgraduate study.

This article would present a critical review of the conventional classification of factors of production and reformulate a new classification for the allocation of resources and the distribution of income (Rent, Wages, Interest, Profits) that would be considered more rational even for the conventional theoretical framework to review and develop the theories of production and distribution. The conventional theory of production discusses the choice between different non-entrepreneurial resources (Land, Labor, and Capital). Why these resources choose to be so and not to become entrepreneurial resource is rather untouched in economic theory. Also, should owners of land, labor and capital decide to work for others on rent, wages and interest respectively or should they take entrepreneurial risk to earn profit? This is a choice often made in reality but has never been explicitly explained in economic theory. The conventional theory does not recognize money capital as an explicit factor of production but recognizes interest as a reward of capital. Interest rate is the price of money capital but it is treated as representing the price of physical capital too. This article would consider Money as an Entrepreneurial Factor of Production-EFP and this classification would create entrepreneurial factors of production when combined together would enhance growth and allow more equity in the distribution of wealth in the economy.

Two key actors in the industry, property developers and contractors, can be identified as important when developing innovation, due to their central roles in the construction project process. Therefore, it should be important to make them dedicated towards innovation, i.e. create motivation. This is in line with research on successful innovation development highlighting the importance of commitment and collaboration. A need seems to be present to create motivation towards innovation for key actors in the industry. Based on this, the purpose of this paper is to explore how motivation of key actors can influence development for systemic innovation in the construction industry. To explore this, a case study of the urban development project Stockholm Royal Seaport and its developed building logistic center was analyzed, adopting a model for receptive change context.

Perennial energy grass called tall wheatgrass (Elymus elongatus subsp. Ponticus cv. Szarvasi-1) is supposed to be a good and environment-friendly alternative to corn. Field trials including these two crops were established in the experimental locality of South Bohemia. Their yield potential was monitored during spring harvest periods (use for combustion). Dry phytomass was fundamentally analysed (N, C, H, S) and higher heating value was determined too. Universal Soil Loss Equation was calculated for both crop species.

Performance in use of BIM can be described as a measure or description of how capable and mature a project team or organisation is in terms of developing, using, evaluating or receiving BIM products or services. Although BIM is awell-known and established methodology in building design and construction organisations, when procuring and executing projects, the building management side, encompassingbuilding operations and maintenance, usually lags behind. Adoption of BIM in building management has become a challenge addressed in discussions on what the next step for BIM uptake will be. By adapting and using solutions that, to an extent, have already been developed for other stages in the construction delivery process, BIM can contribute to benefits for the operations/management phase of buildings. In order to prove efficiency and applicability of BIM as a methodology in building management operations, approaches to assess actual performancearenecessary. Thispaper describes development of a possible approach of assessing BIM performance through self-assessment. It is identified that pre-requisites in the form of default performance indicators, referred to as BIM Performance Indicators (BPI) have to be established for such methodology to be possible. In order to distinguish these BPIs, new data through input from practitioners has to be gathered. This paper suggests that a case study aiming to gather data from practitioners for this development is a suitable vehicle for identifying these indicators underpinning assessment of BIM performance specific to organisations within the building management sector. The paper concludes thatappropriate dimensions in which significance for BIM use in building management organisationsshould be sought in a case study are (1) Technology, (2) Knowledge, (3) Communication, (4) Processes and (5) Organisational culture and motivation.","[Mansson, Daniel W.] Curtin Univ, Perth, WA, Australia; [Hampson, Keith D.] Curtin Univ, SBEnrc, Perth, WA, Australia; [Lindahl, Goran] Chalmers Univ Technol, Gothenburg, Sweden",Curtin University; Curtin University; Chalmers University of Technology,"Månsson, DW (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ, Perth, WA, Australia.",daniel.mansson@postgrad.curtin.edu.au,,"Hampson, Keith/0000-0003-0339-5637",,,,,30,1,1,3,9,POLYTEKNISK FORLAG,LYNGBY,"ANKER ENGELUNDS VEJ 1, LYNGBY, 2800, DENMARK",,,978-87-502-1125-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,375,387,,,,,,13,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering,BJ6NU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426878400034,0

Illegal activities, corruption and unethical behaviour exist within the construction industry. In order to increase the understanding of how legitimate organisations seek to distance themselves from associations to unethical behaviour. Ethical frameworks are summaries of a company's core values and principles as well as a guideline for wanted behaviour. The literature states the importance for organizations to adopt such codes for raising ethical ethos internally, as well as for making an outward statement regarding the company's level of legitimacy. This paper addresses the following research questions; 1. To which extent do ethical frameworks exist among Norwegian Contractors? 2. What characteristics do the ethical frameworks have? This study examines the 50 largest contractors in Norway. The data was collected through examination of the contractor's web pages and relevant content available. We also contacted the contractors without an ethical framework publically available. We differentiated between contractors mentioning ethics on their website, those who had published a formal document and those who had both. The findings show that only 19 out of 50 contractors have a publically released ethical framework. This indicates a gap between a needed ethical embeddedness within the industry and the current state. Further, only 13 ethical frameworks managed to clarify the fuzzy line between ethical and unethical behaviour. Ethical frameworks that do not distinguish between ethical and unethical behaviour should not use the word ethical or other variations of it. The study examines outward professionalism and ethical ethos for the largest contractors. For the construction industry to develop, it must strive to close the gap between just operating legally, and operating both legally and ethically. Thus, this study contributes to a limited pool of research conducted on ethics in the construction industry. The study does not look at whether ethical framework are implemented as a decision-making tool; it highlights the aspect of providing such tool.","[Engebo, Atle; Laedre, Ola; Danielsen, Daniel A.; Lohne, Jardar] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Transport Engn, Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Engebo, A (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Transport Engn, Trondheim, Norway.",atle.engebo@ntnu.no; ola.ladre@ntnu.no; Daniel.a.danielsen@ntnu.no; jardar.lohne@ntnu.no,"Laedre, Ola/AAA-6499-2021; Lohne, Jardar/HGA-4028-2022","Laedre, Ola/0000-0003-4604-8299;",,,,,31,2,2,2,12,POLYTEKNISK FORLAG,LYNGBY,"ANKER ENGELUNDS VEJ 1, LYNGBY, 2800, DENMARK",,,978-87-502-1125-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,127,139,,,,,,13,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering,BJ6NU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426878400012,0

The understanding of Business Process is an essential approach for an Organization to achieve set objectives and improve its operations. It has been able to show Business Analysts, and Managers where bottleneck exists in the system, how to optimize the Business Process to reduce cost of running the Organization, and the required resources needed for an Organization. This is clear for large scale organizations and enterprises but under research investigation for SMEs. Business Process Modelling (BPM) is a representation of the processes of the Organization. Several modelling techniques have been proposed and used to capture the characteristics of business processes. However, limited guidelines exist for selecting appropriate modelling techniques based on the characteristics of the problem and its requirements. This is even more accurate in the case of selecting proper BPM software tools to achieve those BPM modelling and simulation goals. This paper aims at presenting a comparative analysis of some relatively popular business process modelling techniques focusing on the associated software tools. The comparative framework proposed is based on the following major criteria: data flow capability, logical reasoning and understandability, specification of roles, and capability of simulation, flexibility and ease of use, simulation support and scope. However, the emphasis of this investigation is put on SME applicability of these tools and techniques. Therefore, the first goal is to define proper selection criteria for the application of BPM tools to SMEs. The proposed framework can serve as the basis for evaluating further modelling techniques and generating selection procedures focusing on a comparison of existing tools to implement these techniques properly for SMEs. This is to enable a potential user/ modeller choose the right technique and tool in modelling critical SME Business Processes in order to analyse and optimize its operations.","[Papademetriou, Rallis C.] Univ Portsmouth, Sch Engn, Fac Technol, Anglesea Bldg,Anglesea Rd, Portsmouth PO1 3DJ, Hants, England; [Karras, Dimitrios A.] Sterea Hellas Inst Technol, Automat Dept, Psachna 34400, Evoia, Greece",University of Portsmouth,"Karras, DA (通讯作者)，Sterea Hellas Inst Technol, Automat Dept, Psachna 34400, Evoia, Greece.",dakarras@teiste.gr; dimitrios.karras@ieee.org,"Karras, Dimitrios Alexios/AAD-7229-2019","Karras, Dimitrios Alexios/0000-0002-2759-8482",,,,,20,0,0,0,10,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1865-1348,,978-3-319-57222-2; 978-3-319-57221-5,LECT NOTES BUS INF P,,,2017,275.0,,,,,,161,182,,10.1007/978-3-319-57222-2_8,0.0,,,22,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BJ5QG,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426183400008,0

Mixed flours were made of different share of spelt wheat and bread wheat (in total 11 mixtures) in 2016 in the Ceske Budejovice in the laboratories of the Faculty of Agriculture. The technological quality of these mixtures was analyzed, focusing on standard evaluation methods (protein content, characteristic of gluten or swellability of protein). The analysis was supplemented by complete rheological analysis made by Mixolab II. Bread was used as a model product. Subsequently, sensory evaluation of baked bread from the previously prepared mixtures was done. Part of the analysis was to estimate the economic basic bread recipe with different proportions of bread wheat and spelt wheat. The results were statistically analyzed via STATISTICA 9.1 (StatSoft, Inc., USA). It was proved that the flour made of spelt can give cereal products with a higher nutritional value. The results have shown that the spelt grain is much more suitable for baking. Its advantage is the higher protein content and higher resistance of kneading of the dough and starch gelatinization rate, which was statistically confirmed. The main disadvantage is the higher price of spelt. According to the results, the ideal utilization of spelt wheat based on sensory analysis and economic calculations seems to be the mixture of spelt wheat and bread wheat, which results in an undeniable decrease of the product cost, and hence effects the common customer choice and taste preferences.","[Kyptova, Marketa; Konvalina, Petr; Tran Dang Khoa] Univ South Bohemia, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice,"Kyptova, M (通讯作者)，Univ South Bohemia, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",kyptova.marketa@seznam.cz,"Tran, Khoa Dang/GWZ-5718-2022; Konvalina, Petr/AAO-6915-2021","Tran, Khoa Dang/0000-0002-0842-5279; Konvalina, Petr/0000-0002-5151-930X",National Agency for Agricultural Research of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic [NAZV QJ1310072]; University of South Bohemia in Ceske Budejovice [GAJU 094/2016/Z],National Agency for Agricultural Research of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic; University of South Bohemia in Ceske Budejovice,This work was supported by the research project No. NAZV QJ1310072 of the National Agency for Agricultural Research of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic and the University of South Bohemia in Ceske Budejovice (project No. GAJU 094/2016/Z).

The objectives of this paper are to present construction of the estimation framework for eliciting willingness to pay (WTP) for nonmarket agricultural landscape goods through choice experiments (CE) in Lithuania; then, to show the results of framework pre-test, and identify applicability of the framework designed. CE is a survey-based method implying creation of repetitive choice situations about alternatives of agri-environmental schemes for revealing how inhabitants of Lithuania value public goods from agricultural landscape (scenic views, variety of flora and fauna species, recreational infrastructure and services, the objects of cultural heritage), enabling to estimate Lithuanian residents' WTP and the demand for improvements of agricultural landscape. The results of the pilot survey have shown that the questionnaire was comprehensible and interesting to the respondents, revealing that the valuation of agricultural landscape is in demand by the society.

The control of this disease is complicated because of the diversity of pathogens and an insufficient efficacy of fungicides; therefore, the agronomic practices of wheat production are an important tool for reducing the disease development. The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of wheat crown rot depending on soil tillage system and on the pre-crop of wheat in the year 2016. The field experiment was carried out at the Research and Study farm 'Peterlauki' of the Latvia University of Agriculture in the autumn of 2008. The data obtained in 2016 are analyzed in this study: A - soil tillage system: 1 - traditional soil tillage with ploughing at the depth of 22 - 24 cm, 2 - reduced soil tillage with disc harrowing up to the depth of 10 cm; B - pre-crop of winter wheat: 1 - wheat, 2 - oilseed rape, 3 - faba beans. The incidence of crown rot was not influenced by soil tillage system, but the impact of pre-crop was significant (p = 0.006). The level of disease was essentially higher in continuous wheat sowings. The experiments showed that the main causal agents of the disease were Fusarium spp. and Oculimacula spp. The spectrum of pathogens was not dependent on a particular agronomic practice.","[Paulovska, Laura; Bankina, Biruta] Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia; [Paulovska, Laura] Agrokimija Saldus SIA Ltd, Riga, Latvia; [Roga, Ance; Fridmanis, Davids] Latvian Biomed Res & Study Ctr, Riga, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies; Latvian Biomedical Research & Study Centre,"Paulovska, L (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia.;Paulovska, L (通讯作者)，Agrokimija Saldus SIA Ltd, Riga, Latvia.",paulovska.laura@gmail.com,"Fridmanis, Davids/I-3292-2017; Bankina, Biruta/AAG-2504-2019","Fridmanis, Davids/0000-0003-0310-0448; Bankina, Biruta/0000-0001-7745-2804; Roga, Ance/0000-0003-4683-7458",State research programme 'Agricultural Resources for Sustainable Production of Qualitative and Healthy Foods in Latvia' [1 SOIL],State research programme 'Agricultural Resources for Sustainable Production of Qualitative and Healthy Foods in Latvia',"The research was supported by the State research programme 'Agricultural Resources for Sustainable Production of Qualitative and Healthy Foods in Latvia', project No. 1 SOIL.",,25,1,1,2,11,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-4031,,,RES RURAL DEV,,,2017,,,,,,,13,18,,10.22616/rrd.23.2017.043,0.0,,,6,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Environmental Sciences; Geography, Physical",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,BJ4WJ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000425532800002,0

Even though there is a growing trend towards sustainability reporting which is of voluntary nature, not much attention is given to the credibility of such information through external assurance. The paper investigates the extent of sustainability reporting in the mining sector companies in Australia and their assurance practices. The annual reports were examined for top 100 ASX listed companies in the mining sector in Australia for 2013-2014. This study identified 18% of companies had a sustainability report, however, only 44% of the sustainability reports were audited either by accountants or independent assurance providers. However, majority of the companies (62.5%) were assured by accountants. Criteria used for assurance varied resulting in providing limited assurance by majority of the assurance providers. This study showed that there is variability in assurance practices for sustainability reports. Companies also used various assurance standards, as there were no universally accepted assurance standards for non-financial reporting. One of the major limitations for this variability is the lack of standardized indicators. This study shows that there is a need to develop generally acceptable criteria for assurance of non-financial information in sustainability reports. The criteria that can be applied by assurance providers would be a significant contribution for auditing profession and independent providers as well as standard setters, which will provide credible information for users of such information. This paper identified the importance of acceptable criteria for assurance of non-financial information in sustainability reports for companies in the mining sector which are considered to have greater environmental and social impact.","[Heenetigala, Kumudini; Armstrong, Anona F.] Victoria Univ, Coll Law & Justice, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Victoria University,"Heenetigala, K (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ, Coll Law & Justice, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",Kumi.Heenetigala@vu.edu.au; Anona.Armstrong@vu.edu.au,"Armstrong, Anona/AFW-6439-2022",,,,,,53,1,1,2,4,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,335,350,,,,,,16,"Business; Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BJ8SW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428762800036,0

Using data from 1970-2014, we established that the variables were cointegrated with an Autoregressive Distributed Lagged (ARDL 1, 1) Model or Bound Testing Approach to cointegration. The parsimonious model shows that unemployment has a negative short-run effect on economic growth. This finding validates the Okun's Law. The Error Correction Model (ECM) shows that it will take over 3years for the unemployment gap to be cleared. Also, the Block Exogeneity Wald Test shows a uni-directional causality originating from economic growth to unemployment. The authors recommend that government should partner with the private sector to close the infrastructural gaps particularly electricity and roads.

Several researchers point out that the management of this phase of the AEC industry is under researched compared to management of the construction phase. This represents both a lack of maturity, research tradition and proven methods within this field. In this paper we first present some of the key traits of building design management. Through a review of articles we present what research methods are the most common in the field of building design management. The review shows that 47 % of the studied papers are based on a qualitative research approach, 40 % on a quantitative research approach and 13 % on a mixed method approach. The overview also shows that only 9 % presents their research strategy clearly and only 36 % describes how the data was analysed. Secondly the paper presents an example showing how a qualitative research approach and the use of constant comparative method of analysis can increase the knowledge of building design management. The research questions we address in this paper are: 1. What is the most common used research approach in building design management, in the last 20 years? 2. What challenges exists in building design management research? and 3. Can the constant comparative method of analysis contribute to better rigour in building design management research?

Then empirical material, enables insights and arguments that supports and/or contradicts the theoretical data for each of the identified competences. Three additional competencesis derived from the case study, leading to a total of ten competences: learning during change, strategic leadership, dealing with risk and contingencies, embrace and redirect resistance, synergy orientation, managing local responsiveness, cultural mindset appointing qualified personnel, efficient communication and business mindset. Missing competenceswere acquired through external consultants or recruitment. To achieve the desired synergies, management uses detailed checklists and processes, and place a person with a very strong internal network as responsible for the integration project.

This paper searches for the potential mechanism of transmission of the resource curse. The countries which were selected are dependent upon either tourism as a source of revenue, natural resources or are to a degree dependent upon both. In order to avoid potential problems from using cross-section data, individual time series analysis methods were used. By using a Vector Autoregressive framework, this paper concludes that there is evidence of both direct transmission from natural capital towards economic growth, as well as indirect transmission through political instability and increased level of corruption. These finding are overall conclusive with the previous works discussing the research curse hypothesis. The key policy recommendation is ensuring that funds obtained from the exploiting of resources or tourism are used to develop a more stable and long-term sustainable economy.","[Kurecic, Petar; Milkovic, Marin] Univ North, Koprivnica 1, Trg Zarka Dolin, Croatia; [Kokotovic, Filip] Univ Coll Int Relat & Diplomacy Dag Hammarskjold, Zagreb 242, Ilica, Croatia",University North - Croatia,"Kurecic, P (通讯作者)，Univ North, Koprivnica 1, Trg Zarka Dolin, Croatia.",petar.kurecic@unin.hr; marin.milkovic@unin.hr; filip.kokotovic@hotmail.com,"Kurecic, Petar/M-2524-2017",,,,,,22,0,0,1,4,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,362,370,,,,,,9,"Business; Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BJ8SW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428762800038,0

Interstitial floors are defined by Miller and Swensson (2002) as intermediate service floors inserted between primary floors, enabling easier access to technical equipment and less interference on daily hospital activities. The interstitial concept gained some attention in the early 1980s, but was by most analytics judged to require excessive capital investment (Miller & Swensson, 2002). However, as flexibility is becoming crucial in the rapidly changing environment of hospital buildings, Miller and Swensson suggest that the concept might become more justifiable in this decade. The research reported on in this paper is based on three case studies of Norwegian hospitals with interstitial floors. Rikshospitalet, St. Olavs hospital and Sorlandet hospital were studied. A literature review, interviews, document analysis and site visits constitute the main sources of evidence in this research. In total, 9 respondents with experiences from either planning, construction or operational phases of hospital buildings have contributed in this research. Interviewees and other respondents express that interstitial space contributes to making the operational phase easier, more effective and less costly. It is also expressed how interstitial space can aid future changes and reconstructions at hospitals. Based on the interviews, additional investment costs seem to be the most significant disadvantage of building hospitals with interstitial floors. Other challenges are related to the design, such as insufficient space and floor height. Findings indicate that there is a significant potential for long term savings associated with interstitial space in hospitals, however this is not well documented. Further studies should include a cost-benefit analysis of the concept. Findings also indicate that setting aside sufficient space and floor height is essential for the floors to create flexibility and ensure that they are beneficial in the operational phase.","[Veium, Maiken; Schatveta, Marit Store-Valen; Lohne, Jardar] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Transportat Engn, Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Veium, M (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Transportat Engn, Trondheim, Norway.",,"Lohne, Jardar/HGA-4028-2022",,,,,,22,1,1,0,3,POLYTEKNISK FORLAG,LYNGBY,"ANKER ENGELUNDS VEJ 1, LYNGBY, 2800, DENMARK",,,978-87-502-1125-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,484,493,,,,,,10,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering,BJ6NU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426878400044,0

The methodology is based on an adaptation of the IPCC guidelines using Lithuanian emission factors from Lithuania's National Inventory Report and the activity data of family farms derived from Lithuanian FADN. The GHG emissions were analysed per farm (t CO2eq farm(-1)) and per hectare (CO2eq ha(-1) of UAA). The research found out that the major sources of GHG emissions are related to the use of chemical fertilizers on farms comprising 52.6% of the total emissions from family farms. The performed analysis shows that GHG emissions per farm depended on the farm size and ranged from 63.3 t CO2eq farm(-1) to 479.6 t CO2eq farm(-1), on farm size class less than 30 ha UAA and from 500 ha UAA or over, respectively. The GHG emissions on family farms totalled 184.2 t CO2eq farm(-1) and ranged from 5.8 t CO2eq farm(-1) to 234.6 t CO2eq farm(-1), in the permanent crops farms and in the specialist dairying farms, respectively.","[Dabkiene, Vida] Lithuanian Inst Agrarian Econ, Vilnius, Lithuania",Lithuanian Institute of Agrarian Economics,"Dabkiene, V (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Inst Agrarian Econ, Vilnius, Lithuania.",vida@laei.lt,"Dabkienė, Vida/AAO-5927-2021","Dabkienė, Vida/0000-0003-4902-5535",,,,,22,3,3,0,0,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-4031,,,RES RURAL DEV,,,2017,,,,,,,225,232,,10.22616/rrd.23.2017.072,0.0,,,8,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Environmental Sciences; Geography, Physical",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,BJ4WJ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000425532800031,0

This is important for achieving a holistic understanding about system specification. Integration can be reached via modelling process. Currently, most of information system modelling methods present different modelling aspects in disparate modelling dimensions and therefore it is difficult to achieve semantic integrity of various diagrams. In this paper, we present the principles of semantically integrated conceptual modelling method for information system analysis and design. The foundation of this modelling method is based on interaction flows. This way of modelling is critical for the identification of discontinuity and inconsistency in information systems specifications. It also provides possibility to integrate business processes and business data, which is necessary for the integration of various architectural domains and to reach the holistic view of enterprise architecture. We have explained in object-oriented terms how interactive, structural and transitional aspects are merged. We also demonstrated the interpretation of various patterns, in terms of semantically integrated conceptual modelling method. It was shown that the method has sufficient expressive power to cover some special cases, which do not match the standard pattern of transaction. The inference rules of interactions help in reasoning about system decomposition. In this method, decomposition is graphically described as classification, inheritance or composition of concepts. SICM method is based on a single type of diagram, which enables reasoning about integration with the help of a special set of inference rules. The ultimate goal of this paper is to present the generic principles for computation-neutral modeling of service interactions.","[Gustas, Remigijus; Gustiene, Prima] Karlstad Univ, Dept Informat Syst, Karlstad, Sweden",Karlstad University,"Gustas, R (通讯作者)，Karlstad Univ, Dept Informat Syst, Karlstad, Sweden.",Remigijus.Gustas@kau.se,,,,,,,37,2,2,0,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1865-1348,,978-3-319-57222-2; 978-3-319-57221-5,LECT NOTES BUS INF P,,,2017,275.0,,,,,,1,26,,10.1007/978-3-319-57222-2_1,0.0,,,26,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BJ5QG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426183400001,0

The petroleum industry being the most important industry in Norway, not only contributes to the wealth in the country, but is also a very important driver for the innovation and technology development in other sectors especially the construction sector. Therefore, the current global economic situation and its impact on major oil and gas capital projects have made construction productivity improvement more and more important. Nevertheless, according to the Ansoff's theory of weak signals, strategic surprises, such as downturn in oil prices, do not appear out of the blue; rather they may be detected with the aid of pre-emptive signs, which may be referred to as early warning signs. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether an early warning system could have predicted the extent to which the oil crisis would affect the construction industry in Norway, allowing the industrial actors to react strategically ahead of time in order to exploit the opportunities created due to this situation and maintain and improve productivity under these circumstances. This is done through identifying the possible key leading indicators which could be measured in early phase of the downturn in oil capital, in order to discover these early warning signs. The next step is to verify how early a potential disruption could be predicted based on these indicators and how the industrial actors could accordingly react to this situation. This research is based on literature study including scientific publications, newsletters, white papers and available data obtained from selected news volume. The research results contribute to better understanding of the benefits of early warning systems in order for the main actors within the construction industry to effectively manage disruptions in the related industries.","[Hajikazemi, Sara; Ekambaram, Anandasivakumar; Langlo, Jan Alexander] SINTEF, Trondheim, Norway; [Olsson, Nils; Andersen, Bjorn] NTNU, Trondheim, Norway",SINTEF,"Hajikazemi, S (通讯作者)，SINTEF, Trondheim, Norway.",sara.hajikazemi@sintef.no; Nils.olsson@ntnu.no; siva@sintef.no; Bjorn.Andersen@ntnu.no; jan.A.langlo@sintef.no,,,,,,,34,0,0,0,2,POLYTEKNISK FORLAG,LYNGBY,"ANKER ENGELUNDS VEJ 1, LYNGBY, 2800, DENMARK",,,978-87-502-1125-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,186,197,,,,,,12,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering,BJ6NU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426878400017,0

Apart from this, the company has also made provision for a very lucrative trial period from 1st September 2016 to 31st December, 2016 where the subscribers are allowed to use both the voice and data services of the operator for free. However, a little is known or understood about its effect on competition in the telecommunication business in India. Many allegations had come up regarding the company resorting to predatory pricing to acquire larger market share. However, this was countered immediately as according to the competition law provisions in India, predatory pricing is a kind of 'abuse of dominance' and since the operator in question did not enjoy a dominant position, it could not have deployed predatory pricing in the eyes of law. This paper analyses how the introduction of a seemingly customer friendly service, although not per se anti-competitive according to the provisions of the Competition Act, 2000, disrupt the competition in the telecom business in India. The modus operandi deployed by RJio in acquiring the 4G spectrum in 2010 along with the retrospective amendment in 2013 to permit the use of the spectrum for both data as well as voice services and the TRAI recommendation in 2016 to quash the IUC makes the author wonder if it is actually 'being at the right place at the right time ' that worked in case of RJio.","[Jose, Christy Ann] Hidayatullah Natl Law Univ, Naya Raipur, Chhattisgarh, India",,"Jose, CA (通讯作者)，Hidayatullah Natl Law Univ, Naya Raipur, Chhattisgarh, India.",annchristy5@gmail.com,"Chappa, Dr Mohanababu/JJC-6146-2023",,,,,,10,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,241,247,,,,,,7,"Business; Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BJ8SW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428762800025,0

Since the contracts differ in between and there are changes in government policies over time that affects both existing and new contracts, a comparison between different contracts becomes challenging. A literature review has been conducted to understand the change in procurement strategy and how to encourage contractors to innovate. The research questions include: What procurement strategies are there? How is maintenance evaluated? How does procurement affect the innovation opportunities for entrepreneurs? The literature review focuses on railway maintenance and contract design between client and contractor. In total, 17 articles matched the search criteria and were selected for the review. To have successful maintenance service, five articles suggested partnering as a strategy with common goals in combination with good communication during the entirety of the contract. When selecting incentive plan, four articles mentions that a focus on performance-based incentives in combination with risk management is better rather than actual payment schemes. The reason being that payment is often the main cause of conflicts between client and contractor. The scientific literature suggests that improvement in incentives improves quality of maintenance, decreases delays and technical failures. The conclusion from the literature review is that partnering in railway maintenance is considered successful. With accurate knowledge about railway assets the incentive plan becomes accurate which reduces costs.

With an ambition to evaluate the value of a building embedded in its surroundings, and with a wider societal perspective, the task becomes even more complex. A new conceptual evaluation model was introduced at the 8th Nordic conference in Tampere, 2015. The model is further developed and tested since then, and this paper gives an update on the results. The original model was based on principles from well-established evaluation methods and inspired by the OECD integrated evaluation model. It was made as simple as the authors found reasonable, considering the reduction in precision that comes with simplification. The authors tested the original model on three real-life case-projects in the development phase. Initial results proved promising, but also indicated issues for further development. After this initial development, the authors tested the model on two real-life building projects in parallel with testing a different evaluation model developed by Sweco Norway. The purpose of the two models are similar, but the methods have different takes on the process and what information is used as basis for evaluation. The direct comparison gave interesting findings and signals for further development of both models. Both models are developed in Norway and may be characterized as adapted to the Nordic context. The model evaluates the whole urban planning situation, including the neighborhood and transport infrastructure. The model has the potential to help practitioners achieve better results in terms of real sustainability in urban planning.

Modern varieties developed under high input agricultural systems do not always perform well under organic growing conditions. Therefore, farmers need such varieties of cereals that can adapt to variable growing conditions and maintain productivity. One of the ways to promote adaptation to environment is growing of variety mixtures. Field trials were conducted during 2014 - 2016 under organic and conventional farming systems in two locations with an aim to estimate the advantages of barley mixtures in respect of yield and its stability. The trial consisted of eight mixtures of barley varieties and breeding lines, components of mixtures in pure stand and three check varieties. The mixtures were combined by using two, three and five components. Three mixtures, each in one out of 11 environments significantly out-yielded, but one mixture had significantly lower yield than the average value of their components. Some mixtures showed a tendency to out-yield the average of components in both farming systems. All mixtures insignificantly out-yielded check varieties in 2015, but in 2016, yield was within the range between varieties with lowest and highest yield. The results of yield stability analysis showed that mixtures could be used as one of the approaches to stabilize yield - only one of eight mixtures had a lower yield than the average over all environments.","[Locmele, Indra; Legzdina, Linda; Gaile, Zinta; Kronberga, Arta] Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,"Locmele, I (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia.",indra.locmele@llu.lv,"Kronberga, Arta/HTN-0055-2023; Gaile, Zinta/O-3016-2015","Kronberga, Arta/0000-0002-2398-9101; Gaile, Zinta/0000-0003-2840-1263; Locmele, Indra/0000-0001-6036-084X; Legzdina, Linda/0009-0006-5126-1202",Latvian Council of Science project [155/2012],Latvian Council of Science project(Latvian Ministry of Education and Science),Financial support for this study was provided by the Latvian Council of Science project Nr. 155/2012 Genetically diverse varieties for environmentally friendly agriculture - study on advantages and breeding strategies.,,24,2,3,3,16,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-4031,,,RES RURAL DEV,,,2017,,,,,,,19,25,,10.22616/rrd.23.2017.044,0.0,,,7,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Environmental Sciences; Geography, Physical",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,BJ4WJ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000425532800003,0

From analysis of relevant secondary data the main problems that hinder the development of clusters in distinct regions of Lithuania are distinguished. It is revealed that clusterization in Lithuanian regions lags far behind big cities, it is much more passive and clusters there often reach only the level of a micro-cluster. Clusters are most developed in the tourism and food industries, using traditional means instead of high-techs, failing to benefit from EU support for clustering development. In order to improve the clusterization situation in Lithuania and its development in the regions, more attention and investment are to be allocated for promoting cooperation between the companies and the business and science, research sectors, and joining the international cluster.

The potential of small-scale robots for performing tasks alongside the increasing digitisation of construction information offers new possibilities for exploiting off-site construction more flexibly and at more modest scales than previous visions of total automation. Previous task-specific methods of system design have typically involved a limited range of standardised operations, with cutting, drilling and fixing being foremost. However, more adaptable and configurable processes, utilising these emerging technologies and oriented to short production runs may offer a more viable approach. However, innovation brings challenges, not least in reconfiguring the socio-technical relations and expectations around existing work processes. Automation requires defining new human-machine interactions, and rehearsing organisational, cultural and skills changes necessary to facilitate this. This paper presents and describes research currently underway at the University of Reading examining the challenges associated with this. The empirical focus is on the pilot stage of a project that is developing the concept of 'Flexible Robotic Assembly Modules in the Built Environment' (FRAMBE). Drawing on theory from the Information Systems (IS) field and concepts relating to the interface between humans and robots a review of the current practice and implementation approaches of robotics and automation in the construction industry is presented along with the proposed research approach and analytical framework adopted to systematically capture skills needs and culture change throughout the pilot project.","[Dowsett, Ruth; Harty, Chris; Davies, Richard] Univ Reading, Sch Construct Management & Engn, Reading, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Dowsett, R (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Sch Construct Management & Engn, Reading, Berks, England.",r.m.dowsett@reading.ac.uk; c.f.harty@reading.ac.uk; richard.davies@reading.ac.uk,"Davies, Richard/AFN-4809-2022","Davies, Richard/0000-0002-7910-8959",,,,,16,3,3,0,8,POLYTEKNISK FORLAG,LYNGBY,"ANKER ENGELUNDS VEJ 1, LYNGBY, 2800, DENMARK",,,978-87-502-1125-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,93,103,,,,,,11,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering,BJ6NU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426878400009,0

The time component - as it is closely connected with other components of projects, for example, cost - has a huge impact on both the execution and success of projects. It is also widely known that several projects fail - including, in terms of delivery in time. In order to make sure the effectiveness and success of projects, better time management practices are necessary. Identifying better practices requires a study on current practices as a first step. The main purpose of this paper is to contribute to the improvement of time management in projects by presenting a study on the current situation and practices regarding time management in projects, and suggesting possibilities for improvement. The paper will look at project-based organizations in Norway. This paper is connected to a research and development project called SpeedUp. This paper will first describe a summary of current practices in the organizations (AS-IS study). In this regard, it will provide an overall framework, tools and methods, roles and responsibilities, competence development initiatives and aspects that facilitate effective time planning and management. Secondly, a model for planning and managing time (including a link to a list of best practices) will be presented. The results from the AS-IS study can be considered as a base for deriving suggestions and devising initiatives for improving time management in projects. One such initiatives is to develop this model for time management in projects. In addition, this paper will present a discussion on competence development that can support sharing and utilization of best practices. Implication of this paper can be described as follows: The model and the tools correspond to some of the important issues that the results of the AS-IS study point out.

The multi-functionality of these products calls for collaboration between a range of actors from manufacturers, clients, architects, engineers, and contractors. Two major challenges for the increased up-take of the technology has been identified and is dealt with in a transdisciplinary research project, called ELSA, involving industry and academic institutions. First, the successful architectural integration of solar shading in terms of form, size, colour, detailing etc. in relation to the overall building design will be decisive in order to persuade architects. Second, the development of these multi-functional products to reach functional, technical, economic and aesthetical qualities is dependent upon communication between different professions. As a means to initiate a dialogue between the different professional groups taking part in the ELSA project, a model, the AIQ-model (Architectural Integration Qualities), to assess preferences for architectural integration of energy producing solar shading was developed and tested in a workshop. The results indicate a large consensus across different professional groups when assessing successful architectural integrations. Consequently, discrepancies in aesthetic appraisal of energy producing solar shading should not be the main hindrance for a broader implementation of such solutions. The challenge rather lies in that architectural integration qualities will concur with other important aspects of the multi-functional solution, and not all professional groups will put architectural integration qualities above other functions. The workshop shows that the AIQ model serves its function to initiate and to focus discussions. The value of group discussions to reach consensus was also observed. The AIQ model provide definitions to clarify the judgment base behind aesthetic assessments that was appreciated but all groups but most easily applied by the architects. The model should be further developed to include also other aspects than aesthetics.","[Femenias, Paula; Thuvander, Liane; Gustafsson, Anna; Park, Sofia] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Trondheim, Norway; [Kovacs, Peter] Swedish Res Inst, RISE, Stockholm, Sweden",RISE Research Institutes of Sweden,"Femenías, P (通讯作者)，Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Trondheim, Norway.",femenias@chalmers.se,"Femenias, Paula/V-2406-2017; Thuvander, Liane/B-6284-2016","Femenias, Paula/0000-0003-0508-3602; Thuvander, Liane/0000-0002-9031-4323","Swedish Energy Agency's programme E2B2, SBUF the Swedish Constructions Industry's organisation for research and development","Swedish Energy Agency's programme E2B2, SBUF the Swedish Constructions Industry's organisation for research and development","This research was financed through the Swedish Energy Agency's programme E2B2, SBUF the Swedish Constructions Industry's organisation for research and development and by 11 industry partners.

This initial result of the study reveals some of the examples of collective categories in which two groups of managers (from public administration and sales industry) foresee a possibility of using character strengths in the optimization of managerial work tasks.","[Ochinowski, Tomasz] Univ Warsaw, Fac Management, Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Ochinowski, T (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Management, Warsaw, Poland.",ochinto@wz.uw.edu.pl,,,,,,,20,0,0,1,6,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,371,377,,,,,,7,"Business; Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BJ8SW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428762800039,0

The general objective of this research is to explore student knowledge of possible methods of increasing the quality of inclusion for students from under-represented groups in academic environments. The specific objective is to explore their attitudes and knowledge about usage of information and communication technology (ICT) during education and subsequent employment. Respondents are asked to estimate the importance of equal opportunities in studies. Results show that there are governmental and institutional strategies and policies that enable students in the process of gathering academic competences, academic achievement and employment. The results are interpreted within the scope of Croatian national politics. Gender equality could be implemented in the education, career planning and employment procedures. Working experience is an important factor in gathering professional competences and can be done not only through formal working experience, but also through volunteering opportunities. The different types of institutional support for students with disabilities is explained and discussed. These results could be used to enhance the quality of inclusion for students from under-represented groups within the educational system by usage of ICT, peer assistant support and collaborations between educational institutions at all levels of education and labour market.","[Vidacek-Hains, Violeta; Staba, Ana Marija] Univ Zagreb, Fac Org & Informat, Varazhdin, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Vidacek-Hains, V (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Org & Informat, Varazhdin, Croatia.",vvidacek@foi.hr; ana2marija5@gmail.com,,,,,,,25,1,1,0,6,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,258,267,,,,,,10,"Business; Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BJ8SW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428762800027,0

This might be caused by the obligations that public owners being obliged to use competitive and transparent contractor selection procedures based on both price and quality. In addition, they are obliged to treat all tenderers equally. However, fulfilling these obligations is challenging even in the traditional project delivery methods. Thus, it becomes extra challenging when it should happen together with ECI. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to add to the knowledge of abilities and constraints of using such an approach by studying how public owners use ECI approaches. This research was carried out according to a qualitative approach, based on a literature study, a document study and interviews. Fourteen semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with key client personnel from eleven case studies selected from Norwegian bridge projects. Various approaches of ECI have been used in the investigated bridge projects without violating public procurement legislation. Among the identified approaches are; direct contact with specialist contractors in the front-end phase of projects, idea competition, announcing the project with optional technical solutions, using a design & construct contract, information meetings with the contractor branch and a front-end partnering process. This study concludes that public owners might have several alternatives in order to implement ECI. However, the contractors' contributions vary a lot depending on which ECI approaches are implemented and at what time they are implemented in a project. Most of the ECI approaches identified in the targeted projects were implemented in the relatively late phases of the projects. Most of the approaches, however, could have been implemented earlier. Therefore, the ultimate potential of the approaches was not realised. This paper can help public owners to understand the full potential of ECI approaches. Likewise, it can help public owners to benefit more when they implement the approaches in the future.","[Wondimu, Paulos Abebe] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, NPRA, Trondheim, Norway; [Hailemichael, Eyuell] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Stockholm, Sweden; [Svalestuena, Fredrik; Hosseini, Ali; Lohne, Jardar; Laedre, Ola] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Chalmers University of Technology; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Wondimu, PA (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, NPRA, Trondheim, Norway.",paulos.wondimu@ntnu.no; fredrik.svalestuen@ntnu.no,"Laedre, Ola/AAA-6499-2021; Lohne, Jardar/HGA-4028-2022","Laedre, Ola/0000-0003-4604-8299;",,,,,35,2,2,2,6,POLYTEKNISK FORLAG,LYNGBY,"ANKER ENGELUNDS VEJ 1, LYNGBY, 2800, DENMARK",,,978-87-502-1125-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,525,536,,,,,,12,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering,BJ6NU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426878400048,0

A lack of focus and structural emphasis on architectural qualities within the management of protected buildings is an obstacle for suitable protection and development of such buildings. Architectural qualities are among the formal reasons for the protection of buildings. Still, such qualities are not stressed in their management, which instead prioritize provable historic qualities and juridical framework. The article poses four questions: (1) Is architectural quality of universal validity or is it subjective? (2) Is there a final definition for architectural quality in a building, e.g. the original architects intentions? (3) Is architectural quality unaffected by whether the building is in use? (4) Are protected buildings living architecture, or do they belong to the past as museum objects? Answers are sought in a theory of knowledge and understanding, Gadamer's hermeneutics, due to its gravity and its emphasis on the cognition of architecture. Despite its recognition, it is not generally applied to the management of protected buildings. Gadamer's hermeneutics deals with human existence, of which the art experience in architecture is merely one aspect. Gadamer dismisses a subjective understanding of architecture, declaring that experiencing architecture is participation in a fellowship of meaning. Gadamer's writings have provided added theoretical perspectives on architectural qualities in protected buildings, and incentives to protect, use and reinterpret protected buildings: the legal protection of a building is a formalization of the buildings existing significance. This forms a premise for the use of a protected building, with a continued focus on and reinterpretation of its significance. Gadamer focuses on the work of art, rather than the creator: to understand is not to enter the artists mind but to enter the space of meaning that the work offers. The article offers a theoretical foundation for the management of architectural qualities in protected buildings. Applying hermeneutics to the management of protected buildings implies that one should place emphasis on architectural quality, continued use and reinterpretation of significance. The aim is to enable dialog on and management of architectural qualities, in addition to historical qualities, in protected buildings and generally.","[Stendebakken, Mari Oline Giske] NTNU, Dept Architecture & Planning, Trondheim, Norway; [Olsson, Nils O.

The research aims to analyse high-technology industries in Latvia taking into account the competitiveness and the regional allocation using a set of several indicators. According to NUTS 3, Latvia is subdivided into 6 regions; however, the high-technology industries are regionally allocated mainly in two regions, Riga and Pieriga regions.

The research confirms that the high-technology regional allocation depends on available labour resources and also education and professional training facilities in the region.

The research aim is to explore and analyze the laws and regulations governing public food procurement in Latvia and to identify the main obstacles to food purchases from local producers. By purchasing food, local governments or authorities have to fulfill the European Union (EU) and the Latvian statutory requirements for both the correct procurement procedures, both on food safety and hygiene norms throughout the whole food product life cycle. Purchasing food from local producers is a challenge, because on the one hand, the EC Treaty and a number of other documents request the free movement of goods and equal rights for all market participants, on the other - the local community and local government is interested in providing school students with high-quality, natural food and in promoting small local businesses. The solution is to use green public procurement (GPP) criteria in the public food procurement. However, in the implementation of the GPP there are several disadvantages for both the local government and local food producers. By studying Latvian and other EU countries' experiences, it can be concluded that barriers to local food producers to participate in local government food procurement are related to both competitiveness and production storage and regular supply assurance.","[Krivasonoka, Inita] Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,"Krivasonoka, I (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia.",inita.krivasonoka@gmail.com,,,,,,,21,5,5,1,14,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-4031,,,RES RURAL DEV,,,2017,,,,,,,195,202,,10.22616/rrd.23.2017.068,0.0,,,8,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Environmental Sciences; Geography, Physical",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,BJ4WJ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000425532800027,0

However, the quantity of beer sold in Latvia in the last decade did not increase considerably, and the average quantity of beer consumed per capita rose very slowly. Even though beer consumption was stable in Latvia, the quantity of beer supplied to the market was approximately three times greater than the quantity of the other kinds of alcoholic beverages combined, totalling about 15 million dekalitres. Besides, in recent years in Latvia the segment of craft beers tended to increase, which became increasingly popular in Western Europe and the number of small breweries sharply increased there. In Latvia, the number of small breweries increased at a slower pace, therefore, the research aim was to examine the factors influencing the development of small breweries in Latvia. The research found that most of the breweries in Latvia qualified for the status of small brewery, the output of which did not exceed 50 000 dekalitres per year. Although small breweries produced craft beers, yet their performance and development were considerably influenced by the activity of the large breweries and the purchasing power of consumers. Small breweries positively influence the beer drinking traditions of Latvians, which can contribute to the stable development of the small breweries. Small breweries have their competitive advantages in the market, which is due to the quality and assortment of their products, as well as they perform extra economic activities that contribute to their recognition.","[Licite, Lasma; Lukss, Arita] Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,"Licite, L (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia.",lasma.licite@llu.lv; aritalukss@inbox.lv,"Licite-Kurbe, Lasma/ADO-5954-2022","Licite-Kurbe, Lasma/0000-0002-0973-7522",,,,,21,0,0,0,3,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-4031,,,RES RURAL DEV,,,2017,,,,,,,233,240,,10.22616/rrd.23.2017.073,0.0,,,8,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Environmental Sciences; Geography, Physical",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,BJ4WJ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000425532800032,0

Meanwhile, changing regulations and expectations from stakeholders with regards to environmental impacts and sustainability force the industry to approach projects differently both in planning and execution. This paper discusses the terms of industrialization and sustainability in the context of the construction industry and presents the findings from a questionnaire survey addressing how these are related. Industrialization of construction projects is one development trend that encompasses the adaption and adoption of techniques and mindset from manufacturing and other industries. Use of parallelization of tasks by off-site production, prefabrication of components, units or modules, additive manufacturing techniques (such as 3D printed concrete), emphasis on supply chain management, and approaches such as lean construction can all be regarded as examples of industrialization of construction projects. Based on a survey of actors in construction projects (participants in the project SpeedUp and the network Bygdin) we present how arguments for increased industrialisation can be put forward based on cost-efficiency, quality and sustainability concerns. Although consideration for the three elements may appear to align nicely, our survey indicates that cost-efficiency is the main concern for actors in the building and construction industry. We then raise the question of whether this effectively limits quality to good enough and the sustainability aspects of construction projects to become less bad rather than actively doing good. Regulations can be effective in addressing concrete issues such as ensuring that buildings are adapted to harsher climate with more intense rainfall. In order to becoming the primary driver of industrialization however, sustainability must be interpreted holistically as consisting of the environmental, economic and social dimensions, therein recognising companies need for profit to sustain themselves.","[Okland, Andreas; Olsson, Nils O.

The country also includes numerous smaller islands in the Pacific and Indian Ocean. Australia is the sixth-largest country in the world by total area. It also has the world's 12th-largest economy and, fifth-highest per capita income. On 1 January 1901, a federation of six separate British self-governing states was formed after a decade of planning, consultation and voting. This established the Commonwealth of Australia as a dominion of the British Empire. In 1931 the status of the dominions was made equal to that of Great Britain, which is considered the symbolic date of Australia gaining full independence. Before World War II and in the course of it, the Commonwealth of Australia was closely tied to the government in London. However, the fall of the British Empire in the Asia Pacific made Australian authorities rethink their existence in the new reality. In the late 80s, Australia's formal ties with London were further loosened, as planned. Since that time the role and significance of the continent has been growing. A vibrant economy and favourable location drive the country's growing importance, which the government in Canberra strongly focuses on. Economic success and effective policies have made Australia become one of the crucial elements of sustainable balance in the South Pacific region. However, the country's political and economic influence goes far beyond its borders. Australia's importance to and influence on neighbouring countries is clearly visible across East and Southeast Asia, the Indian Ocean basin, and the Antarctic. Therefore it is worth to take a closer look at the drivers of the huge success of this unique country and its inhabitants.","[Przygoda, Miroslaw] Univ Warsaw, Fac Management, Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Przygoda, M (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Management, Warsaw, Poland.",miroslawprzygoda@wp.pl,,,,,,,23,2,2,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,54,64,,,,,,11,"Business; Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BJ8SW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428762800007,0

The combined inoculation and tripartite symbiosis between leguminous plants, Rhizobium spp. and vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi has been the subject of intensive research. Less attention has been paid to their effects on subsequent crops. Pot experiments were carried out in the greenhouse of Latvia University of Agriculture in 2015 and 2016. Soil used for this experiment was taken from the previous trial, where broad beans (Vicia faba var. major Harz.) were grown. Bean seeds, depending on the variant, were inoculated with rhizobia bacteria or mycorrhiza fungi, or the mixture of both microorganisms. Onions were grown as a subsequent crop. During the experiment, fresh and dry weight of onion leaves was determined. Onion root mycorrhizal colonization frequency and arbuscule abundance in the onion root system were determined. The activity of soil microorganisms was determined by soil respiration intensity. Results showed that the use of microsymbionts increased the subsequent onion leaf harvest in 2014 by 2.3% and in 2015 by 9.5%. In 2015 the highest increase of onion leaf yield was detected in variants were rhizobia strain RP023 was used. Rhizobia strain RV407 gave a positive effect only in combination with mycorrhiza fungi. Precrop treatment with mineral nitrogen fertilizer increased the onion yield in both years - by 12.4 and 14.3%, respectively. In all treatments, a decrease in dry matter content was observed. The highest incidence of mycorrhiza fungi structures was detected under mycorrhiza treatment.

Establishing strategic partnerships is in the paper seen as a potential way to make building renovation more sustainable in Denmark particularly in terms of reducing energy consumption and use of resources and increase productivity. However, until now we have only had a limited number of such partnerships implemented and the few examples that do exist, mostly concern the construction of new buildings. The paper is based on an investigation and analysis of strategic partnerships models as well as typical processes used in building renovation. Experiences from development of new strategic partnerships have particularly been found in the UK and Sweden. Based on two workshops with practitioners representing the whole value chain in the construction industry and analyses of two exemplary cases the paper suggests prerequisites for establishing successful strategic partnerships for sustainable building renovation. The results show that strategic partnerships are collaborations set up between two or more organizations that remain independent with the purpose of obtaining a goal of mutual and high priority based on a binding commitment and a long term perspective by a consecutive number of projects. An essential prerequisite for most of the identified challenges in building renovation processes is stable project partners. Framework agreements is a way to legally establish collaboration with more stable project partners, but it is also in itself an important prerequisite to target challenges related to tender, competition and an extreme focus on lowest price.","[Jensen, Per Anker; Johansen, Jakob Berg; Thuesen, Christian] Tech Univ Denmark, DTU Management Engn, Lyngby, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark,"Jensen, PA (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Denmark, DTU Management Engn, Lyngby, Denmark.",pank@dtu.dk; jajoh@dtu.dk; chth@dtu.dk,"Berg, Jakob Brinkø/ABH-3502-2021; Jensen, Per Anker/G-1595-2015","Berg, Jakob Brinkø/0000-0002-2662-1521; Thuesen, Christian/0000-0003-3552-7796; Jensen, Per Anker/0000-0001-6980-0506",,,,,19,1,1,0,9,POLYTEKNISK FORLAG,LYNGBY,"ANKER ENGELUNDS VEJ 1, LYNGBY, 2800, DENMARK",,,978-87-502-1125-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,230,241,,,,,,12,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering,BJ6NU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426878400021,0

Whereas some progress appears to have been made in reducing mortality from disaster events in recent years, the economic consequences of disasters have significantly risen. A number of factors contribute to this: the increasing concentration of people and assets in cities, the tendency for cities to be situated in lowlying coastal areas and on the banks of major rivers, the extension of supply networks and the increased dependence on all kinds of networks which mass urbanization entails. Climate change predictions also suggest that both vulnerabilities of populations and the severity of disaster events are set to increase. The collapse or failure of buildings and infrastructure is often the mechanism by which disasters occur and the economic losses incurred are directly associated with the extent of damage to the built environment. Much can be done by built environment professionals to improve disaster resilience through the incorporation of disaster risk reduction measures in urban planning, in the design and construction of buildings and infrastructure, in responding to disasters and in reconstruction after disasters. These all call for additional investment in the built environment and, although the current magnitude of disaster-related losses suggests that such investments in mitigation would be worthwhile, there appears to be a lack of suitable financing mechanisms available to enable them. This paper reports the results of a desktop study into financing mechanisms for disaster risk reduction investments in the built environment. The aim of this initial study is to define and understand financing mechanisms and their applicability to potential investors and their specific contexts. A Facet Theory approach to defining and understanding the problem domain is adopted and the paper elaborates a mapping sentence that describes the ranges of financing mechanisms, investors and disaster contexts that need to be taken into consideration as a first step to gain a comprehensive understanding of financing mechanisms and their applicability.","[Witt, Emlyn; Lill, Irene] Tallinn Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn & Architecture, Tallinn, Estonia",Tallinn University of Technology,"Witt, E (通讯作者)，Tallinn Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn & Architecture, Tallinn, Estonia.",emlyn.witt@ttu.ee; irene.lill@ttu.ee,"Witt, Emlyn David Qivitoq/B-4468-2019; Witt, Emlyn/O-3589-2019; Lill, Irene/D-3205-2011","Witt, Emlyn David Qivitoq/0000-0001-8321-0975; Witt, Emlyn/0000-0001-8321-0975; Lill, Irene/0000-0003-3178-1455",Estonian Ministry of Education and Research [IUT1-15]; Advancing Skill Creation to ENhance Transformation (ASCENT); European Commission,"Estonian Ministry of Education and Research(Ministry of Education and Research, Estonia); Advancing Skill Creation to ENhance Transformation (ASCENT); European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre)","This research was supported by institutional research funding IUT1-15 Nearly-zero energy solutions and their implementation on deep renovation of buildings of the Estonian Ministry of Education and Research and by the Advancing Skill Creation to ENhance Transformation (ASCENT) project funded with support from the European Commission.

The research discovers the SC at the micro-level - the collaboration and attitudes between citizens and the state as well as in-between the individuals themselves, along with the macro-level -interaction of social groups as a part of a network which helps create trust to local government bodies as well as the state. The study indicates that the development of the Zemgale region is impacted not only by such social capital factors as the population density in the districts (0.37), the number of population until the working age (0.55), but also by the factor education level of the deputies (2009-2013) between the districts (0.12), towns (0.41), and the whole region (0.14). This verified the assumption that higher education level implies higher social potential and more active social inclusion. The authors suggest the local-governments to devote increased funding to the NGOs as it is the most active form of social capital, thus ensuring a long-term development of such initiative groups.","[Jankova, Liga] Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia; [Grizane, Tamara] Turiba Univ, Riga, Latvia; [Jurgelane, Inguna] Riga Tech Univ, Riga, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies; Riga Technical University,"Jankova, L (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia.",ligajankova@inbox.lv,"Jankova, Liga/AAG-6081-2019","Jankova, Liga/0000-0003-3289-5120",,,,,30,1,1,0,2,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-4031,,,RES RURAL DEV,,,2017,,,,,,,256,262,,10.22616/rrd.23.2017.076,0.0,,,7,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Environmental Sciences; Geography, Physical",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,BJ4WJ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000425532800035,0

The rule of law is one of the most important factors necessary for sustained economic development, the protection of human rights, implementation of legitimacy and democracy, etc. Due to the acquisition of this importance of the rule of law, various national and international organizations, individual researchers and research centers are trying to analyze the rule of law and its basis. These approaches aim to reveal factors positively influencing on the rule of law, or to identify all the factors, which can undermine its basis. The final goal of our research is to define basic elements of maintaining the level of constitutionality and the rule of law, that can be applied in the social and economic policy of the state. The main objective of this research is to develop new methodology that will include as many areas and indicators of the rule of law in a particular country as possible. For this purpose, we have used the method of Factor analysis. The basis of this new methodology is the development of the new integral index, which will represent the levels of the rule of law in observed countries, as well as its change over time. As a result, the integral index of the Rule of law was calculated for 141 countries for 2011-2015. Then we have extended the scope of our research by comparing index's results for Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, that helps to conclude in which directions these countries have policies, that are more effective compared to others and in which directions they have failed.

This study adopted questionnaire-survey method with new staff nurses of hospitals. The overal research was divided into two stages. In the first stage, 30 valid pre-trial questionnaires were collected. In the second stage, 255 valid questionaires were gathered. The first stage involved the drafting of preliminary items and expert validity analysis. The second phase included a reliability, construct validity and criterion-related validity analysis. After proposing 48 preliminary items, an expert validity test was carried out by requesting five senior nursing managers with mentoring experience. After the expert validity test, a content validity index (CVI) was constructed, with an average of 0.82. Items with a CVI of less than 0.8 were removed, leading to the deletion of 15 items. The remaining 33 items were then subjected to a reliability test; four items found to have an item-to-total correlation of less than 0.5 were deleted. A total of 29 items of NMEQ were proposed: four nursing manager items, four institutional items, three other medical staff items, twelve mentor items, and six mentee it. Exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis and correlation analysis proved that this questionnaire had good construct validity and criterion-related validity. NMEQ was composed of five elements of institutional dimension, mentor dimension, nursing manager dimension, other medical staff dimension, and mentee dimension with a total of 29 items.Managers could use NMEQ to understand the effectiveness of mentoring program and provide the directions for improving it.

The original focus on cost efficiency represents a challenge of creating sustainable buildings in contemporary society. Large portfolios ofbuildingsneed renovation appreciating future demands of energy consumption and economic, environmental and importantly social sustainability. New energy producing renewable technologies represent an important opportunity to meet these challenges. However, apart from the dominant agenda of large companiesin suburbs ofthe larger cities in Europe and Swedish towns, a series of small public housing companies exists which have parallel challenges, but receive far less attention from institutional players such as government authorities, researchers and policy makers. The aim of this contribution is to analyse challenges and opportunities of doingenergy plus renovation of small public housing companies in Sweden and to develop a possible roadmap for meeting the challenges. The theoretical framework draw on organisation, management in construction, political science and economics and energy renovation literature to conceptualise small organisations characteristics, and building processes of renovation. The empirical material has been done in collaboration with one company, literature study and interviews over a period of a year. The results show that the limited resources of small public housing companies can be tackled by providing extra manpower in the purchasing process and further in the renovation process. And by purchasing, organising and using a network for knowledge, including energy producing and energy saving technologies. If the rental is to be kept stable, it requires a new financial model for the public housing company. The roadmap developed in the project for doing energy plus renovation is presented, involving all phases of purchasing, design, building and operation. It involves systematic participation of tenants. It is structured in seven main phases to support the roadmaps role as a tool.","[Koch, Christian; Lutteman, Anders] Chalmers Univ Technol, Construct Management, Gothenburg, Sweden",Chalmers University of Technology,"Koch, C (通讯作者)，Chalmers Univ Technol, Construct Management, Gothenburg, Sweden.",kochch@chalmers.se; anderslutteman@hotmail.com,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,6,POLYTEKNISK FORLAG,LYNGBY,"ANKER ENGELUNDS VEJ 1, LYNGBY, 2800, DENMARK",,,978-87-502-1125-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,340,350,,,,,,11,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering,BJ6NU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426878400031,0

The evaluation of TFP is based on the Index number approach, where TFP growth is a ratio of the Output index to the Input index.

Moreover, based on the neo-behaviouristic approach, considering attitudinal and behavioural measures, all kinds of loyalties were observed stronger in the urban areas of Lithuania. The assumption was made that there might be an effect of limited-choice condition. Affected by the latter condition, rural citizens tend to seek for variety more than the urban ones. Consequently, considering the rural citizens' evaluations, it can be stated that their loyalty is undermanaged, resulting in a very low amounts of truly loyal customers. Therefore, for the grocery retailers it was recommended to revise their customer loyalty schemes based on the point of residence of their consumers.

With such, this study uses Uses and Gratifications Theory (UGT) and Expectation Disconfirmation Theory (EDT) for model development. The minimum sample size was determined by Israel Glenn sampling table. An online questionnaire using Google Forms were distributed to 400 YouTube users in Malaysia, selected through purposive sampling techniques. All variables and items were extracted from reviews of literatures and were checked for convergent and discriminant validity using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) under AMOS software was used in the analysis. Results of the SEM indicated that the model fits the data. Based on the Three-Variable Nonrecursive Causal Model By Baron and Kenny's (1986), it was found that gratification acts as a mediator for 2 (two) variables as there were positive and significant relationships between expectation towards social and technology gratification with gratification from the use of YouTube for movie watching experience among Malaysians. Findings from this study will be able to guide movie content providers in Malaysia to work hand in hand with Google in regards to online platform distribution for movies and to shed some light towards the potential of YouTube as a new movie watching platform in Malaysia.","[Bin Abu Bakar, Mohd Syuhaidi] Univ Teknol MARA, Shah Alam, Malaysia; [Bin Bolong, Jusang] Univ Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi MARA; Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Bin Abu Bakar, MS (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol MARA, Shah Alam, Malaysia.",mohdsyuhaidi@gmail.com; jusang@upm.edu.my,,,,,,,37,0,0,1,12,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,384,392,,,,,,9,"Business; Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BJ8SW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428762800040,0

It has been both practically and scientifically acknowledged that this poses challenges to knowledge transfer especially because the actors and sites are constantly changing. These challenges have been widely studied, but majority of the research has concentrated on the management and organisational level, i.e. on project organising and management (see e.g. Kamara et al 2002a, Rezqui et al. 2010). It is, however, equally important to understand the challenges of knowledge transfer at the construction worksite. To fill the research gap, this paper concentrates on the knowledge transfer in construction worksites during the actual construction of the facility among construction workers and site supervision. The purpose of the paper is to investigate the factors that enhance or inhibit effective knowledge transfer in a Finnish construction worksite. The study is conducted by adopting case study based research approach (Yin 2008, Eisenhardt 1989) and the research material is collected in a construction worksite of a Finnish main contractor in southern Finland. Material consists of 10 interviews of construction workers, site supervision and the supervision of subcontractors. The study is leaning on existing knowledge transfer literature and a theoretical framework has been built based on a literature review. The research material is analysed by utilising a loose theoretical framework, where issues influencing on knowledge transfer are considered in four categories; personal factors, organisational factors, network related factors and informational factors (see. e.g. Goh 2002, Riege 2005, van Wijk et al. 2008, Kanto et al. 2014). The results indicate that familiarity and trust between the people is a major factor enhancing the knowledge transfer among the construction workers, site supervision and the subcontractors. Besides, established processes and IT-systems have a positive effect on the knowledge sharing. Especially, among the construction workers, it should, however, be recognized that their motivation to spread and receive information is in connection with its convenience and easiness as well as with the personal interest. Besides, the employees do not have access to the IT-systems and - devices, which somewhat inhibits knowledge sharing.","[Halttunen, Maarit] VTT Tech Res Ctr Finland Ltd, Espoo, Finland",VTT Technical Research Center Finland,"Halttunen, M (通讯作者)，VTT Tech Res Ctr Finland Ltd, Espoo, Finland.",maarit.halttunen@vtt.fi,,,,,,,34,0,0,0,8,POLYTEKNISK FORLAG,LYNGBY,"ANKER ENGELUNDS VEJ 1, LYNGBY, 2800, DENMARK",,,978-87-502-1125-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,198,207,,,,,,10,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering,BJ6NU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426878400018,0

It shows the correlation of KOSPI-DJIM portfolio has stronger linkage than that of KOSPI-SHX portfolio. In the portfolio perspective, the S&P 500 Sharia stock Index(SHX) acts as a better hedge asset than DJIM against the risk of stock market. Last, the hedge ratio between two Islamic stock market and Korean stock market pairs is generally low, indicating that the Korean stock risk can be effectively hedged by taking a short position in the Islamic stock markets. In comparison with two pairs, the pair of KOSPI-SHX relatively shows a cheaper hedging cost than that of KOSP-DJIM pair.

The risk of fatality, injury, and property damage is significantly higher in construction jobsites compared with workplaces in other industries. Hazardous accidents happen due to traditional safety planning or failure to monitor the construction safety rules during a construction process. Recently, variety of approaches and technologies have been developed to achieve benefits in design-for-safety or safety performance. Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) technologies can easily monitor all over the site by flying around the construction site under a safety manager's control and transmit real-time information for inspecting safety purposes among the project. This paper presents a safety monitoring framework in the construction projects. The framework consists four following processes; BIM based Model, Safety Regulations, UAS-based collection of Safety Inspection Dynamic Data and Analysis of Project Safety. This system has a potential to assist designers, workers, and safety managers to mitigate construction accidents and fatalities. Throughout the design stage, this system with the help of 3D software and BIM is capable of identifying potential hazards. It also will make use of the gathered information to prevent the potential hazards. In control phase, the UAS gives possibility of these rules' monitoring and control. This novel method integrates BIM and UASs, and allows the potential users such as safety managers to obtain and analyse data in construction sites, which in turn can enable safety specialists (supervisors, agents, and inspectors) to identify hazards at different project phases and develop suitable mitigation strategies. The integration of 4D BIM-based models and UAS technology have the potential to improve identification, implementation and monitoring of construction site safety and hence increase the construction projects stakeholders' safety.","[Alizadehsalehi, Sepehr; Asnafi, Mahsa; Yitmen, Ibrahim; Celik, Tolga] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Famagusta, Northern Cyprus, Turkey",Eastern Mediterranean University,"Alizadehsalehi, S (通讯作者)，Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Famagusta, Northern Cyprus, Turkey.",sepehr.salehi@cc.emu.edu.tr; mahsa23.asnafi@gmail.com; ibrahim.yitmen@emu.edu.tr; tolga.celik@emu.edu.tr,"Çelik, Tolga/KCK-8652-2024; Alizadehsalehi, Sepehr/R-7426-2018; Yitmen, Ibrahim/ABK-3907-2022","Alizadehsalehi, Sepehr/0000-0003-1567-2590;",,,,,46,5,5,0,18,POLYTEKNISK FORLAG,LYNGBY,"ANKER ENGELUNDS VEJ 1, LYNGBY, 2800, DENMARK",,,978-87-502-1125-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,22,32,,,,,,11,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering,BJ6NU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426878400003,0

A dynamic innovative and open-ended expansive process is requested and badly needed. The development and implementation of new technology require a parallel process of developing the use of technology and the social processes of its use. Knotworking represents a distributed collaborative expertise in pursuit of a task that is organised among designers from different design disciplines and other players in a construction process. In Finland and Denmark experiments with Knotworking is being developed and tested: Experiments with Knots, how can it change or create new objects and solutions in construction? The method of the study is action research and applied ethnography that is a practice-oriented approach to contribute to change processes. The degree of authors' participation varied from being a facilitator, consultant or observer in the Danish case and from being a facilitator and observant in the Finnish case. The data collection was a participant observation in a Finish and Danish case. The participants of the experiments were architects, contractors, energy specialists, HVAC design engineers, structural engineers, a cost calculator, representatives of property owners and researchers. The data was saved in digital format using several video cameras. We also gathered BIM documents, process charts, advisors' reports and photographs. Experiments with Knots have the potential to break inertia in construction, multiple solutions will persist and it implies learning by experimenting with the new practice. The Knots are organised to solve specific problems or tasks requiring multidisciplinary expertise. Working with Knots as a successful process requires intensive collaboration across organizational boundaries and hierarchies through object-oriented actions, i.e. objects of activities that include both material and cognitive constructions which lead to entail directionality, purpose, and meaning to collective activities.","[Buhl, Henrik; Andersen, Michael] Univ Coll Northern Denmark, Aalborg, Denmark; [Kerosuo, Hannele] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Buhl, H (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Northern Denmark, Aalborg, Denmark.",,,"Buhl, Henrik/0000-0003-2455-4449; Kerosuo, Hannele/0000-0001-9560-6029",,,,,30,0,0,0,6,POLYTEKNISK FORLAG,LYNGBY,"ANKER ENGELUNDS VEJ 1, LYNGBY, 2800, DENMARK",,,978-87-502-1125-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,57,68,,,,,,12,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering,BJ6NU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426878400006,0

Both public and private sectors widely adopt the project concept to create the product or service that they aim at. Projects are goal-oriented, one-time activities that have time and resource limitations. Even though projects are widely applied in modern organisations, project management is recognised as one of the more challenging tasks in business and one that requires multiple skills to master. The skills encompass technical project management skills such as resource planning and managing a budget; but also a complex mixture of soft skills such as communication, trust building and managing the stakeholders of a project. Current methods for training project managers have received criticisms that call for new approaches to support learning. One such approach is experiential learning for fresh project managers to gain a variety of project experiences in a virtual environment through serious games. This paper discusses the aspects of learning that are important for project manager; in particular, the diverse set of soft skills that are important to managing stakeholder, which are of vital importance for successful projects. The aim of this paper is to examine how specific affordances of serious games can support learning for project managers in construction projects. The main research question that we aim to answer in this paper is: How can serious games support competence development for project managers? This is a conceptual paper and the discussions have been by our work in understanding the diverse technical and soft skills in project management and stakeholder management. This paper aims to contribute to an increased understanding of the competences and how they can be supported by serious games.","[Ekambaram, Anandasivakumar; Petersen, Sobah Abbas] SINTEF, Trondheim, Norway",SINTEF,"Ekambaram, A (通讯作者)，SINTEF, Trondheim, Norway.",siva@sintef.no; Sobah.Petersen@sintef.no,,,,,,,35,0,0,0,2,POLYTEKNISK FORLAG,LYNGBY,"ANKER ENGELUNDS VEJ 1, LYNGBY, 2800, DENMARK",,,978-87-502-1125-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,104,115,,,,,,12,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering,BJ6NU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426878400010,0

In order to determine the influence of brand associations on purchase intentions in the organic product category, the organic yogurt was chosen as a product. The brands' criteria grid was elaborated for the selection of the specific yogurt brands and three different yogurt brands were chosen for the research. Nine associations directly or indirectly associated with ecology were generated and approved by experts of marketing and advertising; namely: organic', 'natural', 'ecological', 'healthy', 'nutritious', 'Lithuanian', 'tasty', 'regular', and 'expensive'. The empirical research with the selected brands and generated associations was composed of two parts: experiment and questionnaire survey. The research results revealed that brand associations have a huge impact on consumer purchase intentions in a framework of organic products. Proper and positive association development positively and directly influences consumer purchase intentions. Positioning of the brand as providing organic products is extremely important when seeking to develop brand associations with organic products; the naturalness, ecology of the product should be emphasised in marketing communication; a brand name should be meaningful and visual marketing communication should expose the ecology. For the future research, the analysis of the influence of brand associations on the conative consumer response in the frameworks of the remaining products categories is necessary.","[Grigaliunaite, Viktorija; Pileliene, Lina] Vytautas Magnus Univ, Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Grigaliunaite, V (通讯作者)，Vytautas Magnus Univ, Kaunas, Lithuania.",viktorija.grigaliunaite@vdu.lt; lina.pileliene@vdu.lt,"Grigaliūnaitė, Viktorija/GXG-1429-2022; Pileliene, Lina/AAP-2315-2020; Pileliene, Lina/B-3293-2014","Grigaliūnaitė, Viktorija/0000-0001-8340-2993; Pileliene, Lina/0000-0003-2704-8314; Pileliene, Lina/0000-0003-2704-8314",,,,,7,1,1,0,3,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-4031,,,RES RURAL DEV,,,2017,,,,,,,210,216,,10.22616/rrd.23.2017.070,0.0,,,7,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Environmental Sciences; Geography, Physical",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,BJ4WJ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000425532800029,0

The challenge of handling new work procedures and practices requires new knowledge and skill, which ought to be learned by the students. The ambition to facilitate this learning have been taken up by several scholars. In Northern Denmark, this led to the organization of The Digital Days - a learning event focusing on BIM, digital tools and inter-disciplinary collaboration. The participants are students from AEC educations and local companies, which allows for challenging current practice with digital tools and ways of collaboration. Despite of this setting, a resent study showed a lack of new collective knowledge. Activity theory and expensive learning are used to set-up a theoretical framework, which is used to generate opportunities for new collective knowledge. In April 2017, this will be tested during the The Digital Days where data will be gathered through ethnographic observations. It is argued that this approach offers a novel theoretical contribution towards understanding how and when new collective knowledge takes place in an educational setting involving BIM.","[Lauritzen, Dorthe Holmberg; Klitgaard, Anne; Nissen, Soren Bulow; Buhl, Henrik] Univ Coll Northern Denmark, Aalborg, Denmark",,"Lauritzen, DH (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Northern Denmark, Aalborg, Denmark.",,"Klitgaard, Anne/ABD-7117-2021","Klitgaard, Anne/0000-0003-2232-6223; Lauritzen, Dorthe Holmberg/0000-0001-9943-5845; Buhl, Henrik/0000-0003-2455-4449",,,,,25,0,0,0,6,POLYTEKNISK FORLAG,LYNGBY,"ANKER ENGELUNDS VEJ 1, LYNGBY, 2800, DENMARK",,,978-87-502-1125-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,220,229,,,,,,10,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering,BJ6NU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426878400020,0

Besides its obvious advantages from the point of view of economic growth, clash of cultures, legal and societal, it often leads to conflicts. Generally speaking, there are two different groups of conflicts. First is dominated by state interests and the state itself has an interest in the outcome of such cases. Traditionally, they were whithin the exclusive domain of courts. However, it is beyond doubt that some of them are arbitral duty. The other group is dominated by private interests so, consequently, private parties are allowed to decide who is going to resolve their conflict and how. With regard to who, arbitration has undoubtedly become the preferred dispute settlement method. There are some indications that almost 90% of international commercial contracts include an arbitration clause. With regard to how, party autonomy represents a cornerstone in cross border commercial transactions. Thus, parties are also allowed to designate the applicable law in the case of a dispute. Sometimes, the parties will even opt for a tandem (combination of choice of law and choice of (arbitral) forum). Since the incentive for opting for arbitration may be, and sometimes is, the parties' interest to avoid the application of certain mandatory rules, question is to whom should the arbitrator give priority, to the state and its interests or the parties and their expectations? Is it an arbitrator's AO; to apply mandatory rules? What are the consequences of their ignorance? The intention of this paper is to present the complexity of arguments and offer some conclusions.","[Medic, Ines] Univ Split, Fac Law, Domovinskog Rata 8, Split 21000, Croatia",University of Split,"Medic, I (通讯作者)，Univ Split, Fac Law, Domovinskog Rata 8, Split 21000, Croatia.",ines.medic@prayst.hr,"Medić, Ines/G-9723-2017",,,,,,42,0,0,5,9,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,38,46,,,,,,9,"Business; Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BJ8SW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428762800005,0

In recent years, more and more construction design projects adopt new working approaches in which project members work collocated and use structured methods as a way to enable face to face communication, which is known to facilitate knowledge sharing and create a better mutual understanding between multidisciplinary project members. Even though literature discusses these new settings, there are few studies on the role of the project manager while working in such a project space. A project space is defined as consisting of physicality, as well as materialization of power and social relations and experiences within the space. We study the role of the project manager within such a project space from an organizational spatial theoretical perspective. The research is based on three qualitative case studies in which data consisted of 26 semi-structured interviews and 60 hours of observations. From the empirical data, we contribute with a focus in understanding the role of the PM within a project space.

This is an ethnographic research paying attention on stakeholders roles and responsibilities in area development. Background: The urban planning practices as well as assessment methods are dominated by top-down planning theories; the so called system-approach has some disadvantages: large scale, big money and strong power. This model 1.0 cannot not solve problems in case of sharp economic downturn. A bottom-up, organic approach in urban planning, model 2.0 puts more emphasis to planning systems that considers the local needs more and allows greater citizen participation. Such approach has also its difficulties, peculiarities and shortcomings: the selfappointed ambassadors of the neighbourhood are thinking on a very small scale and island scope instead of a holistic view. The research question in this paper is how model Area development 3.0 could work for all the stakeholders and developing especially communication in urban planning? Approach: The central focus of the paper is a presentation of a case study: The Binckhorst (150 ha) the biggest redevelopment inner city area in The Netherlands, in its third biggest city The Hague. The case study includes physical, spatial, social, cultural, and economical perspectives. With the research triangulation, analyses of different data from the transformation of diverse area development models and their strengths and weaknesses are presented.. Results: The result is a tentative model 3.0 of area development: it is not the system approach (top down) neither the bottom up, organic approach but the interference of these two. Model 3.0 is a circular approach and provides a new tool towards a sustainable and climate neutral urban environment. Practical implications: The results can be used for (re) development of existing, mostly inner city, neighbourhoods. Future research need to focus on refining the found criteria in the model and on the adjustability of the mode to the different cultural circumstances.","[van Wezel, Ruud; Kaneworff, Louis] The Hague Univ Appl Sci, The Hague, Netherlands; [Nenonen, Suvi; Niemi, Olli] Tampere Univ Technol, Tampere, Finland",Tampere University,"van Wezel, R (通讯作者)，The Hague Univ Appl Sci, The Hague, Netherlands.",r.h.j.vanwezel@hhs.nl; l.a.kanneworff@kpnmail.nl; suvi.nenonen@tut.fi; olli.niemi@tut.fi,,,,,,,8,1,1,0,5,POLYTEKNISK FORLAG,LYNGBY,"ANKER ENGELUNDS VEJ 1, LYNGBY, 2800, DENMARK",,,978-87-502-1125-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,505,513,,,,,,9,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering,BJ6NU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426878400046,0

This problem becomes more apparent in socially deprived residential areas. Although there has been a vast amount of research on the topics of business models and sustainable housing renovation respectively, there seems to be a lack of research connecting these two together. The aim and objective of this paper is to propose a business model regarding sustainable housing renovation for public housing companies. A literature study together with an interview study with a public housing company in Sweden form the basis for a proposed business model. The model was derived through an iterative process of coding, singling out themes relevant to the notion of business models and business-like approach. The model was thereafter applied and tested on a real-life renovation case. The case consists of a public property containing 1200 apartments, afflicted with severe technical complications as well as socio-economic challenges regarding the tenants and the area as a whole. Findings show that merging sustainability dimensions with traditional business prerequisites, such as profit, is perceived as difficult. Achieving a profitable project while at the same time undertaking a social responsibility towards the current tenants is a balance act. There are however financial profits to be found in the social dimension and the notion of CSR projects was positive, both from a social and economic perspective.

SCOT holds the public client, together with contractors, consultants, educators, etc, form relevant social groups that form the social constriction of BIM. Public client fill a particular important role in the social construction of BIM due to their large influence on the other social groups. A large Swedish public infrastructure client recently implemented BIM with the specific aim of driving industry change, innovation and productivity (SOU 2012: 39, Trafikanalys 2015). This study aimed to understand the role and impact of the public client in the social construction of BIM in the Swedish AEC industry. For this, the sociological explanation for BIM at the public client needed to be understood. The findings showed that there are currently two conflicting sociological explanations for BIM that are being socially promoted at the public client (one accepting the implementation as a means for driving industry change and one rejecting it). These conflicting sociological explanations had two different implications for the public client's role and impact in the social construction of BIM.","[Vass, Susanna] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Real Estate & Construct Management, Stockholm, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology,"Vass, S (通讯作者)，KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Real Estate & Construct Management, Stockholm, Sweden.",susanna.vass@abe.kth.se,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,5,POLYTEKNISK FORLAG,LYNGBY,"ANKER ENGELUNDS VEJ 1, LYNGBY, 2800, DENMARK",,,978-87-502-1125-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,463,473,,,,,,11,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering,BJ6NU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426878400042,0

The following three research questions are answered: Which communication channels are used? Which characteristics do the communication channels have? Which actions can improve the information flow between design and production? Information can disappear in communication between design and production, leading to errors or deficient descriptions for the production. Existing literature does not fully describe how this can be corrected in DBB contracts. The purpose of this paper is to improve information flow between design and production. An expansion project at Oslo Airport is selected as case. This project has been chosen because it is an extensive building project with DBB contracts and complex communication patterns. In order to attain a certain representativeness of the effects from DBB contracts the selected research methods are extensive literature review, document study and semi-structured interviews with 13 workers from respectively design, construction management and production in three of the contracts. The paper presents both the formal and informal communication channels used in the case project and the strengths and weaknesses of these channels. It also presents actions that can improve information flow between design and production. The expansion project at Oslo Airport is the only project investigated. The project is vast, so the paper encompasses only a few of the project's contracts. The complexity of the project might complicate the representativeness. The paper highlights important areas for organizing communication between design and production in a building project. Good information flow between design and production contributes to a lean execution of building projects, both with respect to end value and productivity.","[Gresseth, Frode; Lohne, Jardar; Laedre, Ola; Svalestuen, Fredrik] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Trondheim, Norway; [Svalestuen, Fredrik] Veidekke ASA, Oslo, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Gresseth, F (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Trondheim, Norway.",frode.gresseth@probea.no; jardar.lohne@ntnu.no; ola.ladre@ntnu.no; fredrik.Svalestuen@veidekke.no,"Lohne, Jardar/HGA-4028-2022; Laedre, Ola/AAA-6499-2021","Laedre, Ola/0000-0003-4604-8299",,,,,17,0,0,1,2,POLYTEKNISK FORLAG,LYNGBY,"ANKER ENGELUNDS VEJ 1, LYNGBY, 2800, DENMARK",,,978-87-502-1125-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,163,173,,,,,,11,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering,BJ6NU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426878400015,0

Often responsibility is related to some form of accountability and business ethics to codes of ethics or ethical principles. However, drawing on the work of Emmanuel Levinas one must question these principles and understand responsibility and ethics differently. To Levinas ethics and responsibility stem from the encounter with the other, the ethical approaching of the Other. To him, ethics cannot originate from any general principle but must come before any theme, category, or principle. Therefore, he locates ethics and responsibility beyond any concept. To my understanding trust too belongs to this pre-conceptual realm. As the owner of a medium size construction company, I explore my business environment, in particular, my professional conduct, using auto-ethnography to better understand the relations between trust, ethics, and responsibility and their manifestation in business practice. Levinas' understanding of ethics and responsibility before any concept requires an ultimate epoche. Therefore, all concepts, even the concept of language, must be dismantled. My difficulty is then to name, to describe something which is beyond fixed language. Therefore, my writing needs to be evocative rather than analytic. I try to explore how ethical business practice accounts for the situation and the very way of interacting with business partners. I seek to understand ethics, responsibility, and trust beyond static principles. In that way, I try to show how one can maintain trust as a way of interacting. To maintain trusting relationships, one needs to employ first and foremost an attitude of care and forgiveness. Such an attitude, prior to concepts and principles, helps to deal with the inherent change and volatility in construction projects. This rather adaptive way of approaching trust might be helpful for actors in the industry.","[Grosse, Henning] Univ Gloucestershire, Sch Business, Cheltenham, Glos, England",University of Gloucestershire,"Grosse, H (通讯作者)，Univ Gloucestershire, Sch Business, Cheltenham, Glos, England.",hgrosse@glos.ac.uk,"Grosse, Henning/ABF-4347-2020","Grosse, Henning/0000-0002-2523-0756",,,,,32,0,0,0,0,POLYTEKNISK FORLAG,LYNGBY,"ANKER ENGELUNDS VEJ 1, LYNGBY, 2800, DENMARK",,,978-87-502-1125-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,174,185,,,,,,12,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering,BJ6NU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426878400016,0

Offshore wind energy is however expensive due to the large capital expenses. The construction of an offshore wind farm encounters many challenges throughout its construction processes. Therefore inner sea offshore wind farms receive increasing interest, due to their assumed attractive features of reduced costs of erection and operation. The aim of this paper is to identify the challenges encountered during the installation phase of offshore wind turbines at inner sea conditions, understood as the Baltic Sea region and neighbouring areas. Offshore wind farm installation is conceptualised as a building operation. Consequently, theories on construction management, operations management and strategy, supply chain, building logistics and concepts on offshore wind farm development were used. A qualitative approach using interviews and literature. Out of seven farms in operation in the southern Baltic, Oresund and Kattegat, two were selected. Interviews were conducted with professionals that were involved in installation of Anholt and Lillgrund. The analysis showed that installation challenges can either be due to local natural conditions or technical issues related to equipment, planning, technology and work practices. At Lillgrund challenges were bad weather conditions and breakdown of a vessel, causing a delay of export cable installation and the tight tolerances for the bolts at the tower-foundation interface. At Anholt, a soft seabed necessitated the abandonment of some turbine positions. Irregular supply by the turbine supplier forced the vessel operator to change planning, andit was needed to handle gas leaks from the sea bed. Installation challenges grows as wind turbines are becoming bigger and heavier and locations go further from shore. Developers and contractors must continuously innovate processes and equipment to overcome these challenges.","[Koch, Christian; Baluku, Joseph; Habakurama, Issa Ibrahim] Chalmers Univ Technol, Construct Management, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Mathern, Alexandre] Chalmers Univ Technol, Struct Engn, NCC Sverige AB, Gothenburg, Sweden",Chalmers University of Technology; Chalmers University of Technology,"Koch, C (通讯作者)，Chalmers Univ Technol, Construct Management, Gothenburg, Sweden.",kochch@chalmers.se; jbaluku01@gmail.com; issah@student.chalmers.se,,,,,,,19,4,4,4,8,POLYTEKNISK FORLAG,LYNGBY,"ANKER ENGELUNDS VEJ 1, LYNGBY, 2800, DENMARK",,,978-87-502-1125-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,307,317,,,,,,11,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering,BJ6NU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426878400028,0

During this time, most studies have applied rational and technical perspectives to understand BIM implementation and only a have regarded BIM implementation from more reflective and critical perspectives. There are however those who argue that the large interest in BIM research on the rational and technical perspectives, that often proclaim the impact of BIM for increased productivity and efficiency, has created a hype around the concept.

A key mechanism for achieving such improvements is the articulation and codification of knowledge. This study examines an attempt at codifying knowledge in the form of a set of shared construction guidelines (SCG) employed by 24 large public client organizations in the Municipality of Gothenburg, Sweden. Specifically, these guidelines are viewed with respect to the framework of Zollo and Winter (2002) in terms of how organizations with high task heterogeneity and low task frequency can more effectively develop dynamic capabilities through the deliberate learning mechanism of knowledge codification. Preliminary results indicate that task frequency and organizational size are stronger indicators than heterogeneity in deciding whether a public client organization utilizes knowledge codification systems such as the SCG.","[Adam, Abderisak; Lindahl, Goran] Chalmers Univ Technol, Construct Management, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Leiringer, Roine] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Real Estate & Construct, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Chalmers University of Technology; University of Hong Kong,"Adam, A (通讯作者)，Chalmers Univ Technol, Construct Management, Gothenburg, Sweden.",abderisak.adam@chalmers.se; goran.lindahl@chalmers.se; roine.leiringer@hku.hk,,,,,,,13,1,2,0,2,POLYTEKNISK FORLAG,LYNGBY,"ANKER ENGELUNDS VEJ 1, LYNGBY, 2800, DENMARK",,,978-87-502-1125-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,1,9,,,,,,9,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering,BJ6NU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426878400001,0

The regime has been used at strategic level and it mostly deals with financial aspects of projects. In parallel, unlike QA regime, there are other operational initiatives that focus on non-financial aspects and could possibly enhance quality requirements of construction projects, such as the safety charter and BREEAM-NOR (Building Research Establishment's Environmental Assessment Method in Norway). The researchers wanted to test a proposition of bridging the strategic QA regime (financial) and two operational initiatives (non-financial) introduced in Norwegian construction industry. Combining the three initiatives will potentially help to make better strategic choice of right project and at the same time strengthen operational choice of the right method for project execution. We studied the attributes of QA regime and operational initiatives and use their attributes as input for newly introduced sense and response method to identify the critical ones, so that the QA regime can be expanded to cover more non-financial aspects. Identifying the relationship and the critical level of the attributes could help to link the strategic attributes to the operational ones that in turn helps project stakeholders to make a quality and sustainable project choices. The paper introduces a sense and response method called scaled critical factor index (SCFI). This method helps to identify the critical attributes from the initiatives considered. This method uses both qualitative and quantitative analysis. The paper briefly discusses how the survey is organized, the question formulated, and how the responses are analysed to determine the critical level of the attributes considered. Desk test carried out as an example to clarify the concept of sense and response method.

Yet the model has also been exposed to continual challenges. In a construction sector context, the characteristics of peaceful collaboration, a productivity pact, well skilled and organized labour force, high level of work environment quality and enforcement, are all elements seen on Swedish building sites, and almost as prevalent as in other Swedish industrial sectors. In the recent years the construction sector has however seen an unprecedented influx of companies and work force, and they are contributing to what appears to be another labour market in Swedish construction. The aim of this paper is therefore to study these tendencies of erosion of the Swedish model labour market on a high level, and the emergence of another low level labour market. Theoretically the paper draw on industrial relations labour market studies, and concepts of dual labour markets. Empirically, a macro oriented approach is used, yet involving as much micro knowledge as possible. The study uses a host of sources. To address the low level labour market material such as reports on fatal accidents and police cases is used. The result of the analysis is that the high level labour market in Swedish is still strong. Existing and new institutions serve to maintain and adjust this market. However the low level market is emerging, not only on the private house market, but also at large infrastructure projects, impacted by companies working with lower pay, and worse conditions. Even the main public client are actively encouraging foreign companies to engage, to maintain a market competition on infrastructure. This leads to systematic poorer conditions managed through recruitment companies and other sub suppliers that places the phenomenon at a distance from the main contractor. Another type of intermediaries, union employees with foreign language skills, are a counter tendency. It is discussed whether the Scandinavian model can recast itself, to, not only counter the present developments, but also into a new integrative multicultural model, supporting the foreseen growth in the Scandinavian building sector.","[Koch, Christian] Chalmers Univ Technol, Construct Management, Gothenburg, Sweden",Chalmers University of Technology,"Koch, C (通讯作者)，Chalmers Univ Technol, Construct Management, Gothenburg, Sweden.",kochch@chalmers.se,,,,,,,42,0,0,0,3,POLYTEKNISK FORLAG,LYNGBY,"ANKER ENGELUNDS VEJ 1, LYNGBY, 2800, DENMARK",,,978-87-502-1125-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,285,295,,,,,,11,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering,BJ6NU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426878400026,0

The building industryare interested in, have an appetite for growth and/or at least maintaining their share of the upcoming building projects. The Gothenburg area, with some 1 million inhabitants, are no exception to the above characterization. Numerous plans and developments are flourishing, and in the debate, actors state from 78 to 125 million euros in investments in infrastructure, new public institutions, dwellings and housing etc. The aim of this paper is to generate a forecast for the needed manpower given the planned building activities in the Gothenburg area. And to critically scrutinize the context, the method and the results. The paper's conceptual framework build on approaches to forecasting urban, industrial and labour market developments. The paper describes these different approaches, with different scope and conceptualisation of the dynamics. We take issue with forecasts building on implicit linear prognosis, with their inbuilt modern ideology, and introduce concepts of fragmentation, dispersion and emergence to better account such elements in our forecast. The material for the paper comes from a collaboration with the local industry. Generating the forecast encompasses a host of methodological challenges. Triangulation of other previous investigations were used and these adopted different concepts and scope in time and geographical area. A critique of the value of the gathered material and our own platform will be carried out. Are even this forecast merely an expression of the local industry's taste for growth, which come to represent a candy for them? The result shows a very considerable need for new manpower over the next ten years. Using combined forecasts the calculation reach estimates between 17 and 25,000 new employees per year. A large uncertainty mirroring the shaky basis of the forecast. The contributiondiscuss mitigation strategies which include education, mobilizing refugees, and global sourcing.

Furthermore, it is important to accent that because of opening towards european and world market, where competition is extremely big, encirclement is dynamic and quickly adaptable, it is impossible to survive if management is not prepared to make decison rapidly, with no space for mistakes, because wrong decision can destroy the whole business. In order to make good business decisions, management must be in dispose of correct and well - timed information and data. Key information for management are correct information about costs that are related to certain decision. Because of that, in this paper are analyzed key terms that are related to costs and importance of cost function in business decision making. Furthermore, the hardest and most responsible thing in managing is making decision. Making decision, i.e. capability and readiness for taking responsibility is a characteristic that is typical for only small number of people. Without reliable information about costs and their influence on the price, revenues and quality of products or services, it is not possible to make quality decision. Because of importance of costs in business decision making, so as different possibilites of appliance, depending on activities, there are many number of models of cost management that are developed, and in sequel of this paper there will be more word about them. According to that, in this paper are analyzed basic determinants of costs and importance of cost function in business decision making. Basic framework of this paper is presentation of cost management based on activities that is in function of enlargement of profitability, so as presentation of costs of providing services to buyer and analysis of profitability.","[Sopta, Martina; Slavica, Ante] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Sopta, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia.",msopta@efzg.hr; anteslav@gmail.com,"Sopta, Martina/I-1163-2018","Sopta, Martina/0000-0001-7205-4989",,,,,14,0,0,0,8,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,208,225,,,,,,18,"Business; Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BJ8SW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428762800022,0

To do so, the amount of capital flight in Iran has been measured using World Bank (1985) and Erbe (1985) approach. Then, the Auto Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) procedure has been applied in order to estimate a growth equation.

Yet, relying on direct foreign investments for a long time, the financial market in China is still in the development phase. The crowdfunding financing model, which is rapidly increasing in value in the world for the last couple of years, made a relatively recent appearance, with the first crowdfunding platform appearing in China in 2011. The starting delay was quickly caught up by the galloping growth, as today China is third biggest crowdfunding market in the world, after USA and EU, with incredible potential for growth. The sudden greater access to and wider acceptance of Internet technologies, online financial services and especially smartphones combined with the rise of GDP per capita of the numerous Chinese population created a perfect economic environment for the explosive development of crowdfunding. Yet, the government regulation did not follow the economic developments so readily. The first moves by the government to regulate the market came in 2014, thus benefitting from experiences from other countries. At the end of that year the Securities Association of China released the Measures for Administration of Private Equity Crowdfunding. In March 2015, the General Office of the State Council released the Guiding Opinions on Expanding Maker Space to Promote Innovation and Business Startups by General Public, of which an important part is to conduct the pilot program of Internet-based equity crowdfunding and to promote crowdfunding to better serve innovation and business startups by general public. In December 2015, the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) issued the first draft for online lending, and in August 2016, announced the first official rules. Chinese crowdfunding market today has a perspective to become the largest one in the world, but there are still many challenges to overcome. This paper will analyse the status quo in China and highlight important aspects of this market including comparative analysis with the USA and UK market, and propose regulatory solutions, taking note of the unique aspects of Chinese economy.","[Blace, Matija; Grubisic, Anita] Polytech Sibenik, Shibenik, Croatia",,"Blace, M (通讯作者)，Polytech Sibenik, Shibenik, Croatia.",matijablace@gmail.com; anita@vus.hr,,,,,,,17,2,2,0,8,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,188,196,,,,,,9,"Business; Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BJ8SW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428762800020,0

The experimental trial was established at the Pure Horticultural Research Centre with the aim of studying the influence of legumes on the soil properties in the intercrop with strawberries (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.). Different genotypes were included in the trial as intercrops: two local broad bean (Vicia faba var. major L.) genotypes, two pea (Pissum sativum L.) cultivars and clover (Trifolium hybridum L.). Two control treatments were included in the trial: with and without nitrogen fertilizer usage. Strawberries were planted in May of 2014 and maintained in the field for three years. Results showed that there were significant differences between treatments in soil respiration rate (SRR) and SRR dynamic throughout the experiment time. Dehydrogenase activity had similar results, though no significant differences between treatments were observed in the third year. No significant difference between treatments was found in the soil organic matter.

This paper draws on interviews with employees of a small house building firm, the supplier of the open panel timber-frames, and subcontractors. Foregrounding how particular challenges of taking up off-site methods of construction are resolved turns the attention away from the constraints and/or benefits of taking up off-site methods of construction, to how on-site integration occurs when using off-site methods of construction. The paper develops the concept of liquidity to describe integration in off-site construction whereby house building occurs through collaboration between firms and personal. A range of metaphors develop the concept of liquidity in different ways - it is suggested that eddies of integration provides a unique approach of researching integration in supply-chain partners.","[Green, Martin; Dowsett, Ruth; Sexton, Martin; Harty, Chris] Univ Reading, Sch Construct Management & Engn, Reading, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Green, M (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Sch Construct Management & Engn, Reading, Berks, England.",m.s.green@reading.ac.uk; r.m.dowsett@reading.ac.uk; m.g.sexton@reading.ac.uk; c.f.harty@reading.ac.uk,,,,,,,17,1,1,1,11,POLYTEKNISK FORLAG,LYNGBY,"ANKER ENGELUNDS VEJ 1, LYNGBY, 2800, DENMARK",,,978-87-502-1125-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,152,162,,,,,,11,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering,BJ6NU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426878400014,0

These possibilities could be interpreted as radical, yet they appear at a time as results of a long emergent development. The aim of this paper is to critically scrutinize, theoretically and empirically, whether radical innovation is occurring in sustainable building and what the implication are. The theoretical framework is based on concepts of radical innovation, inventions and sustainability. Radical sustainable innovation (RSI) should be characterized by high degrees of newness in the entire life cycle. RSI should offer significant enhancements of known benefits, entirely new benefits, or substantial cost reductions, leading to the transformation of existing markets, the creation of sustainable growth, and global sustainability. Thus, if buildings were RSI, it would be a shift in paradigm of how buildings are designed, build and used. Serious limitations on these notions are addressed. Buildings are large complex products realised through complex processes and with a long lifecycle. It appears impossible that an entire building should/could be radically new. How to evaluate radicality is a major challenge. It is tentatively proposed, to use standards for sustainable office buildings. Standards are developed to accelerate the sustainable development but has to some extent come to constrain possibilities of radical innovation. As the criteria of newness is incorporated in standards, going beyond them, could be viewed as radical. Empirically a selection of international cases of office buildings with very high scores of BREEAM, LEED and DGNB are examined. Six selected cases were analysed more in detail, one of them, GeelensCounterflow's Headquarters, being the most outstanding. This handful of office buildings have reached remarkable higher level of sustainability than contemporary building regulations.

The ambition of this paper is to address 1) how we can envisage how to develop the reflexive capacity of students of Civil Engineering to undertake critical scrutiny of their own practice and, 2) to what extent are Norwegian civil engineering students are educated to incarnate such a reflexive capacity today. The main basis of the research consists in a content analysis of the formalized guidelines governing the education of Civil Engineers at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). In addition to a scoping literature review, insights from theory on what constitutes a profession and the role of professions in general were used as analytic tools. The findings indicate that limited attention is given to transmitting the understanding of the role the students are to fill in their professional lives. Even less attention is given to actually articulating such an understanding. Particularly interesting, however, is the limited attention given to considerations of a more principal nature concerning the ability to transcend (in a positive manner) the limits within which one normally operates. The research carried out has implications for the organisation of the education of Civil Engineers in general. Equally, it highlights concerns that professional bodies within the field ought to examine in order to carve out a thorough understanding of the role of the Civil Engineer in society today.","[Lohne, Jardar; Drevland, Frode; Asgard, Tina; Hoven, Tore; Laedre, Ola] NTNU, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Trondheim, Norway; [Ryum, Truls] NTNU, Dept Psychol, Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Lohne, J (通讯作者)，NTNU, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Trondheim, Norway.",jardar.lohne@ntnu.no; frode.drevland@ntnu.no; tina.asgard@hvl.no; tore.hoven@ntnu.no; ola.laedre@ntnu.no; truls.ryum@ntnu.no,"Drevland, Frode Olav/AHB-6493-2022; Lohne, Jardar/HGA-4028-2022; Drevland, Frode Olav/ABG-2803-2020; Laedre, Ola/AAA-6499-2021","Drevland, Frode Olav/0000-0002-4596-1564; Drevland, Frode Olav/0000-0002-4596-1564; Laedre, Ola/0000-0003-4604-8299",,,,,23,3,3,0,3,POLYTEKNISK FORLAG,LYNGBY,"ANKER ENGELUNDS VEJ 1, LYNGBY, 2800, DENMARK",,,978-87-502-1125-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,362,374,,,,,,13,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering,BJ6NU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426878400033,0

Current process-aware information systems tend to rely on manually pre-configured static process models and during process enactment exhibit challenges in reacting to unforeseen dynamic changes. This paper presents Microflows, an automatic lightweight declarative approach for the workflow-centric orchestration of semantically-annotated microservices using agent-based clients, graph-based methods, and the lightweight semantic vocabularies JSON-LD and Hydra.

This topic is current in the context of the Rural Development Programme 2007 - 2013 evaluation and search for effective tools for supporting rural areas. The results of research conducted in 2016 among residents and local action groups are presented. Firstly, the LEADER programme had little impact on the possibility of finding work outside the agriculture. Secondly, the realized projects have contributed to the improvement of the quality of life of the residents in rural areas, especially when it comes to meeting the needs of tourism and leisure. The programme was of great importance in underpinning social capital in the countryside, especially its behavioral and bonding dimension. It is very significant taking into account the low level of social capital in rural areas in Poland. An overall level of activity of rural residents and other entities increased, so as the propensity to engage in joint initiatives and the level of trust. The observed effects of the LEADER programme may in the future contribute significantly to the endogenous development of rural areas.","[Wojewodzka-Wiewiorska, Agnieszka] Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Wojewódzka-Wiewiorska, A (通讯作者)，Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Warsaw, Poland.",agnieszka_wojewodzka@sggw.pl,"Wojewódzka-Wiewiórska, Agnieszka/ABF-1113-2021","Wojewodzka-Wiewiorska, Agnieszka/0000-0003-2393-0430",,,,,28,7,7,0,6,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-4031,,,RES RURAL DEV,,,2017,,,,,,,97,103,,10.22616/rrd.23.2017.055,0.0,,,7,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Environmental Sciences; Geography, Physical",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,BJ4WJ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000425532800014,0

We formally demonstrate that existing strategies for detecting selection based on such 'unused characteristics' can lead to incorrect conclusions if the estimated coefficients of interest are driven by different parts of the population. We show that this issue can empirically be accounted for by allowing for heterogeneous parameters. We compare existing approaches by using simulated data with different selection regimes and test for parameter heterogeneity within the data. We further provide empirical evidence about selection into the market for private health insurance in England. Both our simulations, and the findings using real data, suggest that parameter heterogeneity is a relevant issue that can confound the interpretation of standard 'unused characteristics' approaches. Our findings are important for analysing the efficiency of insurance markets. They are of interest to both the insurance industry and policymakers, and should be accounted for when selection based on specific characteristics needs to be detected or the effects of structural changes of insurance policies/markets are to be predicted.

The main theoretical result is that, if the unisex fairness principle is adopted for the unisex premium, the SCR at issuing time of the mixed portfolio calculated with unisex survival probabilities is greater than the sum of the SCRs of the gender-based subportfolios. Numerical results show that for pure endowments the gap between the two is negligible, but for lifetime annuities the gap can be as high as 3-4%. We also analyze some conservative pricing procedures that deviate from the unisex fairness principle, and find that they lead to SCRs that are lower than the sum of the gender-based SCRs because the policyholders are overcharged at issuing time.","[Chen, An] Univ Ulm, Fac Math & Econ, Helmholtzstr 20, D-89069 Ulm, Germany; [Guillen, Montserrat] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econometr, Riskctr IREA, Av Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Vigna, Elena] Univ Torino, Coll Carlo Alberto, Corso Unione Soviet 218 Bis, I-10134 Turin, Italy; [Vigna, Elena] Univ Torino, CeRP, Corso Unione Soviet 218 Bis, I-10134 Turin, Italy",Ulm University; University of Barcelona; Collegio Carlo Alberto; University of Turin; University of Turin,"Vigna, E (通讯作者)，Univ Torino, Coll Carlo Alberto, Corso Unione Soviet 218 Bis, I-10134 Turin, Italy.;Vigna, E (通讯作者)，Univ Torino, CeRP, Corso Unione Soviet 218 Bis, I-10134 Turin, Italy.",an.chen@uni-ulm.de; mguillen@ub.edu; elena.vigna@unito.it,"Guillen, Montserrat/E-1407-2011","Guillen, Montserrat/0000-0002-2644-6268",Spanish Ministry Grant/FEDER [ECO2016-76203-C2-2-P],Spanish Ministry Grant/FEDER,We are indebted to Kristian Buchardt and Paolo De Angelis for very valuable comments that improved the paper.

Understanding the impact of non-adherence on costs is essential to the assessment of the cost effectiveness of interventions in which adherence to treatment is a concern. Objectives We undertook a comprehensive review of the available literature on the impact on costs of non-adherence to antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia. Methods We performed a search on multiple databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and Health Management Information Consortium) for any study reporting the impact of adherence to antipsychotics on costs in patients with schizophrenia up to February 2018. We included trials of behavioural interventions but excluded comparisons of different pharmacological therapies. Studies were included if at least one-third of the study population had schizophrenia and costs were reported. Results Thirty-four publications on 28 studies met the inclusion criteria. Twenty studies reported analyses of administrative databases, primarily Medicaid. Findings on healthcare costs were mixed but suggested that lower pharmacy costs in non-adherent patients may outweigh increased hospitalisation costs where drug costs are relatively high. A few studies published analysis of prospective cohort data, or trials of behavioural interventions intended to influence adherence, mainly in a European setting. Findings were again mixed but indicate that increasing adherence does not reduce overall costs. Conclusions Inference from analysis of administrative data is limited by the risk of selection bias. Inference from trials is limited by small sample sizes. The literature does not consistently support an assumption that non-adherence increases healthcare costs.","[Pennington, Mark; McCrone, Paul] Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, David Goldberg Ctr PO24, Kings Hlth Econ, De Crespigny Pk, London SE5 8AF, England",University of London; King's College London,"Pennington, M (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, David Goldberg Ctr PO24, Kings Hlth Econ, De Crespigny Pk, London SE5 8AF, England.",mark.w.pennington@kcl.ac.uk,"Pennington, Mark/AAS-9946-2020","Pennington, Mark/0000-0002-1392-8700; McCrone, Paul/0000-0001-7001-4502",Janssen-Cilag Ltd.,Janssen-Cilag Ltd.,"This study was funded by Janssen-Cilag Ltd.

The main axiom of our analysis is called mixture aversion, as it captures a dislike of probabilistic mixtures of lotteries. Our representation for mixture-averse preferences can be interpreted as if an individual optimally selects her risk attitude from some feasible set. We describe some useful parametric examples of our representation and provide comparative statics that tightly link decreases in risk aversion to larger sets of feasible risk attitudes. We then present several applications of the model. In an insurance problem, mixture-averse preferences can produce a marginal willingness to pay for insurance coverage that increases in the level of existing coverage. In investment decisions, our model can generate endogenous heterogeneity in equilibrium stock market participation, even when consumers have identical preferences. Finally, we demonstrate that our model can address the Rabin paradox even in the presence of reasonable levels of background risk.","[Sarver, Todd] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27706 USA",Duke University,"Sarver, T (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",todd.sarver@duke.edu,,"Sarver, Todd/0000-0003-1526-1089",,,,,69,8,8,3,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,JUL,2018,86.0,4,,,,,1347,1382,,10.3982/ECTA12687,0.0,,,36,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,GP1BX,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440548700007,0

According to the local monotonicity of conditional survival function, we derive the optimal contract forms in different types of interval. Because the conditional survival function reflects the dependence between background risk and insurable risk, the dependence structure between the two risks plays a critical role in the insured's optimal insurance design. Furthermore, we obtain the optimal insurance forms explicitly under some special dependence structures. It is shown that deductible insurance is optimal and the Mossin's Theorem is still valid when background risk is stochastically increasing in insurable risk, which generalizes the corresponding results in Lu et al. (2012). Moreover, we show that an individual will purchase no insurance when the sum of the two risks is stochastically decreasing in insurable risk. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This analysis is particularly relevant for an insurance company operating under the Solvency II regulation which aims to maximize the expected utility of its shareholders, while at the same time being required to provide its policyholders a minimum guaranteed amount. Using static Lagrangian method, we solve the pointwise utility optimization problem to achieve the global maximum by carefully comparing the local maximizers with the jump point or the boundary. Our theoretical and numerical results show that contrary to a pure Value-at-Risk regulation, an insurance company that operates not only under a Solvency II VaR constraint but additionally has to serve a minimal guarantee admits a comprehensive but not too costly protection, and at the same time displays prudent investment behavior. This result holds for both constant and stochastic volatility settings. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We depart from the classical setting by allowing for (0) to be so high-dimensional that the traditional assumptions (e.g. Donsker properties) that limit complexity of the parameter space for this object break down. To estimate (0), we consider the use of statistical or machine learning (ML) methods, which are particularly well suited to estimation in modern, very high-dimensional cases. ML methods perform well by employing regularization to reduce variance and trading off regularization bias with overfitting in practice. However, both regularization bias and overfitting in estimating (0) cause a heavy bias in estimators of (0) that are obtained by naively plugging ML estimators of (0) into estimating equations for (0). This bias results in the naive estimator failing to be N-1/2 consistent, where N is the sample size. We show that the impact of regularization bias and overfitting on estimation of the parameter of interest (0) can be removed by using two simple, yet critical, ingredients: (1) using Neyman-orthogonal moments/scores that have reduced sensitivity with respect to nuisance parameters to estimate (0); (2) making use of cross-fitting, which provides an efficient form of data-splitting. We call the resulting set of methods double or debiased ML (DML). We verify that DML delivers point estimators that concentrate in an N-1/2-neighbourhood of the true parameter values and are approximately unbiased and normally distributed, which allows construction of valid confidence statements. The generic statistical theory of DML is elementary and simultaneously relies on only weak theoretical requirements, which will admit the use of a broad array of modern ML methods for estimating the nuisance parameters, such as random forests, lasso, ridge, deep neural nets, boosted trees, and various hybrids and ensembles of these methods. We illustrate the general theory by applying it to provide theoretical properties of the following: DML applied to learn the main regression parameter in a partially linear regression model; DML applied to learn the coefficient on an endogenous variable in a partially linear instrumental variables model; DML applied to learn the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect on the treated under unconfoundedness; DML applied to learn the local average treatment effect in an instrumental variables setting. In addition to these theoretical applications, we also illustrate the use of DML in three empirical examples.","[Chernozhukov, Victor; Demirer, Mert; Duflo, Esther; Newey, Whitney] MIT, 50 Mem Dr, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Chetverikov, Denis] Univ Calif Los Angeles, 315 Portola Plaza, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Hansen, Christian] Univ Chicago, 5807 S Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Robins, James] Harvard Univ, 677 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of Chicago; Harvard University,"Chernozhukov, V (通讯作者)，MIT, 50 Mem Dr, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",vchern@mit.edu; chetverikov@econ.ucla.edu; mdemirer@mit.edu; duflo@mit.edu; chansen1@chicagobooth.edu; wnewey@mit.edu; robins@hsph.harvard.edu,,,National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We would like to acknowledge research support from the National Science Foundation.

The proposed method transforms the semi-parametric specification of censored dynamic panel data models into a parametric family of distribution functions of observables without specifying the distribution of the initial condition. Then the censored dynamic panel data models are globally identified under a standard maximum likelihood estimation framework. The identifying assumptions are related to the completeness of the families of known parametric distribution functions corresponding to censored dynamic panel data models. Dynamic tobit models and two-part dynamic regression models satisfy the key assumptions. We propose a sieve maximum likelihood estimator and we investigate the finite sample properties of these sieve-based estimators using Monte Carlo analysis.

Moreover, the point forecasts obtained within the exponential error ACV model are significantly superior to those calculated in other competing structures for which Burr or generalized gamma distributions are specified. The main finding from the analysis of density forecasts is that, in many cases, the linear ACV models with the Burr and generalized gamma distributions provide significantly better density forecasts than the linear ACV model with exponential innovations and the ARMA models in terms of the log-predictive score, calibration and sharpness.","[Huptas, Roman] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Stat, 27 Rakowicka St, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Huptas, R (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Stat, 27 Rakowicka St, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",huptasr@uek.krakow.pl,"HUPTAS, ROMAN/U-8169-2018","HUPTAS, ROMAN/0000-0003-3502-6369","Ministry of Science and Higher Education (MNiSW, Poland) through the Faculty of Management at Cracow University of Economics [142/WZ-KS/09/2016/M/6142, 044/WZ-KS/03/2016/S/6044]","Ministry of Science and Higher Education (MNiSW, Poland) through the Faculty of Management at Cracow University of Economics","This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education (MNiSW, Poland) through the Faculty of Management at Cracow University of Economics [grant number 142/WZ-KS/09/2016/M/6142] and [grant number 044/WZ-KS/03/2016/S/6044].",,44,1,3,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

A 3-year model estimated the costs of lipid-modifying therapy (LMT) and CV events to a hypothetical US health plan of 1 million members, comparing two scenarios-with and without the availability of PCSK9i as add-on therapy to statins. Proportions of patients with uncontrolled LDL-C despite receiving statins, and at risk of CV events, were estimated from real-world data. Total undiscounted annual LMT costs (2017 prices, including PCSK9i costs of $14,563.50), dispensing and healthcare costs, including the costs of CV events, were estimated for all prevalent patients in the target population, based on baseline risk factors. Maximum PCSK9i utilization of 1-5% over 3 years according to risk group (following the same pattern as current ezetimibe use), and 5-10% as a secondary scenario, were assumed. Total healthcare budget impacts per target patient (and per member) per month for years 1, 2 and 3 were $3.62($0.10), $7.22($0.20) and $10.79($0.30), respectively, assuming 1-5% maximum PCSK9i utilization, and $15.81($0.44), $31.52($0.88) and $47.12($1.31), respectively, assuming 5-10% utilization. Results were sensitive to changes in model timeframe, years to maximum PCSK9i utilization and PCSK9i costs. The budget impact of PCSK9i as add-on therapy to statins for patients with hypercholesterolemia is relatively low compared with published estimates for other specialty biologics. Drug cost rebates and discounts are likely to further reduce budget impact.","[Mallya, Usha G.; Koren, Andrew] Sanofi US, Bridgewater, NJ 08807 USA; [Boklage, Susan H.] Regeneron Pharmaceut Inc, 777 Old Saw Mill River Rd, Tarrytown, NY 10591 USA; [Delea, Thomas E.] Policy Anal Inc, Brookline, MA USA; [Mullins, C.

Residential gas services in Japan and the United Kingdom are provided under this price schedule. The discrete/continuous choice approach is used to analyze the demand under decreasing block rate pricing. However, the nonlinearity problem, which has not been examined in previous studies, arises because a consumers budget set (a set of affordable consumption amounts) is nonconvex, and hence, the resulting model includes highly nonlinear functions. To address this problem, we propose a feasible, efficient method of demand estimation on the nonconvex budget. The advantages of our method are as follows: (i) the construction of an Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm with an efficient blanket based on the Hermite-Hadamard integral inequality and the power-mean inequality, (ii) the explicit consideration of the (highly nonlinear) separability condition, which often makes numerical likelihood maximization difficult, and (iii) the introduction of normal disturbance into the discrete/continuous choice model on the nonconvex budget set. The proposed method is applied to estimate the Japanese residential gas demand function and evaluate the effect of price schedule changes as a policy experiment.","[Miyawaki, Koji] Kwansei Gakuin Univ, Sch Econ, Nishinomiya, Hyogo 6628501, Japan; [Omori, Yasuhiro] Univ Tokyo, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan; [Hibiki, Akira] Tohoku Univ, Fac Econ, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan",Kwansei Gakuin University; University of Tokyo; Tohoku University,"Miyawaki, K (通讯作者)，Kwansei Gakuin Univ, Sch Econ, Nishinomiya, Hyogo 6628501, Japan.",miyawaki.koji@kwansei.ac.jp,"Hibiki, Akira/AAE-3851-2019","Hibiki, Akira/0000-0001-5955-492X; Omori, Yasuhiro/0000-0002-7896-6177","Japanese Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, Culture, and Technology [21830115]; [26245028]; [25380325]; [25245035]; [18330039]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [21830115, 26245028, 25245035, 15H01943] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japanese Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, Culture, and Technology(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); ; ; ; ; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work is supported by the Grants-in-Aid grant numbers: 26245028, 25380325, and 25245035 for Scientific Research 18330039 and by the Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (Start-up) 21830115 from the Japanese Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, Culture, and Technology.

Based on this characterization, I establish that a weak notion of present biasimplied, for example, by any hyperbolic or quasi-hyperbolic discountingis sufficient for equilibrium to be unique, stationary, and efficient.

II. The Mixture Transition Distribution model,QUANTITATIVE FINANCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Market microstructure; Price formation; Markov chain; Forecasting ability,ALGORITHM; MARKET; TRADES,"Modelling the impact of the order flow on asset prices is of primary importance to understand the behaviour of financial markets. Part I of this paper reported the remarkable improvements in the description of the price dynamics which can be obtained when one incorporates the impact of past returns on the future order flow. However, impact models presented in Part I consider the order flow as an exogenous process, only characterised by its two-point correlations. This assumption seriously limits the forecasting ability of the model. Here we attempt to model directly the stream of discrete events with a so-called Mixture Transition Distribution (MTD) framework, introduced originally by Raftery [J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B, 1985, 528-539]. We distinguish between price-changing and non price-changing events and combine them with the order sign in order to reduce the order flow dynamics to the dynamics of a four-state discrete random variable. The MTD represents a parsimonious approximation of a full high-order Markov chain. The new approach captures with adequate realism the conditional correlation functions between signed events for both small and large tick stocks and signature plots. From a methodological point of view, constraining the MTD within the class of ergodic Markov models, and exploiting the buy-sell symmetry of the data, we propose a weak restriction on the transition matrices which solves the problem of identifiability of mixture models. In spite of the large number of parameters, this translates into a feasible and robust estimation procedure. Out-of-sample analyses demonstrate that the model does not overfit the data.","[Taranto, Damian Eduardo; Lillo, Fabrizio] Scuola Normale Super Pisa, Piazza Cavalieri 7, I-56126 Pisa, Italy; [Bormetti, Giacomo] Univ Bologna, Dept Math, Piazza Porta San Donato 5, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Bouchaud, Jean-Philippe; Toth, Bence] Capital Fund Management, 23-25 Rue Univ, F-75007 Paris, France",Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa; University of Bologna,"Taranto, DE (通讯作者)，Scuola Normale Super Pisa, Piazza Cavalieri 7, I-56126 Pisa, Italy.",damian.taranto@sns.it,,"Bormetti, Giacomo/0000-0003-3542-2505",,,,,23,7,7,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The Peninsula Technology Assessment Group, commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG), critically reviewed the company's submission. Clinical effectiveness evidence for the company's analysis was derived from an open-label, randomised controlled trial, JGDG. The analysis was based on a partitioned survival model with a time horizon of 25 years, and the perspective was of the UK National Health Service (NHS) and Personal Social Services. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5% per year. Given the available evidence, olaratumab is likely to meet NICE's end-of-life criteria. To improve the cost effectiveness of olaratumab, the company offered a discount through a Commercial Access Agreement (CAA) with the NHS England. When the discount was applied, the mean base-case and probabilistic incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for olaratumab plus doxorubicin versus the standard-of-care doxorubicin were A 46,076 pound and A 47,127 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, respectively; the probability of this treatment being cost effective at the willingness-to-pay threshold of A 50,000 pound per QALY gained, applicable to end-of-life treatments, was 0.54. The respective ICERs from the ERG's analysis were approximately A 60,000 pound/QALY gained, and the probability of the treatment being cost effective was 0.21. In August 2017, the NICE Appraisal Committee recommended olaratumab in combination with doxorubicin for this indication for use via the UK Cancer Drugs Fund under the agreed CAA until further evidence being collected in the ongoing phase III trial-ANNOUNCE-becomes available in December 2020.","[Tikhonova, Irina A.; Jones-Hughes, Tracey; Dunham, James; Warren, Fiona C.; Robinson, Sophie; Hoyle, Martin] Peninsula Technol Assessment Grp PenTAG, Exeter, Devon, England; [Stephens, Peter] Royal Devon & Exeter NHS Fdn Trust, Exeter, Devon, England",University of Exeter; University of Exeter,"Tikhonova, IA (通讯作者)，Peninsula Technol Assessment Grp PenTAG, Exeter, Devon, England.",I.Tikhonova@exeter.ac.uk,"Warren, Fiona/AGE-5194-2022; Robinson, Sophie/IWU-5135-2023","Warren, Fiona/0000-0002-3833-0182; Hoyle, Martin/0000-0001-5593-9777; Tikhonova, Irina/0000-0003-2723-0802; Robinson, Sophie/0000-0003-0463-875X",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme [16/54/11],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme (Project Number 16/54/11).

The Kalman filter is used to construct the state-augmented likelihood function and subsequently to generate forecasts, which are mean and path-corrected. We apply our model to eight daily volatility series constructed from both high-frequency and daily returns. Full sample parameter estimates reveal that random level shifts are present in all series. Genuine long memory is present in most high-frequency measures of volatility, whereas there is little remaining dynamics in the volatility measures constructed using daily returns. From extensive forecast evaluations, we find that our ARFIMA model with random level shifts consistently belongs to the 10% Model Confidence Set across a variety of forecast horizons, asset classes and volatility measures.

GPBMs have been developed to use across different interventions and medical conditions and typically consist of a self-complete patient questionnaire, a health state classification system, and preference weights for all states defined by the classification system. Of the six main GPBMs, the three most frequently used are the Health Utilities Index version 3, the EuroQol 5 dimensions (3 and 5 levels), and the Short Form 6 dimensions. There are considerable differences in GPBMs in terms of the content and size of descriptive systems (i.e. the numbers of dimensions of health and levels of severity within these), the methods of valuation [e.g. time trade-off (TTO), standard gamble (SG)], and the populations (e.g. general population, patients) used to value the health states within the descriptive systems.

Considerations when selecting a measure for use in a clinical trial include practicality, reliability, validity and responsiveness.

Assuming that the insurer only has partial information of the individual claim size, we develop the De Vylder approximation for the insurer's ultimate ruin probability. To fulfill the requirement of De Vylder approximation, the translated gamma approximation is adopted for approximating the received premium and the first three moments of the claim size (after reinsurance) for the insurer. We then derive the optimal retention for the reinsurance arrangement by minimizing the approximated ruin probability. For illustration purpose, some numerical examples are included to show the impact of partial information on the approximated ruin probability as well as the optimal retention. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Although testing for a unit root has been studied extensively in econometrics, the method and asymptotic results developed in this paper are unconventional. Unlike a blind application of existing R packages for implementing the two-step inference procedure in Lee and Carter (1992) to the U.S. mortality rate data, the proposed test rejects the null hypothesis that the mortality index follows from a unit root AR(1) process, which calls for serious attention on using the future mortality projections based on the Lee-Carter model in policy making, pricing annuities and hedging longevity risk.

A practical rank condition is derived to test whether any particular collection of at least [n/2] general linear restrictions on the parameter matrix is sufficient for identification. We then consider extensions to incorporate prior restrictions on the covariance matrix of the disturbances, to identify the covariance matrix itself, and to address identification in models with cointegration.","[Blevins, Jason R.] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Blevins, JR (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, 1945 N High St,410 Arps Hall, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",blevins.141@osu.edu,,,,,,,34,5,5,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

Our objectives were to report the economic evaluation methodology for a cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a UK NHS-delivered public health intervention for children with asthma that was evaluated using CPRD and describe the impact of this methodology on results. CPRD identified eligible patients using predefined asthma diagnostic codes and captured 1-year pre- and post-intervention healthcare contacts (August 2012 to July 2014). Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) 4 months post-intervention were estimated by assigning utility values to exacerbation-related contacts; a systematic review identified these utility values because preference-based outcome measures were not collected. Bootstrapped costs were evaluated 12 months post-intervention, both with 1-year regression-based baseline adjustment (BA) and without BA (observed). Of 12,179 patients recruited, 8190 (intervention 3641; control 4549) were evaluated in the primary analysis, which included patients who received the protocol-defined intervention and for whom CPRD data were available. The intervention's per-patient incremental QALY loss was 0.00017 (bias-corrected and accelerated 95% confidence intervals [BCa 95% CI] -0.00051 to 0.00018) and cost savings were A 14.74 pound (observed; BCa 95% CI -75.86 to 45.19) or A 36.07 pound (BA; BCa 95% CI -77.11 to 9.67), respectively. The probability of cost savings was much higher when accounting for BA versus observed costs due to baseline cost differences between trial arms (96.3 vs. 67.3%, respectively).

Such equilibria in the form of random state-to-action rules are parsimonious in form and easy to execute, as they are both oblivious of past history and blind to other players' present states. Our transient results can be extended to a stationary case, where the finite multi-period games are special discounted stochastic games. In both nonatomic and finite games, players' states influence their payoffs along with actions they take; also, the random evolution of one particular player's state is driven by all players' states as well as actions. The finite games can model diverse situations such as dynamic price competition. But they are notoriously difficult to analyze. Our results thus suggest ways to tackle these problems approximately.","[Yang, Jian] Rutgers State Univ, Sch Business, Dept Management Sci & Informat Syst, Newark, NJ 07102 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University Newark; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Yang, J (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Sch Business, Dept Management Sci & Informat Syst, Newark, NJ 07102 USA.",jyang@business.rutgers.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [CMMI-0854803]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [11371273, 71502015]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was supported in part by National Science Foundation Grant CMMI-0854803, as well as National Natural Science Foundation of China Grants 11371273 and 71502015.",,35,5,5,0,4,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

In this paper, we analytically investigate the effect of portfolio constraints on the TCIE of convex cone-constrained markets. More specifically, we derive semi-analytical expressions for the precommitted efficient mean-variance policy and the minimum-variance signed supermartingale measure (VSSM) and examine their relationship. Our analysis shows that the precommitted discrete-time efficient mean-variance policy satisfies TCIE if and only if the conditional expectation of the density of the VSSM (with respect to the original probability measure) is nonnegative, or once the conditional expectation becomes negative, it remains at the same negative value until the terminal time. Our finding indicates that the TCIE property depends only on the basic market setting, including portfolio constraints. This motivates us to establish a general procedure for constructing TCIE dynamic portfolio selection problems by introducing suitable portfolio constraints.","[Cui, Xiangyu] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Cui, Xiangyu] Minist Educ, Key Lab Math Econ SUFE, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Li, Duan] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Li, Xun] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Chinese University of Hong Kong; Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Li, D (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Syst Engn & Engn Management, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",dli@se.cuhk.edu.hk,"Cui, Xiangyu/J-4419-2016; Li, Duan/E-7985-2011; Li, Xun/K-6344-2014","Li, Duan/0000-0001-9786-6238; Li, Xun/0000-0003-0493-417X","Research Grants Council of Hong Kong [414610, 520412]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71201094]; Shanghai Pujiang Program of China [12PJC051]; Patrick Huen Wing Ming Chair Professorship of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management",Research Grants Council of Hong Kong(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Pujiang Program of China(Shanghai Pujiang Program); Patrick Huen Wing Ming Chair Professorship of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management,"This research was partially supported by the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong under grants 414610 and 520412, the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant 71201094, and the Shanghai Pujiang Program of China under grant 12PJC051.

This result holds irrespective of agents' preferences.

A local linear estimation method is developed to estimate the unknown regression function. The asymptotic results of the resulting estimator at both interior points and boundaries are obtained. The asymptotic distribution is mixed normal, associated with the local time of an OrnsteinUhlenbeck fractional Brownian motion. Furthermore, we study the Nadaraya- Watson estimator and we examine its asymptotic results. As a result, it shares exactly the same asymptotic results as those for the local linear estimator for the zero energy situation. However, for the non- zero energy case, the local linear estimator is superior to the Nadaraya- Watson estimator in terms of optimal convergence rate. We also present a comparison of our results with the conventional results for stationary covariates. Finally, we conduct a Monte Carlo simulation to illustrate the finite sample performance of the proposed estimator.","[Cai, Zongwu] Univ Kansas, Dept Econ, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Cai, Zongwu] Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Cai, Zongwu] Xiamen Univ, Fujian Prov Key Lab Stat Sci, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Jing, Bingyi] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Math, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Kong, Xinbing] Nanjing Audit Univ, Sch Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhi] Univ Macau, Dept Math, Ave Univ, Taipa, Macau, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhi] UMacau Zhuhai Res Inst, 1 Software Rd, Zhuhai Hi Tech Zone 519080, Guangdong, Peoples R China",University of Kansas; Xiamen University; Xiamen University; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; Nanjing Audit University; University of Macau,"Kong, XB (通讯作者)，Nanjing Audit Univ, Sch Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",caiz@ku.edu; majing@ust.hk; kongxblqh@gmail.com; liuzhi@umac.mo,,,"National Nature Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71131008, 71631004]; Hong Kong Research Grants Council [HKUST6019/10P, HKUST6019/12P]; NSFC [11571250, 11401607]; HSSYF of the Chinese Ministry of Education [12YJC910003]; PAPD of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institution; Macau Science and Technology Development Fund [078/2013/A3]","National Nature Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Hong Kong Research Grants Council(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); HSSYF of the Chinese Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education, China); PAPD of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institution; Macau Science and Technology Development Fund","Z.

The variance is decomposed into an unconditional and a conditional component such that the unconditional variance component is allowed to evolve smoothly over time. This nonstationary component is defined as a linear combination of logistic transition functions with time as the transition variable. The appropriate number of transition functions is determined by a sequence of specification tests. For that purpose, a coherent modelling strategy based on statistical inference is presented. It is heavily dependent on Lagrange multiplier type misspecification tests. The tests are easily implemented as they are entirely based on auxiliary regressions. Finite-sample properties of the strategy and tests are examined by simulation. The modelling strategy is illustrated in practice with two real examples: an empirical application to daily exchange rate returns and another one to daily coffee futures returns.","[Amado, Cristina] Univ Minho, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Amado, Cristina] NIPE, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Amado, Cristina; Terasvirta, Timo] Aarhus Univ, CREATES, Aarhus, Denmark",Universidade do Minho; Aarhus University; CREATES,"Amado, C (通讯作者)，Univ Minho, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal.;Amado, C (通讯作者)，NIPE, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal.",camado@eeg.uminho.pt,"Terasvirta, Timo/J-1621-2019; Amado, Cristina/B-9811-2009","Amado, Cristina/0000-0003-2173-7856; Terasvirta, Timo/0000-0002-0947-2114",CREATES - Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series - Danish National Research Foundation [DNRF78]; Danish Council for Independent Research [12-126018]; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the Operational Program Factors of Competitiveness (COMPETE); FCT - Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [PTDC/IIM-FIN/4685/2012]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PTDC/IIM-FIN/4685/2012] Funding Source: FCT,CREATES - Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series - Danish National Research Foundation; Danish Council for Independent Research(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF)); European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the Operational Program Factors of Competitiveness (COMPETE)(European Union (EU)); FCT - Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"This work has been supported by CREATES - Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series (DNRF78), funded by the Danish National Research Foundation.

The aim of this paper is to fill this gap by assessing the consequences of operational risk for a financial firm including reputational losses. Toward this end, we extend current operational risk models by incorporating reputation losses. We propose three different models for reputation risk: a simple deterministic approach, a stochastic model using distributional assumptions, and an extension of the second model by taking into account a firm's ability to deal with reputation events. Our results emphasize that reputational losses can by far exceed the original operational loss and that neglecting reputational losses may lead to a severe underestimation of certain operational risk types and especially fraud events.

Our inferential procedure is based on entropy maximization subject to multidimensional moment conditions and normalization in which the entropy is defined over discretized intervals. The discretization is based on theory or empirically observed quantities. The number of estimated parameters is independent of the discretization so the level of discretization does not change the fundamental level of complexity of our model.

The findings show that knowledge and environmental information plays a critical role in managers' decisions to adopt environmental practices across supply chain management, while the economic crisis seems to negatively affect their intention to implement any environmental practice.","[Nikolaou, Ioannis E.; Zervas, Anastasios] Democritus Univ Thrace, Dept Environm Engn, Xanthi, Greece",Democritus University of Thrace,"Nikolaou, IE (通讯作者)，Democritus Univ Thrace, Dept Environm Engn, Xanthi, Greece.",inikol@env.duth.gr,,,,,,,36,2,2,1,5,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,,978-3-319-33003-7; 978-3-319-33001-3,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,17,33,,10.1007/978-3-319-33003-7_2,0.0,,,17,"Business; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BI0ZU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000405341000002,0

The introduction of a closed-form solution is an innovative aspect of the model we propose. We evaluate the impact of dynamic policyholders' behavior modeling the dependence between interest rates and surrendering (affine dependence) with the assumption that mortality rates are independent of interest rates and surrendering. Finally, using experience-based decrement tables for both surrendering and mortality, we explain the calibration procedure for deriving our model's parameters and report numerical results in terms of best estimate of liabilities for life insurance under Solvency II.

Volatility clustering arises in our model due to speculators' herding behaviour. In case of heightened uncertainty, speculators observe other speculators' actions more closely. Since speculators' trading behaviour then becomes less heterogeneous, the market maker faces a less balanced excess demand and consequently adjusts prices more strongly. Estimating our model using the method of simulated moments reveals that it is able to explain a number of stylized facts of financial markets quite well. Various robustness checks with respect to the model setup reveal that our results are quite stable.","[Schmitt, Noemi; Westerhoff, Frank] Univ Bamberg, Dept Econ, Feldkirchenstr 21, D-96045 Bamberg, Germany",Otto Friedrich University Bamberg,"Westerhoff, F (通讯作者)，Univ Bamberg, Dept Econ, Feldkirchenstr 21, D-96045 Bamberg, Germany.",frank.westerhoff@uni-bamberg.de,"Westerhoff, Frank/F-2933-2015; Westerhoff, Frank/GSN-6357-2022; Westerhoff, Frank/ABG-4984-2021","Westerhoff, Frank/0000-0003-1666-4103; Westerhoff, Frank/0000-0003-1666-4103;",,,,,60,33,35,4,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

In a context where the enforcing authority cannot prevent agents (who seek to reduce their cost shares) from splitting or merging their demands, the cost sharing methods used must make such artifices unprofitable. The paper introduces a family of rules that are immune to these demand manipulations, the pattern methods. Our main result is the characterization of these methods using the above requirement. For each one of these methods, the associated pattern indicates how to combine the technologies in order to meet the agents' demands. Within this family, two rules stand out: the public Aumann-Shapley rule, which never rewards technological cooperation; and the private Aumann-Shapley rule, which always rewards technology providers. Fairness requirements imposing natural bounds (for the technological rent) allow to further differentiate these two rules.","[Bahel, Eric] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Trudeau, Christian] Univ Windsor, Dept Econ, 401 Sunset Ave, Windsor, ON, Canada",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; University of Windsor,"Trudeau, C (通讯作者)，Univ Windsor, Dept Econ, 401 Sunset Ave, Windsor, ON, Canada.",erbahel@vt.edu; trudeauc@uwindsor.ca,,"Trudeau, Christian/0000-0003-4195-4153",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) [435-2014-0140],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),The authors thank Herve Moulin and Yves Sprumont for stimulating conversations.

I prove the existence of an incentive compatible and individually rational mechanism. I solve the designer's problem by using a three-stage game. At Stage 0, the designer designs a mechanism. At Stage 1, candidates participate in the mechanism then a subset of candidates become contestants. Lastly, at Stage 2, information is revealed and the contestants participate in a contest. I show that the optimal size of a contest depends on contestants' types, the cost of the prize to the designer and on the marginal cost that a contestant imposes on the designer. Contrary to models in which an entry fee s access to the contest, the designer can elicit truthful revelations by imposing revelation costs, and in turn is able to select the optimal subset of contestants.","[Mercier, Jean-Francois] Loyola Marymount Univ, Dept Econ, Bellarmine Coll Liberal Arts, 1 LMU Dr, Los Angeles, CA 90045 USA",,"Mercier, JF (通讯作者)，Loyola Marymount Univ, Dept Econ, Bellarmine Coll Liberal Arts, 1 LMU Dr, Los Angeles, CA 90045 USA.",jmercier@lmu.edu,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,5,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

V@R is a quantile-based risk measure and neglects extreme risks in the tail. V@R belongs to the family of distortion risk measures. A serious deficiency of V@R is that firms can hide their total downside risk in corporate networks, unless a consolidated solvency balance sheet is required for each economic scenario. In this case, they can largely reduce their total capital requirements via appropriate transfer agreements within a network structure consisting of sufficiently many entities and thereby circumvent capital regulation. We prove several versions of such a result for general distortion risk measures of V@R-type, explicitly construct suitable allocations of the network portfolio, and finally demonstrate how these findings can be extended beyond distortion risk measures. We also discuss why consolidation requirements cannot completely eliminate this problem. Capital regulation should thus be based on coherent or convex risk measures like average value at risk or expectiles. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We show that comonotonicity cannot be characterized by the properties of the acceptance set alone and heavily depends on the choice of the eligible asset. In fact, in many important cases, comonotonicity is only compatible with risk-free eligible assets. The incompatibility with risky eligible assets is systematic whenever the acceptability criterion is based on Value-at-Risk or any convex distortion risk measure such as Expected Shortfall.

Jumps, in particular exponential Levy and affine models, which exhibit small-maturity exploding smiles, have historically been proposed to remedy this (see Tankov in Pricing and hedging in exponential Levy models: review of recent results.

If a risk measure is evaluated on the estimated mixture instead of the (unknown) true one, then it is important to investigate the committed error. In this paper we study the asymptotic behaviour of estimated risk measures, as the data sample size tends to infinity, in the fashion of large deviations. We obtain large deviation results by applying the contraction principle, and the rate functions are given by a suitable variational formula; explicit expressions are available for mixtures of two models.

First, we demonstrate that microeconomic uncertainty rises sharply during recessions, including during the Great Recession of 2007-2009. Second, we show that uncertainty shocks can generate drops in gross domestic product of around 2.5% in a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with heterogeneous firms. However, we also find that uncertainty shocks need to be supplemented by first-moment shocks to fit consumption over the cycle. So our data and simulations suggest recessions are best modelled as being driven by shocks with a negative first moment and a positive second moment. Finally, we show that increased uncertainty can make first-moment policies, like wage subsidies, temporarily less effective because firms become more cautious in responding to price changes.","[Bloom, Nicholas] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Floetotto, Max] McKinsey & Co Inc, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India; [Jaimovich, Nir] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Zurich, Switzerland; [Saporta-Eksten, Itay] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Econ, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Saporta-Eksten, Itay] UCL, Dept Econ, London, England; [Terry, Stephen J.] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Stanford University; University of Zurich; Tel Aviv University; University of London; University College London; Boston University,"Bloom, N (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",nbloom@stanford.edu; max.floetotto@alumni.stanford.edu; nir.jaimovich@uzh.ch; itaysap@post.tau.ac.il; stephent@bu.edu,"Bloom, Nicholas/Y-2448-2019","Terry, Stephen/0000-0002-7692-2074",,,,,79,411,477,20,225,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,MAY,2018,86.0,3,,,,,1031,1065,,10.3982/ECTA10927,0.0,,,35,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,GI0XJ,,"Green Published, Green Submitted",Y,N,2024-03-10,WOS:000434093400007,0

The condition significantly decreases quality of life and generates a substantial economic burden for healthcare payers, patients and the society in which they live. Some patients require chronic pharmacotherapy, and access to novel biologic drugs might be crucial for long-term remission. The analyses of cost-effectiveness for biologic drugs are necessary to assess their efficiency and provide the best available drugs to patients. Objective Our aim was to collect and assess the quality of economic analyses carried out for biologic agents used in the treatment of UC, as well as to summarize evidence on the drivers of cost-effectiveness and evaluate the transferability and generalizability of conclusions. Methods A systematic database review was conducted using MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry and CRD0. Both authors independently reviewed the identified articles to determine their eligibility for final review. Hand searching of references in collected papers was also performed to find any relevant articles. The reporting quality of economic analyses included was evaluated by two reviewers using the International Society of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement checklist. We reviewed the sensitivity analyses in cost-effectiveness analyses to identify the variables that may have changed the conclusions of the study. Key drivers of cost-effectiveness were selected by identifying uncertain parameters that caused the highest change of the results of the analyses compared with base-case results. Results Of the 576 identified records, 87 were excluded as duplicates and 16 studies were included in the final review; evaluations for Canada, the UK and Poland were mostly performed. The majority of the evaluations revealed were performed for infliximab (approximately 75% of total volume); however, some assessments were also performed for adalimumab (50%) and golimumab (31%). Only three analyses were conducted for vedolizumab, whereas no relevant studies were found for etrolizumab and tofacitinib. The reporting quality of the included economic analyses was assessed as high, with an average score of 21 points per 24 maximum possible (range 14-23 points according to the ISPOR CHEERS statement checklist). In the case of most analyses, quality-adjusted life-years were used as a clinical outcome, and endpoints such as remission, response and mucosal healing were less common. The higher clinical effectiveness (based on response rates) of biological treatment over non-biological treatments was presented in revealed analyses. The incremental cost-utility ratios for biologics, compared with standard care, varied significantly between the studies and ranged from US$36,309 to US$456,979. The lowest value was obtained for infliximab and the highest for the treatment scheme including infliximab 5 mg/kg and infliximab 10 mg/kg + adalimumab. The change of utility weights and clinical parameters had the most significant influence on the results of the analysis; the variable related to surgery was the least sensitive. Conclusions Limited data on the cost-effectiveness of UC therapy were identified. In the majority of studies, the lack of cost-effectiveness was revealed for biologics, which was associated with their high costs. Clinical outcomes are transferable to other countries and could be generalized; however, cost inputs are country-specific and therefore limit the transferability and generalizability of conclusions. The key drivers and variables that showed the greatest effect on the analysis results were utility weights and clinical parameters.","[Stawowczyk, Ewa; Kawalec, Pawe] Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Publ Hlth, Dept Drug Management, Fac Hlth Sci, 20 Grzegorzecka St, PL-31531 Krakow, Poland",Jagiellonian University; Collegium Medicum Jagiellonian University,"Kawalec, P (通讯作者)，Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Publ Hlth, Dept Drug Management, Fac Hlth Sci, 20 Grzegorzecka St, PL-31531 Krakow, Poland.",pawel.kawalec@uj.edu.pl,,"Kawalec, Pawel/0000-0002-0125-0947; Stawowczyk, Ewa/0009-0003-1446-4607",,,,,27,25,27,0,14,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,APR,2018,36.0,4,,,,,419,434,,10.1007/s40273-017-0601-6,0.0,,,16,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,FY5UL,29260508.0,"Green Published, hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426901000005,0

Techniques of fractional cointegration analysis are used to examine the relationship between German and Spanish government bond yields with maturities of two, five, seven and ten years in the period 05 January 2001 to 29 December 2006. Back then (in the good times of the currency union) financial markets did not have to fear exchange rate risk and sovereign credit risk. Thus, the risk premia to be observed were small and driven by liquidity risk. Economic theory suggests that a cointegration vector of (1,-1) between the interest rates can only exist when markets do not expect exchange rate movements and the risk premium is not interest rate sensitive (or practically speaking the sensitivity is low). Given the data set examined here, it is probably no surprise that the interest rates of the two countries are cointegrated and that the cointegration vector of German and Spanish government bond yields with maturities of two, five and seven years seems to be (1,-1). We then have also examined the degree of interest rate sensitivity of the yield spread between Spain and Germany. The differential between the yields of the two countries in all maturity brackets do not react to the level of interest rates in the currency union. This fits perfectly to our results with regard to the cointegration vector.","[Basse, Tobias; Kunze, Frederik] Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozent, Friedrichswall 10, D-30159 Hannover, Germany; [Basse, Tobias] Touro Coll Berlin, Rupenhorn 5, D-14055 Berlin, Germany; [Wegener, Christoph] IPAG Business Sch, 184 Blvd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France; [Wegener, Christoph] Ctr Risk & Insurance, Otto Brenner Str 1, D-30159 Hannover, Germany; [Kunze, Frederik] Univ Goettingen, Chair Econ Policy & SME Res, Fac Econ Sci, Pl Goettinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",IPAG Business School; University of Gottingen,"Basse, T (通讯作者)，Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozent, Friedrichswall 10, D-30159 Hannover, Germany.;Basse, T (通讯作者)，Touro Coll Berlin, Rupenhorn 5, D-14055 Berlin, Germany.",tobias.basse@nordlb.de,"Wegener, Christoph/I-7018-2019","Wegener, Christoph/0000-0002-9508-7131",,,,,39,10,10,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Maximizing the usefulness of extreme forecasts to define an optimized hazard threshold, we indicate a financial extreme occurring within the next day when the hazard probability is greater than the optimized threshold. Both in-sample tests and out-of-sample predictions indicate that these forecasts are more accurate than a benchmark that ignores the predictive signals.

Previous literature assumes that the US market implied volatility index is exogenous to the Korean implied volatility index. Here, we allow for correlations between the US and Korean variables and suggest two types of endogeneity, namely endogeneity in the regressors and in the regime-switching probabilities. The estimation results show that both types of endogeneity are present in the US variables and that the parameter estimates are quite different when endogeneity is considered, indicating a serious endogeneity bias in the parameter estimates. The results of the endogeneity test for the regressors show that the effects of global shocks are often persistent and may last for as long as six periods. Sub-period analyses indicate that the degrees of endogeneity were especially strong during the global financial crisis.","[Song, Wonho] Chung Ang Univ, Sch Econ, 84 Heukseok Ro, Seoul 06974, South Korea; [Ryu, Doojin] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, 25-2 Sungkyunkwan Ro, Seoul 03063, South Korea; [Webb, Robert I.] Univ Virginia, McIntire Sch Commerce, 125 Ruppel Dr, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",Chung Ang University; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); University of Virginia,"Ryu, D (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, 25-2 Sungkyunkwan Ro, Seoul 03063, South Korea.",sharpjin@skku.edu,"Ryu, Doojin/AAZ-3318-2020","Ryu, Doojin/0000-0002-0059-4887; Song, Wonho/0000-0003-3307-5802",Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2017S1A5A2A01025583],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)",This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2017S1A5A2A01025583].,,63,31,31,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The aim of this study was to investigate the costs of research, serving two purposes: (1) estimating research costs for use in VOI analyses; and (2) developing a costing tool to support reviewers of grant proposals in assessing whether the proposed budget is realistic. For granted study proposals from the Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development (ZonMw), type of study, potential cost drivers, proposed budget, and general characteristics were extracted. Regression analysis was conducted in an attempt to generate a 'predicted budget' for certain combinations of cost drivers, for implementation in the costing tool. Of 133 drug-related research grant proposals, 74 were included for complete data extraction. Because an association between cost drivers and budgets was not confirmed, we could not generate a predicted budget based on regression analysis, but only historic reference budgets given certain study characteristics. The costing tool was designed accordingly, i.e. with given selection criteria the tool returns the range of budgets in comparable studies. This range can be used in VOI analysis to estimate whether the expected net benefit of sampling will be positive to decide upon the net value of future research. The absence of association between study characteristics and budgets may indicate inconsistencies in the budgeting or granting process. Nonetheless, the tool generates useful information on historical budgets, and the option to formally relate VOI to budgets. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt at creating such a tool, which can be complemented with new studies being granted, enlarging the underlying database and keeping estimates up to date.","[van Asselt, Thea; Lesman-Leegte, Ivonne; Postma, Maarten; Vemer, Pepijn; Feenstra, Talitha] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Epidemiol, Groningen, Netherlands; [van Asselt, Thea; Postma, Maarten; Vemer, Pepijn] Univ Groningen, Dept Pharm, Groningen, Netherlands; [Ramaekers, Bram; Joore, Manuela] Maastricht Univ, Dept KEMTA, Maastricht Univ Med Ctr, Med Ctr, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Ramos, Isaac Corro] Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Al, Maiwenn] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Hlth Policy & Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Feenstra, Talitha] RIVM, Ctr Nutr Prevent & Hlth Serv, Bilthoven, Netherlands",University of Groningen; University of Groningen; Maastricht University; Maastricht University Medical Centre (MUMC); Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Netherlands National Institute for Public Health & the Environment,"van Asselt, T (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Epidemiol, Groningen, Netherlands.;van Asselt, T (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Dept Pharm, Groningen, Netherlands.",a.d.i.van.asselt@umcg.nl,"Ramos, Isaac Corro/O-6393-2019; Feenstra, Talitha/AAM-3234-2020","Ramos, Isaac Corro/0000-0002-1294-8187; Feenstra, Talitha/0000-0002-5788-0454; Ramaekers, Bram/0000-0001-5785-9228; van Asselt, Antoinette/0000-0001-7705-9906; Postma, Maarten/0000-0002-6306-3653; Joore, Manuela/0000-0002-5649-6768",ZonMw implementation (VIMP) grant [80-82500-98-14005],ZonMw implementation (VIMP) grant,"This research has been funded by an unrestricted ZonMw implementation (VIMP) grant, project number 80-82500-98-14005.",,15,5,5,0,1,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JAN,2018,36.0,1,,,,,105,113,,10.1007/s40273-017-0572-7,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,FT3HN,28933003.0,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000423038300011,0

As preference-based measures provide different values when collected from the same patient, it is important to ensure that all HSUVs used within a single model are obtained from the same instrument where ever possible. When people enter the model without the condition of interest (e.g. primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, screening or vaccination programmes), appropriate age- and gender-adjusted HSUVs from people without the particular condition should be used as the baseline. General population norms may be used as a proxy if the exact condition-specific evidence is not available. Individual discrete health states should be used for serious adverse reactions to treatment and the corresponding HSUVs sourced as normal. Care should be taken to avoid double counting when capturing the effects for both less severe adverse reactions (e.g. itchy skin rash or dry cough) and more severe adverse events (e.g. fatigue in oncology). Transparency in reporting standards for both the justification of the evidence used and any 'adjustments' is important to increase readers' confidence that the evidence used is the most appropriate available.","[Ara, Roberta; Brazier, John] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Regent St, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Zouraq, Ismail Azzabi] Takeda Pharmaceut Int AG, Thurgauerstr 130, CH-8152 Glattpark Opfikon, Zurich, Switzerland","University of Sheffield; Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd; Takeda Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.","Ara, R (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Regent St, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",r.m.ara@sheffield.ac.uk,"brazier, john e/B-1936-2008","Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780",Takeda Pharmaceuticals International AG,Takeda Pharmaceuticals International AG,This study was funded by an unrestricted grant from Takeda Pharmaceuticals International AG.,,27,12,13,0,0,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,DEC,2017,35.0,,,1,,,S77,S88,,10.1007/s40273-017-0550-0,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GO0PY,29052163.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439637400010,0

It is demonstrated that the norms defined by EV@R induce the same Banach spaces, irrespective of the confidence level. Three vector spaces, called the primal, dual, and bidual entropic spaces, corresponding with EV@R are fully studied. It is shown that these spaces equipped with the norms induced by EV@R are Banach spaces. The entropic spaces are then related to the L-p spaces, as well as specific Orlicz hearts and Orlicz spaces. This analysis indicates that the primal and bidual entropic spaces can be used as very flexible model spaces, larger than L-infinity, over which all L-p-based risk measures are well-defined. The dual EV@R norm and corresponding Hahn-Banach functionals are presented in closed form, which are not explicitly known for the Orlicz and Luxemburg norms that are equivalent to the EV@R norm. The duality relationships among the entropic spaces are investigated. The duality results are also used to develop an extended Donsker-Varadhan variational formula, and to explicitly provide the dual and Kusuoka representations of EV@R, as well as the corresponding maximizing densities in both representations. Our results indicate that financial concepts can be successfully used to develop insightful tools for not only the theory of modern risk measurement but also other fields of stochastic analysis and modeling.","[Ahmadi-Javid, Amir] Amirkabir Univ Technol, Dept Ind Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Pichler, Alois] Tech Univ Chemnitz, Fak Math, Chemnitz, Germany",Amirkabir University of Technology; Technische Universitat Chemnitz,"Ahmadi-Javid, A (通讯作者)，Amirkabir Univ Technol, Dept Ind Engn, Tehran, Iran.",ahmadi_javid@aut.ac.ir; alois.pichler@mathematik.tu-chemnitz.de,"Ahmadi-Javid, Amir/M-2363-2015","Ahmadi-Javid, Amir/0000-0002-9132-6887; Pichler, Alois/0000-0001-8876-2429",,,,,44,14,14,0,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1862-9679,1862-9660,,MATH FINANC ECON,Math.

The paper presents an efficient method that parallelizes Bayesian computation using distributed computing on Apache Spark across a cluster of computers. The distributed algorithm dramatically boosts the speed of Bayesian computation and expands the scope of applicability of Bayesian methods in insurance modeling. The empirical analysis applies a Bayesian hierarchical Tweedie model to a big data of 13 million insurance claim records. The distributed algorithm achieves as much as 65 times performance gain over the non-parallel method in this application. The analysis demonstrates that Bayesian methods can be of great value to large-scaled insurance predictive modeling.","[Zhang, Yanwei] Uber Technol, 1455 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94103 USA","Uber Technologies, Inc.","Zhang, YW (通讯作者)，Uber Technol, 1455 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94103 USA.",actuary_zhang@hotmail.com,,,,,,,36,3,4,4,29,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,SEP,2017,47.0,3,,,,,943,961,,10.1017/asb.2017.15,0.0,,,19,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,FE9ZW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000408563000011,0

Two-point ambiguity involves n or 100 - n red cards. We investigate experimentally attitudes towards partial ambiguity and the corresponding compound lotteries in which the possible compositions are drawn with equal objective probabilities. This yields three key findings: distinct attitudes towards the three forms of partial ambiguity, significant association across attitudes towards partial ambiguity and compound risk, and source preference between two-point ambiguity and two-point compound risk.

The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG produced a critical review of the evidence contained within the company's submission to NICE. The evidence, which included a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of degarelix versus leuprorelin, found that degarelix was non-inferior to leuprorelin for reduction of testosterone levels and that degarelix achieved a more rapid suppression of prostate-specific antigen levels and subsequently decreased incidences of testosterone flare associated with luteinising hormone releasing-hormone (LHRH) agonists. However, protection against testosterone flare for the comparators in the clinical trials was not employed in line with UK clinical practice. Further claims surrounding overall survival, cardiovascular adverse events and clinical equivalence of the comparator drugs from six RCTs of degarelix should be regarded with caution because of flaws and inconsistencies in the pooling of trial data to draw conclusions. The cost-effectiveness evidence included a de novo economic model. Based on the ERG's preferred base case, the deterministic incremental cost-effectiveness analysis (ICER) for degarelix versus 3-monthly triptorelin was A 14,798 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Additional scenario analyses undertaken by the ERG resulted in ICERs for degarelix versus 3-monthly triptorelin ranging from A 17,067 pound to A 35,589 pound per QALY gained. Subgroup analyses undertaken using the Appraisal Committee's preferred assumptions suggested that degarelix was not cost effective for the subgroup with metastatic disease but could be cost effective for the subgroup with spinal metastases. The company submitted further evidence to NICE following an initial negative Appraisal Committee decision. Further analyses from the Decision Support Unit found that that, whilst some evidence indicated that degarelix could be cost effective for a small subgroup of people with spinal cord compression (SCC), data on the potential size of this subgroup and the rate of SCC were insufficient to estimate an ICER based on the evidence submitted by the company and a separately commissioned systematic review. NICE recommended degarelix as an option for treating advanced hormone-dependent prostate cancer in people with spinal metastases, only if the commissioner can achieve at least the same discounted drug cost as that available to the UK NHS in June 2016.","[Uttley, Lesley; Whyte, Sophie; Gomersall, Timothy; Ren, Shijie; Wong, Ruth; Chambers, Duncan; Tappenden, Paul] Univ Sheffield, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Uttley, L (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",l.uttley@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Uttley, Lesley/0000-0003-4603-9069; Ren, Shijie/0000-0003-3568-7124; Chambers, Duncan/0000-0002-0154-0469",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme [12/64/01],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme (project number 12/64/01).

The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG produced a critical review of the evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of the technology based upon the company's submission to NICE. Clinical evidence for cabazitaxel was derived from a multinational randomised open-label phase III trial (TROPIC) of cabazitaxel plus prednisone or prednisolone compared with mitoxantrone plus prednisone or prednisolone, which was assumed to represent best supportive care. The NICE final scope identified a further three comparators: abiraterone in combination with prednisone or prednisolone; enzalutamide; and radium-223 dichloride for the subgroup of people with bone metastasis only (no visceral metastasis). The company did not consider radium-223 dichloride to be a relevant comparator. Neither abiraterone nor enzalutamide has been directly compared in a trial with cabazitaxel. Instead, clinical evidence was synthesised within a network meta-analysis (NMA). Results from TROPIC showed that cabazitaxel was associated with a statistically significant improvement in both overall survival and progression-free survival compared with mitoxantrone. Results from a random-effects NMA, as conducted by the company and updated by the ERG, indicated that there was no statistically significant difference between the three active treatments for both overall survival and progression-free survival. Utility data were not collected as part of the TROPIC trial, and were instead taken from the company's UK early access programme. Evidence on resource use came from the TROPIC trial, supplemented by both expert clinical opinion and a UK clinical audit. List prices were used for mitoxantrone, abiraterone and enzalutamide as directed by NICE, although commercial in-confidence patient-access schemes (PASs) are in place for abiraterone and enzalutamide. The confidential PAS was used for cabazitaxel. Sequential use of the advanced hormonal therapies (abiraterone and enzalutamide) does not usually occur in clinical practice in the UK. Hence, cabazitaxel could be used within two pathways of care: either when an advanced hormonal therapy was used pre-docetaxel, or when one was used post-docetaxel. The company believed that the former pathway was more likely to represent standard National Health Service (NHS) practice, and so their main comparison was between cabazitaxel and mitoxantrone, with effectiveness data from the TROPIC trial. Results of the company's updated cost-effectiveness analysis estimated a probabilistic incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of A 45,982 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, which the committee considered to be the most plausible value for this comparison. Cabazitaxel was estimated to be both cheaper and more effective than abiraterone. Cabazitaxel was estimated to be cheaper but less effective than enzalutamide, resulting in an ICER of A 212,038 pound per QALY gained for enzalutamide compared with cabazitaxel. The ERG noted that radium-223 is a valid comparator (for the indicated sub-group), and that it may be used in either of the two care pathways. Hence, its exclusion leads to uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness results. In addition, the company assumed that there would be no drug wastage when cabazitaxel was used, with cost-effectiveness results being sensitive to this assumption: modelling drug wastage increased the ICER comparing cabazitaxel with mitoxantrone to over A 55,000 pound per QALY gained. The ERG updated the company's NMA and used a random effects model to perform a fully incremental analysis between cabazitaxel, abiraterone, enzalutamide and best supportive care using PASs for abiraterone and enzalutamide. Results showed that both cabazitaxel and abiraterone were extendedly dominated by the combination of best supportive care and enzalutamide. Preliminary guidance from the committee, which included wastage of cabazitaxel, did not recommend its use. In response, the company provided both a further discount to the confidential PAS for cabazitaxel and confirmation from NHS England that it is appropriate to supply and purchase cabazitaxel in pre-prepared intravenous-infusion bags, which would remove the cost of drug wastage. As a result, the committee recommended use of cabazitaxel as a treatment option in people with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 whose disease had progressed during or after treatment with at least 225 mg/m(2) of docetaxel, as long as it was provided at the discount agreed in the PAS and purchased in either pre-prepared intravenous-infusion bags or in vials at a reduced price to reflect the average per-patient drug wastage.","[Kearns, Benjamin; Pandor, Abdullah; Stevenson, Matt; Hamilton, Jean; Chambers, Duncan; Clowes, Mark] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Graham, John] Taunton & Somerset NHS Fdn Trust, Taunton, Somerset, England; [Kumar, M.

Both the investment criterion and the optimal strategy are characterized by the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation on a semi-infinite time interval. In the case where this equation can be linearized, the problem reduces to a time-reversed parabolic equation, which cannot be analyzed via the standard methods of partial differential equations. Under the additional uniform ellipticity condition, we make use of the available description of all minimal solutions to such equations, along with some basic facts from potential theory and convex analysis, to obtain an explicit integral representation of all positive solutions.

One approach is the formal elicitation and use of patient preferences for weighing clinical outcomes. The aim of this study was to demonstrate how patient preferences can be used to weigh clinical outcomes when both preferences and clinical outcomes are uncertain by applying a probabilistic value-based multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) method. Probability distributions were used to model random variation and parameter uncertainty in preferences, and parameter uncertainty in clinical outcomes. The posterior value distributions and rank probabilities for each treatment were obtained using Monte-Carlo simulations. The probability of achieving the first rank is the probability that a treatment represents the highest value to patients. We illustrated our methodology for a simplified case on six HIV treatments. Preferences were modeled with normal distributions and clinical outcomes were modeled with beta distributions. The treatment value distributions showed the rank order of treatments according to patients and illustrate the remaining decision uncertainty. This study demonstrated how patient preference data can be used to weigh clinical evidence using MCDA. The model takes into account uncertainty in preferences and clinical outcomes. The model can support decision makers during the aggregation step of the MCDA process and provides a first step toward preference-based personalized medicine, yet requires further testing regarding its appropriate use in real-world settings.","[Broekhuizen, Henk; IJzerman, Maarten J.; Groothuis-Oudshoorn, Catharina G.

The main results of this work are: developed heuristic approaches for the prospect theory model proposed by Kahneman and Tversky in 1979 as well as an empirical comparative analysis of this model and the index tracking model. The crucial assumption is that behavioural features of the prospect theory model provide better downside protection than traditional approaches to the portfolio selection problem. In this research the large-scale computational results for the prospect theory model have been obtained for real financial market data with up to 225 assets. Previously, as far as we are aware, only small laboratory tests (2-3 artificial assets) have been presented in the literature. In order to investigate empirically the performance of the behaviourally based model, a differential evolution algorithm and a genetic algorithm which are capable of dealing with a large universe of assets have been developed. Specific breeding and mutation, as well as normalization, have been implemented in the algorithms. A tabulated comparative analysis of the algorithms' parameter choice is presented. The prospect theory model with the reference point being the index is compared to the index tracking model. A cardinality constraint has been implemented to the basic index tracking and the prospect theory models. The portfolio diversification benefit has been found. The aggressive behaviour in terms of returns of the prospect theory model with the reference point being the index leads to better performance of this model in a bullish market. However, it performed worse in a bearish market than the index tracking model. A tabulated comparative analysis of the performance of the two studied models is provided in this paper for in-sample and out-of-sample tests. The performance of the studied models has been tested out-of-sample in different conditions using simulation of the distribution of a growing market and simulation of the t-distribution with fat tails which characterises the dynamics of a decreasing or crisis market.","[Grishina, N.; Lucas, C.

Reduced competition may increase the premiums charged by insurers and their payments made to hospitals. However, it may also strengthen insurers' bargaining leverage when negotiating with hospitals, thereby generating offsetting cost decreases. To understand and measure this trade-off, we estimate a model of employer-insurer and hospital-insurer bargaining over premiums and reimbursements, household demand for insurance, and individual demand for hospitals using detailed California admissions, claims, and enrollment data. We simulate the removal of both large and small insurers from consumers' choice sets. Although consumer welfare decreases and premiums typically increase, we find that premiums can fall upon the removal of a small insurer if an employer imposes effective premium constraints through negotiations with the remaining insurers. We also document substantial heterogeneity in hospital price adjustments upon the removal of an insurer, with renegotiated price increases and decreases of as much as 10% across markets.","[Ho, Kate] Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Ho, Kate; Lee, Robin S.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Lee, Robin S.] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Columbia University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University,"Ho, K (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10027 USA.;Ho, K (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",kh2214@columbia.edu; robinlee@fas.harvard.edu,,,NYU Stern Center for Global Economy and Business,NYU Stern Center for Global Economy and Business,"This paper replaces an earlier working paper titled Insurer Competition and Negotiated Hospital Prices.

The Peninsula Technology Assessment Group was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG produced a critical review of the evidence contained within the company's submission to NICE. The clinical effectiveness data used in the company's economic analysis were derived from a single randomised controlled trial, AZA-AML-001. It was an international, multicentre, controlled, phase III study with an open-label, parallel-group design conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of azacitidine against a conventional care regimen (CCR). The CCR was a composite comparator of acute myeloid leukaemia treatments currently available in the National Health Service: intensive chemotherapy followed by best supportive care (BSC) upon disease relapse or progression, non-intensive chemotherapy followed by BSC and BSC only. In AZA-AML-001, the primary endpoint was overall survival. Azacitidine appeared to be superior to the CCR, with median overall survival of 10.4 and 6.5 months, respectively. However, in the intention-to-treat analysis, the survival advantage associated with azacitidine was not statistically significant. The company submitted a de novo economic evaluation based on a partitioned survival model with four health states: Remission, Non-remission, Relapse/Progressive disease and Death. The model time horizon was 10 years. The perspective was the National Health Service and Personal Social Services. Costs and health effects were discounted at the rate of 3.5 % per year. The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of azacitidine compared with the CCR was A 20,648 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the mean ICER was A 17,423 pound per QALY. At the willingness-to-pay of A 20,000 pound, A 30,000 pound and A 50,000 pound per QALY, the probability of azacitidine being cost effective was 0.699, 0.908 and 0.996, respectively. The ERG identified a number of errors in Celgene's model and concluded that the results of the company's economic evaluation could not be considered robust. After amendments to Celgene's model, the base-case ICER was A 273,308 pound per QALY gained. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the mean ICER was A 277,123 pound per QALY. At a willingness-to-pay of A 100,000 pound per QALY, the probability of azacitidine being cost effective was less than 5 %. In all exploratory analyses conducted by the ERG, the ICER exceeded the NICE's cost-effectiveness threshold range of A 20,000-30,000 pound per QALY. Given the evidence provided in the submission, azacitidine did not fulfil NICE's end-of-life criteria. After considering the analyses performed by the ERG and submissions from clinician and patient experts, the NICE Appraisal Committee did not recommend azacitidine for this indication.","[Tikhonova, Irina A.; Hoyle, Martin W.; Snowsill, Tristan M.; Cooper, Chris; Varley-Campbell, Joanna L.; Mota, Ruben E.

When the correlation becomes strong, Kramer (1985, Journal of Econometrics 28, 363-370.) (for the Durbin-Watson test) and Kramer (2005, Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference, 128, 489-496) (for the Cliff-Ord test) have shown that power can be very low, in fact can converge to zero, under certain circumstances. Motivated by these results, Martellosio (2010, Econometric Theory, 26, 152-186) set out to build a general theory that would explain these findings. Unfortunately, Martellosio (2010) does not achieve this goal, as a substantial portion of his results and proofs suffer from nontrivial flaws. The present paper now builds a theory as envisioned in Martellosio (2010) in an even more general framework, covering general invariant tests of a hypothesis on the disturbance covariance matrix in a linear regression model. The general results are then specialized to testing for spatial correlation and to autocorrelation testing in time series regression models. We also characterize the situation where the null and the alternative hypothesis are indistinguishable by invariant tests.","[Preinerstorfer, David; Poetscher, Benedikt M.] Univ Vienna, Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Preinerstorfer, D (通讯作者)，Univ Vienna, Dept Stat, Oskar Morgenstern Pl 1, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",david.preinerstorfer@univie.ac.at,,,,,,,30,3,4,0,13,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

Daouia and Simar (2007) used nonstandard conditional quantiles to address this problem, conditioning on Yy (Xx) in the output (input) orientation, but the resulting quantiles depend on the a priori chosen direction. This article uses a dimensionless transformation of the (p+q)-dimensional production process to develop an alternative formulation of distance from a realization of (X, Y) to the efficient support boundary, motivating a new, unconditional quantile frontier lying inside the joint support of (X, Y), but near the full, efficient frontier. The interpretation is analogous to univariate quantiles and corrects some of the disappointing properties of the conditional quantile-based approach. By contrast with the latter, our approach determines a unique partial-quantile frontier independent of the chosen orientation (input, output, hyperbolic, or directional distance). We prove that both the resulting efficiency score and its estimator share desirable monotonicity properties. Simple arguments from extreme-value theory are used to derive the asymptotic distributional properties of the corresponding empirical efficiency scores (both full and partial). The usefulness of the quantile-type estimator is shown from an infinitesimal and global robustness theory viewpoints via a comparison with the previous conditional quantile-based approach. A diagnostic tool is developed to find the appropriate quantile-order; in the literature to date, this trimming order has been fixed a priori. The methodology is used to analyze the performance of U.S. credit unions, where outliers are likely to affect traditional approaches.","[Daouia, Abdelaati] Toulouse Sch Econ GREMAQ, Toulouse, France; [Simar, Leopold] Univ Cathol Louvain Neuve, Inst Stat Biostat & Sci Actuaielles, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Wilson, Paul W.] Clemson Univ, Dept Econ, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Wilson, Paul W.] Clemson Univ, Sch Comp, Clemson, SC 29634 USA",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Clemson University; Clemson University,"Wilson, PW (通讯作者)，Clemson Univ, Dept Econ, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.;Wilson, PW (通讯作者)，Clemson Univ, Sch Comp, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",pww@clemson.edu,,,IAP Research Network P7/06 of the Belgian State (Belgian Science Policy; U.S. National Science Foundation [SMA-1243436]; Cyber Infrastructure Technology Integration group at Clemson University,IAP Research Network P7/06 of the Belgian State (Belgian Science Policy; U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Cyber Infrastructure Technology Integration group at Clemson University,"Research support from IAP Research Network P7/06 of the Belgian State (Belgian Science Policy, from U.S. National Science Foundation (grant no.

On the other hand, co-evolution information of multiple residues is useful to study protein structures and functions. Therefore, there is an urgent requirement for methods to identify multiple co-evolved residues. The n-dimensional Mutual Information (n DMI) method is introduced to identify co-evolution of multiple residues. This algorithm gains the co-evolution information of multiple residues from analysis of a matrix of MI values. The method was applied to G proteins. Results show that n DMI method is effective in identification of multiple co-evolved amino acids. Moreover, n DMI performs better in discovering functional important residues than methods focusing on pairwise co-evolved residues.","[Gao, Hongyun; Chen, Shuang; Li, Dan] Dalian Univ, Coll Informat & Engn, Dalian 116622, Peoples R China; [Yu, Xiaoqing] Shanghai Inst Technol, Dept Appl Math, Shanghai 201418, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Xiaolei] Anhui Univ, Sch Life Sci, Hefei 230601, Anhui, Peoples R China",Dalian University; Shanghai Institute of Technology; Anhui University,"Gao, HY (通讯作者)，Dalian Univ, Coll Informat & Engn, Dalian 116622, Peoples R China.",gaohongyun@dlu.edu.cn; xqyu@sit.edu.cn; chenshuang0707@163.com; 279675738@qq.com; xlzhu_mdl@hotmail.com,"Zhu, Xiaolei/AIA-5746-2022; Yu, Xiaoqing/E-2388-2013","Zhu, Xiaolei/0000-0002-1967-2806;","Natural Science Foundation of China [11626051, 11626052, 11501074, 21403002]; Doctoral Fund of Liaoning Province [201601296]",Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Doctoral Fund of Liaoning Province,"This paper is partially supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (11626051, 11626052, 11501074, 21403002), and the Doctoral Fund of Liaoning Province (201601296).",,11,5,5,0,0,FRANCIS ACAD PRESS,LONDON,"35 IVOR PL, LOWER GROUND, LONDON, NW1 6EA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-912407-15-6,,,,2017,,,,,,,35,39,,,,,,5,"Business, Finance; Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BJ8CU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427983100008,0

The test has power against general forms of nonlinearity in the jump dependence as well as temporal instabilities. We further propose an efficient estimator for the linear jump regression model that is formed by optimally weighting the detected jumps with weights based on the diffusive volatility around the jump times. We derive the asymptotic limit of the estimator, a semiparametric lower efficiency bound for the linear jump regression, and show that our estimator attains the latter.

This paper proposes the construction of financial cycle measures for the US based on a large data set of macroeconomic and financial variables. More specifically, we estimate three synthetic financial cycle components that account for the majority of the variation in the data set using a dynamic factor model. We investigate whether these financial cycle components have significant predictive power for economic activity, inflation and short-term interest rates by means of Granger causality tests in a factor-augmented VAR set-up. Further, we analyze whether the synthetic financial cycle components have significant forecasting power for the prediction of economic recessions using dynamic probit models. Our main findings indicate that all financial cycle measures improve the quality of recession forecasts significantly. In particular, the factor related to financial market participants' uncertainty and risk aversion-related to Rey's (2013) global financial cycle-seems to serve as an appropriate early warning indicator for policymakers.","[Menden, Christian; Proano, Christian R.] Univ Bamberg, Bamberg, Germany",Otto Friedrich University Bamberg,"Menden, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bamberg, Bamberg, Germany.",christian.menden@uni-bamberg.de,,"Proano, Christian/0000-0002-5148-7635",,,,,42,8,8,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

For such portfolio structures, plausibly arising in the context of reinsurance, he defines a distortion-type risk measure that facilitates assessment of ceded and net losses with reference to gross portfolio outcomes. Subsequently, Major (2018) derives explicit formulas for Euler allocations for this risk measure, thus (sub-)allocating ceded losses to the portfolio's original components. In this comment, we build on Major's (2018) insights but take a somewhat different direction, to consider Euler capital allocations for distortion risk measures directly applied to homogeneous portfolios.

A recent large randomized controlled trial compared the novel compound sacubitril/valsartan (LCZ696) with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril and found a 16% reduction in mortalityhazard. In Germany, sacubitril/valsartan was launched at the beginning of 2016.ObjectiveThe purpose of this study was to conduct a posthoc analysis of the cost effectiveness, budget impact, and disease burden reduction of sacubitril/valsartan compared with ACE inhibitors for patients with heart failure from the perspective of the German social health insurance (SHI), based on the results of this trial.MethodsA Markov (cohort) state transition model was constructed to simulate treatment over a remaining lifetime. Based on the Markov model, a dynamic population model was developed that projects the incidence, prevalence, mortality, and healthcare costs of heart failure in the SHI population from 2017 to 2060. The population model follows prevalent and incident cohorts over time. Each year a new cohort is added, while the existing cohorts age by 1year or die. To test for sensitivity of results, a Monte Carlo simulation was run.ResultsBased on the price negotiated between manufacturer and representatives of the SHI, the base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of sacubitril/valsartan versus ACE inhibitors is Euro23,401 per life-year gained (in 2018 Euros). At a price of zero, the cost-effectiveness ratio is already Euro9594 per life-year gained due to high background costs of heart failure. Annual budget impact and reduction of disease burden reach a maximum at 4-8years after launch (Euro221 million and 2.9%, respectively, in the base case).ConclusionsThe ICER of sacubitril/valsartan is projected to be at or below the level of other accepted interventions for the treatment of asymptomatic to severe heart failure in Germany. Projected budget impact leads to an increase in SHI expenditures by<0.04% per year.","[Gandjour, Afschin] Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Adickesallee 32-34, D-60322 Frankfurt, Germany; [Ostwald, Dennis A.] WifOR, Darmstadt, Germany",Frankfurt School Finance & Management,"Gandjour, A (通讯作者)，Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Adickesallee 32-34, D-60322 Frankfurt, Germany.",a.gandjour@fs.de,"Gandjour, Afschin/I-8963-2019",,Novartis Deutschland GmbH,Novartis Deutschland GmbH,This study was funded by Novartis Deutschland GmbH.,,45,22,24,0,6,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,OCT,2018,36.0,10,,,,,1285,1296,,10.1007/s40273-018-0688-4,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GS9AR,30054868.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000444007800010,0

We show that the Bermudan price is maximized when this continuation value is estimated near the exercise boundary, which is equivalent to implicitly estimating the optimal exercise boundary by using the value-matching condition. Localization is the key difference with respect to global regression methods, but is fundamental for optimal exercise decisions and requires estimation of the continuation value by iterating local least-squares (because we estimate and localize the exercise boundary at the same time). In the numerical example, in agreement with this optimality, the new prices or lower bounds (i) improve upon the prices reported by other methods and (ii) are very close to the associated dual upper bounds.

Objective The objective of this study was to develop a risk engine with multiple risk equations using a recent patient cohort with type 2 diabetes mellitus reflective of the US population. Methods A total of 17 risk equations for predicting diabetes-related microvascular and macrovascular events, hypoglycemia, mortality, and progression of diabetes risk factors were estimated using the data from the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial (n = 10,251). Internal and external validation processes were used to assess performance of the Building, Relating, Assessing, and Validating Outcomes (BRAVO) risk engine. One-way sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the impact of risk factors on mortality at the population level. Results The BRAVO risk engine added several risk factors including severe hypoglycemia and common US racial/ethnicity categories compared with the UKPDS risk engine. The BRAVO risk engine also modeled mortality escalation associated with intensive glycemic control (i.e., glycosylated hemoglobin < 6.5%). External validation showed a good prediction power on 28 endpoints observed from other clinical trials (slope = 1.071, R-2 = 0.86). Conclusion The BRAVO risk engine for the US diabetes cohort provides an alternative to the UKPDS risk engine. It can be applied to assist clinical and policy decision making such as cost-effective resource allocation in USA.","[Shao, Hui; Stoecker, Charles; Liu, Shuqian; Shi, Lizheng] Tulane Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth Management & Policy, 1440 Canal St,Suite 1900, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA; [Fonseca, Vivian] Tulane Univ, Sch Med, 1430 Tulane Ave, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA",Tulane University; Tulane University,"Shi, LZ (通讯作者)，Tulane Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth Management & Policy, 1440 Canal St,Suite 1900, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA.",lshi1@tulane.edu,,,,,,,40,55,55,0,8,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,SEP,2018,36.0,9,,,,,1125,1134,,10.1007/s40273-018-0662-1,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GO4QV,29725871.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439998500009,0

Sums of Echess positions, played on different boards, span an unusually wide range of topics in combinatorial game theory. We find many interesting examples.","[Berlekamp, Elwyn] Elwyn & Jennifer Berlekamp Fdn, 5665 Coll Ave,Suite 330B, Oakland, CA 94618 USA; [Low, Richard M.] San Jose State Univ, Dept Math, San Jose, CA 95192 USA",California State University System; San Jose State University,"Low, RM (通讯作者)，San Jose State Univ, Dept Math, San Jose, CA 95192 USA.",berlek@gmail.com; richard.low@sjsu.edu,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,5,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

The pension fund is invested in both a risk-free asset and a risky asset. In particular, stochastic salary rates and the correlation between salary movements and financial market fluctuations are considered. Using the stochastic optimal control approach, we derive closed-form solutions for optimal investment strategies as well as optimal benefit payment adjustments, which minimize the combination of benefit risk (in terms of deviating from the target) and intergenerational transfers. Numerical analysis is presented to illustrate the sensitivity of the optimal strategies to parameters of the financial market and salary rates. We also consider how the optimal benefit changes with respect to different target levels. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Objective The purpose of this study is to present the newly developed French National Authority for Health (HAS) guidelines on budget impact analysis as follows: process, literature review, recommendations and comparisons with other guidelines. Methods The development process of the HAS guidelines included a literature review (search dates: January 2000 to June 2016), a retrospective investigation of BIA previously submitted to HAS, a public consultation, international expert reviews and approval from the HAS Board and the Economic and Public Health Evaluation Committee of HAS. Results Documents identified in the literature review included 12 national guidelines, 5 recommendations for good practices developed by national and international society of health economics and 14 methodological publications including recommendations for conducting BIA. Based on its research findings, HAS developed its first BIA guidelines, which include recommendations on the following topics: BIA definition, perspective, populations, time horizon, compared scenarios, budget impact models, costing, discounting, choice of clinical data, reporting of results and uncertainty exploration. Conclusion It is expected that the HAS BIA guidelines will enhance the usefulness, quality and transparency of BIA submitted by drug manufacturers to HAS. BIA is becoming an essential part of a comprehensive economic assessment of healthcare interventions in France, which also includes cost-effectiveness analysis and equity of access to healthcare.","[Ghabri, Salah; Autin, Erwan; Poullie, Anne-Isabelle] HAS, French Natl Author Hlth, Dept Econ & Publ Hlth Evaluat, 5 Ave Stade France, F-93218 La Plaine St Denis, France; [Josselin, Jean Michel] Univ Rennes 1, Fac Econ, CREM CNRS, F-35065 Rennes, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Rennes,"Ghabri, S (通讯作者)，HAS, French Natl Author Hlth, Dept Econ & Publ Hlth Evaluat, 5 Ave Stade France, F-93218 La Plaine St Denis, France.",s.ghabri@has-sante.fr,,,,,,,51,14,14,0,3,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,APR,2018,36.0,4,,,,,407,417,,10.1007/s40273-017-0602-5,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,FY5UL,29247437.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426901000004,0

Previous literature argues that the allocation of the portfolio measure to the financial derivative should take the usual special-case form of Aumann-Shapley, being a distortion weighted co-measure expectation. This is taken here as the definition of the distorted measure of the derivative with respect to the underlying portfolio. Due to homogeneity, the subsequent allocation of the derivative's value to the primitive elements of the portfolio again follows Aumann-Shapley, in the form of the exposure gradient of the distorted measure. However, the gradient in this case is seen to consist of two terms. The first is the familiar distorted expectation of the gradient of the financial derivative with respect to exposure to the element. The second term involves the conditional covariance of the financial derivative with the element. Sufficient conditions for this second term to vanish are provided. A method for estimating the second term in a simulation framework is proposed. Examples are provided. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Network formation models present difficulties for identification, especially when links can be interdependent, for example, when indirect connections matter. We show how one can use the observed proportions of various local network structures to learn about the underlying preference parameters. The key assumption for our approach restricts individuals to have bounded degree in equilibrium, implying a finite number of payoff-relevant local structures. Our main result provides necessary conditions for parameters to belong to the identified set. We then develop a quadratic programming algorithm that can be used to construct this set. With further restrictions on preferences, we show that our conditions are also sufficient for pairwise stability and therefore characterize the identified set precisely. Overall, the use of both the economic model along with pairwise stability allows us to obtain effective dimension reduction.","[de Paula, Aureo] UCL, London, England; [de Paula, Aureo] Sao Paulo Sch Econ, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [de Paula, Aureo] CeMMAP, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [de Paula, Aureo] IFS, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [de Paula, Aureo] CEPR, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Richards-Shubik, Seth] Lehigh Univ, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [Richards-Shubik, Seth] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Richards-Shubik, Seth; Tamer, Elie] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of London; University College London; Lehigh University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University,"de Paula, A (通讯作者)，UCL, London, England.;de Paula, A (通讯作者)，Sao Paulo Sch Econ, Sao Paulo, Brazil.;de Paula, A (通讯作者)，CeMMAP, Sao Paulo, Brazil.;de Paula, A (通讯作者)，IFS, Sao Paulo, Brazil.;de Paula, A (通讯作者)，CEPR, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",apaula@ucl.ac.uk; sethrs@lehigh.edu; elietamer@fas.harvard.edu,,"de Paula, Aureo/0000-0003-3611-3448","NSF [SES-1123990]; ERC [338187]; Economic and Social Research Council through the ESRC Centre for Microdata Methods and Practice [RES-589-28-0001]; ESRC [ES/P008909/1, ES/I034021/1, ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: UKRI; European Research Council (ERC) [338187] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); Economic and Social Research Council through the ESRC Centre for Microdata Methods and Practice(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"We thank the editor and five anonymous referees, along with seminar and conference participants at the Conference on Econometric Analysis of Social Interactions at Northwestern University (2010), the ASSA meetings in Chicago (2012), University of Western Ontario (2013), the Stats in Paris: Statistics and Econometrics of Networks (2013) conference, the Recent Advances in Set Identification (2013) conference, the 2nd European Meeting of Network Economics (2014), Heinz College (2015), the INET Econometrics of Networks Workshop at Cambridge University (2015), the Cowles Foundation (2015), Northwestern University (2015), the Chicago Fed (2015), the Econometric Society World Congress (2015), the USC Dornsife INET Conference on Networks (2015), the New York Fed (2016), the University of Pennsylvania (2016), Surrey (2016), Groningen (2016), the Tinbergen Institute (2016), Harvard (2016), Rutgers (2016), and Virginia (2016) for suggestions and comments.

One important challenge to existing research is how to describe the underlying asset price process and fluctuation features accurately. Considering the benefits of ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) in depicting the fluctuation features of financial time series, we construct an option pricing model based on the new hybrid generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (hybrid GARCH)-type functions with improved EEMD by decomposing the original return series into the high frequency, low frequency and trend terms. Using the locally risk-neutral valuation relationship (LRNVR), we obtain an equivalent martingale measure and option prices with different maturities based on Monte Carlo simulations. The empirical results indicate that this novel model can substantially capture volatility features and it performs much better than the M-GARCH and Black-Scholes models. In particular, the decomposition is consistently helpful in reducing option pricing errors, thereby proving the innovativeness and effectiveness of the hybrid GARCH option pricing model.","[Hua, Qiuling; Cheng, Zhang] Jilin Univ, Sch Econ, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Tingfeng] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Social Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China",Jilin University; Tsinghua University,"Jiang, TF (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Sch Social Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jiangtf14@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn,"Jiang, Tingfeng/M-7956-2019","Jiang, Tingfeng/0000-0001-5301-4826",Jilin University [2015QY020],Jilin University(Jilin University),"This work was supported by the Jilin University Research Funding (Designing Over the Counter Option of Agricultural Products and Risk Management-Based on the Perspective of Market Makers, NO. 2015QY020).",,30,3,3,1,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

In multi-frequency finance various phenomena have been observed, such as shocks, crashes, volatility clustering, turbulent flows and contagion. Hawkes processes have been proposed to model those challenging phenomena appearing across asset prices in various exchanges. The original Hawkes process is an intensity-based model for series of events with path dependence and self-exciting or mutual-exciting mechanisms. This paper introduces a slightly depressing process to model the reverse phenomenon of self-exciting mechanisms. Such a process models the decline in the intensity of jumps observed in market regimes. The proposed birth-immigration-death process captures the decline in jump intensity observed at the start of a daily trading regime while the classical immigration-birth process models an increase in jump intensity towards the close of daily trading. Each of these processes can be expressed as a special case of a simple bivariate Hawkes process.","[Khashanah, Khaldoun] Stevens Inst Technol, Financial Engn, 1 Castle Point Hudson, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA; [Chen, Jing] Cardiff Univ, Math Inst, Senghennydd Rd, Cardiff CF24 4AG, S Glam, Wales; [Hawkes, Alan] Swansea Univ, Sch Management, Bay Campus,Fabian Way, Swansea SA1 8EN, W Glam, Wales",Stevens Institute of Technology; Cardiff University; Swansea University,"Khashanah, K (通讯作者)，Stevens Inst Technol, Financial Engn, 1 Castle Point Hudson, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA.",kkhashan@stevens.edu,,"Hawkes, Alan/0000-0003-0990-1772",,,,,36,2,2,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

High-risk women included those with locally advanced (including inflammatory) breast cancer and women with high-risk early-stage breast cancer (classified as T2/3 or N1). The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group. This article presents the critical review of the company's submission by the Evidence Review Group and the outcome of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance. The clinical data were mainly taken from a phase II, randomised, open-label, active controlled study (NeoSphere), which reported a significant advantage in terms of pathological complete response rates of pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy, compared with trastuzumab alone with chemotherapy (45.8 vs. 29.0%, p = 0.0141). The company did not make any indirect comparisons. A meta-analysis of 12 neoadjuvant studies investigating the relationship between pathological complete response and event-free survival was used to extrapolate the outcomes reported in the NeoSphere study. A cardiac safety study (TRYPHAENA) demonstrated the safety of pertuzumab. The company undertook a model-based economic evaluation of neoadjuvant pertuzumab plus trastuzumab and docetaxel compared with neoadjuvant trastuzumab and docetaxel over a lifetime horizon from the National Health Service and Personal Social Services perspective. The probabilistic incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated to be A 20,104 pound per quality-adjusted life-year gained for pertuzumab alongside trastuzumab and docetaxel compared with trastuzumab and docetaxel, which was revised to A 21,869 pound per quality-adjusted life-year gained following the clarification process. The Evidence Review Group corrected an error in the digitisation of the survivor functions and modified the clinically inappropriate assumption that recurrence is zero after 7 years. The Evidence Review Group's probabilistic base case was A 23,962 pound per quality-adjusted life-year gained. During the appraisal, to mitigate the uncertainties associated with the evidence, the company offered a patient access scheme, which led to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Appraisal Committee recommending pertuzumab in this patient group, subject to the company providing the agreed discount in the patient access scheme.","[Squires, Hazel; Pandor, Abdullah; Thokala, Praveen; Stevens, John W.; Kaltenthaler, Eva; Clowes, Mark] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Regent Court, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Coleman, Robert; Wyld, Lynda] Univ Sheffield, Dept Oncol & Metab, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield; University of Sheffield,"Squires, H (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Regent Court, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",h.squires@sheffield.ac.uk,"Coleman, Robert/E-4346-2019; Pandor, Abdullah/E-4643-2010; Squires, Hazel/GSO-3900-2022","Pandor, Abdullah/0000-0003-2552-5260; Squires, Hazel/0000-0002-2776-4014; Thokala, Praveen/0000-0003-4122-2366",National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme [15/69/11 STA]; National Institute for Health Research [RP-PG-1209-10071] Funding Source: researchfish,National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme (Project Number 15/69/11 STA).

The new methodology removes the non-negligible estimation effect of test statistic via a projection-based transformation, exploiting the nature of conditional moment specification testing. That is, the conditional moment restrictions, which are implicitly defined in conditional moment testing framework, not only imply the unconditional moment restrictions we are testing, but also many other unconditional moment restrictions. This approach is robust to departures from the distributional assumptions that are not being tested; moreover, only a preliminary root T-consistent estimator is needed, and the transformation is asymptotically distribution free. Furthermore, the transformed statistic reaches asymptotic efficiency in the sense of generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation. In some specific alternatives, we establish the optimal tests. We apply the methodology to test the adequacy and nonlinearity of the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models. Finally, an application to the S&P 500 daily data highlights the merits of our approach.","[Wang, Xuexin] Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xuexin] Xiamen Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Econometr, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xuexin] Xiamen Univ, Fujian Key Lab Stat Sci, Xiamen, Peoples R China",Xiamen University; Xiamen University; Xiamen University,"Wang, XX (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.",xuexinwang@xmu.edu.cn,,,Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2012-31748]; 111 Project [B13028]; National Natural Science Funds of China [71301136],"Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); 111 Project(Ministry of Education, China - 111 Project); National Natural Science Funds of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","The financial support from the Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Ref. no.

Previous studies have shown that the EM method produces a set with an accurate coverage ratio even for a small break; however, the set is often overly lengthy. This study proposes a simple modification to rehabilitate their method through the long-run variance estimation. Following the literature, we provide an asymptotic justification for the improvement of the modified method over the original method under a nonlocal asymptotic framework. A Monte Carlo simulation shows that the modified method achieves a shorter confidence set than the EM method, especially when the break is large or the HAC correction is conducted. The modified method may exhibit minor errors in the coverage rate when the break is small; however, the coverage is more stable than alternative methods when the break is large. We apply our method to a level shift in post-1980s Japanese inflation data.","[Yamamoto, Yohei] Hitotsubashi Univ, Dept Econ, 2-1 Naka, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868601, Japan",Hitotsubashi University,"Yamamoto, Y (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Dept Econ, 2-1 Naka, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868601, Japan.",yohei.yamamoto@econ.hit-u.ac.jp,,,"MEXT [25870235, 25285067, 25245042]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25285067, 25245042, 25870235] Funding Source: KAKEN","MEXT(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The author acknowledges financial support for this work from the MEXT Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research Nos. 25870235, 25285067, and 25245042.",,15,7,8,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

This study surveyed the implementation of MEAs in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) where limited comparative information is currently available. We conducted a survey on the implementation of MEAs in CEE between January and March 2017. Sixteen countries participated in this study. Across five countries with available data on the number of different MEA instruments implemented, the most common MEAs implemented were confidential discounts (n = 495, 73%), followed by paybacks (n = 92, 14%), price-volume agreements (n = 37, 5%), free doses (n = 25, 4%), bundle and other agreements (n = 19, 3%), and payment by result (n = 10, > 1%). Across seven countries with data on MEAs by therapeutic group, the highest number of brand names associated with one or more MEA instruments belonged to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC)-L group, antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents (n = 201, 31%). The second most frequent therapeutic group for MEA implementation was ATC-A, alimentary tract and metabolism (n = 87, 13%), followed by medicines for neurological conditions (n = 83, 13%). Experience in implementing MEAs varied substantially across the region and there is considerable scope for greater transparency, sharing experiences and mutual learning. European citizens, authorities and industry should ask themselves whether, within publicly funded health systems, confidential discounts can still be tolerated, particularly when it is not clear which country and party they are really benefiting. Furthermore, if MEAs are to improve access, countries should establish clear objectives for their implementation and a monitoring framework to measure their performance, as well as the burden of implementation.","[Ferrario, Alessandra; Kanavos, Panos] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, LSE Hlth, London, England; [Araja, Diana] Riga Stradins Univ, Dept Pharm, Minist Hlth, Fac Pharm, Riga, Latvia; [Bochenek, Tomasz] Jagiellonian Univ, Dept Drug Management, Fac Hlth Sci, Med Coll, PL-31531 Krakow, Poland; [Catic, Tarik] Soc Pharmacoecn & Outcomes Res Bosnia & Herzegovi, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg; [Danko, David] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Budapest, Hungary; [Dimitrova, Maria] Med Univ Sofia, Dept Org & Econ Pharm, Fac Pharm, 2 Dunav,Str, Sofia 1000, Sofia, Bulgaria; [Furst, Jurij] Hlth Insurance Inst Slovenia, Miklosiceva 24, Ljubljana 1507, Slovenia; [Greiciute-Kuprijanov, Ieva] Minist Hlth Republ Lithuania, Dept Pharm, Vilnius, Lithuania; [Hoxha, Iris] Univ Med Tirana, Dept Pharm, Fac Med, Tirana, Albania; [Jakupi, Arianit] Independent Consultant, Pristina, Kosovo; [Laidmae, Erki] Estonian Hlth Insurance Fund, Head Insurance Benefit Package, Tallinn, Estonia; [Loblova, Olga] Cent European Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Nadoru 9, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary; [Mardare, Ileana] Carol Davila Univ Med & Pharm, Publ Hlth & Management Dept, Fac Med, Bucharest 1-3,Dr Leonte Anastasievici St, Bucharest 050463, Romania; [Markovic-Pekovic, Vanda] Minist Hlth & Social Welf, Banja Luka, Republic Of Srp, Bosnia & Herceg; [Markovic-Pekovic, Vanda] Univ Banja Luka, Med Fac, Dept Social Pharm, Mrkalja 18, Banja Luka, Republic Srpska, Bosnia & Herceg; [Meshkov, Dmitry] Natl Res Inst Publ Hlth, Moscow, Russia; [Novakovic, Tanja] Pharmaceut Assoc Serbia, Pharmacoecon Sect, Belgrade, Serbia; [Petrova, Guenka] Med Univ Sofia, Dept Social Pharm & Pharmacoecon, Fac Pharm, Sofia, Bulgaria; [Pomorski, Maciej] Agcy Hlth Technol Assessment & Tariff Syst AOTMiT, Krasickiego St, Warsaw, Poland; [Tomek, Dominik] Slovak Med Univ Bratislava, Fac Med, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Voncina, Luka] Independent Consultant, Zagreb, Croatia; [Haycox, Alan; Godman, Brian] Univ Liverpool, Hlth Econ Ctr, Management Sch, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Bonanno, Patricia Vella; Godman, Brian] Univ Strathclyde, Strathclyde Inst Pharm & Biomed Sci, Glasgow G4 0RE, Lanark, Scotland; [Godman, Brian] Karolinska Univ, Karolinska Inst, Div Clin Pharmacol, Hosp Huddinge, S-14186 Stockholm, Sweden",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Riga Stradins University; Jagiellonian University; Collegium Medicum Jagiellonian University; Corvinus University Budapest; Medical University Sofia; Central European University; Carol Davila University of Medicine & Pharmacy; University of Banja Luka (UNIBL); N.A.

More flexible approaches are needed to capture the characteristic I-O pattern of delayed treatment effects and, for a subset of patients, the plateau of long-term survival. Using a systematic approach to data management and analysis, the study assessed the applicability of traditional and flexible approaches and, as a test case of flexible methods, investigated the suitability of restricted cubic splines (RCS) to model progression-free survival (PFS) in I-O therapy. The goodness of fit of each survival function was tested on data from the CheckMate 067 trial of monotherapy versus combination therapy (nivolumab/ipilimumab) in metastatic melanoma using visual inspection and statistical tests. Extrapolations were validated using long-term data for ipilimumab. Modelled PFS estimates using traditional methods did not provide a good fit to the Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curve. RCS estimates fit the K-M curves well, particularly for the plateau phase. RCS with six knots provided the best overall fit, but RCS with one knot performed best at the plateau phase and was preferred on the grounds of parsimony. RCS models represent a valuable addition to the range of flexible approaches available to model survival when assessing the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of I-O therapy. A systematic approach to data analysis is recommended to compare the suitability of different approaches for different diseases and treatment regimens.","[Gibson, Eddie; Koblbauer, Ian; Begum, Najida] Wickenstones Ltd, Oxford, England; [Dranitsaris, George] Augmentium Pharma Consulting Inc, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Liew, Danny] Monash Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [McEwan, Phil] Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res Ltd, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Monfared, Amir Abbas Tahami] Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Monfared, Amir Abbas Tahami] McGill Univ, Dept Epidemiol Biostat & Occupat Hlth, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Yuan, Yong] Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Princeton, NJ USA; [Juarez-Garcia, Ariadna] Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Tyas, David] Bristol Myers Squibb Co, London, England; [Lees, Michael] Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Paris, France",Monash University; Health Economics & Outcomes Research Ltd; Bristol-Myers Squibb; McGill University; Bristol-Myers Squibb; Bristol-Myers Squibb; Bristol-Myers Squibb; Bristol-Myers Squibb,"Gibson, E (通讯作者)，Wickenstones Ltd, Oxford, England.",Eddie@wickenstones.com,"Monfared, Ali Shabestani/I-2441-2016","Tahami Monfared, Amir Abbas/0000-0003-4003-3192; Gibson, Eddie/0009-0008-3696-9792; Liew, Danny/0000-0002-0131-623X",Bristol-Myers Squibb,Bristol-Myers Squibb(Bristol-Myers Squibb),This research was funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb.,,31,43,46,0,7,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,DEC,2017,35.0,12,,,,,1257,1270,,10.1007/s40273-017-0558-5,0.0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,FM8GP,28866758.0,"Green Submitted, Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000415324600005,0

To make the EQ-5D suitable for use in economic evaluations, a societal-based value set is needed. Indonesia does not have such a value set. The aim of this study was to derive an EQ-5D-5L value set from the Indonesian general population. A representative sample aged 17 years and over was recruited from the Indonesian general population. A multi-stage stratified quota method with respect to residence, gender, age, level of education, religion and ethnicity was utilized. Two elicitation techniques, the composite time trade-off (C-TTO) and discrete choice experiments (DCE) were applied. Interviews were undertaken by trained interviewers using computer-assisted face-to-face interviews with the EuroQol Valuation Technology (EQ-VT) platform. To estimate the value set, a hybrid regression model combining C-TTO and DCE data was used. A total of 1054 respondents who completed the interview formed the sample for the analysis. Their characteristics were similar to those of the Indonesian population. Most self-reported health problems were observed in the pain/discomfort dimension (39.66%) and least in the self-care dimension (1.89%). In the value set, the maximum value was 1.000 for full health (health state '11111') followed by the health state '11112' with value 0.921. The minimum value was -0.865 for the worst state ('55555'). Preference values were most affected by mobility and least by pain/discomfort. We now have a representative EQ-5D-5L value set for Indonesia. We expect our results will promote and facilitate health economic evaluations and HRQOL research in Indonesia.","[Purba, Fredrick Dermawan; Hunfeld, Joke A. M.; Busschbach, Jan J.

In this paper, we focus on the estimation of a Gaussian graphical model when the dependence between variables has a block-wise structure. We propose a penalized likelihood estimation of the inverse covariance matrix, also called Graphical LASSO, applied to block averages of observations, and we derive its asymptotic properties. Monte Carlo experiments, comparing the properties of our estimator with those of the conventional Graphical LASSO, show that the proposed approach works well in the presence of block-wise dependence structure and that it is also robust to possible model misspecification. We conclude the paper with an empirical study on economic growth and convergence of 1,088 European small regions in the years 1980 to 2012. While requiring a priori information on the block structure - e.g. given by the hierarchical structure of data - our approach can be adopted for estimation and prediction using very large panel data sets. Also, it is particularly useful when there is a problem of missing values and outliers or when the focus of the analysis is on out-of-sample prediction.","[Moscone, Francesco; Tosetti, Elisa] Brunel Univ London, Brunel Business Sch, Eastern Gateway Bldg, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Vinciotti, Veronica] Brunel Univ London, Dept Math, John Crank Bldg, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England",Brunel University; Brunel University,"Moscone, F (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ London, Brunel Business Sch, Eastern Gateway Bldg, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",francesco.moscone@brunel.ac.uk; elisa.tosetti@brunel.ac.uk; veronica.vinciotti@brunel.ac.uk,"tosetti, elisa/ABD-1195-2020; Vinciotti, Veronica/A-7703-2008","tosetti, elisa/0000-0003-0979-2828; Vinciotti, Veronica/0000-0002-2625-7977","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) grant, Semantic Credit Risk Assessment of Business Ecosystems (SCRIBE); Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G00160X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/L021250/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/L021250/1] Funding Source: UKRI; ESRC [ES/G00160X/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) grant, Semantic Credit Risk Assessment of Business Ecosystems (SCRIBE)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","F.

We focus on the setting where changes in health benefits, driven by medical inflation, are accounted for by an appropriate update or indexation of the level premium, the policy value, or both premium and policy value, during the term of the contract. Such an updating mechanism is necessary to restore the actuarial equivalence between future health benefits and surrender values on the one hand, and available policy values and future premiums on the other hand. We extend existing literature (Vercruysse et al., 2013; Denuit et al., 2017) by developing updating mechanisms in a discrete-time framework, where medical inflation is only taken into account ex-post as it emerges over time and where surrender values are allowed for. We propose and design two types of surrender values: based on the ageing provision on the one hand and based directly on the premiums paid until surrender on the other hand. We illustrate our updating strategy with numerical examples, using Belgian data, and investigate the sensitivity of our findings with respect to elements from the technical basis (in particular: the lapse rates) used in the actuarial calculations. Our updating mechanism is generic and useful for a wide range of products in life and health insurance, where some elements of the technical basis are guaranteed while others are subject to revision according to policy conditions.","[Dhaene, Jan; Godecharle, Els; Antonio, Katrien; Hanbali, Hamza] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Econ & Business, Leuven, Belgium; [Antonio, Katrien] Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Denuit, Michel] Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Stat Biostat & Sci Actuarielles, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium",KU Leuven; University of Amsterdam; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Antonio, K (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Econ & Business, Leuven, Belgium.;Antonio, K (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",jan.dhaene@kuleuven.be; els.godecharle@kuleuven.be; k.antonio@uva.nl; michel.denuit@uclouvain.be; hamza.hanbali@kuleuven.be,"Dhaene, Jan/K-6178-2012; hanbali, hamza/AAK-8053-2021; Dhaene, Jan/I-9656-2019","Dhaene, Jan/0000-0003-4314-8809; hanbali, hamza/0000-0001-8060-4813;",,,,,15,5,5,1,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,SEP,2017,47.0,3,,,,,803,836,,10.1017/asb.2017.13,0.0,,,34,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,FE9ZW,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000408563000006,0

We show that the ruin probability can be kept under control through the choice of the target level.

Theoretical justification for using the bootstrap technique to bias adjust log periodogram and semiparametric local Whittle estimators of the memory parameter is provided in the case where the true value of d lies in the range 0 <= d < 0.5. That the bootstrap method provides confidence intervals with the correct asymptotic coverage is also proven, with the intervals shown to adjust explicitly for bias, as estimated via the bootstrap. Simulation evidence comparing the performance of the bootstrap bias correction with analytical bias-correction techniques is presented.

Multiple values of unobserved variables can be associated with particular combinations of observed variables. This can arise when there are multiple sources of heterogeneity, censored or discrete endogenous variables, or inequality restrictions on functions of observed and unobserved variables. The models generalize the class of incomplete instrumental variable (IV) models in which unobserved variables are single-valued functions of observed variables. Thus the models are referred to as generalized IV (GIV) models, but there are important cases in which instrumental variable restrictions play no significant role. Building on a definition of observational equivalence for incomplete models the development uses results from random set theory that guarantee that the characterizations deliver sharp bounds, thereby dispensing with the need for case-by-case proofs of sharpness. The use of random sets defined on the space of unobserved variables allows identification analysis under mean and quantile independence restrictions on the distributions of unobserved variables conditional on exogenous variables as well as under a full independence restriction. The results are used to develop sharp bounds on the distribution of valuations in an incomplete model of English auctions, improving on the pointwise bounds available until now. Application of many of the results of the paper requires no familiarity with random set theory.","[Chesher, Andrew] UCL, Dept Econ, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Rosen, Adam M.] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Social Sci 213, Box 90097, Durham, NC 27708 USA",University of London; University College London; Duke University,"Chesher, A (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Econ, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",andrew.chesher@ucl.ac.uk; adam.rosen@duke.edu,,,"UK Economic and Social Research Council [RES-589-28-0001]; British Academy Mid-Career Fellowship; European Research Council (ERC) [ERC-2009-StG-240910-ROMETA, ERC-2012-StG-312474]; ESRC [ES/I034021/1, ES/M010147/1, ES/P008909/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I034021/1, ES/P008909/1] Funding Source: researchfish",UK Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); British Academy Mid-Career Fellowship; European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We thank the co-editor and three anonymous reviewers for helpful suggestions and feedback that helped to improve the paper.

We utilize a conditional measure of systemic risk that reflects market perceptions and can be intuitively interpreted as an entity's conditional joint probability of default, given the hypothetical default of other entities. The measure of systemic risk is applicable to high dimensions and not only incorporates individual default risk characteristics but also captures the underlying interdependent relations between sovereigns and banks in a multivariate setting. In empirical applications, our results reveal significant time variation in systemic risk spillover effects for the sovereign and banking system. We find that systemic risk is mainly driven by risk premiums coupled with a steady increase in physical default risk.","[Xu, Simon; In, Francis] Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, Dept Banking & Finance, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Forbes, Catherine] Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Hwang, Inchang] Korea Insurance Res Inst, KFPA Bldg,38,Gukjegeumyung Ro 6-Gil, Seoul, South Korea",Monash University; Monash University,"In, F (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, Dept Banking & Finance, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",francis.in@monash.edu,"Hwang, Inchang/GZM-9060-2022","Forbes, Catherine/0000-0003-3830-5865",,,,,39,7,8,1,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

A simple scheme based on the log-normal distribution is developed and shown to be superior to the standard formula and to adjustments of the Cornish Fisher type. The method handles tail dependence if a simple Monte Carlo step is included. A hierarchical Clayton copula is constructed and used to confirm the accuracy of the log-normal approximation and to demonstrate the importance of including tail-dependence. Arguably a log-normal scheme makes the logic in Solvency II consistent, but many other distributions might be used as vehicle, a topic that may deserve further study. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In the TVOC model, half-rotated copulas are constructed to measure the nonlinear and asymmetric negative dependence, and the distribution-free test for independence is introduced to verify the dependent relationship and reduce the computational time. The TVOC model is then employed to research the dependence structure between security and commodity markets. We find evidence that the dependence structures across different markets vary over time and that emergencies are usually the major cause of sudden changes in the dependence structure. We also show that the TVOC model captures the dynamic characteristics of the direction and intensity of the dependence as well as the dynamic characteristics of the types of dependence structure. In particular, the half-rotated copulas can accurately describe the asymmetric negative extreme dependence across different markets.","[Liu, Bing-Yue] Univ Sci & Technol China, Dept Stat & Finance, Hefei, Peoples R China; [Liu, Bing-Yue; Ji, Qiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Policy & Management, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Fan, Ying] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; CAS Institutes of Science & Development; Beihang University","Ji, Q (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Policy & Management, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jqwxnjq@casipm.ac.cn,"Ji, Qiang/AAA-4001-2020; Ji, Qiang/AAY-1986-2021","Ji, Qiang/0000-0002-3502-5254;","National Natural Science Foundation of China [91546109, 71133005, 71203210]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under [grant number 91546109], [grant number 71133005]; and [grant number 71203210] are acknowledged.",,35,56,57,1,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Two complementary strategies are pursued to evaluate the conditional distributions of consecutive TGARCH innovations, a non-parametric approach and a class of standardized copula distributions.

The approach exploits the moments of normal mixtures implied by the regime-switching process and uses Monte Carlo test techniques to deal with the presence of an autoregressive component in the model specification. The proposed tests have very respectable power in comparison with the optimal tests for Markov-switching parameters of Carrasco et al.(2014), and they are also quite attractive owing to their computational simplicity.

We revisit his proposal by investigating Stein-like shrinkage in the context of two-stage least square (2SLS) estimation of a structural parameter. Our estimator follows Maasoumi(1978) in taking a weighted average of the 2SLS and ordinary least square estimators, with the weight depending inversely on the Hausman(1978) statistic for exogeneity. Using a local-to-exogenous asymptotic theory, we derive the asymptotic distribution of the Stein estimator and calculate its asymptotic risk. We find that if the number of endogenous variables exceeds 2, then the shrinkage estimator has strictly smaller risk than the 2SLS estimator, extending the classic result of James and Stein(1961). In a simple simulation experiment, we show that the shrinkage estimator has substantially reduced finite sample median squared error relative to the standard 2SLS estimator.","[Hansen, Bruce E.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, 1180 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Hansen, BE (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, 1180 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",behansen@wisc.edu,"Hansen, Bruce E/AAZ-5224-2020",,National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),Research supported by the National Science Foundation.

Several researches aimed at developing an expression for initiatives, which truly extend their value proposition to ecological and social horizons. This aspect has been referred as 'businesses for sustainability' in the past couple of years. However, despite the initial positive intentions, the expected outcomes seem to come undone in some cases. This paper presents a historic overview of principles developed by environmental economists. Furthermore, it introduces a case study for a novel environmental-based economic approach - the circular economy. The idea of circular economy has been neglected for a long time. Although, it is in governmental and corporate strategic plans by now, the case study proves the lack of appropriate practical background. The present study argues how the application of 'Transition management' appears to be essential in order to realize such a new economic paradigm.","[Horvath, Balint] Szent Istvan Univ, Climate Change Econ Res Ctr, Pater Karoly St 1, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary; [Magda, Robert] Szent Istvan Univ, Inst Econ Law & Methodol, Pater Karoly St 1, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary",Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences; Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences,"Horvath, B (通讯作者)，Szent Istvan Univ, Climate Change Econ Res Ctr, Pater Karoly St 1, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary.",horvath@carbonmanagement.hu; magda.robert@gtk.szie.hu,"Magda, Robert/HCH-0867-2022; Horvath, Balint/J-4020-2017","Horvath, Balint/0000-0001-5238-3320",,,,,35,1,1,0,5,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

Indeed, to date, little attention has been paid to the possibility of considering the two together. To discuss the effect of the simultaneous inclusion of different dependence assumptions in ratemaking models, a bivariate INAR(1) regression model is adapted to the ratemaking problem of pricing an automobile insurance contract with two types of coverage, taking into account both the correlation between claims from different coverage types and the serial correlation between the observations of the same policyholder observed over time. A numerical application using an automobile insurance claims database is conducted and the main finding is that the improvement obtained with a BINAR(1) regression model, compared to the outcomes of the simplest models, is marked, implying that we need to consider both time and cross correlations to fit the data at hand. In addition, the BINAR(1) specification shows a third source of dependence to be significant, namely, cross-time dependence. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Independent economic evaluation of these regimens simultaneously has not been conducted for the UK. Objective Using data from a network meta-analysis as efficacy measures, we estimated the cost effectiveness and cost utility of these regimens for the UK. Methods A three-state Markov model (progression-free, progressed-disease, and death) simulating the total costs and health outcomes (quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs] gained and life-years [LYs]) was developed to estimate the incremental costutility (ICUR) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) for patients with MPC, from the payer perspective. The model was specified to calculate total costs in 2017 British pounds (GBP, ) pound. All values were discounted at 3.5% per year over a full lifetime horizon. One-way sensitivity and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of parameter uncertainty on the results. Results FFX was the most effective regimen, NAB-P + GEM was the most costly regimen, and GEM was the least costly and least effective regimen. OX + GEM, CIS + GEM, and NAB-P + GEM were dominated by CAP + GEM and FFX. Compared with GEM, the ICUR for CAP + GEM and FFX was 28,066 pound and 33,020 pound/QALY gained, respectively; compared with GEM, the ICER for CAP + GEM and FFX was 17,437 pound and 22,291 pound/LY gained, respectively; and compared with CAP + GEM, the ICUR and ICER for FFX were 34,947 pound/QALY gained and 24,414/LY gained, respectively. Conclusions At a threshold value of 30,000 pound/QALY, CAP + GEM was found to be the only cost-effective regimen in the management of MPC in the UK.","[Gharaibeh, Mahdi; Erstad, Brian; Slack, Marion; Alsaid, Nimer; Bootman, J.

The reporting quality of the included studies was assessed using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement.ResultsA total of 72 studies were included in the review, classified as follows: medications for acute asthma treatment (n=5, 6.9%); inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) administered alone or in conjunction with long-acting -agonists (LABA) or tiotropium for chronic asthma treatment (n=38, 52.8%); direct comparisons between different combinations of ICS, ICS/LABA, leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA), and sodium cromoglycate for chronic asthma treatment (n=14, 19.4%); and omalizumab for chronic asthma treatment (n=15, 20.8%). ICS were reported to be cost effective when compared with LTRA for the management of persistent asthma. In patients with inadequately controlled asthma taking ICS, the addition of long-acting -agonist (LABA) preparations has been demonstrated to be cost effective, especially when combinations of ICS/LABA containing formoterol are used for both maintenance and reliever therapy. In patients with uncontrolled severe persistent allergic asthma, omalizumab therapy could be cost effective in a carefully selected subgroup of patients with the more severe forms of the disease. The quality of reporting in the studies, according to the CHEERS checklist, was very uneven. The main cost-effectiveness drivers identified were the cost or rate of asthma exacerbations, the cost or rate of the use of asthma medications, the asthma mortality risk, and the rate of utilization of health services for asthma.ConclusionsThe present findings are in line with the pharmacological recommendations for stepwise management of asthma given in the most recent evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for the disease. The identified reporting quality of the available health economic evidence is useful for identifying aspects where there is room for improvement in future asthma cost-effectiveness studies.","[Rodriguez-Martinez, Carlos E.] Univ Nacl Colombia, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Carrera 45 26-85, Bogota, Colombia; [Rodriguez-Martinez, Carlos E.] Univ El Bosque, Sch Med, Dept Pediat Pulmonol & Pediat Crit Care Med, Ave Cra 9 131A-02, Bogota, Colombia; [Sossa-Briceno, Monica P.] Univ Nacl Colombia, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Carrera 45 26-85, Bogota, Colombia; [Castro-Rodriguez, Jose A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Med, Div Pediat, Ave Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 340, Santiago, Region Metropol, Chile",Universidad Nacional de Colombia; Universidad El Bosque; Universidad Nacional de Colombia; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Rodriguez-Martinez, CE (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Colombia, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Carrera 45 26-85, Bogota, Colombia.;Rodriguez-Martinez, CE (通讯作者)，Univ El Bosque, Sch Med, Dept Pediat Pulmonol & Pediat Crit Care Med, Ave Cra 9 131A-02, Bogota, Colombia.",carerodriguezmar@unal.edu.co,"Castro-Rodriguez, Jose A./ABA-6591-2021; Castro-Rodriguez, Jose A./ABA-2760-2021","Castro-Rodriguez, Jose A./0000-0002-0708-4281; Castro-Rodriguez, Jose A./0000-0002-0708-4281; Rodriguez-Martinez, Carlos E./0000-0003-2560-6693",,,,,116,19,19,0,15,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,OCT,2018,36.0,10,,,,,1165,1200,,10.1007/s40273-018-0668-8,0.0,,,36,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GS9AR,29869050.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000444007800004,0

Policy relevance and external validity turn on the ability to do this reliably. Our method exploits the insight that both the IV estimand and many treatment parameters can be expressed as weighted averages of the same underlying marginal treatment effects. Since the weights are identified, knowledge of the IV estimand generally places some restrictions on the unknown marginal treatment effects, and hence on the values of the treatment parameters of interest. We show how to extract information about the treatment parameter of interest from the IV estimand and, more generally, from a class of IV-like estimands that includes the two stage least squares and ordinary least squares estimands, among others. Our method has several applications. First, it can be used to construct nonparametric bounds on the average causal effect of a hypothetical policy change. Second, our method allows the researcher to flexibly incorporate shape restrictions and parametric assumptions, thereby enabling extrapolation of the average effects for compliers to the average effects for different or larger populations. Third, our method can be used to test model specification and hypotheses about behavior, such as no selection bias and/or no selection on gain.","[Mogstad, Magne] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Stat Norway, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Mogstad, Magne] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Santos, Andres] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Torgovitsky, Alexander] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of Chicago,"Mogstad, M (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Stat Norway, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.;Mogstad, M (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",magne.mogstad@gmail.com; andres@econ.ucla.edu; torgovitsky@uchicago.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [SES-1530538, SES-1426882]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank the editor, four anonymous referees, Matt Masten, Derek Neal, Ed Vytacil, Chris Walters, and seminar participants at several universities and conferences for valuable feedback and suggestions.

Perspective UK National Health Service (NHS). Methods The model was structured as a 3-month decision tree leading into a Markov model. Comparators were licensed tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (including available biosimilars) and CC in the biologic naive and biologic-experienced populations, respectively. Clinical parameters captured treatment response, short-term disease activity and patient functioning, as well as long-term structural disease progression. Utilities were derived from secukinumab trial data. List prices were used for all drugs. The cost year was 2017 and costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5%. Results In the biologic-naive population, secukinumab dominated adalimumab and certolizumab pegol. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) versus other comparators were either below 10,000 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained or south-west ICERs that implied cost effectiveness of secukinumab. In biologic-experienced patients, the ICER for secukinumab versus CC was 4927 pound per QALY gained. Treatment response rates, short-term treatment effects, long-term radiographic progression and biologic acquisition costs were key model drivers. Scenario analysis found results to be robust to changes in model structural assumptions. Probabilistic analysis identified greater uncertainty in results in the biologic-naive population. Conclusions Even at list price, secukinumab appears to represent a cost-effective use of NHS resources for biologic-naive and biologic-experienced patients with active AS.

Rifaximin is a non-systemic antibiotic that reduces the risk of overt HE recurrence and overt HE-related hospitalizations. Objective Our objective was to provide an overview of the direct HE-related costs and cost benefits of rifaximin, lactulose, and rifaximin plus lactulose. Methods A systematic review of PubMed and relevant meeting abstracts was conducted to identify publications since 1 January 2007 reporting economic data related to HE and rifaximin and/or lactulose. Further, a public database and published literature were used to estimate current costs of hospitalization for overt HE, and potential cost savings of HE-related hospitalizations with rifaximin. The methodological quality of included studies was evaluated using the Drummond checklist. Results A total of 16 reports were identified for inclusion in the systematic review. Globally, HE-related direct costs ranged from $US5370 to $US50,120 annually per patient. Rifaximin was associated with shorter hospital stays and reduced healthcare costs. Rifaximin also has the potential to reduce overt HE-related hospitalization risk by 50% compared with lactulose. Rifaximin was shown to have a favourable pharmacoeconomic profile compared with lactulose (based on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio). Conclusions In addition to its clinical benefits (e.g. reduction in the risk of recurrence of overt HE, overt HE-related hospitalizations, favourable adverse event profile), economic data are favourable for the use of rifaximin in patients with a history of overt HE.","[Neff, Guy] Florida Digest Hlth Specialists, Florida Res Inst, Lakewood Ranch, FL 34211 USA; [Zachry, Woodie, III] Quantym Therapeut Data, Sarasota, FL USA",,"Neff, G (通讯作者)，Florida Digest Hlth Specialists, Florida Res Inst, Lakewood Ranch, FL 34211 USA.",guy.neff@fdhs.com,,,"Salix Pharmaceuticals, Bridgewater, NJ, USA","Salix Pharmaceuticals, Bridgewater, NJ, USA","Technical editorial assistance was provided, under the direction of the authors, by Mary Beth Moncrief, PhD, and Sophie Bolick, PhD, Synchrony Medical Communications, LLC, West Chester, PA, USA.

The aim of this study was to consolidate the available evidence on the performance of both instruments. A systematic literature search of studies in the English and German languages was conducted (2007-January 2018) using the PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO (EBSCO) databases, as well as the EuroQol Research Foundation website. Data were extracted and assessed on missing values, distributional properties, informativity indices (Shannon's H' and J'), inconsistencies, responsiveness, and test-retest reliability. Twenty-four studies were included in the review. Missing values and floor effects (percentage reporting the worst health state) were found to be negligible for both 3L and 5L (< 5%). From 18 studies, inconsistencies ranged from 0 to 10.6%, although they were generally well below 5%, with 9 studies reporting the most inconsistencies for Usual Activities (mean percentage 4.1%). Shannon's indices were always higher for 5L than for 3L, and all but three studies reported lower ceiling effects ('11111') for 5L than for 3L. There is mixed and insufficient evidence on responsiveness and test-retest reliability, although results on index values showed better performance for 5L on test-retest reliability. Overall, studies showed similar or better measurement properties of the 5L compared with the 3L, and evidence indicated moderately better distributional parameters and substantial improvement in informativity for the 5L compared with the 3L. Insufficient evidence on responsiveness and test-retest reliability implies further research is needed.","[Buchholz, Ines; Kohlmann, Thomas; Feng, You-Shan] Univ Med Greifswald, Inst Community Med, Greifswald, Germany; [Janssen, Mathieu F.] Erasmus MC, Dept Med Psychol & Psychotherapy, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Greifswald Medical School; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus MC,"Buchholz, I (通讯作者)，Univ Med Greifswald, Inst Community Med, Greifswald, Germany.",ines.buchholz@uni-greifswald.de,"Buchholz, Dipl.-Psych., Dr. Ines/IVV-6400-2023","Buchholz, Dipl.-Psych., Dr. Ines/0000-0001-9729-6992; Feng, You-Shan/0000-0003-1509-3409",EuroQol Research Foundation [2016170],EuroQol Research Foundation,This work was funded by the EuroQol Research Foundation (grant number EQ Project 2016170).,,70,165,169,1,13,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JUN,2018,36.0,6,,,,,645,661,,10.1007/s40273-018-0642-5,0.0,,,17,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GG0LA,29572719.0,"Green Published, hybrid",Y,N,2024-03-10,WOS:000432368700003,0

The null hypothesis of interest is that the average treatment effect at the threshold in the so-called sharp design equals a pre-specified value. We first show that, under assumptions used in the majority of the literature, for any test the power against any alternative is bounded above by its size. This result implies that, under these assumptions, any test with nontrivial power will exhibit size distortions. We next provide a sufficient strengthening of the standard assumptions under which we show that a version of a test suggested in Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2014) can control limiting size.","[Kamat, Vishal] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Kamat, V (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",v.kamat@u.northwestern.edu,,,,,,,29,7,9,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

Our approach addresses various drawbacks associated with previous estimators proposed for this model. It allows for: general multiplicative heteroscedasticity in both selection and outcome equations; a nonparametric selection mechanism; and multiple discrete endogenous regressors. The resulting three-stage estimator is shown to be asymptotically normal, with a convergence rate that can be arbitrarily close to n-1/2 if certain smoothness assumptions are satisfied. Simulation results show that our estimator performs reasonably well in finite samples. Our approach is then used to study the intergenerational transmission of smoking habits in British households.","[Mu, Beili; Zhang, Zhengyu] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, 777 Guoding Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Mu, BL (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, 777 Guoding Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",mubeili891101@163.com; zy.zhang@mail.shufe.edu.cn,,,National Science Foundation of China [71501116]; Shanghai University of Finance and Economics; Innovation Fund of Shanghai University of Finance and Economics [CXJJ-2015-354],National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai University of Finance and Economics; Innovation Fund of Shanghai University of Finance and Economics,"The authors are grateful for the hard work and helpful comments provided by the editor Jaap Abbring and two anonymous referees.

In addition to irreversible bone erosions, joint destruction, and skin manifestations, psoriatic arthritis is associated with numerous comorbid conditions. Over the last 5 years, new treatments emerged; the analysis and comparisons of their additional costs and the added benefits have become increasingly important to optimize the limited resources available. Methods A systematic literature review covering PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library was performed from May 2012 to October 2017 focusing on the most recent evidence of costs, benefits, and burden of psoriatic arthritis and its treatments. All economic evaluations assessing the burden of patients with psoriatic arthritis and written in English were eligible for inclusion. We also performed an assessment of the quality of the studies. Results Of the 1652 references found in the literature search, nine cost-effectiveness analyses and 12 cost-of-illness studies were included in the current review. Patients with psoriatic arthritis incur substantially higher direct and indirect costs, as compared with patients with psoriasis without arthritis or patients with other inflammatory diseases. The cost of treatment with biologic therapies is the major predictor of the total cost. However, individuals with psoriatic arthritis are also affected by substantial productivity losses and indirect costs. Biologic therapies are generally cost effective vs. conventional therapies (e.g., synthetic drugs) for treating psoriatic arthritis. Conclusions Psoriatic arthritis is associated with a significant economic burden and biologic therapies contribute significantly to these costs. Biologic therapies are more effective than disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs for the symptoms and signs of psoriatic arthritis and for improving quality of life and inhibiting structural radiological damage. Therefore, biologic therapies are cost effective compared with conventional therapies: the increased direct cost associated with biologic drugs is offset by the significant improvement in the efficacy of treatments and in patient management of psoriatic arthritis.","[D'Angiolella, Lucia Sara; Cortesi, Paolo Angelo; Lafranconi, Alessandra; Micale, Mariangela; Mangano, Sveva; Cesana, Giancarlo; Mantovani, Lorenzo Giovanni] Univ Milano Bicocca, Res Ctr Publ Hlth CESP, Via G Pergolesi 33, I-20900 Monza, Italy",University of Milano-Bicocca,"Mantovani, LG (通讯作者)，Univ Milano Bicocca, Res Ctr Publ Hlth CESP, Via G Pergolesi 33, I-20900 Monza, Italy.",l.dangiolella@campus.unimib.it; paolo.cortesi@unimib.it; alessandra.lafranconi@unimib.it; m.micale1@campus.unimib.it; s.mangano2@campus.unimib.it; giancarlo.cesana@unimib.it; lorenzo.mantovani@unimib.it,"Mantovani, Lorenzo Giovanni/AAC-4263-2021; Cortesi, Paolo Angelo/AAD-7926-2020","Cortesi, Paolo Angelo/0000-0001-5241-4473; Lafranconi, Alessandra/0000-0002-4586-9610; Mantovani, Lorenzo Giovanni/0000-0003-3866-8199",,,,,32,33,34,4,19,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,MAY,2018,36.0,5,,,,,567,589,,10.1007/s40273-018-0618-5,0.0,,,23,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GD3JD,29441473.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430399300006,0
