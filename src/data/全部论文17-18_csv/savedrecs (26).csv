Super investors who trade the most significantly outperform all other investors. Further investigation attributes at least part of their excess returns to informational advantages.

Such a view is appealing from a modeling perspective but imposes correlation dynamics that are similar to time varying volatility. In this paper, we argue that correlations are quite different in nature. We demonstrate that the highly unstable and erratic behavior that is typically observed for the correlation among financial assets is to a large extent a statistical artifact. We provide evidence that spurious correlation dynamics occur in response to financial events that are sufficiently large to cause a structural break in the time series of correlations. A measure for the autocovariance structure of conditional correlations allows us to formally demonstrate that the volatility and the persistence of daily correlations are not primarily driven by financial news but by the level of the underlying true correlation. Our results indicate that a rolling window sample correlation is often a better choice for empirical applications in finance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

As development studies have shown, the strength of this educational effect however varies considerably across countries. Theoretically, we employ mechanisms from human capital theory and modernization theory that explicate the education employment link. Next, insights from the gender and development approach lead us to hypothesize how economic, political, and socio-cultural features of countries might moderate this effect of educational attainment. Using World Values Survey data on women surveyed in 139 country year combinations, we empirically test whether and how a country's labor market structure, social policy, and gender norms condition the influence of women's education attainment on employment. Employing multilevel logistic regression models with cross-level interactions, our results indicate that in countries where service sector jobs are relatively scarce, having a higher education is more important for women to get a job; it seems that highereducated women push lowereducated women out of employment under those circumstances. Most importantly, women's educational attainment makes more of a difference in countries with conservative gender norms; in these countries women's employment is considerably lower than in more liberal countries, but to a lesser extent for higher educated women.

The decline is primarily driven by changes in the propensity to work in routine jobs for individuals from a small set of demographic groups. These same groups account for a substantial fraction of both the increase in non-employment and employment in low-wage, non-routine manual occupations observed during the same period. We analyze a general neoclassical model of the labor market featuring endogenous participation and occupation choice. In response to an increase in automation technology, the framework embodies a tradeoff between reallocating employment across occupations and reallocation of workers towards non-employment. Quantitatively, we find that this standard model accounts for a relatively small portion of the joint decline in routine employment and associated rise in non-routine manual employment and non-employment.

Academic Press, Burlington, pp 873-938, 2010). The pollution-havens hypothesis, on the other hand, indicates that, rather than innovating, dirty industries may relocate to countries with less stringent environmental regulations (Copeland and Taylor in J Econ Lit 42(1):7-71, 2004). Thus, more stringent environmental regulations may increase or decrease innovative activities. This paper examines empirically the impact of environmental regulations on R&D intensities and R&D expenditures in 21 manufacturing industries in 28 OECD countries from 2000 to 2007. I consider pollution intensity and the relative ease of relocation (immobility) as industry characteristics that determine the optimal industry response to increased environmental policy stringency. I find that more pollution intensive industries innovate less as regulatory environments become more restrictive relative to less pollution intensive industries. At the same time, more immobile industries innovate more than more mobile industries as environmental regulations become more stringent, illustrating innovation as an alternative to relocation.","[Milani, Sahar] St Lawrence Univ, 23 Romoda Dr, Canton, NY 13617 USA",Saint Lawrence University,"Milani, S (通讯作者)，St Lawrence Univ, 23 Romoda Dr, Canton, NY 13617 USA.",smilani@stlawu.edu,,"Milani, Sahar/0000-0001-8587-2948",,,,,38,68,74,12,78,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

While such programs have improved household welfare, from a theoretical perspective they could have also created work disincentives or welfare dependency among recipient families. This article tackles this issue by modeling the impact of publicly provided cash and in-kind food transfers on farmer participation decisions in the subsistence crop economy in Botswana, using a probit regression and agricultural census data for 2004. Results show that social pensions have had no impact on farmer participation decisions, most likely because they are too small to influence household behavior. However, government food rations (GFRs) have reduced the probability of farmer participation in subsistence crop production, and, hence, have created work disincentive among recipient subsistence families. Specifically, recipient families of GFRs are 8.1 percentage points less likely to participate in crop production than non-recipient households.","[Seleka, Tebogo B.; Lekobane, Khaufelo R.] Botswana Inst Dev Policy Anal, Private Bag BR-29, Gaborone, Botswana",,"Seleka, TB (通讯作者)，Botswana Inst Dev Policy Anal, Private Bag BR-29, Gaborone, Botswana.",tseleka@bidpa.bw,"Seleka, Tebogo Bruce/AAA-8555-2021","Seleka, Tebogo Bruce/0000-0002-5489-1510",,,,,53,6,6,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Based on a barbell model with continuous time and repeated purchases, we find that duopoly firms sequentially enter the market and differentiate maximally on product differentiation in equilibrium. The equilibrium timing differentiation between two firms is minimized among all product location combinations of them. We also conduct welfare analysis and show that the optimal differentiation in product location is similar to the equilibrium one, but there is market failure in the choice of entry timing.

In this research we used a novel survey approach to examine the relationships between experiential and material expenditures and life satisfaction. In two studies based on crosssectional survey data from nationally representative samples in Hungary, we estimated linear and non-linear models. We found no significant evidence supporting the greater return received when buying experiences. Even in the non-linear models the difference between the marginal utilities was not statistically significant at any expenditure rate, although the marginal utility of experiential purchases appeared to be linear, whereas the marginal utility of material purchases was rather decreasing.

Employing an input-output-emission-expenditure framework, the authors find a significant difference in household carbon emissions between different affluence levels, regions and educational levels. They also find that, while many household characteristics influence emissions, total expenditure is by far the most important determinant of household emissions, both across households and over time. Consequently, emissions inequality is very similar to expenditure inequality across households. The decomposition analysis confirms that changes in emissions are predominantly due to rising expenditures between the two periods, while expenditure elasticities analysis suggests that the rise in household emissions is mainly caused by the overall rise in total household expenditure, and not by shifting consumption shares among consumption categories. The paper discusses policy options for Indonesia to reduce this very strong expenditure-emissions link.","[Irfany, Mohammad Iqbal] Georg August Univ Goettingen, Fac Econ Sci, Oeconomicum, Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Irfany, Mohammad Iqbal] Bogor Agr Univ, Int Ctr Appl Finance & Econ InterCAFE, Bogor, Indonesia; [Klasen, Stephan] Georg August Univ Goettingen, Fac Econ Sci, Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen; Bogor Agricultural University; University of Gottingen,"Irfany, MI (通讯作者)，Georg August Univ Goettingen, Fac Econ Sci, Oeconomicum, Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.;Irfany, MI (通讯作者)，Bogor Agr Univ, Int Ctr Appl Finance & Econ InterCAFE, Bogor, Indonesia.",mirfany@uni-goettingen.de; sklasen@uni-goettingen.de,"Irfany, Mohammad Iqbal/GPK-1916-2022","Irfany, Mohammad Iqbal/0000-0003-3966-4819",,,,,39,10,10,4,22,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

We are especially interested in feedback mechanisms of fuel efficiency such as the rebound effect, carbon leakage and the green paradox, but also the distributional effects for oil producers. An intertemporal numerical model of the international oil market is introduced, where OPEC-Core producers have market power. We find that the rebound effect has a noticeable effect on the transport sector, with the magnitude depending on the oil demand elasticity. In the benchmark simulations, we calculate that almost half of the energy savings may be lost to a direct rebound effect and an additional 10% to oil price adjustments. In addition, there is substantial intersectoral leakage to other sectors through lower oil prices in the regions that introduce the policy. There is a small green paradox effect in the sense that oil consumption increases initially when the fuel efficiency measures are gradually implemented. Finally, international carbon leakage will be significant if policies are not implemented in all regions; we estimate leakage rates of 35% or higher when only major consuming regions implement fuel economy policies. Non-OPEC producers will to a larger degree than OPEC producers cut back on its oil supply as a response to fuel efficiency policies due to high production costs.","[Aune, Finn Roar; Lindholt, Lars] Stat Norway, Res Dept, Oslo, Norway; [Kverndokk, Snorre] Ragnar Frisch Ctr Econ Res, Oslo, Norway; [Rosendahl, Knut Einar] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, As, Norway; [Boeng, Ann Christin] Stat Norway, Dept Natl Accounts & Ind Stat, Oslo, Norway",Statistics Norway; Norwegian University of Life Sciences; Statistics Norway,"Kverndokk, S (通讯作者)，Ragnar Frisch Ctr Econ Res, Oslo, Norway.",fau@ssb.no; abg@ssb.no; snorre.kverndokk@frisch.uio.no; lli@ssb.no; knut.einar.rosendahl@nmbu.no,,,CREE; PETROSAM program at the Research Council of Norway; ENTRACTE Project - European Union; Research Council of Norway,CREE; PETROSAM program at the Research Council of Norway; ENTRACTE Project - European Union; Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"Thanks to Cathrine Hagem, Bjart Holtsmark, three anonymous referees, the guest editors and participants at the 11th Tinbergen Institute Conference on Combating Climate Change for comments.

This paper examines the local employment effects of exposure to pessimistic economic news. By combining detailed data on newspaper subscriptions with a tabulation of negative newspaper stories, the flow of such news across the United States during the 2008 recession is reconstructed at county and quarterly levels. The resulting data set is used to estimate the causal impact of such news on unemployment, hiring, and separation rates. Exposure to pessimistic news is found to suppress hiring and total employment during the early stages of the recession by up to 40% compared to prerecession levels; such news can account for some 7% of the total reduction in employment between 2007 and 2010. Content analysis of the articles in question rules out the possibility that this relationship is driven by reverse causation, that is, newspapers merely reporting poor economic performance. Further analysis of Google search data suggests that the effect is mediated by changes in public attitude caused by exposure to negative news. These findings imply that labor market outcomes can differ due to arbitrary differences in the dispersal of economic information. Bearings on economic theory, including the notions of sunspots and animal spirits, are discussed.","[He, Zhaochen] Christopher Newport Univ, Dept Econ, Newport News, VA 23606 USA",,"He, ZC (通讯作者)，Christopher Newport Univ, Dept Econ, Newport News, VA 23606 USA.",zhaochen.he@cnu.edu,,"He, Zhaochen/0000-0002-6579-5073",,,,,30,5,5,4,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

The evidence shows that good market conditions drive firms' decisions to split shares and increase their assodated returns, but the dominant effect of macroeconomic factors on stock split announcements is business cycle variations. Firms are most likely to split their shares when they have been experiencing enough excess earnings in economic upturns. This result is more consistent with the Neoclassical Efficiency Hypothesis.

We evaluate the potential of an ETS to alter the emitting behavior of covered firms and to support the achievement of national CO2 intensity reduction targets at least cost. Specifically, we focus on two questions: (1) What factors have limited firms' past compliance with environmental policy in China, and (2) what can be done to strengthen compliance with China's national ETS? We argue that altering firm behavior will require a simultaneous effort to strengthen firms' compliance incentives through changes to national in-stitutions-in particular, a strong legal foundation for the system, a nationally unified set of measurement, reporting, and verification requirements subject to independent scrutiny, and ongoing broader economic reforms to support system operation. It will also require signaling a sustained commitment to experimentation, evaluation, and modification of the system based on performance, given that system effectiveness will depend on expectations about its longevity and credibility, but will inevitably require adjustments. We illustrate the importance of these recommendations for firm compliance behavior by drawing on the experience of the Beijing pilot ETS (2013-2015). Given vast heterogeneity across provinces, special attention should be given to strengthening institutional foundations where they are least developed alongside the construction of a national ETS.","[Karplus, Valerie J.] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Zhang, Xiliang] Tsinghua Univ, Inst Energy Environm & Econ, Beijing Shi, Peoples R China",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Tsinghua University,"Zhang, XL (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Inst Energy Environm & Econ, Beijing Shi, Peoples R China.",zhang_xl@tsinghua.edu.cn,"Zhang, Xi/HJH-1211-2023","Karplus, Valerie/0000-0001-5493-9150",National Science Foundation of China [7160244]; Samuel Tak Lee MIT Real Estate Entrepreneurship Laboratory; Energy Information Administration of the U.S. Department of Energy at MIT,National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Samuel Tak Lee MIT Real Estate Entrepreneurship Laboratory; Energy Information Administration of the U.S. Department of Energy at MIT(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"This work is partly supported by the National Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 7160244).

We show that limited tort policies create an externality on the market. Using a model of price competition where menus of contracts can be offered, and drivers choose their level of safety effort, we show that there can exist a separating equilibrium where low risks choose full tort contracts and high risks choose limited tort contracts. There also can exist pooling equilibria at the full tort or the limited tort contracts. We show that equilibria without limited tort policies and equilibria that include limited tort policies are mutually exclusive. We also show that, relative to an exclusively full tort system, a choice system is no worse and leads to a Pareto improvement if a separating or limited tort pooling equilibrium is obtained.","[Posey, Lisa L.] Penn State Univ, Dept Risk Management, 369 Business Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Thistle, Paul D.] Univ Nevada, Dept Finance, Lee Business Sch, 4505 Maryland Pkwy,Box 456008, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Las Vegas,"Posey, LL (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Dept Risk Management, 369 Business Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",llp3@psu.edu; paul.thistle@unlv.edu,,,Nevada Insurance Education Foundation,Nevada Insurance Education Foundation,"Earlier versions of this paper were presented at the Asia-Pacific Risk and Insurance Association, American Risk and Insurance Association, and Western Risk and Insurance Association conferences.

Yet, knowledge regarding the implementation of maternity provisions is essential, as such policies could significantly improve women and children's well-being. We add to this literature using fixed effects panel regression from 1999 to 2012 across 121 developing countries to explore whether different types of maternity leave policies affect infant/child mortality rates, fertility, and women's labor force participation, and whether those effects are shaped by disparities in GDP per Capita and Secondary School Enrollment. Our findings demonstrate: (1) both infant and child mortality rates are expected to decline in countries that institute any leave policy, policies that last 12 weeks or longer, and policies that increase in duration and payment (as a percentage of total annual salary), (2) fertility is expected to decline in countries that have higher weekly paid compensation, (3) maternity leave provisions decrease fertility and infant/child mortality rates most in countries with lower GDP per capita and countries with middle-range secondary enrollment rates, and (4) labor force participation does not increase.

We find that the market expects inflation to average about 2.5% over the next 30 years. Despite this, the market places substantial weight on deflation scenarios in which prices significantly decline over extended horizons. The market prices the economic tail risk of deflation similarly to other types of tail risks, such as corporate default or catastrophic insurance losses. We find that deflation risk is strongly negatively correlated with outcomes in the financial markets and with consumer confidence.","[Fleckenstein, Matthias] Univ Delaware, Lerner Coll Business & Econ, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Longstaff, Francis A.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Anderson Sch Management, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Longstaff, Francis A.; Lustig, Hanno] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Lustig, Hanno] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Management, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",University of Delaware; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; National Bureau of Economic Research; Stanford University,"Longstaff, FA (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Anderson Sch, 110 Westwood Plaza, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",francis.longstaff@anderson.ucla.edu,"Fleckenstein, Matthias/AAF-1965-2021",,,,,,79,28,30,3,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

We propose an explanation based on illiquidity and the unique advantages of operational hedges. We use 10-K filings to construct dynamically updated text-based measures of the offshore sale of output, purchase of input, and ownership of assets. We find that firms use FX derivatives when they are liquid and generally available. Otherwise, they often favor purchasing input from the same nations they sell output to, an operational hedge.

The structural disequilibrium of the workforce offer reflected in the scarcity of workforce members which have attained only a primary education level determines the need to supplement indigenous labour force by accepting and even encouraging immigration. The goal of using game theory as methodology is to estimate the strategy of player P-1 (considered to be the individual agent) in choosing a specific level of education, while taking into account the choices of future competitors on the labour market - associated in the game with collective player P-2. The resulted Nash equilibrium leads to the conclusion that an individual player, to the extent of approximately 40%, chooses to pursue a superior level of education (tertiary), while more than 95% out of total competitors opt for a similar level of education. Therefore, any version of demographic optimum for Germany, built on the principle of economic efficiency cannot afford to ignore the contribution of immigrants towards achieving the required workforce level.","[Pohoata, Ion; Crupenschi, Vladimir-Mihai; Cariman, Gabriel] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Pohoata, I (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania.",ionpohoata@yahoo.com,"Căriman, Gabriel/ABC-8939-2020; Căriman, Gabriel/P-4108-2016","Căriman, Gabriel/0000-0002-3753-2647;",,,,,33,0,0,0,1,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,AUG,2017,19.0,46,,,,,654,669,,,,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FK9UI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413856000004,0

By issuing liabilities it also creates financial assets held by other sectors of the economy for insurance or liquidity purpose. When the intermediation sector creates less liabilities or their value falls, agents are less willing to engage in activities that are individually risky but desirable in aggregate (bank liabilities channel). The paper shows how financial crises driven by self-fulfilling expectations about the liquidity of the banking sector are transmitted to the real sector of the economy.

Research on this impact is crucial for the design of hunger alleviation programs as well as for the measurement and understanding of hunger. It is also important to understand people's motivation and reaction to interventions. This paper studies the impact of hunger on four different experiences of being well: evaluative, positive affects, negative affects, and sensory. The paper distinguishes between absolute and relative effects of hunger on people's well-being. Information from the Gallup World Poll 2006 for 88 countries in the world is used to quantitatively study the well-being relevance of hunger. It is found that hunger is highly detrimental to people's well-being, which provides a justification for making substantial efforts to alleviate it. In addition, relative effects are important in the evaluative and negative-affect experiences; which means that hunger alleviation programs do not only impact positively on the well-being of those benefiting from the programs but also negatively on the well-being of those who out of different reasons are left behind. Thus, counting success on the number of people who are getting out of hunger does not provide the complete wellbeing picture, because those who are left behind may also be negatively affected by these programs. In consequence, in order to enhance their well-being impact it is important for hunger alleviation programs to be broadly inclusive, aiming not to leave anybody behind. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Our results indicate that process innovation positively affects sales growth for those firms located at the 75th and 90th percentiles. Contrarily, product innovation appears not to be a driver of firm performance.

The decomposition of the final energy consumption is assessed by analyzing effect of different drivers by the main end-users sector (industry, transport, households, agriculture, services), activity, demography, lifestyles, structural effects, energy savings etc. The results show that the reduction in final energy consumption in most EU members states before and after year 2008 can be related to the decline in energy intensities within endusers sectors. At the same time, the increase in final energy intensity after the year 2008 is attributed to expansion of energy demand sectors.

The index incorporates various channels through which a firm's executives, chairperson, directors, and other senior officers are politically connected with government officials and bureaucrats. Overall, there is a negative relation between our index and firm value for the full sample, but such negative relation mainly exists for state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and it becomes positive for non-SOEs. Furthermore, close examination shows an inverted U-shaped relation between political connections and firm value for the full sample in general and for non-SOEs in particular: Firm value increases initially at a lower level of connections and then begins to decrease at a higher level. The findings are consistent with the different business objectives and motivations of SOEs and non-SOEs in seeking political connections. Finally, our findings are robust after controlling for potential endogeneity and using an alternative headcount index construction method. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

While this accumulation has been widely perceived as precautionary savings to prevent financial crises, rising reserves might be incompatible with the goals of monetary policy. This paper assesses the consequences for monetary policy on theoretical and empirical grounds. According to the quantity theory of money, the accumulation of reserves might result in inflationary pressures if the resulting monetary expansion is not fully sterilized and exceeds the growth of money demand. Our estimation results show that the degree of sterilization has varied considerably over time. The empirical analysis of monetary and non monetary determinants of inflation provides evidence that the accumulation of reserves raises the inflation rate, both on the global and the individual-country level.

However, evidence from psychological studies suggests that the stability assumption may not always be valid, as personality traits can respond to certain life events. Our paper analyzes whether and to what extent personality traits are malleable over a time span of eight years for a sample of working individuals. Furthermore, we specifically look at changes in personality traits after a major adverse life event: involuntary job loss. We use data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) from 2004 to 2014 - a period over which individuals' Big Five personality inventory was measured three times. Our dataset allows us to exploit detailed employment information, particularly reasons for job termination and unemployment spells. We focus solely on plant closures as a reason for job termination. Job loss due to plant closure is widely used as a relatively exogenous event to identify causal effects. Our results suggest that personality traits are indeed malleable during adulthood. Although the Big Five measures are relatively stable within the overall population of workers, we find an increase in openness, that is, the willingness to seek new experiences, for the average displaced worker. This increase, however, is fully driven by individuals with high educational attainment and by those who find a new job immediately after dismissal. The other dimensions of the Big Five personality inventory remain nearly unchanged after an involuntary job loss. Our findings hold for a number of robustness checks and are supported by the results of a falsification test using a placebo treatment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

As a solution, firms have been encouraged to purchase insurance policies that, by covering legal costs in the event of a trial, serve as a commitment to litigate so that settlement terms are more favorable to the insured, and potential infringement is less likely to occur. However, very few firms are purchasing insurance and the market remains poorly developed throughout the world. I show that firms might be discouraged from buying insurance because of information asymmetries, not only with insurance companies but also with their competitors. I study the situation of a patent holder, who perfectly knows the validity and enforceability (strength) of her patent, which has been infringed by a competitor with less information on the patent. The patent holder can purchase insurance to have a credible threat to litigate and increase the infringer's settlement offer. But the decision to buy insurance conveys information about the patent strength to the infringer. As a result the patent holder may prefer not to be insured rather than transmitting this information. This signaling effect can yield different equilibriums, in particular, a pooling equilibrium no insurance where no patent holder purchases insurance. I study if this situation might be improved by imposing mandatory insurance or by giving the insurer a share of litigation proceeds.","[Duchene, Anne] IPAG Business Sch, 184 Blvd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France",IPAG Business School,"Duchêne, A (通讯作者)，IPAG Business Sch, 184 Blvd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France.",ad493@drexel.edu,,,,,,,35,7,8,6,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

Adaptive states in LDCs need to create and exploit policy space in national decision-making, build specific production capabilities to participate and meaningfully capture value in GVCs, and handle policy stretches arising from factors and actors they cannot control. In this article, we show that the outcomes of recent multilateral trade negotiations will facilitate these processes only partially. The World Trade Organization's (WTO) Bali and Nairobi Ministerial Declarations have been commonly portrayed as relative victories for developing countries, but they have not provided sufficient steps forward for LDCs. While the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement can help integration into GVCs by enabling freer imports and exports, supportive industrial policies are also needed to guide investment in the direction that allows for flexible specialization and domestic value addition these options are severely limited in the current WTO regime. The legally binding commitments made in Nairobi on rules of origin are also a positive step, but must be linked to the yet unmet duty-free and quota-free commitments. We conclude by arguing that a future agenda for LDCs should focus on supply-side constraints, as well as on allowing nimble industrial and trade policies that can facilitate meaningful participation in some GVCs and non-participation in others that are more detrimental to broad-based development.

Over the past 35 years, these laws have steadily increased mandatory child safety seat restraint ages. We exploit state-year level variation in the age until which children are required to ride in child safety seats to estimate triple difference models using Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) data from 1975 to 2011. Our findings show that increasing the age thresholds is effective in increasing the actual age of children in safety seats. Across the child-age distribution, restraint rates increase by between 10 and 30 percentage points or by between 50 and 170 percent, in the long run. We also estimate the impact of the child safety seat laws on the likelihood that a child dies in a fatal accident. We find that the laws saved up to 39 children per year. Finally, we find that the laws primarily induce compliant parents to switch from traditional seatbelt use to child safety seat use, with only small effects among parents who do not restrain their children.","[Jones, Lauren E.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Human Sci, 115E Campbell Hall,1787 Neil Ave, Columbus, OH 43206 USA; [Ziebarth, Nicolas R.] Cornell Univ, Dept Policy Anal & Management PAM, 106 Martha van Rensselaer Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Ziebarth, Nicolas R.] German Inst Econ Res DIW, Berlin, Germany; [Ziebarth, Nicolas R.] Inst Lab Econ IZA, Bonn, Germany",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Cornell University; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Jones, LE (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Human Sci, 115E Campbell Hall,1787 Neil Ave, Columbus, OH 43206 USA.",jones.2846@osu.edu; nrz2@cornell.edu,"Jones, Lauren E/GQZ-4156-2022; Ziebarth, Nicolas Robert/A-2812-2012","Jones, Lauren E/0000-0002-6236-7874; Ziebarth, Nicolas Robert/0000-0003-3562-2371",,,,,52,12,15,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

In order to facilitate such migration, central governments may need to use fiscal transfers to ensure services to migrants, address infrastructure shortfalls, and ameliorate labor market displacement of natives. In fact, an extensive, mostly normative fiscal federalism literature has argued that central governments ought to use transfers to reduce interjurisdictional externalities such as those due to population displacements. We extend this literature empirically by examining the degree to which exogenous, longterm migration prompts the redirection of central fiscal resources in India. Following the literature on distributive politics, we argue that transfers in decentralized systems addressing the costs of population movements are influenced by partisan politics. Using monsoon shocks to migration, we show that increases in migration are met with greater central transfers but that these flows are at least 50% greater if the state-level executive is in the Prime Minister's political party. Consistent with the theory, the influence of politics is greatest on parts of the budget subject to greater executive control. This politicization may explain why Indian states maintain barriers to internal migration despite the development costs of doing so. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

One solution tried to solve this problem was the regulation of mandatory use of electronic cash registers with fiscal memory. In this way, it was considered that a better highlight and also a tighter control of economic transactions will be achieved, from a fiscal point of view. In our study, we analyze, for the Romanian context in the post-EU accession, whether the mandatory introduction of these devices in recording commercial transactions has had a significant impact on VAT collection. The study includes two stages of the analysis: in the first stage we estimated the influence of VAT rate variation on the degree of the VAT collection. Then we used the residual component to test the influence of EFDs' mandatory introduction on VAT collection or on fiscal efficiency.

Notwithstanding, the literature on this issue has not significantly explored the articulation between the monetary policy and the tariff policy.

It builds a matrix that rests upon a double dichotomy, at a monetary level (hard money versus soft money), and at the tariff level (protectionism versus free trade).

SCCs are used to estimate the benefits of CO2 reductions from policies. However, little is known about the modeling underlying the values or the implied societal risks, making SCC estimates difficult to interpret and assess. This study performs the first in-depth examination of SCC modeling using controlled diagnostic experiments that yield detailed intermediate results, allow for direct comparison of individual components of the models, and facilitate evaluation of the individual model SCCs. Specifically, we analyze DICE, FUND, and PAGE and the multimodel approach used by the US Government. Through our component assessments, we trace SCC differences back to intermediate variables and specific features. We find significant variation in component-level behavior between models driven by model-specific structural and implementation elements, some resulting in artificial differences in results. These elements combine to produce model-specific tendencies in climate and damage responses that contribute to differences observed in SCC outcomes - producing PAGE SCC distributions with longer and fatter right tails and higher averages, followed by DICE with more compact distributions and lower averages, and FUND with distributions that include net benefits and the lowest averages. Overall, our analyses reveal fundamental model behavior relevant to many disciplines of climate research, and identify issues with the models, as well as the overall multimodel approach, that need further consideration. With the growing prominence of SCCs in decision-making, ranging from the local-level to international, improved transparency and technical understanding is essential for informed decisions.","[Rose, Steven K.; Diaz, Delavane B.; Blanford, Geoffrey J.] Elect Power Res Inst, Energy & Environm Anal Res Grp, 3412 Hillview Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA",Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI),"Rose, SK (通讯作者)，Elect Power Res Inst, Energy & Environm Anal Res Grp, 3412 Hillview Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA.",srose@epri.com,,"Diaz, Delavane/0000-0001-8289-0980",,,,,28,38,39,0,13,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2010-0078,2010-0086,,CLIM CHANG ECON,Clim.

We derive the reform design from an optimization program that selects one or more policy instruments and their values - among a predefined set, to minimize the welfare loss of the median voter while keeping sound public finances, sustaining gross domestic product growth and considering the welfare of the newborn generation. We calibrate the model to the Luxembourg economy. The European Commission (2012) forecasts that, among all euro area countries, Luxembourg will experience the largest increase in pension costs between now and 2060. Our simulations show that a single instrument reform would imply severe backlashes on the rest of the economy. The suggested pension reform instead consists of a policy mix including taxation, benefits and the effective retirement age. We stress the need to design pension reforms based on optimization programs that lead to the achievement of desired targets. Indeed, the reform implemented by the Luxembourg government in 2013, which does not result from an optimization program, will not keep public finances sound over the medium term.","[Bouchet, Muriel] IDEA Fdn, Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Marchiori, Luca; Pierrard, Olivier] Cent Bank Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg",,"Bouchet, M (通讯作者)，IDEA Fdn, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.",muriel.bouchet@foundation-idea.lu; luca.marchiori@bcl.lu; olivier.pierrard@bcl.lu,,"Marchiori, Luca/0000-0003-4256-2311",,,,,25,1,1,2,18,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

To shed light on this, we study the impact of Jewish Emancipation in nineteenth century Europe on patterns of education. In Germany, non-religious and Reform Jews dramatically increased their rates of education. In the less developed parts of Eastern Europe, Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox communities imposed unprecedented restrictions on secular education and isolated themselves from society. Explaining this bifurcation requires a model of education that is different from the standard human capital approach. In our model, education not only confers economic benefits but also transmits values that undermine the cultural identity of minority groups. We show that it is individually rational for agents who benefit least from rising returns to education to respond by reducing their investment in education. Group-level sanctions for high levels of education piggy back upon this effect and amplify it.","[Carvalho, Jean-Paul] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Koyama, Mark] George Mason Univ, Ctr Study Publ Choice, Carow Hall, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Sacks, Michael] West Virginia Univ, Ctr Free Enterprise, 1601 Univ Ave,POB 6025, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Sacks, Michael] West Virginia Univ, Dept Econ Business & Econ, 1601 Univ Ave,POB 6025, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine; George Mason University; West Virginia University; West Virginia University,"Koyama, M (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Ctr Study Publ Choice, Carow Hall, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",jpcarv@uci.edu; mkoyama2@gmu.edu; michael.sacks@mail.wvu.edu,"Sacks, Michael/JXN-1753-2024",,,,,,125,16,20,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,APR,2017,171.0,1-2,,,,,119,143,,10.1007/s11127-016-0400-1,0.0,,,25,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,ET4FO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000400234900018,0

To this end, I make use of a policy change in a German state that cut the number of opening hours of polling stations. Using political units from an adjacent state with the same election dates and effectively the same election system as a control group in a difference-in-differences design, I find that reducing the opening hours of polling stations significantly reduces voter turnout.","[Garmann, Sebastian] Univ Bochum, Chair Publ Finance & Econ Policy, Univ Str 150, Bochum, Germany",Ruhr University Bochum,"Garmann, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bochum, Chair Publ Finance & Econ Policy, Univ Str 150, Bochum, Germany.",sebastian.garmann@rub.de,,"Garmann, Sebastian/0000-0002-1035-4916",,,,,43,11,12,23,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,APR,2017,171.0,1-2,,,,,99,117,,10.1007/s11127-016-0399-3,0.0,,,19,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,ET4FO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000400234900017,0

This paper shows that foreign exchange interventions provide an effective instrument to relax the trilemma. An active reserve policy allows central banks to pursue independent monetary and exchange rate policies when the capital account is liberalised. We use the framework of the portfolio balance model to show that exchange market interventions may substitute for capital controls. Both allow a country to achieve the other two objectives of the trilemma. Our empirical analysis of a large country panel data set covering the period 1970-2010 confirms this theoretical insight: the weighted sum of the three trilemma objectives increases in the degree of foreign exchange market intervention. The capacity to relax the trilemma constraint has increased over time and has been most effective in emerging markets. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The discussion starts with a brief review of the standard formula and the introduction of a parsimonious partial internal model. Subsequently, we estimate empirical risk-return profiles for the main asset classes held by European insurers and run a quadratic optimization program to derive nondominated frontiers with budget, short-sale, and investment constraints. We then compute the capital charges under both solvency models and identify those efficient portfolio compositions that are permitted for an exogenously given amount of equity. Finally, we consider a systematically selected set of inefficient portfolios and check their admissibility, too. Our results show that the standard formula suffers from severe shortcomings that interfere with economically sensible asset management decisions. Therefore, the introduction of Solvency II in its current form is likely to have an adverse impact on certain parts of the European insurance sector.","[Braun, Alexander; Schmeiser, Hato; Schreiber, Florian] Univ St Gallen, Inst Insurance Econ, Tannenstr 19, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland",University of St Gallen,"Braun, A (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, Inst Insurance Econ, Tannenstr 19, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland.",alexander.braun@unisg.ch; hato.schmeiser@unisg.ch; florian.schreiber@unisg.ch,,"Braun, Alexander/0000-0003-1334-0533",,,,,36,30,32,1,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

Finally, we explore the potential economic profits that could be obtained from the observed reaction of the VIX futures to the announcement, and show that a strategy that goes short in the nearest term VIX future at the start of a trading day and closes out at the end of that day generates an average return of 10% p.a.","[Fernandez-Perez, Adrian; Frijns, Bart; Tourani-Rad, Alireza] Auckland Univ Technol, Dept Finance, Private Bag 92006, Auckland 1142, New Zealand",Auckland University of Technology,"Fernandez-Perez, A (通讯作者)，Auckland Univ Technol, Dept Finance, Private Bag 92006, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.",adrian.fernandez@aut.ac.nz,"Tourani-Rad, Alireza/AAN-5659-2021; Frijns, Bart/U-5613-2019","Frijns, Bart/0000-0002-6586-1042; Fernandez-Perez, Adrian/0000-0002-9433-7194",,,,,37,28,29,1,7,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5398,1879-1727,,J EMPIR FINANC,J.

We investigate this link in the context of CEO turnover. Our theoretical model predicts that, when the board's monitoring intensity and the informed trader's information decision are jointly endogenized, stock price informativeness is negatively related to the board's monitoring effort. Our empirical tests provide supporting evidence for this negative effect. Moreover, using the passage of the Sarbanes- Oxley Act (SOX) as a quasi- natural experiment, we find that SOX, while strengthening corporate governance, has a negative effect on stock price informativeness, especially among firms with complex organizational structures.","[Gorton, Gary B.] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Gorton, Gary B.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Huang, Lixin] Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Kang, Qiang] Florida Int Univ, Miami, FL 33199 USA",Yale University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; State University System of Florida; Florida International University,"Gorton, GB (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.;Gorton, GB (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"Huang, Li/IUQ-0909-2023; Kang, Qiang/GRO-4872-2022","Kang, Qiang/0000-0002-6154-3514",,,,,61,11,12,3,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

To shed light on this question I study China's High Speed Railway (HSR), an unprecedentedly large-scale network that connected 81 cities from 2003 to 2014 with trains running at speeds over 200 km/h. Using a difference-in-differences approach, I find that an HSR connection increases city-wide passenger flows by 10% and employment by 7%. To deal with the issues of endogenous railway placement and simultaneous public investments accompanying HSR connection, I examine the impact of a city's market access changes purely driven by the HSR connection of other cities. The estimates suggest that HSR-induced expansion in market access increases urban employment with an elasticity between 2 and 2.5. Further evidence on sectoral employment suggests that industries with a higher reliance on nonroutine cognitive skills benefit more from HSR-induced market access to other cities.

The Rebound Effect in International Transfers of Technology,ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ENVIRONMENTAL-POLICY; GROWTH; SPILLOVERS; PROGRESS; CURVE; RISE,"Technological change and its transfer to developing countries is often portrayed by policy-makers as a critical part of the solution to a resource problem such as climate change, based on the assumption that the transfer of resource-conserving technologies to developing countries will result in reduced use of natural capital by those countries. We demonstrate here, in a capital conversion based model of development, that the free transfer of resource-conserving technologies to developing countries will increase the options available to those countries, but that the way that they expend these options need not be in the direction of conserving resources. This is another example of the potential for a rebound effect to determine ultimate outcomes, here in the context of international technology transfer policy. The transfer of technologies is as likely to simply move developing countries more rapidly down the same development path as it is to alter the choices they make along that path. For this reason, the transfer of resource-conserving technologies, without incentives provided to alter development priorities, may not result in any resource-conservation at all.","[Sarr, Mare] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Swanson, Tim] Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Dept Int Econ, Case Postale 136, CH-1211 Geneva 21, Switzerland; [Swanson, Tim] Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, CIES, Case Postale 136, CH-1211 Geneva 21, Switzerland",University of Cape Town,"Sarr, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa.",mare.sarr@uct.ac.za; tim.swanson@graduateinstitute.ch,,"Sarr, Mare/0000-0002-5903-7102",Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF); South African National Research Foundation (NRF) through the Swiss-South Africa Joint Research Programme (SSAJRP); South African Department of Science and Technology; Economic Research Southern Africa,Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); South African National Research Foundation (NRF) through the Swiss-South Africa Joint Research Programme (SSAJRP); South African Department of Science and Technology; Economic Research Southern Africa,"We are grateful to two anonymous referees for their insightful comments.

This paper conceptualizes this in a framework in which a city can produce non-tradable goods and - if it is sufficiently competitive - also internationally tradable goods, potentially subject to increasing returns to scale. A city is unlikely to produce tradables if it faces high urban and hinterland demand for non-tradables, or high costs of urban infrastructure and construction. The paper shows that, if there are increasing returns in tradable production, there may be multiple equilibria. The same initial conditions can support dichotomous outcomes, with cities either in a low-level (non-tradable only) equilibrium, or diversified in both tradable and non-tradable production. We demonstrate the importance of history and of expectations in determining outcomes. Essentially, a city can be built in a manner which makes it difficult to attract tradable production. This might be a consequence of low (and self-fulfilling expectations) or of history. Predictions of the model are consistent with a number of observed features of African cities.

Our findings suggest that securitization is negatively related to various proxies of economic activity-even prior to the crisis of 2007-2009. We explain this finding as the results of securitization spurring consumption at the expense of investment and capital formation. Consistent with this, we find that securitization of household loans is negatively associated with economic activity, whereas business securitization displays a weak positive association with it, and that household securitization increases an economy's consumption-investment ratio. Our results inform recent initiatives aimed at reviving securitization markets, as they indicate that the impact of securitization crucially depends on the underlying collateral.

Productivity spillovers at the firm level have been identified as a key element in the process by which FDI stimulates economic growth. Moreover, there is evidence of FDI-related productivity spillovers in China. Whether these spillovers have been of sufficient size to affect growth at the aggregate level, however, is an empirical question. We apply meta-analysis to the corresponding empirical literature to find an answer. Our main finding is that the effect of FDI on Chinese economic growth is much smaller than one would expect from a naive aggregation of existing estimates. Publication bias and a profusion of estimates based on less preferred study and sample characteristics have served to inflate observed estimates. Once these effects are accounted for, the estimated effect of FDI on Chinese economic growth is reduced to statistical insignificance. This suggests that the cause(s) of the Chinese economic miracle likely lie elsewhere. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Gunby, Philip; Reed, W.

The anticipated disturbances are identified using Treasury bond yield data in estimating a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with a term structure of interest rates. Our estimation results show that the Fed's decisions were unanticipated for market participants until 1999, but thereafter a larger portion of its future policy actions tended to be communicated in advance. We also find that the relative contribution of the anticipated monetary policy disturbances to macroeconomic fluctuations became larger after 1999.

The results show that during the study period the world markets for copper, iron, lead, tin, and zinc were characterized by oligopolistic behavior.

His research has advanced our understanding of the relationship between firm-level innovation, entry and exit on the one hand, and productivity and growth on the other. Aghion has thus accomplished to bridge theoretical macroeconomic growth models with a more complete and consistent microeconomic setting. He is one of the founding fathers of the pioneering and original contribution referred to as Schumpeterian growth theory. Philippe Aghion has not only contributed with more sophisticated theoretical models, but also provided empirical evidence regarding the importance of entrepreneurial endeavours for societal prosperity, thereby initiating a more nuanced policy discussion concerning the interdependencies between entrepreneurship, competition, wealth and growth.","[Karlsson, Charlie] Blekinge Inst Technol, S-37141 Karlskrona, Sweden; [Karlsson, Charlie] Jonkoping Int Business Sch, CESIS, Jonkoping, Sweden; [Acs, Zoltan J.] LSE, London, England; [Acs, Zoltan J.] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA USA; [Braunerhjelm, Pontus] Swedish Entrepreneurship Forum, Stockholm, Sweden; [Braunerhjelm, Pontus] Royal Inst Technol, KTH, Stockholm, Sweden",Blekinge Institute Technology; Jonkoping University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; George Mason University; Royal Institute of Technology,"Karlsson, C (通讯作者)，Blekinge Inst Technol, S-37141 Karlskrona, Sweden.;Karlsson, C (通讯作者)，Jonkoping Int Business Sch, CESIS, Jonkoping, Sweden.",charlie.karlsson@ju.se,"acs, zoltan j/I-5496-2013; Karlsson, Charlie/JQP-0947-2023","braunerhjelm, pontus/0000-0003-0218-7924","Swedish Entrepreneurship Forum (Foundation for Small Business Research, FSF); Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth (Nutek); Swedish Innovation Agency (Vinnova); Stockholms Kopmansklubb","Swedish Entrepreneurship Forum (Foundation for Small Business Research, FSF); Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth (Nutek); Swedish Innovation Agency (Vinnova)(Vinnova); Stockholms Kopmansklubb","The Global Award is a direct continuation of the International Award for Entrepreneurship and Small Business Research, first launched in 1996 by the Swedish Entrepreneurship Forum (then Foundation for Small Business Research, FSF) and the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth (Nutek).

This captures the impact of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). These markets are represented by the following major indices: The Shanghai composite and the Hangseng. (in the case of China, as both China and Hong Kong appear in Australian trade statistics), the S & P500 index, the Nikkei225 and the Kospi index. We apply the Diebold and Yilmaz (2009) Spillover Index, constructed in a VAR framework, to assess spillovers across these markets in returns and in volatilities. The analysis confirms that the US and Hong Kong markets have the greatest influence on the Australian one. We then move to a GARCH framework to apply further analysis and apply a tri-variate Cholesky-GARCH model to explore the effects from the US and Chinese market, as represented by the Hang Seng Index. We further explore three sample sub-periods, Pre-GFC 2004/1/1/until 2007/07/08/, GFC 2007/08/09 until 2010/05/07 and Post-GFC 2010/05/10 until 2014/06/20 and analyse the behaviour of time-varying conditional correlations in these sub -periods. The GARCH analysis re-affirms the strong influence of the Hang Seng Index and the S & P500 Index.","[Allen, David E.] Univ Sydney, Sch Math & Stat, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Allen, David E.] Univ South Australia, Ctr Appl Financial Studies, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [McAleer, Michael] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Coll Technol Management, Dept Quantitat Finance, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan; [McAleer, Michael] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Inst Econometr, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Powell, Robert J.; Singh, Abhay K.] Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Business & Law, Churchlands, WA 6018, Australia; [McAleer, Michael] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Quantitat Econ, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [McAleer, Michael] Univ Canterbury, Dept Math & Stat, Christchurch, New Zealand; [McAleer, Michael] Yokohama Natl Univ, Inst Adv Sci, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan",University of Sydney; University of South Australia; National Tsing Hua University; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Edith Cowan University; Complutense University of Madrid; University of Canterbury; Yokohama National University,"Allen, DE (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Math & Stat, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.;Allen, DE (通讯作者)，Univ South Australia, Ctr Appl Financial Studies, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.",profallen2007@gmail.com,"Singh, Abhay/AAG-9813-2021; McAleer, Michael/A-2407-2008; McAleer, Michael/K-8780-2019; Allen, David/AAM-9744-2021; Allen, David/JTV-4098-2023","Singh, Abhay/0000-0002-3783-6325; Powell, Robert/0000-0003-3634-1264","Australian Research Council, Australia [DP110102884]; Australian Research Council; National Science Council, Taiwan; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","Australian Research Council, Australia(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); National Science Council, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)","For financial support, the first author acknowledges the Australian Research Council, Australia (Grant no.

It is achieved by intensive usage of communication tools and formalized process's workflows that are integrated with technological solutions. Even for small and medium-sized enterprises that has a high necessity for agility in their business processes, the cloud technologies can provide ubiquitous availability and flexibility. However, an efficient business process is not always effective. It is not enough to perform tasks in an optimal way, a successful enterprise must do the right activities in the most optimal way. The responsibility to make the right decision in the right time is placed on employee's shoulders. The aim of the research was to ascertain how e-learning may facilitate business process effectiveness in small and medium-sized enterprises and to identify the descriptive requirements that are specific for small and medium-sized enterprises. The research was based on the analysis of small and medium-sized enterprise's characteristics, such as business process agility, high turnover rate, high bus factor and horizontal enterprise structure. As a result, it was found out that the key knowledge of enterprise business processes is dissipated and unorganized. The key finding of the research is a set of the requirements to which the e-learning solution must comply in order to satisfy the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises. E-learning solution can serve as an enterprise's knowledge database that is accessible at any place with the Internet connection on any device at any convenient time, and its content can be used up-to-date for enterprise's needs. It is considered that using a corresponding e-learning solution the enterprise will put in order its knowledge management and improve competence of employees that will promote the enterprise's growth. The recommendation for further studies is to validate the findings a by field experiment using either an existing solution or a prototype that include the defined set of requirements.","[Balina, Signe; Salna, Edgars; Baumgarte, Dace] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Balina, S (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,3,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-286-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,40,47,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393400004,0

It is one of the first studies using 36 indicators within the context of three South-American countries. It fulfills the lack of knowledge at the scientific work and its practical objective by identifying the factors that public policy may take into consideration urgently to improve the global competitiveness level of the countries for a sustainable development and considerations for a long-term integration. Design/methodology/approach - It analyzes data of four-year average of international sources such as: The International Monetary Fund, The World Bank, The United Nations, among others. The factors were selected after a careful literature review, the final selection and the weight of each determinant was calculated using partial least squares-structural equation modeling. The calculation of the national and international competitiveness indexes used the double diamond for competitiveness theoretical frame. Findings - From a national perspective, it was found that COL is the most competitive country followed by PER in the second place and ECU is in third. Internationally, the authors have found also that COL is the most competitive economy, PER in second place and ECU is in third. Research limitations/implications - This study has found that in order to improve the level of national competitiveness, ECU has to concentrate on improving and strengthening formal and non-formal institutions, which are reflected in: four factors, PER four, and COL three. To reach international competitiveness, ECU should improve four factors, PER five, and COL five formal and non-formal institutions. Practical implications - This research is the first one on its field, it uses 36 competitiveness indexes and the PLS-SEM statistic methodology to assign the weight of competitive indicators and the DD theoretical frame to determine the relevance of its factors and it is oriented to advise decision-makers and provides the appropriate police guidelines for the national competitiveness strategy and improve their quality of life of its residents from: ECU-COL-PER. On the other hand, the academic implications of these results appear when calculating the weight-load competitiveness indexes using inferential multivariate analysis; it provides researchers and practitioners an analysis tool for comparing competitive factors of emerging countries from the DD approach without any weaknesses, as a framework to assist in formulating economic policy at the national and regional level. Social implications - Due to the difficulty of competitiveness operationalization, this research uses PLS-SEM to correlate its factors as the statistical methodology and the DD as the tool for the identification of theoretical indicators. This work may be taken into consideration for an immediate and sustainable improvement in order to win competitiveness than its neighbors. Originality/value - This study is unique because the factors were selected after a careful literature review; the final selection and the weight of each determinant was calculated using PLS-SEM. The calculation of the national and international competitiveness indexes used the DD for competitiveness theoretical framework applied for the first time in a research for South America with 36 determinants. The result of this analysis compares the weak and strong determinants of these three member countries of UNASUR for the development of their complementarities and therefore the recommendations of public policy.","[Castro-Gonzales, Segundo J.; Espina, Maritza I.] Univ Este, IEN Business Sch, Carolina, PR 00984 USA; [Tinoco-Egas, Raquel M.] Univ Tecn Machala, Fac Ciencias Empresariales Machala, Machala, Ecuador",,"Castro-Gonzales, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ Este, IEN Business Sch, Carolina, PR 00984 USA.",scastro50@suagm.edu,"Espina, Maritza/JUV-6936-2023; Tinoco-Egas, Raquel/E-1550-2015","Tinoco-Egas, Raquel/0000-0001-5979-8123","Prometeo Program of the National Secretary of Higher Education, Science and Technology (SENESCYT) - Ecuador","Prometeo Program of the National Secretary of Higher Education, Science and Technology (SENESCYT) - Ecuador","This research was sponsored by Prometeo Program of the National Secretary of Higher Education, Science and Technology (SENESCYT) - Ecuador.",,40,5,5,4,31,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

In particular, we measured the brain activity-through the electroencephalogram (EEG)-and the eye gaze of individuals visiting specific areas of a supermarket, and focused particularly on the purchase of some products in the fruit and vegetables department. The group was equally divided according to the occupation (50% workers and 50% non-workers), and chosen on the basis of specific socio-demographic features and of intrinsic characteristics, like the sensitivity to local rather than global food. Comparisons of neuro-and biometric indices previously defined (pleasantness, memorization, interest and, emotion) have been performed to highlight differences between the customers' perception of the products-also compared to other product categories. Findings show how EEG methodologies, along with the measurements of autonomic variables, could be used to obtain information not obtainable otherwise with verbal interviews. The analysis of the emotions aroused during the shopping experience, investigated with modern techniques of brain-marketing, could help to analyze the perception of fruit and vegetable products-whose consumption is in decline in Italy since this is not an 'emotionally appealing' product category-according to the consumer's actions and emotions.","[Cherubino, Patrizia; Caratu, Myriam; Modica, Enrica; Rossi, Dario; Maglione, Anton Giulio; Babiloni, Fabio] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Med Mol, Viale Regina Elena 291, I-00161 Rome, Italy; [Cherubino, Patrizia; Trettel, Arianna; Maglione, Anton Giulio; Babiloni, Fabio] BrainSigns Srl, Via Sesto Celere 7-C, I-00152 Rome, Italy; [Della Casa, Roberto; Dall'Olio, Michele; Quadretti, Raffaella] Agroter, Via Amendola,10-1 Loc Montale Rangone, I-41051 Modena, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Cherubino, P (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Med Mol, Viale Regina Elena 291, I-00161 Rome, Italy.;Cherubino, P (通讯作者)，BrainSigns Srl, Via Sesto Celere 7-C, I-00152 Rome, Italy.",patrizia.cherubino@brainsigns.com; myriam.caratu@brainsigns.com; enrica.modica@uniroma1.it; dario.rossi@uniroma1.it; arianna.trettel@brainsigns.com; antongiulio.maglione@uniroma1.it; roberto@agroter.net; michele@agroter.net; raffaella@agroter.net; fabio.babiloni@brainsigns.com,"Caratù, Myriam/Y-2088-2019; Caratù, Myriam/E-3757-2019","Caratù, Myriam/0000-0003-1635-1107; Caratù, Myriam/0000-0003-1635-1107; Cherubino, Patrizia/0000-0001-7669-5855",,,,,14,8,8,0,11,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-62938-4; 978-3-319-62937-7,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,293,307,,10.1007/978-3-319-62938-4_19,0.0,,,15,"Economics; Psychology, Multidisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Psychology,BK3HF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000435015000019,0

The goal of this paper is to find scientific research based evidence that proves or disapproves such correlation and in case of positive conclusion, to draw the list of specific character traits associated with high engagement that can be successfully used to perform more efficient recruitment for organizations. Consultants, Researchers and Human Resources Management professionals around the globe are spending enormous time and effort to solve the puzzle of employee engagement. According to research (Gallup, PWC, etc.), both, public and private sector organizations that report higher employee engagement levels, achieve by far better results. Still, despite of all the effort, vast number of sources (Gallup, TNS, Bersin by Deloitte and many others) quote global average engagement level as low as 13%. Organizations spend millions each year on trying to understand secrets for higher employee engagement and on investments in work environment improvements to achieve it, as research quotes as much as 33% higher profitability for companies with engaged employees. According to Josh Bersin, founder of Bersin by Deloitte, more than 120 vendors are now providing pulse survey tools, employee mood monitoring systems, and culture and engagement assessments. However, one important element in this equation is in most cases forgotten - personality of individual employee. Perhaps, there is little that companies can do to drive engagement, if certain personality traits are missing in their employees? Perhaps, the answer to the ongoing debate around more engaged workforce is not found within what companies can do to raise engagement of their existing workforce. Perhaps, the answer is in what kind of people companies should hire if they care about high engagement levels. To support the findings from theoretical research, article includes analysis of short survey results, as well as considers possibilities to support and trigger individuals' engagement through a smart use of modern technology.","[Ergle, Daiga; Vorontchuk, Inesa] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Ergle, D (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,5,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-286-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,189,197,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393400019,0

Design/methodology/approach - In total, 411 IBG firms were identified based on born global (BG) definition and post-entry internationalization age requirement of this study. A balanced panel comprising of three years from 2010 to 2012 was analyzed using pooled panel and moderated multiple regression techniques. Findings - The authors empirically prove that though EI and financial performance are positively related at overall level, this relationship is curvilinear in nature. In presence of foreign equity this positive curvilinear relationship is moderated to inverted-U shape. Research limitations/implications - The data sample is restricted to 411 private limited IBGs between the years 2009 and 2012. Implications of the findings are for policy makers and managers to sharpen their strategic foresight for exporting firms in its post-entry period. Also, investors can take level of internationalization into cognizance when investing in BG firms. Practical implications - The authors believe the results have practical implications for numerous parties, such as shareholders, institutional investors, scholars, policymakers and managers. It emboldens modern day managers to make further foray into internationalization due to its positive benefits on both productivity as well as profitability. Also, firms that look for foreign equity participation have to balance their strategies for greater scale and scope into international markets. Originality/value - This is the first study that brings out the vital relationship aspect of EI with financial performance of IBG firms in their post-entry internationalization period, adding to international business literature in area of BG firms in their post-entry internationalization period.","[Ganvir, Manish B.; Dwivedi, Neeraj] Indian Inst Management, Dept Strateg Management, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Lucknow,"Ganvir, MB (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Management, Dept Strateg Management, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India.",fpm10008@iiml.ac.in,"Dwivedi, Neeraja/IAM-3777-2023","Dwivedi, Neeraja/0000-0003-0194-1630",,,,,78,12,12,2,40,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

We find that motives have varied over time; vulnerability to current account shocks was relatively important in the 1980s but, as EMEs became more financially integrated, factors related to the magnitude of potential capital outflows gained importance. Reserve accumulation as a by-product of undervalued currencies has also become more important since the Asian crisis. Correspondingly, using quantile regressions, we find that the reason for holding reserves varies according to the country's position in the global reserves distribution. High-reserve holders, who tend to be more financially integrated, are motivated by insurance against capital account rather than current account shocks and are more sensitive to the cost of holding reserves than are low reserve holders. Currency undervaluation is a significant determinant across the reserves distribution, albeit for different reasons.","[Ghosh, Atish R.; Tsangarides, Charalambos G.] IMF, Res Dept, Suite 9-612G,700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Ostry, Jonathan D.] IMF, Res Dept, Suite 10-700F,700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund; International Monetary Fund,"Ghosh, AR (通讯作者)，IMF, Res Dept, Suite 9-612G,700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",aghosh@imf.org; jostry@imf.org; ctsangarides@imf.org,,,,,,,39,14,17,0,2,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

Making sure public transport users are satisfied with the service is a goal many public transport agencies are trying to achieve. Customer satisfaction surveys are often used to monitor customer perceptions of service quality and to determine the relative influence of service attributes on a customer's overall assessment of the service. This study presents a new method to spatially evaluate customer satisfaction survey data through examining satisfaction with bus service across neighbourhoods of varying levels of socio-economic status (SES). Using customer satisfaction survey data collected by Transport for London between 2010 and 2015, multi-level regression modeling is used to estimate the relationship between overall satisfaction and social deprivation of the area in which bus routes were operating. The results indicate lower levels of satisfaction along routes serving low SES neighbourhoods, which appears to be attributed to (1) low satisfaction with service characteristics related to an individual's experience and quality of the bus and (2) conditions of the bus stop and shelter. Findings from this paper shows the importance of including cleanliness and bus internal quality as one of the performance indicators when contracting bus services, to ensure that all customers receive the same quality of service in the region regardless of their SES.

In April 2016, the Advice on Supporting Banking Financial Institutions to Start the Investment and Loan Linkage Pilot to Tech-innovation Companies was released, setting 5 national innovative pilot areas and approving 10 banks to carry out the business in those 5 areas. However, restricted with separated operation, commercial banks lack experience in equity investment and its risk control, and they haven't built the risk management systems for investment and loan linkage. Thus, research on risk management of investment and loan linkage business of China's commercial banks is of great importance. Based on risk management theory, this paper identifies the risks existing in commercial bank investment and loan linkage business, including credit risk, law risk and risk caused by unsound isolating mechanism and so on. Then, it analyses the reasons for such risks, including imperfect policy and regulation, mismatching term structure of capital and the information asymmetry. Finally, this paper puts forward the risk management strategies of investment and loan linkage business in the domestic commercial banks.

In this article, poverty is defined as a discriminatory factor that condemns a person to hardship from cradle to grave, and thus contradicts the human rights to life and a dignified existence. The paper summarizes the results of sociological research investigating the public perception of poverty as a discriminatory factor. The outcome is the finding that quite a large proportion of the population still do not consider poverty to be a discriminatory factor in a person's life, and a marked section of the population have no opinion on this issue. The priority for scientists looking into poverty and its impact on human rights should be to place greater stress on the severity of the problem and to explain it to the public more thoroughly - in co-operation with the media, through campaigns, etc.","[Krebs, Vojtech; Barak, Vladimir] Univ Econ, Fac Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Krebs, V (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",krebs@vse.cz; vladimir.barak@vse.cz,,,project of the internal grant competition VSE v Praze Socialni bydleni 2015 - 2025: hospodarsko-politicka doporuceni [F5/66/2016 (IG504046)],project of the internal grant competition VSE v Praze Socialni bydleni 2015 - 2025: hospodarsko-politicka doporuceni,This paper was created within the project of the internal grant competition VSE v Praze Socialni bydleni 2015 - 2025: hospodarsko-politicka doporuceni.

First, based on the economic loss, disaster area and deaths data caused by flood disaster in China during 2004-2013, we respectively estimate and fit the marginal distributions of three events, and combine them with Copula function to fit two joint probability distribution functions, one function is with respect to property loss and disaster area, the other is with respect to property loss and mortality.

In fact, Sustainable Development is not a new concept, but it is embedded in the fundamental codes of conduct in Islamic Societies and Laws through Shari'ah. The objectives are: a) a literature review of Islamic CSR b) a qualitative comparative analysis between Islamic CSR (ICSR) and conventional CSR c) a documental analysis of the Islamic network that implements CSR strategies, policies, and practices in Islamic Societies (IRI-Islamic Reporting Initiatives) supported by an ad-hoc interview held with an IRI's Staff member. The conclusion of this research discusses the perspective of Islamic view in sustainability reporting by incorporating the concept of Tawhid which provides a holistic guidance based on Islamic beliefs, values and concepts and, in specific, the main differences between western and Islamic Corporate Sustainability Reporting perspective.

This ambition has generated unprecedented commitment of political support and financial funds for the forest-development sector. Many academics and people-centered advocacy organizations have conceptualized REDD+ as an example of green grabbing and have voiced fears of a potential global rush for land and trees. In this paper we argue that, in practice and up until now, REDD+ resembles longstanding dynamics of the development and conservation industry, where the promise of change becomes a discursive commodity that is constantly reproduced and used to generate value and appropriate financial resources. We thus argue for a re-conceptualization of REDD+ as a conservation fad within the broader political economy of development and conservation. We derive this argument from a study that compares the emergence of REDD+ in Tanzania with that of a previous forest-policy model called Participatory Forest Management. Our study describes how the advent of REDD+ implies change at the discursive level, but also continuity and repetitiveness in terms of the initial promises and expectations leading to substantial donor financing, pilot project activities, and policy development and implementation processes. In both epochs, these have achieved little in terms of changing actual forest management and use on the ground outside selected pilot project sites, but have sustained the livelihoods of actors within the development and conservation industry, including academics. Given that there are still many who look to REDD+ in the hope of addressing global climate change, despite less than hoped for financial support at the global level, our study provides an important starting point for questioning the uses of the finances for REDD+ that are actually amassed.

Furthermore, the purpose of this study is to augment the research on shared leadership that is still in its developing stages. An emotionally mindful leader enhances organisational performance and behaviour due to the prevailing climate of trust. Positive emotions can reduce absenteeism, improve levels of effort, health and energy, all of which influence the levels of performance. The methodology in this study is centred on the pragmatic paradigm. An adapted version of the Anderson et al (2008) questionnaire was disseminated in an Information Technology company. This case study endeavours to ascertain how leadership self-efficacy might influence shared leadership and affect organisational performance in this SME. This study includes the premise that managers who have self-reported ratings for the self-efficacy leadership attributes cluster will demonstrate a higher probability of improving both perceived and actual employee performance. The results of this study demonstrate that emphasis seems to be positioned on the problem-solving attributes cluster of leadership self-efficacy. These attributes may have a positive impact on the organisational performance as a whole. A limitation of this research is the case study.

This research shows the mechanisms that allow the development of organizational capacities in rural communities as a response to the needs of each territory, so that these micro initiatives favor global business development, integrating the three dimensions of local space: Culture, the economy and society. The traditional vision had a functional approach that conceived the development of the rural sector, from its capacity of support of resources and supply of agricultural products to the most populated sectors and more developed areas. The new vision involves the development of a territorial community as the set of resources (economic, human, institutional and cultural) that constitute its own development potential and presents the associativity as a response to the different interrelations between territorial agents: networking, collaboration, adapted common strategy. In this research we will see how these processes of change, entrepreneurship and innovation merit a deep and respectful knowledge of the traditional and cultural elements, resorting to both endogenous and exogenous factors, without obviating that the process of change belongs to the local actors who are the ones Have the capacity to transform the territory with their participation.","[Munoz Aroca, Annie; Verzosi Vargas, Carolina] Univ Guayaquil, Fac Ciencias Econ, Guayaquil, Ecuador; [Verzosi Vargas, Paulina] Univ Estatal Milagro, Fac Adm, Milagro, Ecuador",Universidad Estatal de Milagro,"Aroca, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Guayaquil, Fac Ciencias Econ, Guayaquil, Ecuador.",annie.munoza@ug.edu.ec; carolina_verzosi@hotmail.com; pvpaulinaverzosi@gmail.com,"Vargas, Víctor/HZI-6293-2023",,,,,,8,0,0,0,4,EDITORAL UNIV ABYA-YALA,CUENCA,"12 OCTUBRE N24-22 Y WILSON, CUENCA, CP170525, ECUADOR",,,978-9978-10-274-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,51,67,,,,,,17,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BM4OB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000463697000003,0

This phenomenon can be an opportunity for development because it is a factor of human and economic change and also because it allows people to achieve their aspirations. This paper provides a comprehensive picture of emigration, immigration, and remittance flows for European countries and territories, drawing on authoritative, publicly available data. The study was based on the experience of the authors in the areas addressed and was carried out through a rigorous analysis of the trends in the field of migration. International migration is a reality that will continue to exist as long as there are welfare and development disparities between different regions of the world, as there will be economic, political and social problems. In order to achieve this, we have analyzed data collected from various sources, including national censuses, labor force surveys, and population registers. Within the paper, we also approach some perspectives regarding the interaction between the phenomena of migration and features of the knowledge economy. Another section of the paper argues the effects of migration at the family-community level, presenting the negative influence of migration on the demographic structure and the positive influence in terms of economic and developmental aspects.

The paper is supported by the results of the analysis of twelve interviews with human resources specialists responsible for recruitment and selection. The aim is to explore recruitment and selection opportunities, challenges and tendencies considering the continuous development of online media, which has transferred HRM activities in this new sector.

From the psychological point of view decision making is a process where cognitive, emotional and motivational aspects play a vital role. Studies on the brain magnetic nuclear resonance imaging reveal that decision-making processes begin before an individual is able to realize it. Neurochemistry has identified several neurotransmitters that are differently associated with decision-making processes, the most important ones being dopamine, serotonin, cortisol, oxytocin and prolactin. Due to a complicated nature of neurotransmitters, the mechanisms that implicate their production are to fully understood yet and it is still not quite known how they work. From the neurochemical perspective, the control of decision-making processes is determined by good communication among different parts of the brain that is regulated by the levels of serotonin. Decision making is a complex process which is possible due to processes taking place in many parts of our brain. However, neuroanatomically speaking, it is the prefrontal cortex that plays a pivotal role in coordinating these processes. To some extent decision making is based on an assumption that people are able to predict other people's behavior and step into their shoes. This capability results from individual preferences and beliefs. Social neuroscience allows us to see neural mechanisms underlying the human ability to represent our intentions. Neurobiology, in turn, strives to explain how relevant moral decisions appear in our brains and how they can modify our emotions. Studies on neurobiological background of our decision-making processes give us better insight into the presumably bounded human rationality as well as into the role of emotions, morality and empathy. Also, these studies contribute to our knowledge about the course of decision-making processes and their adaptive value.","[Potemkowski, Andrzej] Dept Clin Psychol & Psychoprophylaxis, Krakowska 71-79, PL-70019 Szczecin, Poland",,"Potemkowski, A (通讯作者)，Dept Clin Psychol & Psychoprophylaxis, Krakowska 71-79, PL-70019 Szczecin, Poland.",andrzej.potemkowski@wp.pl,,,,,,,67,1,1,0,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-62938-4; 978-3-319-62937-7,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,3,18,,10.1007/978-3-319-62938-4_1,0.0,,,16,"Economics; Psychology, Multidisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Psychology,BK3HF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000435015000001,0

Using the advanced statistical methods from the time series analysis adaptive approaches domain, long-term tendencies of farmland fund structure development have been described over the 1999-2015 years, as considered in the context of historical data from 1920-2015, and future development forecasts have been constructed. Two exponential smoothing methods have been applied in the forecasts for non-seasonal time series with local linear trend (the Holt method) and the double exponential smoothing (the Brown method). The solution starts from identification and analysis of relevant factors causing reduction of area and degradation of farmland, especially the loss of arable land. Primarily these are: area development, changes in the forest land area, water and wind erosion, soil compaction, acidification, dehumification and soil contamination.

Considering the 80% self-sufficiency in the basic foodstuffs production it is necessary to preserve the soil production capabilities not only by its protection but by the economically tolerable structure, too.

The impact of financial literacy on retirement planning is a well-established issue in the existing empirical literature; our main contribution is proving that financial knowledge not only impacts retirement planning, but also the decisions of entering a private pension scheme (or devoting the severance pay to a private pension scheme). Adding the consideration of trust poses serious econometric concerns, since both financial literacy and trust in financial institutions are likely to be endogenous and the presence of two endogenous regressors renders the identification of causality very difficult. Our solution is to keep only financial literacy as endogenous and include in our models an exogenous regional indicator of social capital (similar to the one adopted by Guiso et al., 2004), as a proxy for the level of trust between the counterparts of a financial contract in each geographical area. Our main findings show that trust has a positive influence on both the decisions to enter a private pension scheme or to devote the severance pay to a private pension scheme.","[Ricci, Ornella; Caratelli, Massimo] Univ Rome Tre, Business Studies, Rome, Italy",Roma Tre University,"Ricci, O (通讯作者)，Univ Rome Tre, Business Studies, Rome, Italy.",ornella.ricci@uniroma3.it,"Ricci, Ornella/I-5371-2019","Ricci, Ornella/0000-0001-6853-471X",,,,,26,24,26,5,53,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

Regional planning and policy development depend on accurate sustainability assessment for the estimation of genesis and evolution of agribusiness clusters. The lack of a universal methodology creates challenges for the analysis of regional issues and the role of separate industries in the sustainability of regional development. This research suggests and reviews the application of Regional Sustainability Assessment Methodology (RSAM) by using a case study approach with a special attention to agribusiness clusters. The empirical analyses reveal the importance of resource cycling in the regions, their dependency on external resources and self-sufficiency as indicators of regional sustainability (social, economic and environmental resource use efficiency) in a dynamic perspective, applicable to diverse regions and separate aspects of sustainability. The study areas include three sub-national level regions in Germany: two forming an agribusiness cluster, specialized in livestock-meat production (Vechta Landkreis and Cloppenburg Landkreis) and one control region (Hochsauerlandkreis). The application of RSAM revealed varying rates of resource use efficiency, self-sufficiency and dependency on external resources for both static and dynamic perspectives. The assessment indicated the potential of RSAM application for the static and dynamic assessment of regions with agribusiness clusters. At the same time, static analysis of separate aspects of sustainability (economic, social and environmental) was not informative. RSAM application to the separate types of resource analysis allowed identification of sustainability hotspots (unbalanced development, weak sustainability and increased dependency on separate resources).","[Smetana, Sergiy; Heinz, Volker] German Inst Food Technol, Quakenbruck, Germany; [Tamasy, Christine] Univ Vechta, Vechta, Germany; [Mathys, Alexander] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Smetana, S (通讯作者)，German Inst Food Technol DIL eV, Prof von Klitzing Str 7, D-49610 Quakenbruck, Germany.",s.smetana@dil-ev.de,"Smetana, Sergiy/K-6224-2019; Smetana, Sergiy/B-2514-2012; Mathys, Alexander/B-3255-2016","Smetana, Sergiy/0000-0002-5471-0521; Mathys, Alexander/0000-0003-1633-848X",,,,,82,3,3,0,22,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

The author chose the expulsion from a common dwelling, which represents a relatively new administrative law institution. At the same time, the selected form of direct intervention (expulsion from a common dwelling) is not a frequented subject of legal science (jurisprudence) research. Therefore, its examination and critical evaluation is necessary. However, the aim of the paper is not only to point out to the current legal reglementation of this relatively new administrative law institution, but also to show seamy sides of this legal institution and to present comprehensible and reasonable legal opinion relating to key characteristics of selected direct intervention. In the paper, the author used general scientific methods as well as special methods of legal science (jurisprudence), which include dominantly methods belonging to a group of interpretative methods and also some methods belonging to a group of legal argumentation methods. In the first part of his paper, the author evaluates the current state of knowledge in the examined field and concludes that the issue of direct intervention is recognized unambiguously. At the same time, the texts in publications are very brief and short and do not associate the issue with the concrete form of direct intervention. Therefore, in the next parts of the papper the author offers the analysis of legal conditions for the execution of the selected form of direct intervention and of some problematic issues arising from the legal regulation of expulsion from common dwelling. The final part of the paper presents de lege ferenda proposals which pick up on the shortcomings found in the current legal regulation - inadequate, resp. a totally absent mechanism for controlling the execution of selected form of direct intervention. In concreto, the author proposes a possible legal regulation which could ensure the possiblity of expelled person to defend himself (herself).","[Sramel, Bystrik] Univ Ss Cyril & Methodius Trnava, Fac Social Sci, Bucianska 4-A, Trnava 91701, Slovakia",University of SS Cyril & Methodius Trnava,"Sramel, B (通讯作者)，Univ Ss Cyril & Methodius Trnava, Fac Social Sci, Bucianska 4-A, Trnava 91701, Slovakia.",bystrik.sramel@ucm.sk,,,project KEGA [KEGA 017UCM-4/2017],project KEGA,This paper was created within the project KEGA titled Dynamika premien politickeho systemu SR.

In addition, digitalization serves as a catalyst for closer integration of various elements within the 'knowledge triangle'. In this paper, the main focus is placed on research, innovation and digitalization performance in the EU member states and their financing from the different European instruments. This paper presents the rationale behind the EU Investment Plan, evaluates the current research, innovation and digitalization performance of Latvia from multiple perspectives, looks at the economic consequences of innovation activity, and provides an overview of the EU innovation support instruments relevant for Latvia. The paper concludes that besides funding, the inherent quality and marketability of research projects remains essential. As regards digitalization, Latvia has relatively developed connectivity and infrastructure, but is increasingly facing shortage of skilled ICT professionals and integration of internet-based solutions in business operations, especially among SMEs, is below its EU peers. Latvia ranks 19 from EU-28 in Digital Economy and Society Index 2017. Overall progress is driven by increasing shares of fast broadband subscriptions as well as by the improved delivery of public services. More and more Latvians are going on-line and are using eGovernment services but still half of the population has low or no digital skills. Latvians are increasingly shopping online but businesses are exploiting technologies in a limited way. The paper concludes that, for innovations to flourish, investment is, no doubt, a necessary pre-requisite, globally, in Europe and in Latvia. In this context, the national governments are responsible for a reasonable budgetary spending for research, but even more for creating conducive framework conditions - such as fostering private enterprise, creating a vibrant eco-system for start-ups, fighting shadow economy and improving the business environment. The EU stands ready to offer multiple support instruments, ranging from Investment Plan to Structural Funds, to Horizon 2020, and to InnovFin. However, even when financing is available, it is up to the research community to make good use of them.","[Steinbuka, Inna; Balina, Signe] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia; [Zemitis, Martins] European Commiss EU, Luxembourg, Luxembourg",University of Latvia,"Steinbuka, I (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,9,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-286-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,642,650,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393400064,0

The study confirms the influence on the TOI of several independent variables: e.g. the listed price, the transaction price, the condition of the apartment, the number of clicks, and the living space area. The observations have been provided by an Austrian internet platform and cover the period from 2010 to 2013. The methodology is based on descriptive and regression analyses. The empirical findings show that internet-related characteristics, such as the number of inquiries, have an obvious influence on the TOI. This could be associated with an increasing interest in the particular ad: The higher the number of inquiries, the more interesting is the ad, which, in turn, affects the TOI. Furthermore, the living space, the condition, the availability of a balcony or terrace, as well as the location (city/non-city) have a strong influence on the TOI. We have noticed that the pricing of online ads significantly relies on the TOI. Our conclusion is: The higher the price difference between the offer and transaction price, and the better the quality of the building, the higher the interest for the apartment will be, finally resulting in a decreased TOI.","[Stocker, Emanuel; Despotovic, Miroslav; Koch, David] Univ Appl Sci Kufstein, Kufstein, Austria; [Dunska, Margarita] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Stocker, E (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci Kufstein, Kufstein, Austria.",,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,3,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-286-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,651,659,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393400065,0

Our empirical analysis is based on data of Population censuses and current registration in the Baltic States, Eurostat database and information on government views and policies from the UN World Population Policies database. Statistical analysis is performed using descriptive statistics, time series indicators, ethnic diversity indexes and graphical methods. The ethnic structure for the Baltics on the whole is calculated and analysed. After regained political independence the number of population of titular ethnicities has decreased, but at a slower rate than average and their proportion has increased. Even now ethnic minorities constitute one-fourth of the total in the Baltic population. The Baltic States have one of the highest population loss rates in the world. The excess of deaths over births and emigration is prevailing in international migration processes, particularly in Lithuania and Latvia. Very low fertility rate and emigration of younger people advanced population ageing of Slays and other minorities groups. The age structure of ethnic minorities in each state is older than structure of titular ethnicities. The scenarios of depopulation prevail in population projections in the Baltic States. The share of ethnic Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians in all the three states most likely will increase, particularly in Latvia and Estonia, because of their relatively higher fertility and vitality (life expectancy), and higher part of returning home nationals.","[Zvidrins, Peteris; Berzins, Atis] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Zvidrins, P (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,,,,,,,18,0,0,1,1,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-286-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,775,787,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393400077,0

The setting of the empirical research is the television situation comedy (sitcom) industry in the United States between 1949 and 2011. Specifically, we explore the factors that explain the survival rate of sitcoms and their spin-offs. We develop two sets of indicators to explore the effect of pre-entry experience: team similarity and star power based on the character/actor. Our findings show that spin-offs, or sitcoms that inherit character/actors and theme elements from a successful parent sitcom, have a greater likelihood to survive than de novo sitcoms. Even further, the greater the number of team members that not only worked with each other on previous shows but worked together on the same parent show, the better the performance of the spin-off. By contrast, star power, or the fame of the character/actor(s) that passes from the parent to the spin-off, shows no significant correlation with performance. We suggest that these results provide initial evidence that, consistent with the literature on spinouts in manufacturing industries, knowledge endowments represent an important source of performance heterogeneity in project-based industries.","[Adams, Pamela] Seton Hall Univ, 400 South Orange Ave, S Orange, NJ 07079 USA; [Fontana, Roberto] Univ Pavia, Via San Felice, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Fontana, Roberto] Bocconi Univ, ICRIOS, Via Roengten 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Marinoni, Astrid] Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, 105 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3E6, Canada",Seton Hall University; University of Pavia; Bocconi University; University of Toronto,"Fontana, R (通讯作者)，Univ Pavia, Via San Felice, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.;Fontana, R (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, ICRIOS, Via Roengten 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy.",pamela.adams@shu.edu; roberto.fontana@unipv.it; astrid.marinoni@rotman.utoronto.ca,,"Adams, Pamela/0000-0003-4199-9925",,,,,71,0,0,1,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Moreover, we analyze whether emerging market volatility indices would respond asymmetrically to positive and negative volatility shocks in the fear index i.e., whether the relationships are asymmetric between the VIX and the emerging market volatilities. Our results confirm that there are strong positive relationships between changes in the VIX and emerging market volatilities, and the linkages tend to be stronger for the upper-parts of the conditional distributions, namely above the median-quantiles up to the extreme-quantiles. In all cases, the nature of the relationship appears to be contemporaneous and on average is three times stronger than their lagged relationship. Further test results reveal that the relationship is highly asymmetric i.e., the effect of a positive shock in the VIX is on average about twice more pronounced than the effect of a negative shock at the extreme-tails of their conditional distributions, a stylized fact that cannot be revealed via conventional estimation methods as OLS. If we compare the effects of positive and negative VIX shocks on emerging market volatilities utilizing QRM, Copulas and OLS, our findings reveal that the effect of a positive shock by the QRM at the 95% quantile is about eight times higher than the one revealed by OLS.

In a simple DSGE model, we show analytically that more flexible prices always amplify output volatility for supply shocks and also amplify output volatility for demand shocks if monetary policy does not respond strongly to inflation. More flexible prices often reduce welfare, even under optimal monetary policy if full efficiency cannot be attained. Our results extend to a model with both sticky information and wages.

Simulations are performed under three scenarios, differentiated by the number of countries considered (2, 6, 10). The parametric configuration employed yields economically reasonable values for the dynamics and relative dimension of key variables, broadly comparable with historical data and available stylized facts. Our policy experiments show that fiscal expansions generally allow to improve the dynamics of real GDP, labor productivity, and employment, though being generally associated with higher levels of public debt. Conversely, permanent fiscal contractions always exert strong recessionary effects, exacerbate real GDP volatility, and tend to be self-defeating in the long run. In scenarios where the Monetary Union includes a greater number of countries and the common market is bigger, fiscal austerity raises-rather than decreasing-average public debt-to-GDP ratios. We show that this is mainly related to a raise of debt-to-GDP in poorer and less productive countries mirrored by a reduction of their net foreign asset position.","[Caiani, Alessandro] Univ Pavia, Dept Econ & Management, Pavia, PV, Italy; [Catullo, Ermanno; Gallegati, Mauro] Marche Polytech Univ, Dept Management, Ancona, AN, Italy",University of Pavia; Marche Polytechnic University,"Caiani, A (通讯作者)，Univ Pavia, Dept Econ & Management, Pavia, PV, Italy.",alessandro.caiani@unipv.it,"Li, Wang/M-1612-2019","Caiani, Alessandro/0000-0002-3972-2217",European Union [612955],European Union(European Union (EU)),"The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union, Seventh Framework Programme FP7, under grant agreement FinMaP numver 612955.",,78,21,21,1,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

We form a historical panel of corporate tax returns and simulate the deduction for FDII had it been in place from 2000-2015. We find that the deduction would have provided significant benefits, particularly to firms in the manufacturing, information, and professional services sectors. We find these benefits to be highly concentrated In addition, we find that deemed intangible income (DII) is pro-cyclical in nature-declining significantly as a share of income during recessions.

Results reveal that adoption of IFRS seems to increase analysts' awareness of fundamental signals useful for predicting future changes in EPS. However, overall, analysts remain only as efficient as they were pre-IFRS in using these fundamental signals. While their efficiency in using the earnings signal decreased, it increased for non-earnings signals in the post-compared to pre-IFRS period. Furthermore, analysts substantially underutilise the earnings signal in common compared to code law countries. These findings are likely to be of interest to analysts and market participants when making forecasts and investment decisions, and to standard setters and regulators in evaluating the impact of accounting standards.","[Pathiranage, Nandana P.

Our rejoinder first addresses his general concerns about a basic income, which reflect an enduring policy debate over the past half century that has included social experimentation to examine work disincentives and other issues. We then respond to his specific concerns about our proposal for a Universal Guaranteed Basic Income (UGBI) through tax reforms that would convert existing nonrefundable tax credits to refundable credits. We illustrate how our proposed design balances low tax rates that are in line with the rates applied to current credits, prior social experimentation, and policy discussion with effective new income support that eradicates measured poverty for all family groups except non-elderly singles. In this regard, we provide new estimates to show the redistributive effect of our UGBI across family income deciles. Finally, we appraise his alternative proposals for a multifaceted approach to poverty reduction and find these established prescriptions for anti-poverty strategy wanting. We also point out that our UGBI can be implemented gradually by focusing on tax credit refundability in the future.","[Stevens, Harvey; Simpson, Wayne] Univ Manitoba, Dept Econ, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Simpson, Wayne] Univ Calgary, Sch Publ Policy, Calgary, AB, Canada",University of Manitoba; University of Calgary,"Stevens, H (通讯作者)，Univ Manitoba, Dept Econ, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.",,,,,,,,32,3,3,2,17,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

When misappropriation of campaign funds occurs, political parties that divert more funds for personal gain stand on more independent platforms and require larger contributions from lobby groups. Greater electoral competition could reduce policy distortions but this, in turn, sparks more intense lobbying thereby increasing the scope of misappropriation of funds.

Design/methodology/approach The paper examines four different specifications for the implied volatility smile of exchange-traded dollar-rupee options. These specifications are tested by running Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regressions on a daily basis for all options over the entire sample period. Seven potential determinants for the shape of the volatility function are identified. Contemporaneous and lead-lag relationships between these determinants and the shape of the volatility function are examined using OLS and multivariate VAR. Impulse response functions are employed to test the strength and persistence of the lead-lag relations. Seasonality of the smile pattern is tested using OLS. Findings The study shows that the implied volatility function for dollar-rupee options is asymmetric and varies with the time to maturity of the option. Historical volatility, momentum and jumps in the exchange rate, time to maturity, traded volume of options and volatility in the stock market appear to Granger-cause the shape of the volatility smile. Feedback causality is observed from the shape of the smile to the volatility, momentum and jumps in the exchange rate and trading volume of currency options. A weak day-of-the-week effect is observed in the pattern of the volatility smile. Practical implications The study sheds light on the potential determinants of the smile and highlights the predictive power of the smile which findings can be useful to market practitioners for pricing and hedging of dollar-rupee options. The study has strong practical implications during a period of increased volatility in the dollar-rupee pair. Originality/value Most of the existing literature regarding implied volatility smiles has focused either on the volatility smile of US equity index options or that of major liquid currencies. There is a need for such studies in the context of options on emerging market currencies such as the Indian rupee which are characterized by thin trading and frequent central bank intervention and signaling. To the best of the author's knowledge this study is the first to focus on the volatility smile of exchange-traded options on the US dollar-Indian rupee.","[Bhat, Aparna Prasad] KJ Somaiya Inst Management Studies & Res, Dept Finance, Mumbai, India",Somaiya Vidyavihar University; K J Somaiya Institute of Management,"Bhat, AP (通讯作者)，KJ Somaiya Inst Management Studies & Res, Dept Finance, Mumbai, India.",aparna.p.bhat@gmail.com,"Bhat, Aparna Prasad/AFL-2246-2022",,,,,,46,2,2,0,7,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach This study investigates the long-run performance of firms conducting SEOs on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) over the period of 1998-2015, by examining the return performance and operating performance of firms, along with the impact of investor sentiment on these variables. Findings The results of this study are inconsistent with the existing literature, which argues that the long-run performance of issuing firms signalled an initial underreaction to SEOs buoyed by over-optimistic investors. Research limitations/implications Instead, the long-run performance of issuing firms is adequately explained by the rational models centred on the risk-return framework, implying that investors are reacting swiftly to SEOs in an unbiased fashion. Originality/value Investor sentiment does not materially influence the long-run share performance or operating performance of issuing firms, casting doubt on the ability of the market timing theory to explain the long-run performance of SEOs. The authors thus find that SEO performance cannot be explained by behavioural-based reasoning, in contrast to some asset pricing studies on the JSE which indicate the role of sentiment in explaining returns.","[da Cunha, Jesse Alves; Seetharam, Yudhvir] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Seetharam, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa.",568446@students.wits.ac.za; yudhvir.seetharam@wits.ac.za,"Seetharam, Yudhvir/AAH-9563-2021","Seetharam, Yudhvir/0000-0003-4409-1015",,,,,34,2,2,0,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

J,"Wang, L; Li, SM",,,,"Wang, Liu; Li, Shaomin",,,Determinants of foreign direct and indirect investments from the institutional perspective A comparative analysis between emerging and mature markets,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING MARKETS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Foreign direct investment; Stock market development; Foreign portfolio investment; Cross-country arbitrage; Governance environment; Market openness,STRATEGY; ENVIRONMENT; RISK,"Purpose Amid the rising concerns about the unbalanced globalization, there has been a renewed interest in examining the pattern of international trade and investment, especially between emerging and mature economies. In this study, the purpose of this paper is to examine the role of different institutional and market-related determinants in shaping the pattern and mode of foreign investments in emerging and developed markets. Design/methodology/approach The empirical investigation is based on a balanced panel sample of 45 countries (28 developed countries and 17 emerging economies) over an 11-year period from 2002 to 2012. A series of multivariable regressions are conducted to evaluate both the trend and the mode of foreign investment with rigorous robustness checks. Findings Overall, the authors find that market openness and capital market development are the main determinants of a country's ability to attract foreign investment in developed countries, while the governance environment is the key consideration in emerging markets. Regarding the mode of foreign investment, the authors find that, in developed markets, foreign investors tend to choose direct investment in the countries with more open markets. In emerging markets, however, the choice between direct and indirect (portfolio) investments is mainly driven by arbitrage activities, where investors opt for portfolio investment when the stock market is undervalued. Practical implications First, the findings may aid foreign investors in their strategic choice between emerging vs mature markets based on the governance environment, market openness, capital market development and arbitrage opportunities. Second, the findings may be used to aid governments in prioritizing institutional improvement in market openness, stock market development and policies aimed at balancing different investment channels. Social implications The study may enhance the social understanding on the current debate on the winners and losers of globalization. A main complaint from mature economies is that the emerging economies took their jobs away and, therefore, they should adopt protectionism (which implies closing their own markets) in order to preserve jobs. The study shows that such a reaction may not be in the best interests of the mature economies since they will be able to attract more foreign investment (which implies creating or at least keeping more jobs) if they make their markets more open. Originality/value Existing studies on foreign investment have primarily focused on direct investment. The study examines both the direct and indirect investments and the way in which they affect the foreign investment markets in emerging and mature economies. From the institutional perspective, the authors show how the governance environment and market factors affect foreign investors' strategic choice between direct and indirect investment, contingent upon the stage of a country's economic and institutional development.","[Wang, Liu] Providence Coll, Sch Business, Providence, RI 02918 USA; [Li, Shaomin] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Management, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA",Providence College; Old Dominion University,"Li, SM (通讯作者)，Old Dominion Univ, Dept Management, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.",lwang@providence.edu; sli@odu.edu,,,,,,,31,15,16,1,27,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

The response was muted because the labor supply of panhandlers appears to be inelastic. On the other hand, good places to panhandle are relatively abundant.

It is shown that, in the presence of human capital externalities, microloans that are small and have immediate repayment can be growth depressing, and welfare decreasing, through their effect on the opportunity cost of schooling. By increasing the opportunity cost of schooling, such microloans divert investment away from human capital: by failing to internalize the social returns to education, households' individually optimal investment decisions in the face of microcredit availability act to depress the growth of the economy and result in suboptimal welfare outcomes. Conditions under which these negative effects can occur are identified and potential solutions are suggested.","[Emerson, Patrick M.] Oregon State Univ, Corvalis, OR USA; [Emerson, Patrick M.] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Emerson, Patrick M.] FGV, C MICRO, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [McGough, Bruce] Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",Oregon State University; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Getulio Vargas Foundation; University of Oregon,"Emerson, PM (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Econ Program, Sch Publ Policy, 332 Bexel Hall, Corvalis, OR 97331 USA.",patrick.emerson@oregonstate.edu,,,,,,,27,1,1,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

We start with an outline of a simple model of how ICT skills shortages might be manifested in labour market signals, such as rising wages, and then how, in response to these signals, workers already in the labour market should adjust, whereas young people making schooling and career decisions would be expected to skew toward ICT areas. We then discuss some of the reasons these dynamics might not follow this model, and therefore how ICT skill shortages could potentially endure over time. The article sets the stage for the other articles in this special issue, which address these and other issues related to ICT skills from a mix of traditional academic and industry perspectives.","[Finnie, Ross] Univ Ottawa, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Finnie, Ross; Mueller, Richard E.; Sweetman, Arthur] Univ Ottawa, Educ Policy Res Initiat, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Mueller, Richard E.] Univ Lethbridge, Dept Econ, Lethbridge, AB, Canada; [Sweetman, Arthur] McMaster Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Sweetman, Arthur] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa; University of Lethbridge; McMaster University; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Finnie, R (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Ottawa, ON, Canada.;Finnie, R (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Educ Policy Res Initiat, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",,"Mueller, Richard E/W-9054-2018","Mueller, Richard E/0000-0001-6749-0348",Industry Canada; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council; Human Resources and Skills Development Canada; Statistics Canada; Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade,Industry Canada; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Human Resources and Skills Development Canada; Statistics Canada; Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade,"This special issue of Canadian Public Policy/Analyse de politiques has its roots in a workshop held in March 2013 hosted by the Education Policy Research Initiative (https://www.epri.ca/), a national research organization based at the University of Ottawa and organized in collaboration with and supported by Industry Canada.

For this analysis, marked point process models are proposed which are able to capture the dynamics of the intensity of occurrence and comovement during periods of crisis. The results show a significant, negative interdependence between most OECD markets, especially those of the USA, Japan and France. These major oil importing countries display links between equity market losses and positive returns in both oil markets. However, positive interdependence is not observed between any of the OECD countries except for South Korea. The great advantage of this methodology is that, apart from using the size distribution of extreme events, it also uses the occurrence times of extreme events as a source of information. With this information, these models are better able to capture the stylized facts of extreme events in financial markets such as clustering behavior and cross-excitation.","[Herrera, Rodrigo] Univ Talca, Fac Econ & Negocios, Talca, Chile; [Gonzalez, Sergio] Univ Talca, Fac Ingn, Talca, Chile; [Clements, Adam] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Universidad de Talca; Universidad de Talca; Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Herrera, R (通讯作者)，Univ Talca, Fac Econ & Negocios, Talca, Chile.",rodriherrera@utalca.cl,"Herrera, Rodrigo/GXV-4743-2022; Herrera, Rodrigo/AAL-9467-2021; Clements, Adam E/I-9812-2012","Herrera, Rodrigo/0000-0002-4604-0396; Herrera, Rodrigo/0000-0002-4604-0396; Clements, Adam/0000-0002-4232-0323",Chilean Agency CONICYT [FONDECYT 1150349],Chilean Agency CONICYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT),Both authors would like to thank the anonymous referee for the comments and suggestions on an earlier draft of this discussion paper.

The Czech Republic, despite its relatively small area, is an important destination for cultural tourism - a large number of unique cultural and other historic monuments are located on its territory. Twelve of those historic monuments are inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, including the Czech capital, the city of Prague. As capitals are usually very different from the regions as far as tourism demand is concerned, another separate study area was chosen for this case - the Vysoelna Region located in the middle of the Czech Republic. This region has the most UNESCO World Heritage Sites of all the Czech regions - there are three of them there: Telc, Trebic and Zelena horn in Zdar nad Sazavou. Within the framework of developing a new regional tourism strategy and at the request of the Regional Authority of the Vysoelna Region, an extensive marketing survey among visitors to the region was carried out. This research was done by the College of Polytechnics Jihlava in 2014-2015 and within it, various characteristics of tourism demand in all three UNESCO destinations were gathered. The research provided background information for creating visitor profiles of the destinations. Primary data obtained from the questionnaire survey enabled, after being processed by various mathematical and statistical methods, a comparative analysis of the chosen UNESCO destinations in Central Europe in terms of tourism demand. Its results show, e.g. that all surveyed destinations attract mainly one-day visitors, but not all of them regard a visit to unique cultural heritage sites of those destinations as their main reason for travelling there. The research results show not only new visitor profiles of the UNESCO destinations in the smallest statistical unit (the municipality), but they can also be used by destination management for planning customised tourism development strategies. Moreover, the study gives a comprehensive picture of tourism demand, which is important for the regional policy. Finally, the paper can be used as a case study for sustainable development of tourism in other UNESCO destinations.","[Pachrova, Stanislava; Janouskova, Eva; Ryskova, Jitka] Coll Polytech Jihlava, Jihlava, Czech Republic",College of Polytechnics Jihlava,"Pachrová, S (通讯作者)，Coll Polytech Jihlava, Jihlava, Czech Republic.",stanislava.pachrova@vspj.cz,,"Janouskova, Eva/0000-0002-0074-0901","College of Polytechnics Jihlava, Analyses of Regional Disparities in Tourism [c. 1170/4/178]","College of Polytechnics Jihlava, Analyses of Regional Disparities in Tourism","This paper was written within the framework of an internal grant provided by the College of Polytechnics Jihlava, Analyses of Regional Disparities in Tourism (c. 1170/4/178).",,33,1,1,2,26,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2018,20.0,,,,12,,1040,1054,,10.24818/EA/2018/S12/1040,0.0,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GY5HR,,gold,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448604700015,0

Moreover, when firms have weaker ERM systems, we find that managers are less likely to use real-activities earnings management in their equity financing efforts. Therefore, our policy-relevant findings suggest that weaker ERM systems can signal poor control mechanisms and attract additional investor scrutiny, thus constraining managers' use of real-activities earnings manipulation to harm long-term firm value.","[Wang, Teng-Shih] Providence Univ, Dept Accounting, Taichung, Taiwan; [Lin, Yi-Mien] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Accounting, Taichung, Taiwan; [Werner, Edward M.] Rutgers State Univ, Sch Business Camden, Camden, NJ USA; [Chang, Hsihui] Drexel Univ, LeBow Coll Business, Philadelphia, PA USA",Providence University - Taiwan; National Chung Hsing University; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Rutgers University Camden; Drexel University,"Lin, YM (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Accounting, Taichung, Taiwan.",tswang0617@pu.edu.tw; ymlin@dragon.nchu.edu.tw; edward.werner@rutgers.edu; hc336@drexel.edu,,"Wang, Teng Shih/0000-0002-2746-4062","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan ROC [NSC 101-2410-H-005-027]","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan ROC(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","This paper has benefited from the comments of Prof. Carl R.

Subjects observe draws from the true but unknown probability distribution generating outcomes at the beginning of each period of the experiment and state at selected periods a) the likelihoods that each probability distribution in the set is the true distribution, and b) the likelihoods of future outcomes. We estimate heterogeneity of rules used to update uncertainty about the true distribution and rules used to report distributions of future outcomes. We find that approximately 65% of subjects report distributions by properly weighing the possible distributions using their expressed uncertainty over them, while 22% of subjects report distributions close to the distribution they perceive as most likely. We find significant heterogeneity in how subjects update their expressed uncertainty. On average, subjects tend to overweigh the importance of their prior uncertainty relative to new information, leading to ambiguity that is substantially more persistent than would be predicted using Bayes' rule.

We relate our argument to recent empirical trends in productivity dynamics and innovative activities. These suggest that an innovation slowdown is taking place and, consequently, that a renewed interest in the (re-)direction-rather than on the intensity of innovative activities-is key to the design of R&I policy capable to tackle current challenges.

To this end, we develop stochastic models for factors driving the assets' underlying market and volume risks on which we base a model for risk-optimized pooling.

Land markets are one of the channels through which farmers get exposed to such hazards. This paper investigates the consequences of land transactions for the (un)equal distribution of exposure to landslide risk and of total land holdings in a rural area in Western Uganda. We propose and empirically test a mechanism through which land holdings and exposure to landslide risk evolve over a farmer's lifetime. A structured household survey and detailed information on land transaction as well as georeferenced information on plots was used to construct a panel dataset of land transactions. Regressions with household fixed effects were run to identify how landholdings and exposure to landslide susceptibility evolves over a farmer's lifetime. We find that farmers that are initially more exposed to landslides manage to reduce their average exposure to some extent by acquiring plots outside landslide prone areas. This goes at a cost, as farmers that are initially highly exposed acquire land more slowly than farmers that have a lower exposure on their first plot. Over a lifetime, in our case study, land transactions therefore have a somewhat levelling effect on inequality in exposure to landslides, but increase the inequality in land ownership. As such, one of the ways through which unequal risk exposure contributes to propagating inequality in total land ownings is theoretical and empirically identified. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In coffee value chains, upgrading opportunities are presented by the growth in consumption of specialty coffees, which are associated with direct engagement with producer communities by roasting firms, along with an apparent increased commitment to social responsibility. Known in the industry as relationship coffee, such interventions align with a value chain approach to development and are promoted as offering upgrading opportunities for otherwise marginalized rural communities. In this article, we critique the dominant development discourse of relationship coffee in Indonesia via three case studies of livelihoods and local agrarian dynamics across three coffee-growing communities on the islands of Sulawesi, Bali and Java. We find that the relationship coffee model does present opportunities for producer upgrading. However, these benefits have been subsequently captured by key individuals within the producer community who are able to accumulate wealth and consolidate their social position. As it is currently implemented in Indonesia, the relationship coffee model has reproduced local patterns of inequality rather than contributing to poverty alleviation efforts. These insights suggest the urgent need to develop a critical political economy of upgrading in the global value chain and rural development literature. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Peter",,,"Promoting natural resource conflict management in an illiberal setting: Experiences from Central Darfur, Sudan",WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"My main goal is to draw attention to ongoing conflict and insecurity in Darfur region of Sudan, still one of the world's largest humanitarian situation. Darfur once commanded global attention but has receded into the shadows of a world suffering from compassion fatigue. This study was prompted by three distinct yet related concerns. The first is the growing interest in environmental performance within illiberal regimes. I contend that understanding the situation in authoritarian and heavily conflict-ridden societies such as Darfur region in Sudan requires a combined holistic and historical framework for understanding the complex interplay of political economy and cultural ecology affecting local use and management of natural resources. The second concern is a desire to reflect on the possibilities and challenges of peace-building and recovery Darfur, drawing on my experience there with two projects carried out by the Near East Foundation that sought to promote early recovery in Central Darfur through environmental peacebuilding. Its preparation was prompted by three distinct yet related concerns. The third concern is to address some of the links between peacebuilding and natural resource interventions. I argue that even in extremely illiberal settings such as Darfur that it is still possible to carry out activities that widen the scope for action by local populations. This finding was most evident regarding the project's conflict management training, which local people ended up applying in a range of situations, and which helped spawn a peace movement among youths. Nevertheless, project participants noted that this training and action, while helpful at the community level, could not address bigger problems outside. Renewed national and international peace efforts are needed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Castro, A.

The models employ a fractionally integrated version of the dynamic conditional correlation GARCH (DCC-GARCH) process (Engle, 2002), and can be used to forecast conditional covariance matrices of high dimension. The models are applied to a data set consisting of ten US stocks and out of sample forecasts over 1-80 days evaluated using statistical and economic loss functions. If intraday data is unavailable, the statistical loss function reveals that LM correlation models provide superior return covariance matrix forecasts over 20-80 days. When intraday data is available, LM correlation models provide superior forecasts of the realised covariance matrix over the same horizons, however the gains when forecasting the return covariance matrix are small. Finally, when forecasting minimum variance portfolio weights, even though the benefits from LM correlation models diminish completely, they are not consistently outperformed by any of the benchmarks.","[Dark, Jonathan] Univ Melbourne, Dept Finance, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Dark, J (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Dept Finance, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",jdark@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,60,12,12,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5398,1879-1727,,J EMPIR FINANC,J.

Consequently, the interest rate has become uninformative regarding the stance of monetary policies. As an important innovation, our research adopts the Divisia monetary aggregate as an alternative to the policy indicator variable. We apply the bootstrap Granger causality method, which is robust to the presence of non-stationarity in our data. We also apply bootstrap rolling window estimates to account for the parameter non-constancy and structural breaks in our sample. We find a strong causality from Divisia money to exchange rates and further highlight the importance of Divisia at ZLB by capturing the time-varying link between these variables.","[Ghosh, Taniya] Indira Gandhi Inst Dev Res, Gen AK Vaidya Marg,Film City Rd, Bombay 400065, Maharashtra, India; [Bhadury, Soumya] Natl Council Appl Econ Res, New Delhi, India",,"Ghosh, T (通讯作者)，Indira Gandhi Inst Dev Res, Gen AK Vaidya Marg,Film City Rd, Bombay 400065, Maharashtra, India.",taniya@igidr.ac.in,,"Ghosh, Taniya/0000-0002-9792-0967",,,,,38,4,4,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

In order to consider and to distinguish between these two types of research, we merge the seminal models of Romer [1990] and Aghion and Howitt [1992]: knowledge accumulation stems from a series of inventions (horizontal / fundamental knowledge accumulation) and from a succession of innovations (vertical / applied knowledge accumulation) building upon each of these inventions. Then, we study a decentralized economy in which the creative destruction mechanism does not deter investments in fundamental research through an IP law design that induces profit-division between an inventor and his following innovators. We show that providing optimal incentives to fundamental research requires, not only a design of IP law that ensures a sufficient positive transfer from innovators to inventors, but also public policies in form of subsidies supporting both fundamental research and applied R&D activities.","[Gray, Elie] Toulouse Business Sch, 20 Bd Lascrosses,BP 7010, F-31068 Toulouse 7, France",Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite de Toulouse; TBS Education,"Gray, E (通讯作者)，Toulouse Business Sch, 20 Bd Lascrosses,BP 7010, F-31068 Toulouse 7, France.",e.gray@tbs-education.fr,,,,,,,68,0,0,0,9,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Using surveys of professional forecasters, we create hypothetical inflation-linked bond return series for 41 countries starting in 1987 or later depending on the availability of nominal bond markets.

The main aim of the research is to determine the factors and variables that significantly influence and shape the consumer's perception and attitude towards the purchase of private label products. The perception of private label products by Slovak consumers was studied empirically, focused on three hypotheses: (1) if the type of purchased product affects the consumer's attitude towards private label products; (2) lithe consumer's attitude is influenced by the reasons for the purchase; and (3) if the attitudes of consumers to private label products are determined by demographic determinants. The study of consumer preferences is of great importance in the context of the competitive ability of branding. The greatest contribution of the study is the determination of which types of private label products are purchased by consumers, considering their family status, and that the consumers' perceptions of private label products are determined by the consumer's age, income and family status, as well as by the reasons for their purchase. The research results can be used in the retail trade when planning strategies for private label products, focusing on the specific requirements and needs of individual consumer groups, accepting their demographic differences.","[Valaskova, Katarina; Kliestikova, Jana; Krizanova, Anna] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Valaskova, K (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",katarina.valaskova@fpedas.uniza.sk; jana.kliestikova@fpedas.uniza.sk; anna.krizanova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Valaskova, Katarina/O-9250-2015; Majerova, Jana/N-8126-2015; Krizanova, Anna/P-2710-2015","Valaskova, Katarina/0000-0003-4223-7519; Krizanova, Anna/0000-0003-0331-8826",program of the Slovak Research and Development Agency [APVV-15-0505],program of the Slovak Research and Development Agency,"The research leading to these results received funding from the project titled Integrated model of management support for building and managing the brand value in the specific conditions of the Slovak Republic, within the framework of the program of the Slovak Research and Development Agency, under grant agreement number APVV-15-0505.",,43,49,50,9,41,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

I analyze the dynamics of the optimal contract and its implications for the level of managerial turnover. I show that optimal contracts might be stationary and entail no termination. In general, I show that the principal reduces the manager's temptation to behave myopically by reducing the likelihood of termination and deferring compensation.

By diverting production to local markets, these policies tend to reduce prices and increase domestic supply of food or intermediate inputs in the short term, to the benefit of consumers or manufacturers, which make them attractive to policymakers. However, in the long term, export restrictions discourage agricultural production, which may ultimately negate the short-term gains. This study assesses the economy-wide effects of Malawi's long-term maize export ban, which was only recently lifted, and a proposed oilseed export levy intended to improve food security and support local processing industries, respectively. We find that maize export bans only benefit the urban non-poor, while poor farmers' incomes and maize consumption levels decline in the longer run. The oilseed export levy also fails to achieve its long run objectives: even when tax revenues are used to further subsidize food processors, their gains in value-addition are outweighed by declining agricultural value-addition. More generally, these results show that while export restrictions may have the desired outcomes in the short run, production responses may render the policies ineffective in the medium to long run. Ultimately, such restrictive policies reinforce a subsistence approach to agriculture, which is inconsistent with the stated economic transformation goals of many Sub-Saharan African countries.

We suggest that existing work on effectiveness of macroprudential policy may be vulnerable to bias due to omission of long run cointegration effects. This paper seeks to offer a fresh baseline for work in this area by adopting a cointegration framework which is robust to a variety of alternative techniques and compares favourably with non-cointegrated alternatives. We assess the impact of typical macroprudential policy interventions on house price and household credit growth in up to 19 OECD countries, using three datasets from the IMF and BIS, thus giving both a wider range of control variables and broader coverage of instruments than in most extant work. We find evidence that macroprudential polices remain effective in both short- and long-run at curbing house price and household credit growth even within a cointegration framework, albeit some tools are more effective than others. These include, in particular, taxes on financial institutions, general capital requirements, strict loan-to-value ratios and debt-to-income ratio limits. (C) 2018 The Authors.

The product space (PS) framework developed in recent seminal works by economists and physicists suggests that path-dependence characterizes the evolution of the production basket (Hausmann and Klinger, 2007, Harvard University Center for International Development Working Paper #146; Hidalgo et at., 2007, Science Magazine, 317(5837), 482-487). These authors represent economies as sets of productive capabilities that can be combined in different ways to produce different products. Countries progressively change their production baskets and move toward goods that require capabilities that are already available; on the contrary radical structural change rarely happens. In this article, we analyze the evolution over time of the production baskets in 107 Italian provinces (NUTS 3) and perform the first test on the PS hypothesis of path-dependence. We investigate whether new products entering the provincial production baskets are nonrandomly related to initial production baskets. We confirm the general tendency of path-dependence but highlight at the same time that a sizable share of new products are an exception to this general pattern. These random entries over the PS are particularly interesting for industrial policy, since they represent radical deviations from the initial comparative advantage. In the final part of the article, we investigate using parametric analysis the product and provincial characteristics that determine these deviations from the PS pattern.","[Coniglio, Nicola D.; Lagravinese, Raffaele; Vurchio, Davide] Univ Bari, Dept Econ & Finance, I-70121 Bari, Italy; [Vurchio, Davide] Univ Roma Tre, Dept Econ, I-00145 Rome, Italy; [Armenise, Massimo] Italian Natl Inst Stat ISTAT, I-00153 Rome, Italy",Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro; Roma Tre University,"Coniglio, ND (通讯作者)，Univ Bari, Dept Econ & Finance, I-70121 Bari, Italy.",niele.coniglio@uniba.it; raffaele.lagravinese@uniba.it; davide.vurchio87@gmail.com; m.armenise@gmail.com,"Coniglio, Nicola Daniele/AAD-9851-2019; Vurchio, Davide/JRW-5824-2023","Coniglio, Nicola Daniele/0000-0001-6488-4122; Vurchio, Davide/0000-0003-1892-2161",,,,,45,9,17,1,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

This study sheds light on the relevance of supplementing teacher training schemes with appropriate teaching materials in resource-poor settings.","[Fuje, Habtamu; Tandon, Prateek] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Fuje, H (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",Habtamu.Fuje@columbia.edu,,,,,,,33,2,2,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Bioeconomy has had a multi-disciplinary approach with the objective of an integrated scope, namely, to achieve sustainable development. In a knowledge-based economy, the link between sustainable bioeconomy and organizations is achieved by Intellectual Capital. The intangible assets of Intellectual Capital coming from the external environment of an organization in the shape of Relational Capital have great value, as they can offer competitive advantages. Consequently, along with the progress of technology and especially the online opinion platforms and Social Media, consumers have begun to share their experiences with other consumers in a new form of communication called electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM). In the health care field, this type of communication triggered a shift in the consumer behavior, leading to their knowledge empowerment about physicians, symptoms and even health care organizations. This study extends the existing literature on health care and Relational Capital by examining the consumers' motives to post eWOM messages in a Romanian Social Media support group, which concentrates on In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) procedures. We identified a number of key motives (reputation, reciprocity, sense of belonging to a community, enjoyment of helping other individuals, moral obligation of helping other individuals with knowledge contribution and knowledge self-efficacy), which may explain the consumers' intentions to post eWOM messages, as integrated in an empirical model. Using the PLS technique, we tested the model on a sample of 121 women, members of the Social Media support group. The findings revealed that 39% of the variance of the intention to post eWOM messages, was explained by reciprocity. The outcomes of this study provide important implications for both research and practice.","[Gheorghe, Iuliana Raluca; Purcarea, Victor Lorin; Gheorghe, Consuela Madalina] Carol Davila Univ Med & Pharm, Bucharest, Romania",Carol Davila University of Medicine & Pharmacy,"Gheorghe, IR (通讯作者)，Carol Davila Univ Med & Pharm, Bucharest, Romania.",raluca.gheorghe@umfcd.ro,"Vécsei, László/B-2066-2010; Gheorghe, Consuela Madalina/AAF-8553-2019","Vécsei, László/0000-0001-8037-3672; Gheorghe, Consuela Madalina/0000-0002-6062-6879; Gheorghe, Iuliana Raluca/0000-0003-1561-6855",,,,,67,6,6,1,36,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,AUG,2018,20.0,49,,,,,684,699,,10.24818/EA/2018/49/684,0.0,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GO8SD,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440364100011,0

In particular, in the face of a changing price schedule, observing each individual twice is sufficient to recover a linear demand function separately for each individual, with no additional restrictions. Constructing a rich panel data set of buyers, we recover the full distribution of demand functions for clean air in the Bay Area of California. First, we find that estimating the full demand function, rather than simply recovering a local estimate of marginal willingness to pay, is important. Second, we find evidence of considerable heterogeneity, which is important from a policy perspective; our data-driven estimates of the welfare effects associated with a nonmarginal change in air quality differ substantially from those recovered using the existing approaches to welfare estimation.","[Bishop, Kelly C.] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Timmins, Christopher] Duke Univ, Box 90097, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Duke University,"Bishop, KC (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",kelly.bishop@asu.edu; christopher.timmins@duke.edu,,,,,,,31,15,22,0,14,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

Using two structural vector autoregressive (VAR) models and a counterfactual scenario analysis, the results show that monetary policy shocks, as identified by changes in Treasury yields following changes in the central bank's target interest rates, lead to a substantial increase in pension funds' allocation to equity assets. Notably, the shift from bonds to equity securities is greater during the period where the US Federal Reserve launched unconventional monetary policy measures. Additional findings show a positive correlation between pension fund risk-taking, low interest rates and the decline in Treasury yields across both well-funded and underfunded public pension plans, which is thus consistent with a structural risk-shifting incentive.

We show a nonlinear relationship between oil futures returns and OPEC-based predictors; hence, linear Granger causality tests are misspecified and the linear model results of non-predictability are unreliable. When the quantile-causality test is implemented, we observe that the impact of OPEC variables is restricted to Brent Crude futures only (with no effect observed for the WTI market). Specifically, OPEC production announcements, and meeting dates predict only lower quantiles of the conditional distribution of Brent futures market returns.

Second, from the perspective of systems theory, the economic structures of IWT systems under different modes of governance are described. Third, data are collected from inland shipping industries in the Pearl River system, and system dynamic (SD) models of the IWT system are constructed using the Vensim PLE software suite.

We find that errors in districts' revenue forecasts can have a significant negative impact on student achievement, beyond what one would expect based on changes in spending levels. In particular, a one percentage point increase in error involving revenue shortfalls can lead to declines in student achievement growth of up to 0.02 standard deviations during the following school year, which equates to about 8 days' worth of learning.

Drawing on a series of field studies in the lower Ba River Catchment on Fiji's main island Viti Levu, the objective of this paper is to determine how climate adaptation strategies - employed by indigenous Fijian communities and households - are influenced by socio-cultural values and access to resources, information and power. Our multi-method approach has been conceptually informed by Agrawal and Perrin's (2008) climate adaptation framework and included semi-structured interviews at the household level, and participatory hazard mapping with diverse focus groups at the community level. Our study finds that due to diverse value-based assessments of livelihood opportunities and climate-related risks, communal and household adaptive strategies can differ widely, even in a very localized cultural context. We also show how decisions to relocate from 'risky environments' are influenced by a combination of local power relations, attachment to cultural and social space, and the provision of external assistance. Our findings comment on the need for disaster risk reduction strategies to recognize how different groups and households respond to climate-related events in distinct socially determined ways.

The dataset also contains geo-coded FEMA data on which building structures were damaged by the hurricane and to what degree. Our estimates provide robust evidence of a persistent negative impact on flood zone housing values. We show the gradual emergence of a price penalty among flood zone properties that were not damaged by Sandy, reaching 8% in year 2017 and showing no signs of recovery. In contrast, damaged properties suffered a large immediate drop in value following the storm (17-22%), followed by a partial recovery and convergence toward a similar penalty as non-damaged properties. The partial recovery in the prices of damaged properties likely reflects their gradual restoration. However, the persistent price reduction affecting all flood-zone properties is more consistent with a learning mechanism. Hurricane Sandy may have increased the perceived risk of large-scale flooding episodes in that area.","[Ortega, Francesc; Taspinar, Suleyman] CUNY, Queens Coll, New York, NY 10021 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Queens College NY (CUNY),"Ortega, F (通讯作者)，CUNY, Queens Coll, New York, NY 10021 USA.",fortega@qc.cuny.edu; staspinar@qc.cuny.edu,,"ortega, francesc/0000-0001-5779-5711",PSC-CUNY Award,PSC-CUNY Award,"Support for this project was provided by a PSC-CUNY Award.

Initially, we examine the factors affecting the deposits in Islamic banking by types, which include investment deposits, demand deposits, savings deposits, ringgit Tawarruq deposits, dollar Tawarruq deposits and negotiable instrument deposits. Additionally, we investigate the determinants of deposits in Islamic banking by holders including household deposits, business deposits, financial institution deposits, federal government deposits, state government deposits and statutory agency deposits. We also examine the factors affecting the total deposits in the Islamic banking system. After confirming that the variables are stationary in the first difference through the use of the residual augmented least squares (RALS) procedure of Meng et al. (2014), we use the break-augmented co-integration methods of Johansen et al. (2000) and Giles and Godwin (2012) to check the co-integrating relationships and generate the long run coefficients of the variables. The results show that industrial production index, real interest rates on fixed and savings deposits have positive impacts on several components of Islamic banking deposits and the total deposits of Islamic banks, while real interest rates on deposits in commercial banks have a negative impact. However, the roles of both the Shariah index and the real exchange rate are mixed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Further, the negative tail dependence area between EPU and CDS also demonstrates that higher economic policy uncertainty may reduce real risk premium. Finally, based on Markov time-varying Copula functions, the dynamic time-varying structures between the EPU index and indexes including SP500, CDS, VIX and UK EPU indexes are studied.

THE UNEASY CASE FOR A COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TAX,NATIONAL TAX JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,broad-based; low-rate taxation; comprehensive income; Haig-Simons standard; optimal taxation; tax reform,OPTIMAL TAXATION; PUBLIC PRODUCTION; RATES,"Discussions of the ideal form of individual income taxation have largely been based on some variant of the standard suggested by Haig (1921) and Simons (1938). This Haig-Simons (H-S) standard argues that an ideal income tax should be imposed on comprehensive income, and the H-S standard has been used to justify the frequently heard call for a Broad-based, Low-rate tax reform strategy. However I argue in this paper that a truly comprehensive individual income tax has in fact never been fully applied, either in the design of a new income tax or in the reform of an existing one. Indeed, my first conclusion is that the H-S standard is effectively dead in terms of its actual real-world relevance to income tax design or reform. This conclusion obviously does not demonstrate that the H-S standard should be discarded as the basis for an ideal individual income tax, including any reform of the income tax. However, my second conclusion is that the death of the H-S standard is entirely appropriate; that is, there are compelling arguments that can be made for an individual income tax that is in fact imposed on an even narrower tax base, with even more extensive use of the many exclusions, adjustments, deductions, and exemptions that currently populate most all income taxes. Even so, my final conclusion is that there is no one-size-fits-all income tax standard; that is, any standard must consider the specifics of the current environment, especially the underlying goals of taxation.","[Alm, James] Tulane Univ, Dept Econ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA",Tulane University,"Alm, J (通讯作者)，Tulane Univ, Dept Econ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.",jalm@tulane.edu,,,,,,,53,5,5,0,6,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

The GDP forecasts cover 63 countries for the years 1992-2014. The main finding is that, while forecasters are generally aware that recession years will be different from other years, they miss the magnitude of the recession by a wide margin until the year is almost over. Forecasts during non-recession years are revised slowly; in recession years, the pace of revision picks up but not sufficiently to avoid large forecast errors. Our second finding is that forecasts of the private sector and the official sector are virtually identical; thus, both are equally good at missing recessions. Strong booms are also missed, providing suggestive evidence for Nordhaus' view that behavioural factorsthe reluctance to absorb either good or bad newsplay a role in the evolution of forecasts.","[An, Zidong] Amer Univ, Coll Arts & Sci, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [An, Zidong; Jalles, Joao Tovar] Int Monetary Fund, Res Dept, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Loungani, Prakash] Int Monetary Fund, Independent Evaluat Off, Washington, DC 20431 USA",American University; International Monetary Fund; International Monetary Fund,"Jalles, JT (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Res Dept, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",jjalles@imf.org,"Jalles, Joao Tovar/AAA-9923-2019","Jalles, Joao Tovar/0000-0002-7171-5076; An, Zidong/0000-0001-5629-3883",,,,,23,18,20,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

The results reveal that relationships between exchange rates and stock returns are positive in the medium and long term, indicating that exchange rates lead stock returns in Brazil and Russia. However, the India index pair has a negative relation, and stock returns lead exchange rates in 64-128-day scales over the periods 2008, 2010-2012, and 2012-2015, while South Africa seems to have a more bidirectional causality; the Chinese index pair did not show any correlation.

Approximately 20 per cent of children are classified as poor on one measure but not the other. Children in workless households and ethnic minority children face the highest odds of growing up in both multidimensional poverty and income poverty. We find similar levels of persistence in multidimensional poverty and income poverty, with 17 per cent (18 per cent) of children experiencing persistent multidimensional (income) poverty and 10 per cent of children experiencing both persistent multidimensional poverty and persistent income poverty.

Assessing and managing future impacts of climate change on poverty requires different metrics, and specific studies focusing on the vulnerability of poor people. This special issue provides a set of such studies, looking at the exposure and vulnerability of people living in poverty to shocks and stressors that are expected to increase in frequency or intensity due to climate change, such as floods, droughts, heat waves, and impacts on agricultural production and ecosystem services. This introduction summarizes their approach and findings, which support the idea that the link between poverty and climate vulnerability goes both ways: poverty is one major driver of people's vulnerability to climate-related shocks and stressors, and this vulnerability is keeping people in poverty. The paper concludes by identifying priorities for future research.","[Hallegatte, Stephane] World Bank Grp, Global Facil Disaster Reduct & Recovery, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Fay, Marianne] World Bank Grp, Sustainable Dev Vice Presidency, Washington, DC USA; [Barbier, Edward B.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",The World Bank; The World Bank; Colorado State University,"Hallegatte, S (通讯作者)，World Bank Grp, Global Facil Disaster Reduct & Recovery, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",shallegatte@worldbank.org,,,,,,,55,71,79,9,78,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Furthermore, Japan anticipates significant increases in future government expenditures due to an aging population. These problems have led Japan to introduce a consumption tax rate in an attempt to raise revenues, and, more recently, to reduce the statutory corporate income tax rate to raise investment and output growth. In this paper we study the growth and welfare consequences of a reduction in income taxation in Japan along with increases in consumption taxation to stabilize the debt to output ratio. In particular, we consider various unanticipated tax reforms using the model described in Hansen and imrohoroglu (2016).

By connecting physiological and behavioral responses to microfinance requests for 101 participants, we found that investments with a social purpose, compared with those that were self-focused, received 25% more loans. Social purpose requests were associated with a significant reduction in two measures of physiologic arousal, resulted in greater empathic concern, and produced stronger negative affect compared with self-focused requests. These factors were largely driven by responses by women, who invested 90% more money to requests overall and 97% more to social purpose requests than did men. Our findings indicate that communicating social purpose is an effective way to attract more investment to entrepreneurs in developing countries.","[Kraig, Adriana; Terris, Elizabeth T.; Barraza, Jorge A.; Zak, Paul J.] Claremont Grad Univ, Ctr Neuroecon Studies, 160 East 10th St, Claremont, CA 91711 USA; [Cornelis, Cosette] St Georges Univ, Sch Med, True Blue Point, Grenada; [Neubert, Mitchell J.] Baylor Univ, Dept Management, Hankamer Sch Business, Waco, TX 76798 USA; [Wood, Matthew S.] Baylor Univ, Dept Entrepreneurship, Hankamer Sch Business, Waco, TX 76798 USA",Claremont Colleges; Claremont Graduate School; Baylor University; Baylor University,"Zak, PJ (通讯作者)，Claremont Grad Univ, Ctr Neuroecon Studies, 160 East 10th St, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",paul.zak@cgu.edu,"Wood, Matthew/HDN-1469-2022",,"National Science Foundation [0925907]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0925907] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",This study was supported by the National Science Foundation Grant 0925907 to Mitchell J.

We present the first theoretical model of VCPs, motivating it from a review of their institutional background, and the limited empirical literature on their effects. We show that tort liability alone leads to excessive development and insufficient risk mitigation, motivating the creation of mandatory cleanup programs (MCPs). We then show that MCPs with budget constraints lead to insufficient development and excessive risk mitigation, motivating the creation of VCPs. We analyze both the effect of VCPs on the extensive margin (whether a site is developed or not) and the intensive margin (mitigation level). VCPs do not increase mitigation efforts at all sites, but do increase the number of contaminated sites that are remediated and redeveloped. If designed properly they can induce highly-contaminated sites that are unknown to regulatory authorities to come forward to join the VCP.","[Lyon, Thomas P.] Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, 701 Tappan St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Yin, Haitao] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Blackman, Allen] Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC USA; [Wernstedt, Kris] Virginia Tech, Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Alexandria, VA USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Resources for the Future; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Lyon, TP (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, 701 Tappan St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",tplyon@umich.edu; haitao.yin@gmail.com; blackman@rff.org; krisw@vt.edu,,"Lyon, Thomas/0000-0003-2283-7365","U.S. Environmental Protection Agency STAR Program [R832154]; EPA [909019, R832154] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",U.S. Environmental Protection Agency STAR Program(United States Environmental Protection Agency); EPA(United States Environmental Protection Agency),The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency STAR Program (Grant No. R832154) provided funding for this research.,,50,1,2,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Language and agricultural aid allocation strategies in northern Mali,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Mali; Northern Mali crisis; Aid allocation strategies; Language; French; Agricultural aid,FOREIGN-AID; CORRUPT GOVERNMENTS; GOVERNANCE; CONFLICT; POLITICS; RECEIVE; SHOCKS; CRISIS,"In January 2012, insurgent groups in northern Mali began a violent campaign against the central government. By March 2012, then-President Amadou Toumani Toure (ATT) was ousted in a successful coup. The ongoing unrest has drastically shifted the strategies foreign donors are using to allocate aid, particularly to northern Mali. While bilateral donors have drastically scaled back all programmatic aid, NGOs including Oxfam International and the Red Cross have stepped in to provide humanitarian aid. This shift from programmatic to humanitarian aid has left the agricultural sector particularly vulnerable. Since most of the food grown in Mali is grown in the northern region, such a drastic decrease in agricultural aid will have catastrophic effects in terms of projected food shortages. Furthermore, using evidence from new World Bank survey data gathered in northern Mali in 2015, we find that the agricultural aid being distributed by NGOs is not targeting those most in need. We find that French-speaking villages are more likely to be targeted for aid compared to non-French-speaking villages. We argue that in northern Mali, under the current sociopolitical conditions, speaking French makes these villages more attractive to aid organizations, regardless of their actual need for assistance. This appropriation principle means that aid is not going to the most vulnerable, but to the most politically or socially connected. We also find proof of a second layer of aid misappropriation. While Sonrai and Tamasheq-speaking villages receive less agricultural aid than French-speaking villages, the aid they do receive goes to those households most vulnerable to exogenous shocks. However, in French-speaking villages, the most vulnerable households are not guaranteed to receive agricultural aid. If desperately needed agricultural aid continues to be misappropriated, it could lead countries like Mali to become even more unstable. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

These measures are employed as control variables to investigate the pass-through of changes in the monetary policy rates (MPR) to retail banks' lending rates to firms. Applying a multivariate framework it is shown that the introduced credit risk measures are statistically significant and have the expected signs. In this context, the pass-through is symmetric and complete in the short run. No evidence indicates that expectations of MPR changes matter for banks' lending rates in Chile and robustness analyses indicate that neither do macroeconomic factors. The results suggest that credit risk should be taken into account when evaluating changes in banks' lending rates and higher-order moments of the interest rate distribution are suitable for measuring changes in this risk.

It also focuses uniquely on appropriability with two key issues in mind: (1) state appropriability of assets, and (2) the mobility of assets to thwart appropriation. In the previous resource curse literature, mobility has been framed using the concept of lootability. Appropriability is related to non-lootable assets, such as oil, that can be seized by the state or rival private oligarchs. Recent resource curse research has addressed appropriability by distinguishing between point-source resources and diffuse-source resources. This survey demonstrates that this distinction is borrowed from staple theory, and that point-source and diffuse-source resources are defined in terms of geographical concentration/dispersion rather than institutional characteristics. By establishing that political institutions, markets and incentives are the most important elements for determining appropriability, the resource curse/blessing literature could support a general positive theory of the predatory state.","[Vahabi, Mehrdad] Univ Paris 13, CEPN, 69 Rue Haxo,Escalier 10, F-75020 Paris, France",Universite Paris 13,"Vahabi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 13, CEPN, 69 Rue Haxo,Escalier 10, F-75020 Paris, France.",mehrdad.vahabi@wanadoo.fr,,,,,,,147,21,25,1,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUN,2018,175.0,3-4,,,,,393,428,,10.1007/s11127-018-0533-5,0.0,,,36,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,GG9QZ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000433037400010,0

In recent years, two important types of urban mobility datasets - smart card transactions and taxi GPS trajectories - have been used extensively but often separately to quantify travel patterns as well as urban spatial structures. Despite the fruitful research outcomes, the relationships between different types of transport flows in the same geographic area remain poorly understood. In this research, we propose an analytical framework to compare urban mobility patterns extracted from these two data sources. Using Singapore as a case study, this research introduces a three-fold comparative analysis to understand: (1) the spatial distributions of public transit and taxi usages and their relative balance; (2) the distance decay of travel distance, and (3) the spatial interaction communities extracted from the two transport modes. The research findings reveal that the spatial distributions of travel demand extracted from the two transport modes exhibit high correlations. However, more in-depth analysis (based on rank-size distribution and log odds ratio) reveals a higher degree of spatial heterogeneity in public transit usage. The travel distance of trips from public transit decays faster than that of taxi trips, highlighting the importance of taxis in facilitating long-distance travels. Both types of trips decay much faster when travel distance is beyond 20 km, which corresponds to the average distance from the urban periphery to the center. The spatial interaction communities derived from public transit are different on weekdays and weekends, while those of taxis show similar patterns. Both transport modes yield communities that reveal the city's polycentric structure, but their differences indicate that each of the transport modes plays a specific role in connecting certain places in the city. The study demonstrates the importance of comparative data analytics to urban and transportation research.","[Zhang, Xiaohu] Singapore Alliance Res & Technol, 1 Create Way, Singapore, Singapore; [Xu, Yang] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Land Surveying & Geoinformat, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Tu, Wei] Shenzhen Univ, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Shenzhen Key Lab Spatial Informat Smart Sensing &, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Tu, Wei] Shenzhen Univ, Res Inst Smart Cities, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Tu, Wei; Ratti, Carlo] MIT, Senseable City Lab, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Shenzhen University; Shenzhen University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Xu, Y (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Land Surveying & Geoinformat, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",yang.ls.xu@polyu.edu.hk,"Xu, Yang/ABD-4970-2021; TU, Wei/H-4073-2014","Xu, Yang/0000-0003-3898-022X; TU, Wei/0000-0002-0255-4037; Zhang, Xiaohu/0000-0001-5654-1445","National Research Foundation (NRF), Prime Minister's Office, Singapore under CREATE programme; Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART) Centre; Future Urban Mobility (FM) Interdisciplinary Research Group; Hong Kong Polytechnic University [1-BE0J]","National Research Foundation (NRF), Prime Minister's Office, Singapore under CREATE programme(National Research Foundation, Singapore); Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART) Centre(Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research & Technology Centre (SMART)); Future Urban Mobility (FM) Interdisciplinary Research Group; Hong Kong Polytechnic University(Hong Kong Polytechnic University)","The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions on earlier drafts of the manuscript.

We analyse the statistical properties of Bitcoin and find that it is uncorrelated with traditional asset classes such as stocks, bonds and commodities both in normal times and in periods of financial turmoil.

The cordon toll may give rise to several interrelated conflicts: between residents within and outside the cordon, between car and public transport users, between the rich and the poor and, as the toll capitalizes into rents, between landowners and renters. These conflicts drive all our results. In the short-run, we assume the population is immobile and rents are fixed. With identical individuals, the toll then increases commuting costs only for those outside the cordon. Unless residents within the cordon are the majority, the equilibrium toll resulting from the political process is below the optimal level. Allowing for heterogeneous values of time, rich car commuters prefer a toll higher than socially optimal but, unless access costs to public transit are small, the poor majority prefers a toll below the optimum. When the toll capitalizes into land rents within the cordon, we show that only voters owning land in the center support it. In all scenarios, earmarking revenues for public transport mitigates the effect of the toll on commuting costs, raising voter support. Finally, we find that it is easier to get support for a cordon close to the center than for one further out in the suburbs. We illustrate our results using a calibrated model based on data for Milan.","[De Borger, Bruno] Univ Antwerp, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Russo, Antonio] ETH, Leonhardstr 21, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Antwerp; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"De Borger, B (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",bruno.deborger@ua.ac.be,,"Russo, Antonio/0000-0002-8837-1265",,,,,39,8,9,0,11,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0094-1190,1095-9068,,J URBAN ECON,J.

A common understanding is that religion depresses women's rights in general and reproductive and abortion rights in particular. The literature on reproductive rights, however, is disproportionately focused on Western cases, and is limited in its definition of religion as a variable. What happens, though, when we switch to a more inclusive framework? To what extent do a variety of religious variables correlate with policy on reproductive rights outside of the Western context? We examine the relevance of the religion-abortion link in a broad comparative framework. We introduce the Comparative Abortion Index and test the effects of a wide range of denominations and religious characteristics on reproductive rights. Our study finds that reproductive rights correlate only with some religious denominations, while others have no significance. Additionally, while religiosity correlates with reproductive policy, variables such as religious freedom, separation of religion and state and religious diversity show no correlative effect. The comparative analyses suggest that the connection between religion and development in general and in the area of women's rights in particular is far more nuanced than previously thought.

We find that the CEE transition economies have generally increased their world export competitiveness, but gains in market share have been tempered by a poor match between both the commodity and regional export profiles of most of the CEE economies and the changes in the world impost profile, and by generally slow adaptation of the region to changes in the latter on both the commodity and regional dimensions. Changes in export competitiveness in the region overall are instead driven largely by expansions of market share within the EU. Using a new method we show that only a small proportion of the change in the trade share is attributable to changes in the extensive margin. We discuss possible policy implications.","[Gilbert, John] Utah State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Muchova, Eva] Univ Econ Bratislava, Dept Econ Theory, Bratislava, Slovakia",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; University of Economics Bratislava,"Gilbert, J (通讯作者)，Utah State Univ, Jon M Huntsman Sch Business, Dept Econ & Finance, 3565 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",jgilbert@usu.edu,"Gilbert, John P/A-9031-2009","Muchova, Eva/0000-0001-9758-5313",ITMS [26140230005]; European Union,ITMS; European Union(European Union (EU)),The authors would like to thank Peter Lelko for research assistance and Sandra Hlivnjak for helpful comments.

The aim of this legal framework is to replace what is nowadays referred to as the linear economy, in which people consume and throw away, with an economic system which supposedly reuses all its available resources. In spite of its probably good intentions, the circular economy package contains at least one directive which under current economic conditions is practically inapplicable in countries such as Romania. The packaging waste directive, which we speak of, focuses on raising mandatory recycling rates above the current levels. Past experience has shown that the present recycling system in Romania was unable to fulfil even the exiting, more modest targets. The lack of a necessary infrastructure in waste management and collection, combined with poor legislative measures made fulfilling individual environmental obligations a real challenge for producers of packaged goods. All the more, the recycling targets increase, without being correlated with the other conditions required for their completion, would place an undue burden on producers, that would also trigger a significant rise in consumer prices, especially in the area of foodstuff products.","[Jora, Octavian-Dragomir; Patruti, Alexandru; Iacob, Mihaela] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Jora, OD (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",octavian.jora@rei.ase.ro,"IACOB, Mihaela/ABC-9047-2020; Patruti, Alexandru/GZL-5598-2022; JORA, Octavian-Dragomir/AAS-6677-2021","IACOB, Mihaela/0000-0003-0558-8248; Patruti, Alexandru/0000-0002-4974-9018; JORA, Octavian-Dragomir/0000-0001-7111-3078",,,,,54,4,5,0,14,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,MAY,2018,20.0,48,,,,,478,497,,10.24818/EA/2018/48/478,0.0,,,20,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GL6OW,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000437308600006,0

These results are contrary to previous results from research not involving financial incentives, as most participants' WTP and WTA values are near zero for drinking cockroach contaminated water. Additionally, filtration of cockroach water leads participants to become significantly more likely to request compensation compared to spring water, but it does not result in requesting significantly more money to drink it.

Our research identifies several new facts. Firstly, borrower restrictions are definitely more effective in reducing the procyclicality of loan-loss provisions than other macroprudential policy instruments. This effect is supported in both unconsolidated and consolidated data and is robust to several robustness checks. Secondly, dynamic provisions, large exposure concentration limits and taxes on specific assets are effective in reducing the procyclicality of loan-loss provisions. And finally, we find that both loan-to-value caps and debt-to-income ratios, are especially effective in reducing the procyclicality of LLP of large banks. Concentration limits and taxes are also effective in reducing the procyclicality of LLP of large banks. Dynamic provisions reduce the procyclicality of LLP independently of bank size.

In the basic model where the urban skilled sector and the urban unskilled sector have no upstream and downstream linkage, we find that the wage inequality will be narrowed down if the urban skilled sector is more capital intensive than the urban unskilled sector. To capture the characteristic of China's state capitalism, we build an extended model where the urban skilled sector acts as an upstream industry for the urban unskilled sector, and find that the wage inequality will be reduced if the substitution elasticity of unskilled labor and intermediate product in the urban unskilled sector is large enough. When we consider the factual characteristics of the Chinese economy, our models predict that a shrink of rural-urban human capital disparity will be helpful to reduce the skilled-unskilled wage inequality in China.","[Pi, Jiancai; Zhang, Pengqing] Nanjing Univ, Dept Econ, 22 Hankou Rd, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University,"Pi, JC (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ, Dept Econ, 22 Hankou Rd, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",pi2008@nju.edu.cn,"Pi, Jiancai/AAY-5955-2021","Pi, Jiancai/0000-0003-4327-8355",National Social Science Foundation in China [16BJY080],National Social Science Foundation in China,"the National Social Science Foundation in China, Grant/Award Number: Grant No. 16BJY080",,42,10,10,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

In the literature, there is an intensive debate on the impact of alliance resources for smaller firms. We submit that the effect of alliance resources on the smaller firm financial performance depends on the attributes of these resources. Specifically, we argue that the attributes of partner organizational capital are negatively related and the attributes of partner production factor resources are positively related to the smaller firm financial performance. We test our theoretical framework by applying a longitudinal analysis to a dataset of 1730 firm-year observations of strategic equity alliances in the software industry in 25 countries over an 11-year period. We find support for our hypotheses, highlighting the critical importance of resource attributes for smaller firms in strategic equity alliance networks.","[Belgraver, Herman; Verwaal, Ernst] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Econ & Business, Korte Nieuwstr 33, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Belgraver, H (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Econ & Business, Korte Nieuwstr 33, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",herman.belgraver@kuleuven.be; ernst.verwaal@kuleuven.be,"Belgraver, Herman/C-8193-2015","Belgraver, Herman/0000-0002-4796-0506; Verwaal, Ernst/0000-0001-8160-8904",,,,,172,4,5,0,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Covering some 1.35 million hectares or about 25% of the country's arable area, agricultural estates are an important part of Malawi's rural economy. However, the analysis shows that 70% of these estates have expired leases, reducing government revenue from ground rent by up to US$35 million or 5% of the total public spending annually. The low quality of spatial records, as indicated by the fact that some 140,000 hectares under estates are subject to overlapping claims could preclude the land market participation, especially under longer-term contracts. Data from a 2006/07 survey suggest that estates' yield, productivity, and intensity of land use are below those of small farms. While the recently passed land laws create a basis for low-cost systematic demarcation and registration of rights to customary land, our analysis suggests that, to maximize their likely contribution to increasing productivity and welfare rather than conflict, such efforts need to be preceded by a clarification of boundaries and lease status of existing estates and ideally a more detailed study of the reasons underpinning the low productivity.

Such conversions are typically done at prices below market value. This provides strong financial incentives for tenants involved in such a conversion to use their informational advantage regarding the financial management of a cooperative, compared to less informed neighbors and buyers on the general market. This setting also provides a reliable way of estimating the persistence and effects of such an informational asymmetry through nearly 200,000 apartment transactions in Stockholm, Sweden, during the period of 2005 through mid-2014. We find that insiders take advantage of an informational asymmetry as newly formed cooperatives set monthly fees artificially low to increase the probability of a conversion as well as apartment values.

The formative role of rubber production in the 19th century involved local despots' imposition of a regime of violence. Reacting to this violent capitalist system, individual Waorani forged new socio-spatial territories through violence with rubber slavers and cooperation with the Taromenane, a people who continue to live in isolation. Today, an oil complex exerts control to bring the end of Yasuni's commodity frontier, even while the Waorani Nation and Taromenane hold legal rights to parts of the forests.

Proactively mobilizing the youth as a resource in the creation of sustainable livelihoods can potentially be a win-win-win solution that Ethiopia is currently attempting. The new youth employment strategy includes allocation of rehabilitated communal lands to youth groups. This study investigates the extent to which Ostrom's Design Principles (DPs) are followed and matter for the early performance of youth groups in terms of their stability, trust and overall performance. Data from a census of 742 youth groups in five districts in Tigray in northern Ethiopia is used. This study utilizes econometric methods to assess correlations between the DPs and a range of early performance indicators. The study contributes to the limited literature on local collective action utilizing large samples. We find a high degree of compliance with the DPs. Some of the DPs appeared more important for early performance of the youth groups. The Ethiopian youth group approach to mobilize landless and unemployed youth is promising and should be tested elsewhere. Further longitudinal research is needed on the Ethiopian model as it is still at an early stage of testing as most groups are less than five years old. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Consistent with a tightening of financing constraints post shock, borrower composition shifts toward larger and less risky firms, and loans exhibit higher collateralization rates.

We use a methodology which allows us to decompose the observed change in the rating into an effect associated with the change in agency rating policies (understood in a broad sense) and into another effect associated with the situation of bank assets. The results obtained show that with the crisis there was a generalised fall in the ratings, caused by both a worsening of the bank asset situation and the hardening of rating policies. Specifically, we find that 39.95% and 19.25% of the fall in ratings in the United States and European countries are due to a hardening of rating policies in Fitch and Standard and Poor's, respectively. Although the relevance of the change in the rating policy is lower in Moody's (15.83%), which suggests that has a less procyclical behaviour, this agency adjust their rating to a greater extent (15.94%) than Fitch (8.75%) and Standard and Poor's (8.17%) when the rating action is taken.","[Salvador, Carlos] CUNEF, Madrid, Spain; [Fernandez de Guevara, Juan; Manuel Pastor, Jose] Univ Valencia & Ivie, Valencia, Spain",CUNEF Universidad,"Salvador, C (通讯作者)，CUNEF, Madrid, Spain.",carlos.salvador@cunef.edu; radoselo@uv.es; jmpastor@uv.es,"Fernández de Guevara-Radoselovics, Juan Francisco/I-1996-2012; Pastor, Jose Manuel/K-9581-2014","Fernández de Guevara-Radoselovics, Juan Francisco/0000-0003-0590-612X; Pastor, Jose Manuel/0000-0002-5815-127X; Salvador, Carlos/0000-0001-7684-7505","Spain's Ministry of Education and Science [ECO2015-67656-P, ECO2017-84828-R, ECO2015-70632-R]",Spain's Ministry of Education and Science(Spanish Government),"Carlos Salvador (ECO2015-67656-P), Juan Fernandez de Guevara (ECO2017-84828-R) and Jose Manuel Pastor (ECO2015-70632-R) acknowledge the financial help of Spain's Ministry of Education and Science through research programs.",,58,8,9,1,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1062-9408,1879-0860,,N AM J ECON FINANC,N.

Research suggests several reasons for historic underrepresentation of racial/ethnic minorities, including limited spatial accessibility, marginality, subcultural differences, and discrimination. This study uses spatial analysis of survey data collected in a range of geographic locations across the US, to assess the spatial accessibility of three racial/ethnic groups to units of the national park system. The study also considers the relationships between spatial accessibility and measures of marginality, subculture, and discrimination. Results show that access to national parks varies greatly between geographic areas: residents of large metropolitan areas have better access to units of the national park system than residents of rural areas. The effect of spatial accessibility on visitation varies among racial/ethnic groups. The study also highlights the importance of culturally-oriented parks, provides information about park accessibility in order to enhance relevancy, and informs management strategies that can encourage visitation across different geographic areas and more diverse populations.","[Xiao, Xiao] Univ Vermont, Rubenstein Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Transportat Res Ctr, 81 Carrigan Dr, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Xiao, Xiao] Univ South Carolina, Dept Geog, Callcott Bldg,709 Bull St, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Aultman-Hall, Lisa] Univ Vermont, Coll Engn & Math Sci, Transportat Res Ctr, Farrell Hall,210 Colchester Ave, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Manning, Robert; Voigt, Brian] Univ Vermont, Rubenstein Sch Environm & Nat Resources, 81 Carrigan Dr, Burlington, VT 05405 USA",University of Vermont; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; University of Vermont; University of Vermont,"Xiao, X (通讯作者)，Univ Vermont, Rubenstein Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Transportat Res Ctr, 81 Carrigan Dr, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",xiaoxiaonju@gmail.com; laultman@uvm.edu; robert.manning@uvm.edu; brian.voigt@uvm.edu,"Xiao, Xiao/Z-1199-2019","Xiao, Xiao/0000-0001-5124-0985",National Park Service [H8W07110001]; USDOT UTC grant; Graduate College of the University of Vermont,National Park Service; USDOT UTC grant; Graduate College of the University of Vermont,This project and original data collection were funded by the National Park Service (H8W07110001) and a USDOT UTC grant to the University of Vermont Transportation Research Center through the National Center for Sustainable Transportation.

The model is a variation of asymmetric Cournot duopoly where developers choose levels of output conditioned on their rivals' output and their own levels of optimism in a stochastic environment. Our results show that optimistic developers construct more housing and hold more inventory when facing higher demand uncertainty. Developers' overconfidence creates value in terms of optimal profit and market share. We also discuss how updating beliefs over multi periods could turn a pessimistic developer to an optimistic one, and vice versa.

Given the broad importance of rank sum scoring (e.g., in non-parametric statistical testing, sporting competition, and mathematical competition), it is important to establish the level of ambiguity generated by this aggregation rule. Combinatorial likelihoods are na < ve, however, in that they assume each possible outcome sequence for an event to be equally likely. We develop a computational algorithm to extend upon previous combinatorial results as to the likelihood of a violation of transitivity or independence in rank sum scoring. We use a similar computational scoring approach to analyze the empirically-observed likelihood of each such violation across fourteen NCAA Cross Country Championships. Within the data, rank sum scoring fails to specify a robust winning team (i.e., one that also rank sum wins against each possible subset of opponents) in 4 of 14 cases. Overall, we find that empirical likelihoods of social choice violations are consistently (significantly) overestimated by combinatorial expectations. In the NCAA data, we find correlated ability (quality) levels within team (group) and discuss this as a cause of lower empirical likelihoods. Combinatorial analysis proves reliable in predicting the order of empirical likelihoods across violation type and event setting.","[Boudreau, James] Kennesaw State Univ, Coles Coll Business, Dept Econ Finance & Quantitat Anal, Kennesaw, GA USA; [Ehrlich, Justin] Western Illinois Univ, 447P Stipes Hall, Macomb, IL 61455 USA; [Raza, Mian Farrukh] Kansas State Univ, 327 Waters Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Sanders, Shane] Syracuse Univ, 316 MacNaughton Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",University System of Georgia; Kennesaw State University; Western Illinois University; Kansas State University; Syracuse University,"Sanders, S (通讯作者)，Syracuse Univ, 316 MacNaughton Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",ja-ehrlich@wiu.edu; mianfarrukhraza@ksu.edu; sdsander@syr.edu,"Raza, Mian Farrukh/AAU-5573-2021","Raza, Mian Farrukh/0000-0003-1209-1993",,,,,16,8,10,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,MAR,2018,174.0,3-4,,,,,219,238,,10.1007/s11127-017-0494-0,0.0,,,20,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,FW2PM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000425146200002,0

We show that winners outperform losers by a significant amount in restrictive funding states, while in expansive states, winners and losers perform similarly. This pattern is consistent with changing investor preferences for winners and losers following signaled shifts in funding availability. One plausible channel for this relation is the interaction between stock-level illiquidity and funding conditions. We find that liquidity risk is significantly priced during restrictive states, especially in loser stocks. Furthermore, loser stocks become more illiquid during restrictive conditions. Both effects help explain the relative performance difference between losers and winners across funding environments. Moreover, the funding environment influences the relationship between momentum and firm characteristics, after controlling for the influence of sentiment, market states and return dispersion. Overall, transitions in funding states appear to encourage investors to revise their factor pricing decisions, which produces inter-temporal variation in momentum. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We identify firms in distress among all listed firms based on accounting data, and we separately identify firms undergoing corporate restructuring based on a newspaper search for the Japanese term saiken. Even though the ratio of distressed firms has not declined, the incidence of saiken restructuring by such firms has become less frequent after the 1990s, indicating a decline in the governance and rescue role of the main bank. When firms undergo saiken, they adopt real adjustments in terms of labor, assets and finance. While the intensity of these adjustments has also declined over time, saiken firms make more significant adjustments than distressed firms that do not undergo restructuring. The role of saiken was an important part of corporate renewal in Japan, and it has declined. In line with existing research, these findings underscore changes in Japanese corporate governance, in particular regarding the decline of the monitoring and restructuring function of the main bank.","[Hoshi, Takeo] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Hoshi, Takeo] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Koibuchi, Satoshi] Chuo Univ, Hachioji, Tokyo, Japan; [Schaede, Ulrike] Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Chuo University; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Hoshi, T (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Hoshi, T (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",tkohoshi@stanford.edu,,,Economic and Social Research Institute of the Cabinet Office of Japan,Economic and Social Research Institute of the Cabinet Office of Japan,"An earlier version of this paper was presented at the 26th TRIO Conference held at The University of Tokyo, June 22,2017.

The paper shows how competitive versus team incentives compare in motivating Ugandan farmers to learn and share information relevant to adopting a new agricultural technology. We find that tournament-based incentives provide greater outcomes in terms of total information learned than threshold-based team incentives. Furthermore the order of the incentive - whether the tournament precedes or follows the team incentive scheme - does not affect the volume of information learned. New information introduced between rounds was learned by more individuals under team incentives than under tournament incentives. The study provides direct practical policy recommendations for improving learning in the context of agriculture in Uganda. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to successfully overcome the many pressures that they face, founders must make difficult choices about how to allocate their time and how much effort to exert in their ventures. These founders are also embedded in a broader social context, and their efforts are influenced by external conditions. In this study, we examine one particular social condition-pace of life-and its relationship on entrepreneurial work effort. We argue that the pace of life in the region where founders launch and run their ventures affects their work effort over and above other individual- and firm-level characteristics. We also argue that this direct relationship can strengthen or weaken depending on founding team size or entrepreneurial experience. Our longitudinal analyses of nearly 2600 US new ventures from 2004 to 2011 support our arguments. Our work advances prior research on the determinants of entrepreneurial work effort, enhances the literature on social norms and entrepreneurial action, and provides additional insights into the multilevel influences of entrepreneurial activity. While entrepreneurs are commonly perceived as non-conformists who march to the beat of their own drum, we find evidence suggesting that regional pace of life actually sets the tempo for business owners and influences the amount of effort that they allocate to their ventures.","[Vedula, Siddharth; Kim, Phillip H.] Babson Coll, Arthur M Blank Ctr Entrepreneurship, 231 Forest St, Babson Pk, MA 02447 USA",Babson College,"Vedula, S (通讯作者)，Babson Coll, Arthur M Blank Ctr Entrepreneurship, 231 Forest St, Babson Pk, MA 02447 USA.",svedula@babson.edu; pkim1@babson.edu,,"Vedula, Siddharth/0000-0002-6171-8388",,,,,102,17,21,3,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Here we discuss the most policy-relevant results of the study, mindful of the strengths and weaknesses of current models. Across all models, carbon prices lead to significant reductions in CO2 emissions and conventional pollutants, with the vast majority of the reductions occurring in the electricity sector. Importantly, emissions reductions do not significantly depend on the rebate or tax cut used to return revenues to the economy. Expected economic costs, as modeled by either GDP or welfare, are modest, but vary across models. These costs are offset by benefits from avoided climate damages and health benefits from reductions in conventional air pollution. Using revenues to reduce preexisting capital or labor taxes reduces costs in most models relative to lump-sum rebates, but the size of the cost reductions varies significantly. Devoting at least some revenue to household rebates can significantly reduce adverse impacts on low income households. Carbon prices at $25/ton or even lower levels cause significant shifts away from coal as an energy source with responses of other energy sources highly dependent upon technology cost assumptions. Beyond 2030, we conclude that model uncertainties are too large to make quantitative results useful for near-term policy design. We close by describing recommendations for policymakers on interacting with model results in the future.","[Barron, Alexander R.] Smith Coll, Environm Sci & Policy Program, 44 Coll Lane, Northampton, MA 01063 USA; [Fawcett, Allen A.; McFarland, James R.] US EPA, 1200 Penn Ave NW, Washington, DC 20460 USA; [Hafstead, Marc A.

We investigate the remittance behavior using the migrants' conditions before migration as well as during the migration experience. Using a two-part model, we show that the decision to remit and the amount remitted depend on a combination of different migrant characteristics and reasons for migration as well as the form of migration. More importantly, we also consider if the remittance behavior is dependent on the type of return: decided or compelled. We show that the two groups have different incentives to remit, which can help explain the link between type of migrants and their remittance behavior.","[Collier, William; Piracha, Matloob] Univ Kent, Canterbury, Kent, England; [Piracha, Matloob] IZA Inst Labor Econ, Bonn, Germany; [Randazzo, Teresa] Univ Bari, Bari, Italy",University of Kent; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro,"Piracha, M (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Keynes Coll, Canterbury CT2 7NP, Kent, England.",M.E.Piracha@kent.ac.uk,"Randazzo, Teresa/AGZ-6630-2022","Piracha, Matloob/0000-0003-0885-349X; Randazzo, Teresa/0000-0001-7524-9191",,,,,21,5,7,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Unlike the predominant viewpoint in which commercialization is reached, as advances in science facilitate design changes that enable improvements in performance and cost, most new forms of electronic products and services are not invented in a scientific sense, and the cost and performance of them are primarily driven by improvements in standard components. They become candidates for commercialization, as the cost and performance of standard components reach the levels necessary for the final products and services to have the required levels of performance and cost. This suggests that when managers, policy makers, engineers, and entrepreneurs consider the choice and timing of commercializing new electronic products and services, they should understand the composition of new technologies, the impact of components on a technology's cost, performance and design, and the rates of improvement in the components.",,,,jeffreyleefunk@gmail.com,,,,,,,84,5,7,0,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

The adulteration of honey can undermine confidence in products as well as having adverse public health consequences. The aim of this research is to demonstrate the possibilities for the utilisation of network-based stochastic simulation methods to determine the proliferation of (accidentally or deliberately) polluted food products, using the example of the international honey trade network. The database for the analysis is based on the FAO dataset. The results of a network analysis of the global honey trade system highlight the scale-free character of the world's honey supply system. Focussing on backbone states and product flows, it is possible to determine the geographical distribution of polluted products as a function of the source of pollution. This information is important for the organisation of international trade control systems when contaminated products appear in a given state. The polluted product transfer capacity and the exposure of different states to polluted honey products can, in most cases, be efficiently forecast by the simultaneous application of different centrality measures and indicators.","[Popp, Jozsef; Olah, Judit; Mate, Domician; Bai, Attila] Univ Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary; [Kiss, Anna; Lakner, Zoltan] Szent Istvan Univ, Godollo, Hungary",University of Debrecen; Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences,"Oláh, J (通讯作者)，Univ Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.",olah.judit@econ.unideb.hu,"Bai, Attila/J-4499-2019; Máté, Domicián/J-4640-2019; Popp, József/AAF-4461-2021; Popp, József/AFN-1250-2022; Oláh, Prof. Dr. Judit/U-5352-2019","Bai, Attila/0000-0001-9323-7311; Máté, Domicián/0000-0002-4995-7650; Popp, József/0000-0003-0848-4591; Oláh, Prof. Dr. Judit/0000-0003-2247-1711",New National Excellence Program of the Ministry of Human Capacities [UNKP-17-4],New National Excellence Program of the Ministry of Human Capacities,Supported by the UNKP-17-4 New National Excellence Program of the Ministry of Human Capacities.,,45,18,18,0,10,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2018,20.0,47,,,,,84,98,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FZ8BI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427829800006,0

Using national data for 4,129 married women 15-43 years who took part in the Egypt Labor Market Panel Survey (ELMPS 1998-2012), we performed autoregressive, cross lagged panel analyses to assess whether women's first marriage in adulthood (at 18 years or older, as reported in 2006), was positively associated with their long-term post-marital economic empowerment, measured as their engagement in market work and latent family economic agency in 2012. Women's first marriage in adulthood had positive unadjusted associations with their market work and family economic agency in 2012. These associations persisted after accounting for market work and family economic agency in 2006, pre-marital resources for empowerment, and cumulative fertility.

The population of the study was the prospective jobseekers represented by the students of Faculty of Economics, State University of Padang which were currently in the last semester (8th semester) amounted to 441 people. The sampling was performed by using Slovin formula. Based on the formula, a total sample of 210 people was obtained. The data were collected using an instrument directly addressed to the respondents. The analysis technique used the Logistic Regression Model. The economic infrastructure significantly affects the decision of jobseekers to do urbanization to both Padang and Pekanbaru. However, the opportunities of prospective jobseekers to do urbanization to Pekanbaru tend to be higher than to Padang. Educational facilities have a significant effect on the decision making of prospective job seekers to do urbanization, but the opportunity of prospective jobseeker to do urbanization to Padang tend to be higher compared to Pekanbaru. Health facilities significantly affect the decision of prospective job seekers do urbanization, but the trend of job seekers to do urbanization to Pekanbaru tends to be higher than to Padang. Employment opportunity variable becomes a significant consideration for prospective job seekers to do urbanization in determining the decisions, but the opportunity of prospective job seekers to do urbanization to Pekanbaru tends to be higher than to Padang. Two variables differentiate the job seekers to do urbanization to Padang and Pekanbaru. Those variables are the security level and the wage rate. Prospective job seekers tend to decide to do urbanization to Padang with the consideration of a higher level of security, while others move to Pekanbaru with the consideration of higher wage rate than to Padang.","[Amar, Syamsul; Ariusni; Satrianto, Alpon] Univ Negeri Padang, Padang, Indonesia",Universitas Negeri Padang,"Amar, S (通讯作者)，Univ Negeri Padang, Padang, Indonesia.",syamsul_amar3@yahoo.com; ariusni.fe.unp@gmail.com; alpon.unp@gmail.com,"satrianto, alpon/ADR-9595-2022",,,,,,20,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-581-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,57.0,,,,,,410,417,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM7OX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000468271400053,0

The target of Malaysia is to have women's representation of 30% in senior decision-making positions and on boards by 2016 as to accelerate the development of high-potential women leaders in the labour market and in decision-making positions across all industry sectors and business functions. The purpose of this paper is to look at various facets of corporate governance, notably the effectiveness of boards of directors and the composition of boards. In this context, the current study gauges the effects of women directors regarding firm performance issues and the benefits of female representation on boards. The research purpose is to examine the effect of board gender diversity and independence on firm performance in Malaysia's listed companies in consumer products and properties sectors covering a 10-year period from 2007 to 2016. This study also examines number of female and directors affecting the firm performance in terms of Return on Asset (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE) specifically in two sectors which is consumer products and properties. Quantitative data was collected from the Bloomberg website and annual reports of the public listed companies in Bursa Malaysia. Board Gender diversity was found to be positively related to the firm performance. However, independent director is found insignificant to firm performance. The findings may provide some implications for future research regarding the effectiveness of board of directors towards firm performance. Nevertheless, the finding may not reflect the true picture since the percentage of female directors quite constant in Malaysia. It is recommended to promote gender equality in terms of recruiting women into the corporate board and increase the participation of women in the labour force.","[AuYong, H. N.; Tan, B. S.

While encouraging, these commitments are not ambitious enough to achieve the 2 degrees C threshold by 2100, and further negotiations are needed. There is, therefore, a necessity to assess the economic consequence of a pathway to 2 degrees C and the fair sharing of this burden. In this paper, we use a game theoretic approach for the design of fair agreements concerning additional abatements up to 2050. The simulations performed with our model confirm the weakness of INDC pledges but sbow that, with political determination, an equitable burden-sharing agreement can be achieved with very reasonable costs for all nations of approximately 0.8% of total discounted household consumption. With a more ambitious 1.5 degrees C target, global cost is multiplied by a factor of four revealing the stringency of such an objective. Numerical results also show that the implementation of an international carbon market and participation of all countries in the game are crucial elements for reaching equitable burden-sharing among countries. For example, considering a reduced G20 coalition, welfare losses are multiplied by a factor of three for coalition members. Our simulations also permit a first evaluation of the possible impacts of the recently announced USA withdrawal from the Paris agreement.","[Babonneau, Frederic; Haurie, Alain] ORDECSYS, Chene Bougeries, Switzerland; [Babonneau, Frederic] Adolfo Ibanez Univ, Sch Business, Santiago, Chile; [Vielle, Marc] Swiss Fed Inst Technol Lausanne EPFL, LEURE Lab, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Haurie, Alain] Univ Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland; [Haurie, Alain] Univ Montreal, HEC Business Sch, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Universidad Adolfo Ibanez; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; University of Geneva; Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal,"Babonneau, F (通讯作者)，ORDECSYS, Chene Bougeries, Switzerland.;Babonneau, F (通讯作者)，Adolfo Ibanez Univ, Sch Business, Santiago, Chile.",frederic.babonneau@uai.cl,"Babonneau, Florence/A-6318-2009; Vielle, Marc/A-5788-2016","Vielle, Marc/0000-0002-0810-8281",Qatar National Research Fund [6-1035-5-126],Qatar National Research Fund(Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF)),This research has been partially supported by the Qatar National Research Fund under Grant Agreement no 6-1035-5-126.

The need for profit in the short term may result in reporting unreliable data to public statistics entities. The aim of the chapter is to point out some of possible irregularities in economic activities' evidence of Polish taxpayers whose businesses depend on intra-community trade. These anomalies consist of hiding transactions by avoiding statistical declarations or late declaring which has an immediate impact on aggregated statistical data. As a result, there are huge differences between datasets containing the same data reported by both sides of transactions, i.e., as intra-community supplies (ICS), by Polish businesses and as intra-community acquisitions (ICA) from Polish businesses. At least some of such anomalies can be linked with tax fraud. Another group of anomalies includes specific schemes that can be observed in declared data. The authors have studied the above-mentioned differences and found irregularities within ICS and ICA for Combined Nomenclature chapters and positions. The structures of such differences have been compared for years 2010-2016. In the second part of the chapter, we discuss specific schemes in declared data that may indicate participation in VAT fraud.

However, the conversion process in the EU is a twotier decision, which brings the possibility of a nested structure between mixed and organic farming. In the context of Sweden, where the conversion investment is flexible, we attempted to identify economic determinants of the organic conversion process. For that purpose, we applied the nested Logit random utility maximisation (NLRUM) model to data from the Swedish farm accounting data network for 2002-2012. The analysis showed that milk prices, milk yield and environmental support payments play a significant role in the organic conversion process. As expected, a decrease in conventional milk prices would induce conventional farms to convert to organic production. The scale of conversion to organic farming was more pronounced among dairy farms located in regions with higher environmental support payments, and in regions endowed with more pasture land and leys.","[Basnet, Shyam Kumar; Manevska-Tasevska, Gordana; Surry, Yves] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Uppsala, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Basnet, SK (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, Box 7013, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",,"Manevska-Tasevska, Gordana/ABH-4979-2020","Manevska-Tasevska, Gordana/0000-0003-0966-0200; Basnet, Shyam Kumar/0000-0002-7072-6013","AgriFood Economics Centre, Lund, Sweden","AgriFood Economics Centre, Lund, Sweden","The authors thank AgriFood Economics Centre, Lund, Sweden for financial support to this research.

To increase production efficiency and overall output, the Government of Tanzania and its development partners are promoting dairy market hubs (DMHs) to enhance access to milk markets, inputs and services. However, there is limited empirical evidence on the degree to which these potential benefits translate into real benefits in dairy production and income, particularly for smallholder farmers. This paper therefore, examines the effect of DMHs on smallholder farmers' income. Using primary data collected from 461 smallholder dairy farmers in four districts in two regions of Tanzania (Tanga and Morogoro) the study employs quasi-experimental methods combining propensity score matching and difference-in-difference (DD) to estimate treatment effects. The results indicate that participation in DMHs increased household dairy income by 4.07 percentage points on average for the period 2014 to 2016. Participation is encouraged by group membership, land owned and quantity of milk sold. It relates negatively with milk price and negatively, though weakly, with age. These results suggest that it would be productive to support livestock producer groups across all potential dairy areas to move towards forming DMHs. Specific actions that could facilitate this are discussed.","[Bayiyana, Irene; Hepelwa, Aloyce; Mdadila, Kenneth] Univ Dar es Salaam, Dept Econ, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Rao, Elizaphan J.

The following hypothesis was verified: institutional solutions in the current Polish pension scheme will not provide sufficient protection against poverty for all future pensioners. The research methods used included a review of the subject literature and an empirical analysis of statistical data. The research findings show that the statutory pension scheme in Poland does not protect well all future pensioners against income poverty. Transition to pensions based on lifetime contributions will lead to lower adequacy and an increased risk of poverty among elderly population. A minimum insurance period of 25 years for men and 20 years for women is required to obtain the right to a guaranteed minimum-pension.

Emerging economies thriving towards achieving higher rates of economic growth are considering Foreign Direct Investments to be the best source of funds. OECD defines Foreign Direct Investment as Foreign direct investment reflects the objective of obtaining a lasting interest by a resident entity in one economy (direct investor'') in an entity resident in an economy other than that of the investor (direct investment enterprise''). The lasting interest implies the existence of a long-term relationship between the direct investor and the enterprise and a significant degree of influence on the management of the enterprise. Direct investment involves both the initial transaction between the two entities and all subsequent capital transactions between them and among affiliated enterprises, both incorporated and unincorporated. Indian economy is one such economy which has shown increasing volume of Foreign Direct Investment amounting to US$ 44468 million till 2018. This research paper deals with relationship of FDI and GDP of BRICS economies. The regression analysis has been done to prove how closely Foreign Direct Investment is linked with Gross Domestic Product of BRICS nations. At the same time the paper has also focused on changes in FDI stocks, flows and Gross Domestic Product over the years.","[Bhakri, Suman] Delhi Univ, Dept Commerce, Shri Ram Coll Commerce, Delhi, India; [Kaur, Ravleen] Delhi Univ, Commerce, Shri Ram Coll Commerce, Delhi, India",Shri Ram College of Commerce; University of Delhi; Shri Ram College of Commerce; University of Delhi,"Bhakri, S (通讯作者)，Delhi Univ, Dept Commerce, Shri Ram Coll Commerce, Delhi, India.",suman.bhakri@srcc.du.ac.in,,"Kaur, Ravleen/0000-0003-4498-1819",,,,,14,1,1,2,10,VOLKSON PRESS,KUALA LUMPUR,"C-3A-15 CENTRIO PANTAI HILLPARK, JALAN PANTAI MURNI, BANGSAR SOUTH,, KUALA LUMPUR, WILAYAH PERSEKUTUAN KUALA LUMPUR 59200, MALAYSIA",,,978-1-948012-10-2,,,,2018,,,,,,,29,31,,10.26480/icefs.01.2018.29.31,0.0,,,3,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL6HR,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000454212200006,0

The strongest evidence comes from the specifications which involve higher-order interest rate smoothing in the trade-weighted Taiwan Dollar rate.

We document differences in the distribution of female autonomy in India (using the National Family Health Survey 2005-2006) addressing two methodological challenges: the multidimensional nature of the concept and its frequent measurement with ordinal variables (which are not amenable to direct comparisons of social averages). We tackle these challenges with three methods based on stochastic dominance techniques suited for ordinal and dichotomous variables. Whenever these dominance conditions hold for a pairwise comparison, we can conclude that the multidimensional autonomy distribution in one state is more desirable than in another one across a broad range of criteria for the individual and social welfare evaluation of autonomy. Consistently across the three methods, we find that most of the states with better autonomy distributions (in pairwise comparisons) come from the north east and the south, whereas most of the states with worse autonomy distributions come from the north.","[Chaudhuri, Kausik; Yalonetzky, Gaston] Univ Leeds, Business Sch, Maurice Keyworth Bldg, Leeds LS6 1AN, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Yalonetzky, G (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Business Sch, Maurice Keyworth Bldg, Leeds LS6 1AN, W Yorkshire, England.",G.Yalonetzky@leeds.ac.uk,,"Yalonetzky, Gaston/0000-0003-2438-0223; Chaudhuri, Kausik/0000-0002-7492-1369",,,,,27,2,2,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

In the second subsequent stage, Support Vector Machine regression is applied to discriminate between high/low efficiency groups within each performance threshold. The results reveal that the overall efficiency level of the Chinese banks remains still low.

The research contributes to the understanding of institutional arrangements in place at coffee grower perspective. An additional descriptive field investigation presented the existence of three different types of arrangement as a solution for coffee harvesting mechanization: total vertical integration (make), outsourcing contracts (buy) and tapped vertical integration. Those results demonstrate a shift from a spot transaction pattern to more sophisticated contractual tools.

This research is limited to taking only two indicators from each perspective due to time so that constraints, so that further researchers can take with several other full indicators. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method has the advantage of allowing assessors to capture both subjective and objective measures of organizational quality evaluation.

Based on a model that accounts for a subsistence requirement in the consumption of ecosystem services, we provide empirical evidence on substitution elasticities. We find an initial mean elasticity of substitution of two, which declines over time towards complementarity. We subsequently extend the theory of dual discounting by introducing a subsistence requirement. The relative price of ecosystem services is non-constant and grows without bound as the consumption of ecosystem services declines towards the subsistence level. An application suggests that the initial discount rate for ecosystem services is more than a percentage-point lower as compared to manufactured goods. This difference increases by a further half percentage-point over a 300-year time horizon. The results underscore the importance of considering limited substitutability in long-term public project appraisal.","[Drupp, Moritz A.] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Wilhelm Seelig Pl 1, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; [Drupp, Moritz A.] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton, England",University of Kiel; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Drupp, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Wilhelm Seelig Pl 1, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.;Drupp, MA (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton, England.",Drupp@economics.uni-kiel.de,,"Drupp, Moritz/0000-0001-8981-0496",German National Academic Foundation; DAAD; BMBF [01LA1104C],German National Academic Foundation; DAAD(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); BMBF(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"I am very grateful to Stefan Baumgartner, Ben Groom and Martin Quaas for their support.

Board size and board composition have significant impact on the ability in preventing financial distress in Indonesia whereas it is found insignificant in the case of Malaysia companies. On the contrary, in Indonesia, the managerial ownership has impact on the financial distress prevention, while Malaysia's result shows there is a significant impact. Additionally, this study has found that gender diversity has a significant impact on the ability in preventing financial distress in both Indonesia and Malaysia.

This study estimated derived demand for input seed in central Uganda using trans-log production model. Own-price and cross-price elasticities for production inputs were estimated using marginal approach. Seed demand analysis showed that farmers would utilise seed from market sources of approximately 32 tons per year, against current formal supply of 4.4 tons. Estimated price elasticities showed that purchased seed was less sensitive to its own price, implying less significant effect of price change on the quantity of seed demanded over time. Seed production exhibited higher gross margins and returns to labour day compared to vegetable production, suggesting prospects of profitability and sustainability of farmer-seed enterprises as an alternative source of quality seed for farmers.","[Kansiime, Monica K.; Karanja, Daniel K.] CAB Int, Seed Syst, POB 633-00621, Nairobi, Kenya; [Alokit, Christine] CAB Int, Extens & Commun, POB 633-00621, Nairobi, Kenya; [Ochieng, Justus] World Vegetable Ctr, Eastern & Southern Africa, POB 10, Arusha, Tanzania",,"Kansiime, MK (通讯作者)，CAB Int, Seed Syst, POB 633-00621, Nairobi, Kenya.",monkansiime@yahoo.co.uk,,"Karanja, Daniel/0000-0001-8167-7395; Justus, Ochieng/0000-0002-6326-1377",Irish Aid,Irish Aid(CGIAR),"This survey was conducted as part of the project titled, 'Good Seed Initiative' financed by Irish Aid.

Design/methodology/approach - SR metrics from GRI-G4 guidelines were mapped to persuasive communication parameters to develop a blended analytical framework. Content analysis (CA) technique was used to assess SR of top 10 banks on this framework. Findings - The study has three key findings. First, most of the top 10 Indian banks are yet to adopt adequate disclosure and transparency practices in SR. Second, even though environmental and social goals are broadly reported, there are glaring omissions on metrics like equalremuneration, occupational health and safety and  customer privacy. Third, stakeholder engagement focus is weak as reflected in low persuasive appeal of SR content of most banks. Research limitations/implications - The blended framework provides a theoretical and analytical pathway for operationalizing the sustainability context principle, which has been inadequately addressed even within the GRI framework implementation. Practical implications - The paper provides a  health check and identifies red flags in SR of top 10 Indian banks, enabling them to undertake a critical review of their sustainability metrics and reporting practices. Social implications - The paper establishes the significance of evaluating non-financial reporting practices addressing broader sustainability metrics in the banking sector, in an emerging economy context. Originality/value - This paper develops a GRI-G4-based persuasive communication framework for SR assessment, and conducts an evaluation of top 10 Indian banks using CA technique.","[Kumar, Ranjan; Pande, Neerja] Indian Inst Management Lucknow, Dept Commun, Noida, India; [Afreen, Shamama] Indian Inst Management Lucknow, Dept Business Sustainabil, Noida, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Lucknow; Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Lucknow,"Kumar, R (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Management Lucknow, Dept Commun, Noida, India.",ranjan.kumar@iiml.org,"Baldissera, Annalisa/AHD-6334-2022",,,,,,66,19,20,2,29,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Nevertheless, they have not conducted the european economies to optimal situations both from the point of view of members (adhesion optimality) and of the entire group (admission optimality).We think that this two kinds of optimality must be validated in case of independant nations joining themselves in a Monetary Union.

Agroforestry systems have several advantages like lower levels of soil erosion, the reduction of nutrient leaching, increasing biodiversity and an improvement of the landscape. Despite the various advantages, the number of agroforestry system in Germany is negligible and alley cropping is only applied at specific experimental sites. Reasons for this retention might be economic disadvantages in comparison with traditional annual cropping systems. In order to compare the profitability and risk profiles of agroforestry and traditional annual cropping systems, we applied Monte-Carlo simulation. The analysis is based on data from two different experimental farms in Germany. In comparison with an annual arable farming system, the experimental agroforestry system in Dornburg shows a higher expected value of the performance cost difference in combination with a lower standard deviation. For the second experimental site in Forst, the results also reveal a higher expected value of the performance cost difference for the agroforestry system in comparison to the annual arable farming system. However, differences to the first experimental area occur because in Forst the standard deviation is higher for the agroforestry system than for the annual arable farming system. Thus, in both cases the agroforestry system turns out to be more profitable than the annual arable farming system but in the case of the Forst the higher profitability goes hand in hand with higher risk. The results have manifold implications for agricultural policy and future research.","[Langenberg, Josef; Feldmann, Marius; Theuvsen, Ludwig] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany; [Langenberg, Josef; Feldmann, Marius; Theuvsen, Ludwig] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Dept Agrarokon & Rurale Entwicklung, Arbeitsbereich Betriebswirtschaftslehre Agribusin, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen; University of Gottingen,"Langenberg, J (通讯作者)，Georg August Univ Gottingen, Dept Agrarokon & Rurale Entwicklung, Arbeitsbereich Betriebswirtschaftslehre Agribusin, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",josef.langenberg@agr.uni-goettingen.de,,,,,,,67,10,10,0,11,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

In the real options literature, compound options are most suitable to be employed to investment problems involving sequential decision making. Most compound option and real options formulae are based on log-normal distribution while the empirical evidence shows that the return distribution in real market exhibits asymmetric leptokurtic feature, higher peak and two heavier tails. This paper introduces the jump-diffusion process into pricing compound options and derives the related valuation formulas. We assume that the dynamic of the underlying asset return process consists of a drift component, a continuous Wiener process and discontinuous jump-diffusion processes which have jump times that follow the compound Poisson process and the logarithm of jump size follows the double exponential distribution proposed by Kou (2002). Numerical results indicate that the advantage of combining the double exponential distribution and normal distribution is that it can capture the phenomena of both the asymmetric leptokurtic features and the volatility smile. Furthermore, the compound options under the double exponential jump diffusion model which we derived are more generalized than those proposed by Gukhal (2004) and Geske (1979), and thus have wider application.","[Liu, Yu-hong; Hsu, Wei-tze] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Tainan, Taiwan; [Jiang, I-Ming] Yuan Ze Univ, Taoyuan, Taiwan",National Cheng Kung University; Yuan Ze University,"Jiang, IM (通讯作者)，Yuan Ze Univ, Coll Management, Taoyuan 32003, Taiwan.",jiangfinance@satum.yzu.edu.tw,,,,,,,36,4,5,1,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1062-9408,1879-0860,,N AM J ECON FINANC,N.

To address problems of endogeneity and reverse causation, we use historical instrumental variables from an 1890 plan for the railroad network and a 1937 plan for the autobahn and major roads network. We find a statistically and economically significant positive causal effect of regional changes in autobahn kilometers on employment and the wage bill. According to our IV results, a one-standard-deviation increase in the growth of autobahn length between 1937 and 1994 led to employment growth of between 2.7 and 3.4% and to wage bill growth of between 3.0 and 3.7% over the period from 1994 to 2008. The results are robust to an alternative regional demarcation and identification strategy as well as to alternative estimation methods.","[Moeller, J.] Inst Employment Res IAB, Regensburger Str 104, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany; [Moeller, J.; Zierer, M.] Univ Regensburg, Inst Volkswirtschaftslehre Einschl Okonometrie, Univ Str 31, D-94040 Regensburg, Germany",University of Regensburg,"Möller, J (通讯作者)，Inst Employment Res IAB, Regensburger Str 104, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany.",joachim.moeller@iab.de; marcus.zierer@gmx.net,,,,,,,43,26,26,2,23,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0094-1190,1095-9068,,J URBAN ECON,J.

In efforts to arrive at more enriching findings, the UTFs are further categorised into equity, bond, balanced, fixed, mixed, money market and feeder funds. Design/methodology/approach The study adopts the vector autoregression framework (Johansen and Juselius (1990), cointegration test and vector error correction model to analyse the relationship between the macroeconomic variables and the NAVs of the various type of funds. Findings The study shows that there is a significant long-run equilibrium relationship between the macroeconomic variables and the NAV of all Islamic UTFs in Malaysia. Despite of this, the findings show that different funds have different responses to the movements of the macroeconomic variables. Practical implications The results of the study are of significant importance to the various stakeholders in the Islamic UTF industry. Investors benefit in terms of getting the inputs on their investment decisions as to whether to buy, hold or sell fund units within their investment portfolio in the long run, along with building their optimal portfolio diversification investment strategy, especially in reallocating their assets distribution between the various types of funds in the UTFs industry. For the policy-makers, the findings of the study may assist them in evaluating the suitability of the existing economic policies as to whether they positively or negatively contribute to the development of the Islamic UTFs. Originality/value This paper fulfils the need to understand how unit-holders can strategise and diversify their portfolio investments in the Malaysian Islamic UTFs industry based on detailed understanding and knowledge derived from rational and scientific inputs.","[Othman, Anwar Hasan Abdullah] Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Aziz, Hasanuddeen Abdul] Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Kulliyyah Econ & Management Sci, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Kassim, Salina] Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Inst Islamic Banking & Finance, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",International Islamic University Malaysia; International Islamic University Malaysia; International Islamic University Malaysia,"Othman, AHA (通讯作者)，Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",anwar315a@yahoo.com,"Othman, Anwar Hasan Abdullah/U-3214-2019; Kassim, Salina/Q-7008-2019","Othman, Anwar Hasan Abdullah/0000-0001-5759-8216; Kassim, Salina/0000-0002-7514-8750",,,,,55,4,4,0,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Research are also increasingly directed toward the analysis of new models such as Boltzmann Gibbs or application of Gama function that describes this distribution. An interesting issue is the analysis of the distribution of wealth among the countries themselves. In these works, the value of GDP is used as the wealth that country has. In this article, the author dealt with the analysis of the distribution of GDP between countries at the global level. Analysis were performed using the Pareto distribution model of wealth distribution and GINI coefficient based on the data of the value of GDP for countries from IMF estimation. The analysis was conducted for the period from 1980 to the present, as well as analysis of data provided by IMF estimates for the value of GDP by 2022. The goal is to determine the degree of uneven distribution between the countries themselves in the world, analyzing the dynamics of change in the degree of unevenness and an analysis of the degree of unevenness in the future based on forecasts of the IMF on the values of countries GDP.

Previous studies primarily document the existence of the disposition effect in China without addressing: first, the impact of market states (bullish, bearish and neutral market) on the investors' disposition effect; and, second, we separate the fund performance according to the different levels of gains and losses. Our results suggest that investors are characterized by a house money effect when they have extreme capital gains under a bull market, and investors are characterized by an inverse disposition effect (they redeem their losing mutual fund units) when they have moderate capital losses under a neutral market. Thus, disposition effect is not uniform; it varies across market states in China.

We examine the implications of this decomposition for the country and industry size premia within a sample of 51 equity markets for the years 1973-2017. We confirm a significant size effect across countries and uncover an industry size effect: small industries markedly outperform large industries. While the cross-sectional dispersion in market value is determined almost exclusively by the lagged market value component, the country and industry size premia have two prmary drivers: lagged market value and long-run reversal.

A particular focus is set on the impact of differences in the regulatory environment and market structure across countries in explaining the interest margins of individual banks. Our results suggest that bank market power, operating costs, credit risk, and liquid asset holdings increase the margin between loan and deposit rates, while increased income diversification and GDP growth are associated with lower loan-deposit spreads. When considering information on banking regulation, we find strong evidence to support our main hypothesis that improvements in market quality and liberalization have a significant effect on interest margins.

The program was designed based on the assumption that households benefit from living in higher-opportunity neighborhoods. Early evaluations of the MTO program, however, showed minimal gains for participant families. One explanation for these findings is the short length of time which MTO families typically spent in lower-poverty neighborhoods; the positive effects of longer-term exposure to low-poverty neighborhoods appear more promising. In this study we examine the role of automobiles in increasing the length of time that MTO households remain in lower-poverty neighborhoods over a much longer period than previous studies, 1994-2010. A growing body of research suggests that automobiles provide households with better access to opportunities than other modes of travel, particularly in neighborhoods with lower poverty rates in more dispersed urban environments. We find that automobile access reduces households' neighborhood poverty exposure by between 3% and 4%, and automobile access trails only successful lease-up among policy-relevant factors in reducing exposure. Therefore, to maximize the effects of housing mobility programs, we suggest that voucher receipt ought to be paired with policies to increase participants' access to automobiles.","[Blumenberg, Evelyn; Pierce, Gregory] UCLA Luskin Sch Publ Affairs, 3250 Publ Affairs Bldg, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,"Pierce, G (通讯作者)，UCLA Luskin Sch Publ Affairs, 3250 Publ Affairs Bldg, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",eblumenb@ucla.edu; gpierce@luskin.uda.edu,,,HUD Sustainable Communities Research Grant [DCSRM0002-11],HUD Sustainable Communities Research Grant,This research was funded by a HUD Sustainable Communities Research (DCSRM0002-11) Grant.,,64,15,17,0,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Based on a balanced panel dataset comprising 115 countries during the period 1996-2015, the empirical results are generally robust across different estimation methodologies and show a high degree of persistence in exchange rate volatility. After controlling for standard macroeconomic factors, we find that the soft power' variablessuch as an index of voice and accountability, life expectancy, educational attainments, fragility of the banking sector, financial openness, and the share of agriculture relative to serviceshave a statistically significant influence on the level of exchange rate volatility across countries.

We find that the price level-income elasticity is fairly consistently estimated across data sets. However, there is some evidence that the relationship is non-linear. For developed economies, the quadratic term implies an inverted U-shaped relationship. Developing economies, on the other hand, display a U-shaped relationship. Estimates of misalignment differ, depending on the choice of specification and data sets. It appears that the Renminbi (RMB) was fairly valued by 2011.

Given that IA is not observable from revealed preferences, we draw on a survey experiment to elicit individuals' willingness to pay (WTP) to avoid institutionalization (e.g., in a nursing home), using a single and double-bounded referendum WTP format. Our results suggest robust evidence of IA and reveal a willingness to pay of up to 16% of respondent's average income of individuals over fifty-five years of age. We find that the estimated willingness to pay to avoid institutionalization (292) exceeds the amount respondents are willing to pay for home health care at old age in the event of a mild impairment (222). WTP estimates vary with income, age and especially, respondents' housing conditions.

Our results indicate that among Dutch homeowners there is substantial potential interest in reverse mortgages, especially for the purpose of being able to live more comfortably and not worry about money until death, or to make a significant expenditure on home improvements or traveling. Of the respondents who are interested in taking out a reverse mortgage loan, most indicate they prefer a line of credit (42%), while fewer prefer an annuity (15%) or a lump sum (10%). Our regression results, based on rich survey data, indicate that interest is higher among the self-employed and those who expect pension cuts, have wishes for big expenditures, have a high housing wealth relative to their income or already have more than one mortgage. Women and those with (grand)children, a lower socioeconomic status, sufficient savings and/or a deteriorating health are less interested. We find that giving examples of using a reverse mortgage for the benefit of the homeowners' (grand) children significantly raises interest in reverse mortgages among people who wish to leave a bequest. We interpret this as evidence that people are unaware of the potential of reverse mortgages to optimize the timing of wealth transfers.","[Dillingh, Rik] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Prast, Henriette] Tilburg Univ, CentER, Netspar, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Rossi, Mariacristina] CeRP CCA, Sch Management & Econ, Turin, Italy; [Rossi, Mariacristina] Netspar, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Brancati, Cesira Urzi] CeRP CCA, Int Longev Ctr UK, Turin, Italy; [Dillingh, Rik] CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, The Hague, Netherlands",Tilburg University; Tilburg University; Tilburg University; CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy,"Dillingh, R (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.;Dillingh, R (通讯作者)，CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, The Hague, Netherlands.",w.f.dillingh@uvt.nl,,,,,,,42,11,12,0,20,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",1051-1377,1096-0791,,J HOUS ECON,J.

Specifically, we explore the link between regime type and adoption of unconditional transfers versus transfers conditioned on beneficiaries' investments in human capital. Due to the direct nature of benefits, unconditional transfers are more likely to be used to buy off opposition and prevent social unrest. As transfers that are conditioned on education and health pay off only in a relatively distant future, they are rarely initiated for political motives and rather defined by interests of long-term development and human capital accumulation. Using the new dataset on Non Contributory Social Transfer Programs (NSTP) in developing countries, we find that transfers are indeed chosen so as to be unconditional under less democratic regimes. There is some evidence that conditional transfers are more likely to be adopted in democracies. In particular, democracies tend to increase the number of conditional schemes once any social transfer program is introduced.","[Dodlova, Marina] Univ Passau, GIGA German Inst Global & Area Studies, Innstr 29, D-94032 Passau, Germany; [Dodlova, Marina] CESifo Res Network, Innstr 29, D-94032 Passau, Germany; [Giolbas, Anna; Lay, Jann] Univ Goettingen, Neuer Jungfernstieg 21, D-20354 Hamburg, Germany; [Giolbas, Anna; Lay, Jann] GIGA German Inst Global & Area Studies, Neuer Jungfernstieg 21, D-20354 Hamburg, Germany",German Institute of Global & Area Studies; University of Passau; Ifo Institut; German Institute of Global & Area Studies,"Dodlova, M (通讯作者)，Univ Passau, GIGA German Inst Global & Area Studies, Innstr 29, D-94032 Passau, Germany.;Dodlova, M (通讯作者)，CESifo Res Network, Innstr 29, D-94032 Passau, Germany.",mdodlova@gmail.com; anna.giolbas@giga-hamburg.de; jann.lay@giga-hamburg.de,"Lay, Jann/AAP-7896-2020","Lay, Jann/0000-0002-0784-3807; Dodlova, Marina/0000-0002-7158-3093","European Union under the 7th Research Framework Programme (NOPOOR project) [SSH.2011.1, 290752]; UNU-WIDER under the project on The Economics and Politics of Taxation and Social Protection; A*MIDEX under the project on Social, Demographic, Economic and Democratic Transitions in MENA","European Union under the 7th Research Framework Programme (NOPOOR project)(European Union (EU)); UNU-WIDER under the project on The Economics and Politics of Taxation and Social Protection; A*MIDEX under the project on Social, Demographic, Economic and Democratic Transitions in MENA(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR))","This paper is a part of a research project entitled Enhancing Knowledge for Renewed Policies against Poverty funded by the European Union under the 7th Research Framework Programme (NOPOOR project, Theme SSH.2011.1, Grant Agreement No. 290752).

Through this, rather ideal combination employment can be enhanced, communities can be uplifted through education, and growth can be increased through discretionary purchasing power. This cycle has positive spinoffs which can alleviate poverty and decrease famine. Recent local research suggests that more than eighty percent of entrepreneurs, start-ups and Business 'Incubatees' don't make it through their first year of establishment after leaving a Business Incubator programme. This paper tries to identify some of the marketing challenges faced by Business Incubators, and indeed BIMs in the Public Sector environment in South Africa. Identification and highlighting the possible drawbacks for 'incubatees' may assist them with success or meeting competitive challenges when they depart from the security of the relevant programmes. This study examines some of the skills, knowledge and attributes required for BIMs in this sector and what is required to meet the business and marketing challenges faced to remain sustainable. The survey was aimed at the largest, focused segment of South African Business Incubators affiliated to the industrial public sector and the hypothesis was to prove that strategic marketing information, acumen and knowledge is a key differentiator towards the growth and sustainability of Business Incubators in that sector. It is notable that these marketing challenges may also compare favourably with several other public sector segments in relevant countries of the southern African region as similar macroeconomic challenges are faced.","[Donaldson, Walter James] Univ Amer, Fac Business Management, Temecula, CA 92590 USA; [Pauceanu, Alexandrina Maria] Higher Coll Technol, UAE Fac Business Div, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates",Higher Colleges of Technology - United Arab Emirates,"Donaldson, WJ (通讯作者)，Univ Amer, Fac Business Management, Temecula, CA 92590 USA.",walterdonaldson@gmail.com; apauceanu@hct.ac.ae,"Pauceanu, Alexandrina Maria/AAB-1349-2019; Pauceanu, Alexandrina Maria/ABC-8299-2021","Pauceanu, Alexandrina Maria/0000-0001-7412-4813",,,,,34,1,2,1,24,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

In a simple model of individual religious behavior, this paper shows that if a religion denies the benefits of membership to those who fall short of the threshold, it stands to gain an increase in compliance with its rules by forcing members to the edge of defection, hence the incentive to set the thresholds strategically. When members' compliance costs are private information, the model yields several regimes: a pooling contract if costs are close enough to each other, a separating contract if costs are different enough, and an expulsion solution if the proportion of high-cost types in the total membership is too low. Changes in costs and in membership composition trigger changes in thresholds and switches between regimes, thus providing a model of religious governance and evolution. We then review the history of sectarianism in the three monotheistic religions and show that the model can help account for the basic differences between them as well as explain the historical evolution of dogmas and behavioral rules within each of them.

This number is the same as the number of assets. Our nonlinear shrinkage estimator is asymptotically optimal for portfolio selection when the number of assets is of the same magnitude as the sample size.

I exploit a period after a far-reaching institutional reform that entirely re-distributed political powers on both the government level and the fiscal supervisor level. The results do not show that party alignments of governments and supervisors (co-partisanship) drive short-term deficits. Instead, I find that the ideology of partisan governments and supervisors matters: left-wing local governments run higher deficits than their right-wing counterparts; left-wing supervisors tolerate higher deficits than right-wing supervisors.

To that end we build up a model for testing whether depositors do discipline banks considering different degrees and measures of bank risk and changes in the features of deposit insurance schemes (DISs). To test our hypotheses, we gathered a sample of banks located in 22 OECD countries covering the period from 2005 to 2014. We found the presence of depositor discipline and also depositors' moral hazard behaviours. The results suggest that depositor discipline worked differently through the periods analysed according to the relevant changes in the economic conditions. Moreover, the specific features of DISs did not influence depositor discipline before and during the crisis; conversely they have proven to be positively evaluated by depositors in the post-crisis period.

China, for instance, managed to enter low value added phases in GVCs to rapidly become a major player in world trade. Against this background, this paper asks whether North Africa, given its favourable geographic position in the Mediterranean and proximity to Europe, can grab similar opportunities. In particular, it analyzes the GVCs participation of North African firms and its implications for productivity. Since the coordination of vertically fragmented production processes increasingly relies on an adequate level of quality and reliability, especially when the inputs from several stages and locations must come together in a specific way, we identify firms involved in GVCs as traders with internationally recognized quality certification. Using a propensity score matching diff-in-diff method, the paper finds that firms that enter GVCs both perform better ex ante and show additional productivity gains ex post. Results suggest that policies designed to support certifications and compliance with international standards and to increase trust between firms in different countries, represent an important tool for linking developing countries to global production networks, with possible positive consequences on their economic development and growth.","[Del Prete, Davide] IMT Lucca, Rome, Italy; [Del Prete, Davide] FAO, Rome, Italy; [Giovannetti, Giorgia] Univ Firenze, Florence, Italy; [Giovannetti, Giorgia] EUI, Florence, Italy; [Marvasi, Enrico] Politecn Milan, Milan, Italy",IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca; Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); University of Florence; European University Institute; Polytechnic University of Milan,"Giovannetti, G (通讯作者)，Univ Firenze, Florence, Italy.;Giovannetti, G (通讯作者)，EUI, Florence, Italy.",giorgia.giovannetti@unifi.it,"Marvasi, Enrico/AAJ-5521-2020; Marvasi, Enrico/P-6733-2019; Marvasi, Enrico/GSM-8939-2022","Marvasi, Enrico/0000-0003-2411-8030; giovannetti, giorgia/0000-0001-6322-2696; Del Prete, Davide/0000-0001-7847-2890",,,,,44,49,50,3,59,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Although the Netherlands has already invested heavily in recycling policies, this is still a big challenge as nowadays this rate is approximately 50 % on average and very few no municipalities have a rate above 65 %. Given this practice, it is possible to learn from the Dutch experience which policies are effective in increasing recycling rates. Based on a large panel data set for the Netherlands, we show that unit-based pricing, avoiding a duo-bin for unsorted and compostable waste, and reducing the frequency of collecting unsorted and compostable waste at the curbside are effective in raising the recycling rate. However, only a bag-based pricing system has a substantial effect, but this policy can have some adverse effects. Other unit-based pricing systems have effects of less than 10 % points. In nearly all cases, changing the frequency of collection of recyclables has no or very small effects. Moreover, the complementarity between unit-based pricing and curbside service is low. Overall, it seems very difficult to reach the EU goal of 65 % with the policies applied.","[Dijkgraaf, Elbert] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Dijkgraaf, Elbert] Erasmus Univ, Tinbergen Inst, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Gradus, Raymond] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Tinbergen Institute; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Dijkgraaf, E (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands.;Dijkgraaf, E (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Tinbergen Inst, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",dijkgraaf@ese.eur.nl,"GRADUS, RAYMOND/HLW-0327-2023","GRADUS, RAYMOND/0000-0002-4519-4633; Dijkgraaf, Elbert/0000-0003-3568-1558",,,,,28,25,26,5,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Although accumulating net foreign assets appears reasonable against the background of population ageing, one of the criticisms that has been voiced repeatedly in this regard is that Germany's savings are being squandered abroad. In order to disentangle the dynamics of the German investment income balance, we apply a novel decomposition framework to a rich German dataset spanning 11 different asset classes between 1999 and 2014. First, we show that Germany gained a yield privilege in this time period and that it would not have been more profitable to invest German savings in domestic assets. Second, the accumulation of net foreign assets accounted for 60% of the rise in the investment income balance. Third, the global decline in interest rates in the aftermath of the global financial crisis led to an appreciable dent in net investment income receipts, which leaves scope for a risk sharing interpretation.","[Knetsch, Thomas A.; Nagengast, Arne J.] Deutsch Bundesbank, Wilhelm Epstein Str 14, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany",Deutsche Bank,"Nagengast, AJ (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bundesbank, Wilhelm Epstein Str 14, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany.",arne.nagengast@bundesbank.de,,"Nagengast, Arne/0000-0002-9479-5371",,,,,43,2,2,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Based on a theoretical model of land acquisition by a heterogeneous farming population, different hypotheses are developed and empirically tested. Farm households involved in forest land appropriation differ from those involved in land market purchases in terms of migration status and other socioeconomic characteristics. In principle, these differences provide opportunities for market-induced deforestation. However, the appropriated forest land is not extensively traded, which we attribute to the lack of de jure property right protection and the resulting undervaluation in the market. While the de facto property right protection under customary law provides sufficient security within the village community, the sense of external tenure security is low when the land cannot be formally titled. Clearing forests for trading in the land market is, therefore, financially less lucrative for farm households than engaging in own cultivation of plantation crops, such as oil palm and rubber. We conclude that land markets did not have significant effects on deforestation. On the other hand, the emergence of land markets alone has also not been able to deter forest appropriation by local farm households. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

The model predicts that firms from a larger country are more likely to acquire in a smaller country when M&A activity is driven by a technology-seeking motive, but the opposite is true when it is driven by a market-seeking motive. Using detailed data on worldwide M&A activity from 1985 to 2007, I find empirical evidence that cross-border M&A activity exhibits behavior consistent with this prediction. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

As a result, an investment strategy that involves investing in the former and short selling of the latter produces positive and sizable excess returns.

The aim of this paper is to explore the relationship between job informality and accessibility to employment by public transport in Sao Paulo Metropolitan Region (SPMR), Brazil. To do so, we calculate a cumulative-opportunity measure of accessibility to jobs for 633 areas within the SPMR. We use a multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression model to estimate the effect of job accessibility on the likelihood of being informally employed, controlling for individual and other area characteristics. To account for informal sector heterogeneity, two regression models are generated: one for the workers earning below minimum wage and one for the workers earning above minimum wage. The results show that accessibility to jobs is unevenly distributed across the region, largely concentrated in the core of the region, and especially in the high-income areas. The regression results show that for workers earning less than the minimum wage, a higher level of accessibility to jobs by public transport is associated with a lower likelihood of being a worker in the informal job sector. For informal workers earning more than the minimum wage, car ownership seem to be more relevant than transit accessibility in determining the likelihood of being part of the informal job sector. In light of these findings, increasing accessibility by public transport through either expanding transit services to areas with high informality rates to have a better access to formal jobs or supporting the decentralization of formal jobs may be a way to achieve reductions in informality rates, especially among those earning less than the minimum wage.","[Boisjoly, Genevieve; El-Geneidy, Ahmed] Sch Urban Planning, Suite 400,815 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada; [Moreno-Monroy, Ana Isabel] OECD, Reg Dev Policy Unit, Paris, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"El-Geneidy, A (通讯作者)，Sch Urban Planning, Suite 400,815 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada.",genevieve.boisjoly@mail.mcgill.ca; ana.morenomonroy@oecd.org; ahmed.elgeneidy@mcgill.ca,"El-Geneidy, Ahmed/N-3904-2013","El-Geneidy, Ahmed/0000-0002-0942-4016; Moreno Monroy, Ana Isabel/0000-0002-8282-4067; Boisjoly, Genevieve/0000-0001-5375-7750",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Fonds de Recherche du Quebec-Nature et Technologies (FRQNT); 7th European Community Framework Programme [PEIF-GA-2013-627114],Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Fonds de Recherche du Quebec-Nature et Technologies (FRQNT); 7th European Community Framework Programme(European Union (EU)),We would like to thank Guillaume Barreau for modeling the transit trips and providing the travel time matrix used in the accessibility measures.

We are the first to examine the association of venture capital funding with a company's choice of innovation strategies. We employ a unique data set of over 10,000 innovative Dutch companies, some of which received venture financing. The data include detailed information on patent applications, innovation activities, and other company characteristics. We find that companies backed by venture capital focus on the buildup of absorptive capacity by engaging in both in-house R&D and in the acquisition of external knowledge. Companies that receive public funding, instead, are able to relax their financing constraints and perform more innovation activities without focusing solely on absorptive capacity. Our results also suggest that the correlation between venture capital funding and the build-up of absorptive capacity is not only due to a selection effect.

This indicator is more comprehensive than the measures of air pollutant emissions commonly used in the literature and, in particular, can also capture the impact of pollution on human health. This allows for a better understanding of the actual effects of a wide range of human activities on the ecosystem. From a panel data analysis, two regularities emerge. First, corruption deteriorates the overall environmental quality. This effect is robust and persistent. Second, our findings highlight the improvement of environmental quality as income rises, even at an initial level of development. This is not in contradiction with the EKC hypothesis because an increase in income levels provides positive externalities on the whole environmental quality by compensating the mere negative effects induced by industrialization on the emission levels. As a consequence, in emerging economies, policies fighting corruption and enhancing development are very likely to improve the environmental performances.","[Lisciandra, Maurizio; Migliardo, Carlo] Univ Messina, Dept Econ, Piazza Pugliatti 1, I-98122 Messina, Italy",University of Messina,"Lisciandra, M (通讯作者)，Univ Messina, Dept Econ, Piazza Pugliatti 1, I-98122 Messina, Italy.",mlisciandra@unime.it; cmigliardo@unime.it,"Lisciandra, Maurizio/J-4444-2016; MIGLIARDO, CARLO/K-7601-2019","Lisciandra, Maurizio/0000-0002-9020-7106; MIGLIARDO, CARLO/0000-0002-4055-0782",,,,,52,58,59,1,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Some are due to the impacts of economic growth within areas of new discriminatory preferential access, while others are produced by the long-term implications of mega-regional trade agreements on global trade governance. These challenges are likely to increase as more mega-regional trade agreements with large economic size, regulatory ambition and geo-strategic significance are negotiated and signed. The implications of these challenges are significant for developing countries outside the mega-regional trade agreements, particularly the least-developed countries. This paper examines some of the major challenges from mega-regional trade agreements for non-participating developing countries, with attention to the drivers of these agreements, their economic impacts, the difficulties encountered by the World Trade Organization following emergence of mega-regional trade agreements, and possible strategic responses to these trade agreements. Underlining the differential impacts of mega-regional trade agreements on non-participating developing countries, the paper concludes that larger economies like China and India are likely to be less affected due to their economic size and strategic influence, compared with the least developed countries.","[Palit, Amitendu] Natl Univ Singapore, Inst South Asian Studies, Singapore, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Palit, A (通讯作者)，Inst South Asian Studies, 29 Heng Mui Keng Terrace,08-06 Block B, Singapore 119620, Singapore.",amitendu@gmail.com,"Palit, Amitendu/Q-9149-2019",,Baldy Center; Nila T.

Additionally, we discuss the robustness of the corrected result to different specifications of the contest success function, and we partially restore Morgan's case for sequential contests by showing that these contests are more desirable when maximizing only the effort of the winner, rather than maximizing the aggregate effort.","[Serena, Marco] Max Planck Inst Tax Law & Publ Finance, Munich, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Serena, M (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Tax Law & Publ Finance, Munich, Germany.",marco.serena@tax.mpg.de,,"SERENA, MARCO/0000-0002-6215-9629",,,,,6,7,9,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,OCT,2017,173.0,1-2,,,,,131,144,,10.1007/s11127-017-0467-3,0.0,,,14,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,FJ8CH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412988600007,0

More specifically, drawing upon a sample of 143 Greek ventures less than 8 years old, it examines empirically the individual and interactive effects of functional and numerical flexibility on product innovation. It also considers how these effects are moderated by the entrepreneur's political skill. Results suggest that functional flexibility has a positive direct effect on incremental innovation, whereas numerical flexibility has a positive direct effect on radical innovation. The interactions between numerical and functional flexibility affect both types of innovation. The results also suggest that the labor flexibility-innovation relationship is positively moderated by the entrepreneur's political skill. These findings point toward aspects of knowledge related with flexible labor engagement and entrepreneurial relational capital that affect innovation.","[Voudouris, Irini] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Management Sci & Technol, Patiss 76, Athens, Greece; [Deligianni, Ioanna; Lioukas, Spyros] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Patiss 76, Athens, Greece",Athens University of Economics & Business; Athens University of Economics & Business,"Voudouris, I (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Management Sci & Technol, Patiss 76, Athens, Greece.",ivoudour@aueb.gr; idelig@aueb.gr; scl@aueb.gr,"Voudouris, Irini/AAC-3441-2021; Deligianni, Ioanna/AGG-1895-2022",,,,,,80,10,10,2,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

In the first stage, we use meta-frontier technology to address bank heterogeneity-bank nature (Islamic vs. conventional banks) and bank ownership (local vs. foreign banks). Using a data set of 43 Malaysian commercial banks, the application of meta-frontier enables us to compare the existence of inefficiency among Malaysian banks because of their business nature and ownership. In doing so, we empirically demonstrate that using different approaches (i.e., production, profitability, and intermediation) for calculating bank efficiency can give significant contradictory results in efficiency scores. In the second stage, we use Simar and Wilson's double bootstrap regression to estimate the determinants of efficiency in Malaysian banks. This helps to achieve valid inference even in the presence of unknown serial correlation in the meta-frontier efficiency scores. The results from double bootstrap regression confirm that bank ownership, bank nature and gross domestic product have significant influence on bank efficiency. This study reveals that Islamic banks have outperformed. The frontier results reveal that local Islamic banks have moved towards the group technology and foreign Islamic banks have taken the lead in country frontier technology.","[Azad, Abul Kalam; Munisamy, Susila] Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Appl Stat, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Muhammad Masum, Abdul Kadar] Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Adm Studies & Polit, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Saona, Paolo] St Louis Univ, Dept Econ & Business, Avda Valle 34, Madrid 28003, Spain; [Wanke, Peter] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, COPPEAD Grad Business Sch, Rua Paschoal Lemme 355, BR-21949900 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Universiti Malaya; Universiti Malaya; Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,"Munisamy, S (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Appl Stat, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",azadiiuc@gmail.com; susila@um.edu.my; akmmasum@yahoo.com; psaonaho@slu.edu; peter@coppead.ufrj.br,"Saona, Paolo/ABE-3912-2020; Azad, Md.

The mechanism is rooted in scientific studies from various disciplines. For our evidence, we propose and estimate a dynamic model of tie formation using different experimental data sets regarding public goods, test its within-sample and out-of-sample predictive performance, and compare it with other models. In addition to the support obtained for the mechanism, we find that the effects of interaction experiences show substantial persistence over time, and that only a minority looks ahead to strategically influence the behavior of interaction partners. Furthermore, our model appears to track the often volatile behavioral dynamics of the different datasets remarkably well. Additional evidence is presented of a neural substrate of the tie mechanism, based on a recent (fMRI) application of the estimated model, and of the explanatory power of our model regarding other extant experimental findings. Implications for private and public governance and topics for future research are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Our theory of change builds on established conceptual models of impact pathways and highlights the role of (1) contextual dimensions (e.g., political, institutional, and socio-economic conditions, spatial heterogeneity in environmental service values and provision costs, and interactions with pre-existing policies), and (2) scheme design (e.g., payment type and level, contract length, targeting, and differentiation of payments) in determining environmental and socio-economic outcomes. To shed light on the overall effectiveness of payment schemes, and its determinants, we review counterfactual-based empirical evaluations, comparative analyses of case-studies, and meta-analyses. Our review suggests that program effectiveness often lags behind the expectations of early theorists. However, we also find that theory has advanced sufficiently to identify common reasons for why payment schemes fail or succeed. Moreover, payment schemes are often rolled out along with other policy instruments in so-called policy mixes. Advances in theory and evaluation research are needed to improve our understanding of how such policy mixes interact with the targeted social-ecological systems.

It finds evidence of structural instability in the long-run trade equations but little evidence it is coincident with the global recession. It also uncovers a distinct pattern in the income elasticity of business services trade: a large long-run value but a significantly smaller short-run value. Combined with its large weight in total US services trade, the limited short-run demand response of business services trade dampened the effect of the economic downturn on aggregate services trade. Far from being an anomaly, the response of US services trade to the 2008-2009 global recession was consistent with its time-series and compositional characteristics.","[Ceglowski, Janet] Bryn Mawr Coll, Dept Econ, 101 N Merion Ave, Bryn Mawr, PA 19010 USA",Bryn Mawr College,"Ceglowski, J (通讯作者)，Bryn Mawr Coll, Dept Econ, 101 N Merion Ave, Bryn Mawr, PA 19010 USA.",jceglows@brynmawr.edu,,,,,,,17,2,2,3,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

The main objective of these programs is to increase local investment and employment, as tourism activities are labor intensive. Little evidence is available, however, to assess the effect of these policies on job creation in emerging markets. In this paper, we analyze a program of fiscal incentives introduced by the Brazilian federal government in the SUDENE area in 2002 and in which tourism firms were eligible to participate. Through a difference-in-difference estimation, we compare the change in the logarithm of local employment in the SUDENE municipalities before and after 2002 to the change in the same outcome in a group of municipalities that were not affected by the program. Although our empirical analysis does not measure the efficiency of a similar fiscal policy, it is the first one in the literature to show its effectiveness. It provides evidence that the fiscal incentives led to a substantial increase in tourism employment in the SUDENE area. We find that, over the period 2002-09, municipal tourism employment was on average 30% higher than in the absence of the intervention. This result is robust and is not the consequence of either displacement effects or job destruction in neighboring municipalities that had not been targeted by the tax incentives. We finally discuss some limitations of our analysis that might open avenues for future research in the field. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We model interactions between two neighboring towns, and explore welfare implications of spatial-dynamic feedbacks in the coastal zone. When communities are adjacent, the community with a wider beach loses sand to the community with a narrower beach through alongshore sediment transport. Spatial-dynamic feedbacks create incentives for both communities to nourish less, resulting in lower long-run beach width and lower property values in both communities, a result that parallels the classic prisoner's dilemma. Intensifying erosion-consistent with accelerating sea level rise-increases the losses from failure to coordinate. Higher erosion also increases inequality in the distribution of benefits across communities under spatially coordinated management. This disincentive to coordinate suggests the need for higher-level government intervention to address a traditionally local problem. We show that a spatially targeted subsidy can achieve the first best outcome, and explore conditions under which a second-best uniform subsidy leads to small or large losses.","[Gopalakrishnan, Sathya] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, 2120 Fyffe Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [McNamara, Dylan] UNC Wilmington, Dept Phys & Phys Oceanog, Ctr Marine Sci, Wilmington, NC USA; [Smith, Martin D.; Murray, A.

The foundation for this issue is the clash and articulation of different kinds of land ownership structures and rights. Under the traditional social or communal ownership system, land belongs to the clans and is distributed among families following tradition-based user rights. The land ownership structures of a capitalist mode of production are only slowly breaking into this system. The analysis is based on institutional analysis including a calculated estimation of the transaction costs for telecom operators seeking to establish contracts for land rental and for enforcing contracts. Quantitative as well as qualitative empirical evidence is analyzed. The paper concludes that the land ownership system in Ghana creates problems for the telecom and tower companies. The communal lands constitute the dominant land ownership system. When this system encounters a private ownership system, a number of land ownership cases are produced, which costs money for the telecom companies. The total transaction costs relating to ownership problems connected with mobile towers are calculated to be between GHC 6.9 and 13.9 million in 2015. In the Ghana context, though this may not be a very large sum, such problems may hold or delay the expansion of the telecom infrastructure especially in rural areas. Uncertainty is an important factor when making investment decisions.","[Osei-Owusu, Alexander; Henten, Anders] Aalborg Univ, Ctr Commun Media & Informat Technol CMI, Copenhagen, Denmark",Aalborg University,"Osei-Owusu, A (通讯作者)，Aalborg Univ, Ctr Commun Media & Informat Technol CMI, Copenhagen, Denmark.",ao@es.aau.dk,,"Hansen Henten, Anders/0000-0003-1126-8398",,,,,26,4,4,0,4,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1309-4297,2147-4281,,EURASIAN BUS REV,Eurasian Bus.

Although there was a wide consensus among economists and policymakers that this was key to solving Spain's economic troubles, both bank CDS and sovereign CDS further increased in the days following the announcement while lower bank CDS spreads were expected. Higher sovereign debt discounts deteriorated the fiscal position of the Spanish government. We propose a mechanism that can explain the events in Spain, namely the interaction whereby weak banks that are heavily exposed to risky domestic sovereign debt and weak government finances set off a negative amplification cycle: additional debt issue leads to higher sovereign debt discounts, resulting in capital losses on existing sovereign debt, deteriorating the capital base of banks, additional rounds of interest rate increases, a perverse amplification cycle substantially offsetting the initial recapitalization. We construct a DSGE model with balance-sheet-constrained financial intermediaries that finance private loans to the real economy, as well as sovereign debt subject to sovereign default risk. We calibrate the model to Spanish data, and find that our model is capable of matching the developments in the sovereign bond market in Spain in May/June 2012 quite well. We investigate an alternative policy, direct recapitalization by a foreign entity, such as the ESM, which avoids the negative sovereign risk amplification cycle.","[van der Kwaak, Christiaan; van Wijnbergen, Sweder] Univ Amsterdam, Tinbergen Inst, Roetersstr 11, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute,"van Wijnbergen, S (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Tinbergen Inst, Roetersstr 11, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",s.j.g.vanwijnbergen@uva.nl,,,Dutch Organization for Sciences through NWO [406-13-063],Dutch Organization for Sciences through NWO,"We acknowledge the generous support of the Dutch Organization for Sciences, through the NWO Research Talent Grant No. 406-13-063.

At the same time, cooperation brings along the risk of betrayal. To mitigate this risk, people may form expectations regarding another person's trustworthiness based on previous encounters. However, if strangers are encountered, decision makers have to rely on their intuitions to predict others' intentions and behavior. Previous research has shown that the positive affect triggered by the mere ease of processing some stimulus (fluency) is often used as information in intuitive judgments. In the current set of studies, we assign names to trustees in economic trust games and observe the amount of resources invested in the cooperation as a behavioral measure of trust. We show that trustees carrying either real surnames (Experiment 1) or artificially created names (Experiment 2) which are fluent were trusted more.

An empirical investigation with Yelp,JOURNAL OF URBAN ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Real estate market; Hedonic analysis; Local amenity capitalization; Consumption amenities; Information value,PROPERTY-VALUES; HEDONIC PRICES; DEMAND; CRIME; MARKET; CITY,"The possibility that local consumption amenities provided by bars, restaurants, and other retail services improve neighborhood or city attractiveness has received increasing attention in the literature. Empirical research thus far has focused on the number of establishments in an area. This paper proposes and tests a method for differentiating consumption amenities along a quality dimension, based on either consumer ratings or price estimates from Yelp.com. Appealing to the implicit market model of Rosen (1974), consumption amenity is capitalized in the value of nearby housing. The results demonstrate that both the quantity and quality aspects of consumption amenities matter, and that consumer ratings are more informative about unobservable restaurant amenity than price estimates. Furthermore, comparisons between the results for the pre- and post-Yelp periods show that such capitalization differentials are more significant when information on quality is readily available to and widely used by the public. The method used in this paper to measure the quality of consumption amenities could be applied to other private retail businesses or even local public goods.

We disaggregate FDI into two distinct varieties: mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and venture capital (VC). We propose that VC flows are less sensitive to host institutions but correlate strongly with skilled migrant networks that monitor compliance and impose reputational costs. Our empirical analysis of dyadic VC and M&A flows covers over 100 countries during 1980-2009. We address other mechanisms through which migrant networks facilitate FDI and verify our results hold at the country-industry level.

The downside of decentralization is that it enables these same local authorities to slow or block implementation of centrally mandated governance reforms, especially when these may negatively affect local development goals. We suggest that China's fiscal system and promotion system have created mismatched incentives that encourage cash-strapped local authorities to disregard central governance reforms. Specifically, we show that cities with weaker revenue bases were slower to implement new, centrally mandated environmental transparency regulations. Additional evidence points to a bifurcation in development strategies. In fiscally strong cities, increased foreign investment leads to greater compliance. In fiscally weak cities, foreign investment is associated with decreased disclosure, suggesting they aim to promote local development by becoming pollution havens. Similarly, high levels of pollution induce fiscally strong cities to increase pollution disclosures while the opposite holds in fiscally weak cities. These findings imply that mismatched decentralization policies can undermine other important governance reforms, even ones that might be expected to be complementary to decentralizing initiatives.

We formulate two models: ex-post privatization and ex-ante privatization. In the former, the government liberalizes the market and then privatizes the public firm, whereas the order of the policies is reversed in the latter. We find that ex-ante privatization yields a higher (lower) level of privatization and a larger (smaller) equilibrium number of entering private firms when foreign ownership in private firms is high (low). We also show that the optimal level of privatization is increasing (decreasing) in the share of foreign ownership in the ex-ante (ex-post)privatization case. Finally, we find that although both the ex-ante and the ex-post privatization cases yield the same consumer welfare, ex-ante privatization always yields higher social welfare than ex-post privatization.","[Xu, Lili] Dalian Maritime Univ, Econ & Trade Dept, Dalian, Peoples R China; [Lee, Sang-Ho] Chonnam Natl Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Gwangju, South Korea; [Matsumura, Toshihiro] Univ Tokyo, Inst Social Sci, Tokyo, Japan",Dalian Maritime University; Chonnam National University; University of Tokyo,"Lee, SH (通讯作者)，Chonnam Natl Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Gwangju, South Korea.",lilixu@chonnam.ac.kr; sangho@jnu.ac.kr; matsumur@iss.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Matsumura, Toshihiro/F-3997-2010; Xu, Lili/AAY-4923-2021; Lee, Sang-Ho/E-7848-2017","Matsumura, Toshihiro/0000-0003-0572-6516; Xu, Lili/0000-0001-9660-3145; Lee, Sang-Ho/0000-0002-0283-5998",National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government [NRF-2014S1A2A2028188]; JSPS KAKENHI [15k03347]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K03347] Funding Source: KAKEN,"National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government; JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",We thank to two anonymous referees for their careful and constructive comments on an earlier version of this paper.

Anticipating this, people who have a say in the selection of the leader are likely to resort to alternative strategies to limit his tenure. In this paper, we examine empirically the strategic gerontocracy hypothesis: Because selecting aging leaders is a convenient way of reducing their expected time in office, gerontocracy will become a likely outcome whenever leaders are expected to rule for life. We test this hypothesis using data on political leaders for the period from 1960 to 2008, and find that dictators have shorter life expectancies than democrats at the time they take office. We also observe variations in the life expectancies of dictators: those who are selected by consent are on average closer to death than those who seize power in an irregular manner. This finding suggests that gerontocracy is a consequence of the choice process, since it disappears when dictators self-select into leadership positions.","[Berton, Raul Magni] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Sci Po Grenoble, PACTE, 1030 Ave Cent, F-38400 St Martin Dheres, France; [Panel, Sophie] Ctr Emile Durkheim, Sci Po Grenoble, 11 Allee Ausone, F-33600 Pessac, France",Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Berton, RM (通讯作者)，Univ Grenoble Alpes, Sci Po Grenoble, PACTE, 1030 Ave Cent, F-38400 St Martin Dheres, France.",raul.magniberton@iepg.fr; sophie.panel@scpobx.fr,,,,,,,61,4,6,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUN,2017,171.0,3-4,,,,,409,427,,10.1007/s11127-017-0449-5,0.0,,,19,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,ET4FQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000400235100009,0

The use of recursive preferences gives a convenient decomposition of saving into precautionary and nonprecautionary components. Over 80% of China's saving rate and nearly all U.S. saving arises from the precautionary motive. The difference between U.S. and Chinese household income growth rates is vastly more important than income risk for explaining the saving rates. The key mechanism is that precautionary savers have target wealth-to-income ratios, and rapid income growth necessitates high saving rates to maintain the ratio.","[Choi, Horag] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Lugauer, Steven] Univ Kentucky, Gatton Sch Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Mark, Nelson C.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Econ, Int Econ, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Mark, Nelson C.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Monash University; University of Kentucky; University of Notre Dame; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Choi, H (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic, Australia.",horag.choi@monash.edu; steven.lugauer@uky.edu; nmark@nd.edu,,"Choi, Horag/0000-0002-8250-539X; Mark, Nelson/0000-0001-5446-5119","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,55,24,26,3,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

The state of Gujarat in Western India has planted thousands of hectares of mangroves over the coastal mudflats and, today, the state's mangrove cover is nearly double that in the 1930s. However, these mangroves have limiting features: for example, these are mostly single-species, Avicenna marina, and are sparse, and lack freshwater supply. Mangroves provide multiple ecosystem services including nursery and habitat services for fish fry that enhances fish growth. This study evaluates the regenerated forests' contribution to the fishery sector of Gujarat, both inshore, and offshore, using the difference-in-differences technique, and panel regression estimates. Commercial catch data from secondary sources and primary survey diary on the daily catch of artisanal fishermen are used in the analysis. The results show that the planted mangroves have significantly increased the catch of mangrove-dependent fish in both sectors, and that young planted strands contribute nearly one-fourth of the contribution of natural strands. Despite the limiting features, the contribution of the planted mangroves' nursery ground and habitat service to the fishery sector of Gujarat state is valued at INR36.04 billion (USD0.57 billion) annually.

During national team matches, prices on local stockmarkets can temporarily decouple from global financial market developments.

While our main finding is in favor of a liberal trade policy environment, we argue input and output tariffs should be treated separately in examining their impact on productivity. Ceteris paribus, lowering input tariffs potentially has at least two opposite effects. It allows firms to benefit in several ways, enhancing their productivity, while also discouraging their efforts to improve productivity due to the increased level of effective protection. This necessitates caution when pursuing trade policy reform in not placing too much focus on input tariffs while leaving output tariffs untouched. Even though input and output tariffs work differently in promoting firms' productivity, any trade policy reform process should take both input and output tariffs into consideration in ensuring that trade is actually liberalized.","[Jongwanich, Juthathip; Kohpaiboon, Archanun] Thammasat Univ, Fac Econ, 2 Prachan Rd, Bangkok 10200, Thailand",Thammasat University,"Jongwanich, J (通讯作者)，Thammasat Univ, Fac Econ, 2 Prachan Rd, Bangkok 10200, Thailand.",juthathip@econ.tu.ac.th,,,,,,,45,10,10,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,1746-1049,,DEV ECON,Dev.

This paper proposes a Quantile Regression (QR) approach to get a comprehensive view on the entire probability distribution of losses. The method allows new insights on covariate effects over the whole LGD spectrum. In particular, middle quantiles are explainable by observable covariates while tail events, e.g., extremely high LGDs, seem to be rather driven by unobservable random events. A comparison of the QR approach with several alternatives from recent literature reveals advantages when evaluating downturn and unexpected credit losses. In addition, we identify limitations of classical mean prediction comparisons and propose alternative goodness of fit measures for the validation of forecasts for the entire LGD distribution.

The authors use a multi-method, quasi-experimental impact evaluation approach to examine direct and indirect livelihood impacts of the Equitable Payments for Watershed Services (EPWS) program piloted in the Morogoro region in Tanzania. The evaluation is based on a survey of 116 program participants and 117 non-participants, 32 semi-structured interviews and 16 focus group discussions to complement the survey data. They find that, while the EPWS program incentives resulted in direct benefits, indirect benefits such as increased crop yields, higher land values, new employment opportunities, more knowledgeable farmers, improved leadership skills as well as increased trust, expanded internal and external networks and strengthened institutions were more important. The results clearly indicate the potential of PES schemes to generate win-win outcomes in agro-ecosystems, but they also call for attention to equity in the design of PES programs implemented on agro-ecosystems.","[Kwayu, Emmanuel J.] Univ Dar Es Salaam, Dar Es Salaam Univ Coll Educ, Dept Geog & Econ, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Kwayu, Emmanuel J.; Paavola, Jouni; Sallu, Susannah M.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Dar es Salaam; University of Leeds,"Kwayu, EJ (通讯作者)，Univ Dar Es Salaam, Dar Es Salaam Univ Coll Educ, Dept Geog & Econ, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania.;Kwayu, EJ (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",eeejk@leeds.ac.uk; j.paavola@leeds.ac.uk; s.sallu@leeds.ac.uk,"Sallu, Susannah/T-9318-2019; Paavola, Jouni/A-5413-2010","Sallu, Susannah/0000-0002-1471-2485; Paavola, Jouni/0000-0001-5720-466X; Kwayu, Emmanuel J/0000-0003-3713-8399","Government of Tanzania; Dar es Salaam University College of Education (DUCE); School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds","Government of Tanzania; Dar es Salaam University College of Education (DUCE); School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds","The authors thank the University of Dar es Salaam on behalf of the Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology for granting permission to conduct this research.

Most young households who purchase a home do so using a mortgage. But mortgages are complex financial instruments and this complexity may be a barrier to less sophisticated households becoming homeowners. Using survey data from a sample of English and Welsh households we measure household financial literacy related to mortgages, including concepts such as loan duration, interest compounding and amortization. We find that in the population mortgage financial literacy is generally low and among renters mortgage financial literacy is substantially worse than among homeowners. Econometric estimates show mortgage financial literacy predicts home ownership for younger, but not for older households. Financial literacy also affects the type of mortgage and leverage position of younger households. Young homeowners with poorer financial literacy take on larger mortgage debts and are more likely to use alternative mortgage products. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Drawing on special features of the 1985-2013 American Housing Survey (AHS) panel, our most robust models control for recent expenditures on home maintenance, MSA-by-year fixed effects, lagged proxies for wealth and other household attributes. Net of home maintenance, a 20% real increase in home value over a two-year period raises the likelihood of entry into self-employment by roughly 1.5 percentage points; housing capital losses have little effect on exits. Controlling for house fixed effects, self-employed homeowners are also more likely to hold a HELOC, facilitating easy, low-cost access to home equity that could be used to cover business expenses. These and other estimates suggest that links between homeownership and self-employment are strong enough to be important when home prices are rising rapidly, but modest when housing capital gains are limited or negative.

Managers who began their careers during recessions become CEOs more quickly, but at smaller firms. They also have more conservative styles, such as lower investment in capital expenditures and research and development, more cost cutting, and lower leverage and working capital needs. These recession effects appear to be largely driven by the characteristics of the CEO's first job (recession CEOs tend to start in smaller or private firms), which suggests that the early work environment is important to the formation and selection of managers.","[Schoar, Antoinette] MIT Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Schoar, Antoinette] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Schoar, Antoinette] Ideas42, New York, NY 10004 USA; [Zuo, Luo] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research; Cornell University,"Schoar, A (通讯作者)，MIT Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.;Schoar, A (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Schoar, A (通讯作者)，Ideas42, New York, NY 10004 USA.",,,,MIT Sloan School of Management; Cornell University; Deloitte Foundation,MIT Sloan School of Management; Cornell University; Deloitte Foundation,"We appreciate the helpful comments of Francesca Cornelli (editor), three anonymous referees, Joshua Anderson, Philip Berger, Qi Chen, Jess Cornaggia, Sudipto Dasgupta, Mei Feng, Robert Gibbons, Dirk Jenter, Bin Ke, Leonid Kogan, Camelia Kuhnen, Masatoshi Kurusu, Jing Liu, Evgeny Lyandres, Mark Maffett, Randall Morck, Sendhil Mullainathan, Kasper Meisner Nielsen, Dimitris Papanikolaou, Francisco Perez-Gonzalez, Morten Sorensen, T.J.

However, the strong interdependence area is limited for the oil-importing countries.

The empirical context is choices over household waste contracts and recycling actions in Poland. A theoretical model is used to show how cost-based motives and the desire for a positive self and social image combine to determine the utility from alternative choices of recycling behaviour. We then describe a discrete choice experiment designed to empirically investigate the effects such drivers have on stated choices. A hybrid logit model is used to link statements over attitudes to recycling to choices, dealing with a potential endogeneity problem caused by the joint effects of un-observables on attitudes and choices. We find that a substantial share of our respondents prefer to sort their waste at home rather than in a central sorting facility. This preference is associated with a moral/intrinsic motivation, involving a belief that sorting at home is more thorough than central sorting.","[Czajkowski, Mikolaj] Univ Warsaw, Dept Econ, Warsaw, Poland; [Hanley, Nick] Univ St Andrews, Sch Geog & Sustainable Dev, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland; [Nyborg, Karine] Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, Oslo, Norway",University of Warsaw; University of St Andrews; University of Oslo,"Czajkowski, M (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Dept Econ, Warsaw, Poland.",miq@wne.uw.edu.pl; ndh3@st-andrews.ac.uk; karine.nyborg@econ.uio.no,"Czajkowski, Mikołaj/K-2292-2012; Hanley, Nick/C-1759-2012","Czajkowski, Mikołaj/0000-0001-5118-2308; Hanley, Nick/0000-0002-1362-3499; Nyborg, Karine/0000-0002-0359-548X",Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education; Foundation for Polish Science,"Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education(Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Poland); Foundation for Polish Science(Foundation for Polish Science)",The first author gratefully acknowledges the support of the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education and the Foundation for Polish Science.,,51,97,105,3,108,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Periods of rising media fragmentation are followed by increased polarization.

This paper reports the development of a suite of tools to measure and value community severance, undertaken as a part of the Street Mobility and Network Accessibility research project. The tools include participatory mapping, spatial analysis, a video survey, street audits, a health and neighbourhood mobility survey, and a valuation tool based on a stated preference survey. They were tested in the area around Finchley Road, a busy arterial road in North London. The study found that Finchley Road is an unpleasant place for pedestrians due to high traffic levels, air and noise pollution, and the lack and poor quality of pedestrian crossing facilities. This has a negative impact on the mobility and accessibility of local residents and, to some extent, on their health and wellbeing. The analysis showed coherence between the findings from the different measurement tools applied individually, but also revealed interconnections between factors which contribute to severance, demonstrating that overall the suite is reliable for assessing community severance in urban areas. Overall, the paper provides a multidisciplinary approach to developing standardised methods to measure a negative impact of transport that is still relatively unknown. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Using firm-level data across 41 countries for the 1993-2013 period, we document an important role of asset tangibility in explaining the patterns in ICFS. Asset tangibility affects ICFS through two channels: investment intensity and cash flow persistence. As the share of tangible capital, investment and cash flow persistence has fallen in developed economies, ICFS has declined. In contrast, as developing economies operate with more tangible capital, have higher investment rates and more persistent cash flows, their ICFS is more stable. The results support our explanation of ICFS as a reflection of capital (investment) intensity and income predictability, rather than a measure of financial constraints. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We suggest that in order to gain access to power, the FA opted to move to the centre of the political spectrum and implement agrarian policies in which agribusiness and family farming coexist. Another possible interpretation to understanding the absence of a policy more focused on supporting family farming, and on limiting the expansion of the financial capital and transnational corporations, is to see it as resulting from the internal tensions within the coalition. However, the FA, in accordance with its own history, did carry out a policy of protection and promotion of labour and civil rights of rural wage workers.","[Pineiro, Diego E.; Cardeillac, Joaquin] Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias Sociales, Dept Sociol, NESA, Constituyente 1502, Montevideo, Uruguay","Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay","Piñeiro, DE (通讯作者)，Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias Sociales, Dept Sociol, NESA, Constituyente 1502, Montevideo, Uruguay.",diego.pineiro@cienciassociales.edu.uy,"Cardeillac, Joaquin/X-5288-2019","Cardeillac, Joaquin/0000-0002-4564-9212",,,,,46,6,8,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

In contrast, we posit that the sign of the relation varies, depending upon the macroeconomic and financial market conditions that exist in the earnings announcement quarter. We argue that the existing macroeconomic and financial market conditions influence market participants' frame of reference, which in turn affects whether they interpret aggregate earnings surprises to be informative about the expected inflation component of the discount rate, the market risk premium component of the discount rate, or aggregate future cash flows. Consistent with this, we find that the sign of the aggregate earnings-returns relation changes numerous times across our sample period. We also find that market participants interpret aggregate earnings to be informative about changes in expected inflation (market risk premium) when the sign of the aggregate earnings returns relation is negative (positive). Finally, we identify macroeconomic and financial market conditions under which the aggregate earnings-returns relation is more (less) likely to be negative (positive). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This paper sheds new empirical light on their origins. Using a new dataset covering over 250,000 randomly selected potential city locations, and all actual cities during the period 800-1800, we disentangle the different roles of geography in shaping today's European city system. We find that a location's physical geography characteristics are the dominant determinants of its urban chances. Preferential location for water- or land-based transportation is a particularly important city seed. In addition, a location's position relative to already-existing cities matters for its urban chances. Interestingly, it does so in a way corresponding to predictions from economic geography theory.

Using the Labor Force Survey micro-data from 1983 to 2008 we construct worker flows and study the effects of the so-called Lost Decade on unemployment, employment and participation. We perform the analysis both at the aggregate level and disaggregated by age and gender to understand the type of worker that was most affected by the long recession. We also perform counterfactual experiments to study the importance of demographic factors in such changes. We find that the decade-long recession significantly altered the state of the labor market, although not all workers were affected equally. We find that while almost all changes observed in the unemployment rate can be attributed to the recession, part of the evolution of the employment to population ratio and a large extent of the decline in the participation rate can be accounted for by the aging of the population.

We use a local economy-wide impact evaluation (LEWIE) model to analyze how the recent global saffron-price variability affected Morocco's Taliouine-Taznakht region, a specialized agro-export economy with a stark gender division of labor. Prices of saffron increased by 71% per year over the 2007-09 period before falling quickly back to their trend. Our modeling approach allows us to simulate such shocks and evaluate impacts not only on producers but also on the local economies around them. In our simulations, positive price-shocks and increases in productivity both cause large reallocations of labor resources, particularly for female workers at harvest time. We use Monte-Carlo simulations to evaluate how saffron-price variance affects the economy. Female wage, income is especially sensitive to global price variability: a 100% increase in saffron-price variance leads to 133% increase in female wage income variance, but only 36% for males. Accounting for general-equilibrium effects is critical for understanding the ramifications of exposure to export price volatility in poor economies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, we use an evolutionary co-spectral analysis that sets a time varying dynamic correlation measure. Results of our analyses suggest that persistent commodity price shocks exert a greater impact on real economy than transitory fluctuations. Similar patterns can be derived for different types of commodities. During downswings, coherence is high for beverages and agricultural raw materials. In contrast, coherence for metals and oil is high during upswings. Periods of high coherence correspond to periods of financial pressure. As such, they can serve as indicators for impending financial crises. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We argue that the results of the investigation have been advantageous for the large energy companies and they risk failing to bring any significant and positive change to the energy industry. We highlight three major aspects of the Competition and Markets Authority's assessment. First, the panel examined retail and wholesale segments of the energy industry in isolation, which can be misleading in the assessment of vertical integration. It also considered new entries to the sector as a sign of competitive strength when many were due to favourable government policies in the form of exemptions from various obligations. Second, its conclusion that a position of unilateral market power by the large energy companies arises from weak customer engagement (i.e. low switching rates) shifts the focus and responsibility for the problems of the energy markets away from the conduct of the companies onto customers. Finally, the investigation placed an overemphasis on competition without due reference to its consequences for consumers' welfare.","[Amountzias, Chrysovalantis; Dagdeviren, Hulya; Patokos, Tassos] Univ Hertfordshire, Hatfield AL10 9EU, Herts, England",University of Hertfordshire,"Dagdeviren, H (通讯作者)，Univ Hertfordshire, Hatfield AL10 9EU, Herts, England.",h.dagdeviren@herts.ac.uk,"Dagdeviren, Hulya/C-1679-2016","Dagdeviren, Hulya/0000-0002-4606-2042; Amountzias, Chrysovalantis/0000-0002-7013-7032",,,,,26,2,2,2,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1024-5294,1477-2221,,COMPET CHANG,Compet.

Managers engage in strategic timing: poor monthly returns are reported with delay, sometimes clustered with stronger subsequent performance, suggestive of performance smoothing. We posit that propensity to delay could reveal operational risk and/or poor managerial quality. Consistent with this, a portfolio strategy that buys (sells) funds with historically timely (untimely) reporting delivers 3% annual-style-adjusted returns. Investor flows are lower following reporting delays, although there are potential benefits to managers from delaying reporting when performance is sufficiently poor.

Politically liberal hedge funds are also more likely to enter new positions or fully exit existing positions, and make larger adjustments to their U.S. equity market exposure. Our results suggest that psychological characteristics can influence the portfolio decisions of even those at the very top of the financial sophistication ladder. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

At the firm level, Tobin's q explains physical and intangible investment roughly equally well, and it explains total investment even better. Compared with physical capital, intangible capital adjusts more slowly to changes in investment opportunities. The classic q theory performs better in firms and years with more intangible capital: Total and even physical investment are better explained by Tobin's q and are less sensitive to cash flow. At the macro level, Tobin's q explains intangible investment many times better than physical investment. We propose a simple, new Tobin's q proxy that accounts for intangible capital, and we show that it is a superior proxy for both physical and intangible investment opportunities.

However, the traditionally strong relationship between ports and port cities has gradually weakened due to the emerging negative externalities of ports. Therefore, port-city municipalities need to better understand the relationship between port activities, urban competitiveness, and the attraction of investment. This paper uses the Quadratic Assignment Procedure (QAP) and related regression models to test this relationship as well as identify the determinants of urban competitiveness. The results show that despite the positive relationship between port and urban networks, port cities currently exhibit no significant advantages over non-port cities in attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI); in addition, port-city competitiveness depends more on urban characteristics than on port factors. Based on these results, we propose various strategies for port city developments. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

CSR communication contributes to a corporation's corporate social disclosure, whose main purpose is to enhance a corporate image in order to promote customer and community relations and indirectly promote products to customers. To reach this goal, transparency is crucial. However, transparency in the field of CSR is a difficult matter for two reasons: there is not uniformity in social reporting and the preparation of this document is not mandatory ( except that large company forced by the UE Directive 2014/95/UE to prepare a non-financial statement). The research is divided into two sections and the approach used is mainly descriptive: in the first part, the concept of social balance as a means to interact with all the stakeholders of a firm is exposed. In the second part the paper analyses the web sites of a panel of selected listed Italian companies. The data are able to demonstrate that we can still identify a CSR divide among the country according to 2 different points of view: 1. The size of the company, it still represents a barrier to CSR reporting and communication since require efforts and investment in term of time and resources, and 2. the geographical localization of the selected companies, the concentration of corporates identifying CSR as part of their strategy is still centralized in specific region of the country, mainly due to historical reasons of the country, the openness of those company to the international market and the managerial approach of the company. The research is also able to demonstrate that those companies identified as best practice in the selected panel have a common strength, besides financial reporting, social and environmental responsibility is becoming more and more relevant and considered. The higher the level of CSR acceptance of the company, the best is the image from the perspective of the multiple stakeholders.","[Amelio, Stefano; Battistini, Claudio] Univ Insubria, 2 Via Ravasi, I-21100 Varese, Italy",University of Insubria,"Amelio, S (通讯作者)，Univ Insubria, 2 Via Ravasi, I-21100 Varese, Italy.",stefano.amelio@uninsubria.it; c.battistini.90@gmail.com,,,,,,,42,0,0,0,1,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-269-9,STRATEGICA,,,2017,,,,,,,609,620,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0ZU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431586800047,0

We demonstrate that the rational expectations equilibrium approximates the observed equilibrium in the money management space at least as well as it does in the stock market. Recent work reveals that there is little support for the common conclusion that, as a group, investors in the money management space are naive and that mutual fund managers are charlatans. Even today, equilibrium thinking is not nearly as prevalent in mutual fund research as it is in the rest of asset pricing.

The host country seeks capital inflows for high growth, yet worries about accompanying volatility so much that it limits capital market opening due to its financial weakness. However, the investing country solicits quick and safe returns from capital outflows by requesting wide foreign openness. It is often observed that one side's push for opening encounters the other side's reluctance. We examine how this conflict of interest is resolved for international compromise equilibrium through sequential bargaining between the two sides with private valuations of capital flows. We find that openness bargaining can end up with strategic delay after information revelation. This finding sheds light on certain puzzles in international finance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We find that a fiscal devaluation carried out in the South has a strong positive effect on output, which is five times larger than under a wage tax cut.

Yet, two experiments indicate that bonuses rewarding short-term performance may lead to worse timing of purchases. The authors propose that hyperbolic time discounting makes participants set lower aspired purchase prices for short-term (decreasing percentage) bonuses than for long-term (increasing percentage) bonuses. For this reason purchases are made earlier for decreasing than increasing percentage bonuses, earlier for decreasing than random prices, and earlier for high price volatility than for low price volatility. Neither purchases at the lowest price or highest bonus are attained.

Most people report that the quality of their lives is determined by the number and standard of their interpersonal relationships. In organizational settings, effective communication is a crucial variable in determining the success of interpersonal relationships. Interpersonal communication, the process by which people exchange information, feelings, and meaning through verbal and non-verbal messages, is of considerable importance for an organization, as it predictor of the success, concurrently being able to create the adequate background within an organization, for leaders to efficiently and effectively implement organizational strategies. Defined as a person's global feeling regarding his/her job and the various aspects or facets thereof, job satisfaction is a topic of wide interest when it comes to improving organizational performance and the quality of working life. There is an increased interest in better understanding employee behaviors and in identifying the main factors that could augment job satisfaction, improve business productivity and customer satisfaction, reduce costs, and diminish the turnover and absenteeism rates. The construct of organizational citizenship behavior has been subject to intense research over the past three decades. Being considered as an individual behavior that is discretionary, not directly or explicitly recognized by the formal reward system of an organization, it has been shown to increase organizational effectiveness by creating a stable social and psychological climate. The current study aims at investigating the relationships between interpersonal communication, the various dimensions of job satisfaction, and organizational citizenship behavior. The results of this research are discussed in the light of the previous empirical findings. They are useful for understanding the relationship between the selected variables, as they raise interesting policy issues related to the implementation of different organizational programs aimed at enhancing the personnel interpersonal communication, at increasing employee job satisfaction, and subsequently organizational citizenship behavior, thus managing to improve an organization's performance.","[Gheorghe, Virgil] Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, 30A Expozitiei Blvd,Sect 1, Bucharest 012104, Romania",National University of Political Studies & Public Administration (SNSPA) - Romania,"Gheorghe, V (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, 30A Expozitiei Blvd,Sect 1, Bucharest 012104, Romania.",virgilgheorghe23@yahoo.com,,,,,,,58,0,0,0,9,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-269-9,STRATEGICA,,,2017,,,,,,,329,340,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0ZU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431586800025,0

The reliability of these forecasts has received little attention in the literature, despite the fact that (i) the forecasts have potentially far-reaching consequences for national governments, especially in the euro area while (ii) the EC depends on information supplied by national officials in preparing its forecasts. We hypothesize that the EC's forecasts are biased upwards when national governments expect European fiscal rules to bind. Reconstructing this expectation using real-time information, we show that for euro area countries the EC's fiscal forecasts are indeed biased upwards when the budget deficit threatens to exceed the critical value of 3 % of GDP. For non-euro area countries, which do not face the risk of fines, this bias cannot be established. Our results are robust to various ways of controlling for crisis-induced budgetary problems and the exclusion of various country groups. We offer suggestive evidence that the presence of independent fiscal councils at the national level helps to attenuate the bias induced by the 3 % threshold.","[Gilbert, Niels D.; de Jong, Jasper F.

Findings - The main findings of this paper show that corruption is a serious hurdle to economic growth in MENA countries since it affects investment activities and foreign direct investment inflows. In this case, policymakers have to implement effective anti-corruption strategies to avoid the epidemic of corruption. Research limitations/implications - Unfortunately, in this study the authors did not use institutional variables to see their role and to judge whether governments should enhance the quality of institution and improve the corporate governance. This would be an opportunity to expand the sample and to conduct a new research in the near future to assess the real costs of corruption in the MENA region. Practical implications - Governments and policymakers need to apprehend and admit that corruption is an important issue that deters foreign direct investment and threats the economic development and growth. Corruption can also deteriorate the infrastructure and increase the cost of doing business for both government and private sector which in turn will lower the growth (Tanzi and Doovi, 1997). It is worth recalling that during the past five years, a large part of the MENA region has witnessed multiple social upheavals. Hence, corruption must be tackled effectively and coherently to avoid further social tensions. It is the proper time to take serious steps and strict policy actions within a zero-tolerance framework to fight corruption and its widespread. New rules, laws, and anti-corruption procedures are among the most important initiatives that governments should implement. The governments should also increase the public awareness of the multiple drawbacks of corruption by publishing official reports and data on the most corrupted sector in the country. In this case, media will have a key role to diffuse the necessary information. Originality/value - While most of the previous studies have employed GMM and OLS techniques, the authors opt a panel vector error correction model and cointegration technique to detect causality between the variables used in the model for the present study.","[Hakimi, Abdelaziz] Univ Jendouba, Fac Sci Jurid Econ & Gest Jendouba, Jendouba, Tunisia; [Hamdi, Helmi] Aix Marseille Univ, CERGAM, EA4225, Aix En Provence, France",Universite de Jendouba; Aix-Marseille Universite,"Hakimi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Jendouba, Fac Sci Jurid Econ & Gest Jendouba, Jendouba, Tunisia.",abdelazizhakimi@yahoo.fr,"Hamdi, Helmi/D-6844-2016; Hakimi, Abdelaziz/AAQ-6750-2020","Hamdi, Helmi/0000-0002-0056-3685; Hakimi, Abdelaziz/0000-0003-2715-0239",,,,,73,40,41,3,39,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

In case of such a serious financial crisis of a highly reputable city like Detroit, it is reasonable to ask whether an upswing might be expected, and if yes, then what sort of a role its famous automotive industry would play in it? Although the structure and operation of local governmental systems are different from country to country, studying the reasons and consequences of the financial crisis of Detroit may suggest new recommendations that may globally support the sustainability of local governmental systems. The aim of this study is to discover the financial proofs that have led to the bankruptcy of Detroit by using statistics of Detroit's budget. The main finding of the paper is that individual bankruptcy cases have serious lessons to learn.

Occupying almost half of the territory of the country, forests provide environmental safety and are one of the most important factors of socio-economic development. In modern conditions, the problems of conservation and use of forests are becoming more complex and require the modification of existing approaches to forest management, which should be implemented on the basis of the principles of sustainable development. State forest policy should be based on the recognition and respect of the rights of citizens to use forest resources and a favorable environment and multi-purpose and sustainable use of forests. The concept of sustainable development presupposes the consideration of economic, social and environmental factors that in the sphere of forest management means increasing the efficiency of the forestry sector, preserving the biosphere role of forests and increasing the level and quality of life of the population associated with forests. Despite the fact that a large number of normative documents in the field of forestry have been adopted in Russia, there are serious inconsistencies in them, as well as a considerable discrepancy between theory and practice. This study is aimed at identifying the main problems of sustainable forest management in Russia and identifying ways to overcome them, including using the experience of European countries. The authors believe that the long-declared approach to forest management based on the principles of sustainable development requires concrete steps both in the area of adjusting forest legislation, and in enhancing the legal awareness of Russian citizens, and their active involvement in the sphere of control over the turnover of forest products. An important factor is the improvement of the quality of life of the local population.","[Ikonnikova, Olga] Northern Arctic Fed Univ, Dept Accounting & Auditing, Arkhangelsk, Russia; [Gorkin, Aleksandr] Northern Arctic Fed Univ, Accounting & Audit Dept, Arkhangelsk, Russia; [Petrik, Vitaliy] Northern Arctic Fed Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture, Arkhangelsk, Russia",Northern Arctic Federal University; Northern Arctic Federal University; Northern Arctic Federal University,"Ikonnikova, O (通讯作者)，Northern Arctic Fed Univ, Dept Accounting & Auditing, Arkhangelsk, Russia.",o.ikonnikova@narfu.ru,"Ikonnikova, Olga/AAB-3240-2019",,Russian Foundation for Basic Research; Government of Arkhangelsk Region within the framework of scientific project The Economic Substantiation of the Restoration of Gum Preparation in Industrial Pumping in the Context of Ensuring Sustainable Forest Development in Arkhangelsk Region [16-12-29003],Russian Foundation for Basic Research(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)Spanish Government); Government of Arkhangelsk Region within the framework of scientific project The Economic Substantiation of the Restoration of Gum Preparation in Industrial Pumping in the Context of Ensuring Sustainable Forest Development in Arkhangelsk Region,The study was carried out with the financial support of the Russian Foundation for Basic Research and the Government of Arkhangelsk Region within the framework of scientific project No. 16-12-29003 The Economic Substantiation of the Restoration of Gum Preparation in Industrial Pumping in the Context of Ensuring Sustainable Forest Development in Arkhangelsk Region,,16,1,1,0,6,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-408-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,38.0,,,,,,241,245,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI9HY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416099600041,0

Some scholars have argued that colonization left African Economies poor and unable to develop as western counterparts. Colonialism is adjudged to be the tool the colonial masters of European countries pillaged and sabotaged the African economies. There had also been an attempt to explain the underdevelopment of many third world countries with the economic relationship of the core economies and the periphery economies. The argument was that the countries at the periphery support the countries at the core. While the countries of the core consist of the wealthy countries of the northern hemisphere, the countries of the periphery consist of the poor countries of the southern hemisphere. Before colonialism, some scholars argued that slave trade milked African countries of youthful vibrancy needed for economic growth. The slave trade was asserted to have created a huge development gap in African economies in a time Europe grew their economies through merchandize and trade relations. Despite the foregoing perceptions on economic status and performances, many African countries have had the opportunity to accelerate their economic growth and development, but failed to do so. This research presents the perspective that since Slavery and colonialism had ended many years ago; and as such, African countries have had huge opportunities for economic growth and development, some of which exceeds those of the countries blamed for their woes, but they failed to grow economically. There was also the issue of the resource curse, which affected African economies rich in natural and mineral resources. In view of the subsisting challenges of realizing high levels of economic growth and development, this article identifies and assesses some of the challenges facing African economies over the years. It reviews the academic literature on African economies, identifies their contemporary challenges and draws useful conclusions. Some of the challenges of African economies identified and discussed include leadership, import dependence, corruption, sabotage of economic efforts, lack of investment in infrastructure, concentration on primary products, etc. The research underscores the fact that the challenges are not just structurally based on economic indices, but has dimensions associated with activities which undermine and sabotage economic efforts in both short and long time periods. One of the conclusions at the end of the research is that various African leadership levels have to stir the cord of African economies aright forthwith on the inevitable path to giant economic growth and development.","[Itumo, Victor Nwaoba] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 6 Piata Romano, Bucharest 010374, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Itumo, VN (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 6 Piata Romano, Bucharest 010374, Romania.",victoritumo@yahoo.com,,,,,,,13,0,0,2,7,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-269-9,STRATEGICA,,,2017,,,,,,,17,27,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0ZU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431586800001,0

There is some evidence that this is the result of changing ideologies towards companionate marriage but there is also evidence of life-cycle influences which result in declining cooperation over time.","[Johnson, Susan] Univ Bath, Ctr Dev Studies, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England",University of Bath,"Johnson, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Ctr Dev Studies, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",s.z.johnson@bath.ac.uk,,,"Financial Sector Deepening Trust, Kenya","Financial Sector Deepening Trust, Kenya","This work was supported by the Financial Sector Deepening Trust, Kenya.",,39,14,15,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

The proposed approach is based on existing traffic demand data and limited roadside surveys. Results indicate that the introduction of the proposed LRT would attract a moderate number of 23,000 passengers daily and shift a small percentage of 3.5% of traffic to the system. It was also found that approximately 33% of these trips correspond to the urban section of the network, while about 62% of the estimated ridership will use the part of the system connecting Nicosia and Larnaca.

The EU has encouraged this deepening through an active trade policy, including the Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) that provides for the creation of a free trade area between the Union and Macedonia. The latter was granted candidate status for EU membership in 2005. The relative competitiveness will therefore play a key role in determining changes in trade patterns and flows between the country and the member states. There is no doubt that the candidate countries will not be able to exploit the benefits of integration unless they have products and companies to withstand the market competition. Hence, the external competitiveness per se has become a more salient issue than ever before, while improving competitiveness is important in terms of EU accession. This paper aims to discover whether Macedonia is in the process of extending the products in which it has trade potentials, as opposed to a situation in which the number of products that can be competitively exported is static. More specifically, it examines the sectoral specialization and competitiveness of the country, in relation to that of the EU/28, using four indices of revealed comparative advantage over the years 2000-2015. The statistical findings (mean and coefficient of variation) for the four indices indicate that comparative advantage are mainly achieved in primary products and few manufactures, which corresponds to the level of economic development, the availability of natural resources and the price of production factors (labour). In other words, change in the composition of exports remain slow, with limited progress towards higher value added products over the last few years.","[Kostoska, Olivera; Hristoski, Ilija] Univ St Kliment Ohridski, Fac Econ Prilep, Bitola, Macedonia",St. Clement of Ohrid University of Bitola,"Kostoska, O (通讯作者)，Univ St Kliment Ohridski, Fac Econ Prilep, Bitola, Macedonia.",olivera.kostoska@uklo.edu.mk; ilija.hristoski@uklo.edu.mk,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,0,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2017,,,,,,,856,871,,,,,,16,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7PJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455302900054,0

However, it is rare to analyze the risk of insurance companies from the profitability of insurance companies. Insurance companies as a special economy, have played a role in escalating economic development, both in the micro or in the macro. They also bear an important social responsibility at the same time. Insurance companies need to be in accordance with the principle of decentralized risk, the average burden of compensation for natural disasters, accidents caused by the loss of social production and life to ensure the normal order. On the other hand, the insurance company is an independent economy, in addition to social responsibility, but also need bear the corresponding responsibility for its investors and creditors. This means, insurance companies need to ensure their own profitability and growth space. In recent years, Chinese insurance industry has developed strongly, the market players are increasingly rich, the market structure is changing rapidly. All insurance companies adopt different competitive strategy, whether their product side or the investment side is full of new industry vitality. This paper will analyze the profitability of various insurance companies according to the statistical information disclosed by the insurance companies in 2015 and 2016, using the methods of principal component analysis and fuzzy clustering. Through the comparative analysis of the profitability business structure of Qian Hai Life Insurance and other top-ranked insurers, the results show that the similarity between Qian Hai Life and other top-ranked insurance companies' profitability business structure is very low and the comparability is not high. Based on this result, the author analyzes the uniqueness of Qian Hai Life business structure. In this paper, through the longitudinal analysis and horizontal analysis of the data released by Qian Hai Life in 2015 and 2016, this paper provides new research ideas and methods for life insurance company profit model.","[Kou Yefu] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Insurance, China Inst Actuarial Sci, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Liu Shengyang; Li Mingzi; Chang Yang] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Insurance, Beijing, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics; Central University of Finance & Economics,"Kou, YF (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Insurance, China Inst Actuarial Sci, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",kouyefu@sina.com; lshy13@sina.com; limingzireal@126.com; 1071511718@qq.com,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,1,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,,,,,2017,,,,,,,555,573,,,,,,19,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK8HD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000442810700039,0

The dependent variable is private investment and the independent variables are the lag of private investment; economic growth rate, the ratio of remittances over GDP; the ratio of Government expenditure over GDP; the trade openness of the economy. The Granger Causality Tests result shows that there is only one-way causality from remittance to private investment existing in research period. Therefore, the study suggests that the government policy should be designed toward promoting private investment for leveling up the rate of economic growth.

The OECD/IEA quantifies the investment requirements of this to be at 640 billion USD. Little evidence exists on socio-economic impacts of electrification. The present paper is the first to causally investigate the effects of electrification in Africa on all beneficiary groups. The electrification program under research, the Rwandan Electricity Access Role-Out Program (EARP), is one of the largest in the world. Our analysis is based on a panel of 974 households, a full-census survey among health centers, and qualitative surveys among 83 micro-enterprises and 50 schools. We find that EARP has been remarkably effective in increasing the connection numbers among all beneficiary types. Around 3.5 years after electrification, the quantity of consumed electricity and the uptake of appliances, though, remain low. Noteworthy impacts are decreasing energy expenditures and a considerable reduction in dry-cell battery consumption with potential environmental benefits. Beyond this, electricity mostly facilitates people's life, but there is only weak evidence for impacts on classical poverty indicators such as income, health, and education. We conclude by calling for more research on the comparison of on-grid and off-grid electrification with respect to impact potentials, costs, and people's willingness to pay in order to inform the way forward within the SE4All endeavor.

Because of its own distinguishing features, like long cycle, poor ability to resist natural disasters and regional differences, it makes agricultural insurance different from other kinds of general property insurance. As China's strategic food reserve base and commodity grain base, Heilongjiang reclamation area has a significant role in the protection of national food security and agricultural development, also it is one of the earliest areas included in the agricultural insurance pilot areas. In order to improve the ability of resisting risks of agriculture, it is necessary to give full play to the risk management and safeguarding effect of agricultural insurance. In recent years, both in the central document or the government work report, agricultural insurance are seriously concerned. By studying relevant achievements and specific data, combining with the latest relevant policy documents and practically analyzing the document literature and data message, this paper takes the development of mutual insurance in Heilongjiang as the object, evaluates the economic effect of mutual insurance system from the standpoints of Sunlight Agricultural Mutual Insurance Company and the development of agriculture in Heilongjiang reclamation area. This paper is divided into three parts, the first part introduces the background, the related concepts, the logical framework and the research method of the article. The second part discusses the actual situation of Heilongjiang reclamation area and the Sunlight Agricultural Mutual Insurance Company, and explores the current situation and existing problems of mutual insurance development in Heilongjiang. Then, using the SWOT model and quantitative analysis, this paper analyzes the economic benefits of the Sunlight Mutual Agricultural Insurance Company from the microcosmic angle and analyzes the changes brought by the mutual agricultural insurance system to the agricultural development in Heilongjiang reclamation area from the macroscopic point of view, which focuses on the economic effect. In the last part, this paper gives a summary and comes up with several proposals in terms of policy formulation, corporate governance, risk control and other aspects, in order to provide a reference for the improvement of China's insurance system and the development of agricultural insurance.","[Li Yunzhe] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Insurance, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Li, YZ (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Insurance, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.",2014311347@email.cufe.edu.cn,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,2,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,,,,,2017,,,,,,,394,406,,,,,,13,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK8HD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000442810700027,0

At present, the micro class has been widely used in College English teaching, and has opened up a new model of College English teaching, and has achieved good teaching results. However, in the application of the micro class, the situation still exists in the form, which affects the teaching efficiency of the University pronunciation. In this paper, the author mainly studies the problems and misunderstandings existing in the current micro class mode in College English teaching, and puts forward some suggestions on how to use the micro class reasonably and improve the efficiency and quality of College English teaching. As a new type of teaching mode, the micro class has provided many conveniences for the classroom teaching of College English after the elaborate design of information teaching. With the wide application of micro class, it has become an important way for college students to learn independently. There are some differences with the traditional teaching mode. Micro class only changes the way of presentation and transmission of learning content, but it does not change the properties of the content. From practice teaching, it can be seen that some English teachers lack the correct understanding of the micro class, and as a new teaching mode, there are inevitably some mistakes in teaching, which affect the teaching efficiency. Based on this, the author has studied the effective application of micro class teaching model in College English classroom.","[Liu, Na] Tianshi Coll, Tianjin 301700, Peoples R China",,"Liu, N (通讯作者)，Tianshi Coll, Tianjin 301700, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-463-7,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,53.0,,,,,,941,944,,,,,,4,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL5MW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000452213200193,0

We defined countries with efficient higher education (e.g. Canada, Israel, Japan, Sweden) and countries with inefficient higher education (e.g. Turkey, Korea) and calculated how much the countries with inefficient higher education should change the outputs to become efficient.

Its entry to economics is not at all surprising and here it found an extremely fertile soil for its implementation and future development. Hysteresis has been acknowledged by the economic theory as having the potential to diminish the distance that separates economic modelling from reality and has provided elevated explanations for the evolutions of economic phenomena.

The objective of this study is to examine whether previous studies, predicting the direction of movement of earnings, are still relevant when using the newly SEC required, XBRL database (standardized financial reporting system). The study analyzes NYSE companies' XBRL quarterly data, from 2011 to 2015, using a two-step Logit regression model. The model is then used to arrive at the probability of the directional movement of earnings between current quarter and subsequent quarter, adjusted for a drift. Additional models are created by dividing the sample into industry membership (based on SIC codes). The results classified the companies as ones that would realize an increase in earnings or a decrease in earnings. The final model indicated a significant ability to predict subsequent earnings changes. The predictions appear to be correct on average about 70.7% of the time (higher than those of previous studies based on COMPUSTAT). The industry based models, although do not increase the accuracy of the model (an average of 68%) do increase the portfolio size.

Over the last two decades, the sukuk market has become global. However, the main centres of trade are still located in South-Eastern Asia, with Malaysia at the forefront, and countries in the Persian Gulf region. Sukuk are present in the European financial market, mainly through companies' issues and the functioning of centres of trade in London, Luxembourg and Dublin. Despite that, the Islamic certificates have not yet gained significant interest. The paper will indicate the types of challenges and barriers related to issuing and trading sukuk in the European market. The research applies an analysis of literature on the subject, reasoning based on statistical data regarding the European market and a case study of a 2014 sukuk offering transacted by the government of the United Kingdom. The paper indicates that the specific characteristics of sukuk lead to the conclusion that they should be treated as a separate category of capital market instruments. In consequence, trading in these instruments on the European financial market requires an adjustment of the applicable legal norms. What is more, the fact that sukuk's structure is more complicated than that of traditional financial instruments increases risks and costs of the issuers. The distinctness and variety of sukuk forms hinder financial risk assessment, and thus have a negative impact on the scale of investors' interest in sukuk.","[Piotrowski, Dariusz] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Piotrowski, D (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Torun, Poland.",,,"Piotrowski, Dariusz/0000-0001-8482-8064",,,,,38,0,0,0,3,INTL INST SOCIAL & ECONOMIC SCI,PRAGUE,"TREBESOVSKA 2038/14, PRAGUE, 193 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87927-38-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,69,83,,10.20472/EFC.2017.008.006,0.0,,,15,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6OC,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426884200006,0

For this purpose, we investigate a potential influence of interest rate on perceived housing affordability. We apply a general housing affordability concept on data covering European Union member states. We find that large swings in interest rates on housing loans can significantly influence households' perception of housing prices. Moreover, housing market imbalances are further growing in some EU countries despite the active use of macro prudential instruments by national authorities. This partially supports some previous research pointing on the asymmetric approach of monetary policy to boom and bust phases and its overemphasis of inflation targeting.","[Ryehtarik, Stefan] Natl Bank Slovakia, Macroprudential Policy Dept, Imricha Karvasa 1, Bratislava 81325, Slovakia",National Bank of Slovakia,"Ryehtárik, S (通讯作者)，Natl Bank Slovakia, Macroprudential Policy Dept, Imricha Karvasa 1, Bratislava 81325, Slovakia.",stevo.rychtarik@gmail.com,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,5,EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"UNIV ECONOMICS, EKONOMICKA UNIVERZITA & BRATISLAVE, DOLNOZEMSKA CESTA 1, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-4362-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,225,231,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI4MO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000411851600029,0

These dilemmas are: to manage or lead, to divide or integrate, to control or trust, to make money or service society. This article is based on theoretical and empirical evidence. The main objective of this article is to create organizational model that takes into account management dilemmas in relation to two fundamental views of organizations - organization like machines or organization like organisms. It explains the relationship between the dilemmas and critically evaluates them in relation to this approaches and organizational dimensions. Premise of biotic model is that organizations are autopoietic systems. In this concept, organization may be defined as living systems that are able to adapt to the surrounding environment. This theoretical approach facilitates the seeking penetration between management dilemmas. It prefers forms of management that avoid artificial dependencies. It creates specific work environment that develops the potential of individuals through freedom and responsibility. The core of biotic organization is self-organizaton.

Involving local communities in the management of protected areas - national and nature parks - will allow local stakeholders to understand the possibilities, significance and role of protected natural areas and ecosystem services in enhancing their living standards and overall quality of life. The study was conducted by a method of semi-structured interviews combined with survey on a sample of 43 subjects. Multi-sectorial analysis included the sectors of nature protection, economy, agriculture, fisheries, tourism, forestry, health, education, employment, spatial planning and sports. The results of the study of attitudes of different stakeholders and their relationship to protected natural areas at national, regional and local level as well as international organizations in the Republic of Croatia show that the protected areas are an important resource of the Republic of Croatia and the potential to launch socio-economic development and sustainable development financing in local communities where they are established. However, there are few development ideas and business opportunities between various stakeholders from national and nature parks. The overall conclusion is that the protected natural areas are still largely viewed through the protection, control and conservation of nature, and therefore they are not open to potential investors and the business sector in general. Stronger integration of protected natural areas in the development of local communities is a long process that requires the implementation of a series of activities, and one of the key activities for the forthcoming period is to strengthen the knowledge and capacity of people about the value of ecosystem services and utilization of economic potential of protected natural areas in a sustainable manner.","[Tisma, Sanja] Inst Dev & Int Relat, Zagreb, Croatia",Institute for Development & International Relations,"Tisma, S (通讯作者)，Inst Dev & Int Relat, Zagreb, Croatia.",sanja.tisma@irmo.hr,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,1,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2017,,,,,,,810,823,,,,,,14,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7PJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455302900051,0

This paper briefly introduces concept and nature of green supply chain, establishes the conceptual model of green supply chain, analyzes the goal of green supply chain management, and discusses the basic principle and nature of green supply chain management from the idea of sustainable development.","[Zhang, Jinsong] Tianjin Univ Technol, Dept Ind Engn, Tianjin 300384, Peoples R China",Tianjin University of Technology,"Zhang, JS (通讯作者)，Tianjin Univ Technol, Dept Ind Engn, Tianjin 300384, Peoples R China.",806338091@qq.com,,,,,,,11,0,0,2,11,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-382-1,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,48.0,,,,,,344,348,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI9GL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416078200073,0

Still, the substantial variation in duration by product form and factors influencing it, indicates heterogeneous dynamics for each supply chain even for slight differences in the characteristics of a commodity.

The main findings indicate that ambiguity in the equity market is priced. Introducing ambiguity alongside risk provides stronger evidence on the role of risk in explaining expected returns in the equity markets.

A key question is how to recruit and retain college students in STEM majors. We offer new evidence on the role of financial aid in supporting STEM attainment. Exploiting a regression discontinuity that allows for causal inference, we find that eligibility for need-based financial aid increased STEM credit completion by 20 to 35 percent among academically-ready students in a large, public higher education system. These results appear to be driven by shifting students into STEM-heavy course loads, suggesting aid availability impacts the academic choices students make after deciding to enroll. We also find suggestive evidence that aid offers increase degree attainment in STEM fields, although we cannot rule out null impacts on STEM degree production.

I study whether there is any evidence of such preferences with a unique data set containing 10,500 scores given by 105 evaluators to 3,500 students in the humanities and social sciences who applied for a doctoral scholarship. On average, I find very weak evidence of same-gender preferences for male evaluators (p = 0.133). To better understand this effect, I also study same-gender preferences across the distribution of candidates, in subcommittees with different gender composition, and for evaluators from different disciplines. I show that male evaluators give higher scores to strong male candidates relative to those given by female evaluators. At the same time, male evaluators give higher scores to male candidates than do female evaluators when there is only one male evaluator in the subcommittee. The representation of men in a discipline does not seem to affect the scores given by evaluators. Overall, there is no clear evidence that replacing a male evaluator with a female one would help female candidates.","[Chandler, Vincent] Univ Quebec Outaouais, Ind Relat Dept, Gatineau, PQ, Canada",University of Quebec; University Quebec Outaouais,"Chandler, V (通讯作者)，Univ Quebec Outaouais, Ind Relat Dept, Gatineau, PQ, Canada.",,,,Social Science and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) [430-2017-00540],Social Science and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"The author acknowledges funding from the Social Science and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) through an Insight Development Grant (430-2017-00540).

In 2007, Portugal introduced Ecological Fiscal Transfers (EFT), where municipalities receive transfers for hosting protected areas (PA). We study whether introducing EFT in Portugal incentivized municipalities to designate PA and has led to a decentralization of conservation decisions. We employ a Bayesian structural time series approach to estimate the effect of introducing EFT in comparison to a simulated counterfactual time series. Quantitative results show a significant increase in the ratio of municipal and national PA designations following Portugal's EFT introductionwhich we infer to be a causal consequence. The analysis furthermore places emphasis on the importance of relevant municipal conservation competencies for the functioning of the instrument.

We study a model of electoral competition with rationally ignorant voters in which the success of a reform is tied to a politician's unobservable competence. We show that when voters' demand for reform is high, candidates engage in a form of populism and propose reformist agendas regardless of their ability to successfully carry them out. As voters are then faced with either risky reformers or policy inaction, the relationship between demand for reform and the probability that any (i.e., genuine or populist) policy change is implemented depends on how harmful botched reforms are. Our results help organize the mixed empirical evidence regarding the impact of crises on the likelihood of reform. They also suggest that the rise of populism may cause political disenchantment rather than the other way round.","[Prato, Carlo] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Wolton, Stephane] London Sch Econ, London, England",Columbia University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Prato, C (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",cp2928@columbia.edu; s.wolton@lse.ac.uk,,"Wolton, Stephane/0000-0003-1405-650X",Hoover Institution,Hoover Institution,"We thank two anonymous referees, Avidit Acharya, Scott Ashworth, Laurent Bouton, Renee Bowen, Ethan Bueno de Mesquita, Peter Buisseret, Micael Castanheira, Allan Drazen, Justin Fox, Navin Kartik, Pablo Montagnes, Roger Myerson, Larry Samuelson, Francesco Squintani, Dustin Tingley, Gabriel Ulysses, Richard Van Weelden, seminar participants at APSA, MPSA, Princeton, University of Chicago, Collegio Carlo Alberto, University of Mannheim, University of Oslo, SCARES, Stockholm School of Economics, and EITM Institute for helpful comments, as well as Kate Anthony and Richard Jung for excellent research assistance.

Through assessing the literature an organizing framework is formed to support a nuanced basis for future research and management decisions in EMs. Design/methodology/approach Following guidelines of seminal authors, the authors conduct a systematic review involving both leading field-specific and top-tier international business journals. Findings The empirical context of the literature is outlined showing dominance of studies involving China and India. Seminal contributions are identified based on cross-references in the EM field and citations in international business literature in general. The definitional elements of the most dominant definitions are compiled into an organizing framework. Research limitations/implications Researchers need to acknowledge the distinct contextual setting of specific regions and countries labeled as EMs. This entails considerations into the capacity of current frameworks to lend insights not just on EM contexts but the particular EM context in focus. Practical implications The findings suggest a more nuanced approach to managing activities in EM contexts. The proposed framework encloses the EM category on its distinct dimensions. Each provides a unique basis for managerial decision-making on specified EM activities.

The authors draw on both the resource-based view and the institutional perspective and argue that within-industry diversification can enhance the financial performance of SMEs in EMs. Due to institutional voids in emerging economies, SMEs can gain additional benefits from scope economies, as well as from market returns, by filling product market voids and gaps in business ecosystems, while also enjoying low input and labor costs that reduce the coordination costs of diversification. This, in turn, enhances benefits of within-industry diversification, thereby resulting in higher financial profitability. Design/methodology/approach This study employs panel data econometrics to estimate the model. The authors test hypotheses on 195 firms, originating from five countries in Southeast Asia, during the period of 2009-2014. Findings The empirical results support the arguments. Within-industry diversification has a positive impact on the performance of SMEs in EMs. These effects become weaker when the institutional contexts are more developed. Nevertheless, such effects become stronger when SMEs in EMs are more efficient. Research limitations/implications The relationship between within-industry diversification and performance is a positive linear pattern, which differs from the pattern in advanced economies. In addition to unrelated diversification, the related diversification is preferable for firms in EMs. Practical implications The paper provides implications for SMEs that aim to enhance their performance by engaging in single product lines and within-industry diversification. Originality/value This paper examines the different ways within-industry diversification can enhance SMEs performance in EM contexts.","[Pangboonyanon, Varaporn] Mahidol Univ, Coll Management, Bangkok, Thailand; [Kalasin, Kiattichai] Natl Inst Dev Adm, NIDA Business Sch, Bangkok, Thailand",Mahidol University; National Institute of Development Administration - Thailand,"Kalasin, K (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Dev Adm, NIDA Business Sch, Bangkok, Thailand.",kiattichai.kal@nida.ac.th,,,,,,,108,9,11,4,29,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Acquirers in transactions with earnouts are significantly more likely to be financially constrained, face tighter credit market conditions, and use less debt and equity to fund acquisitions. Financially constrained acquirers also book lower fair values for the contingent claim. Earnout use is more likely in transactions that involve liquid sellers, and earnout bids garner higher transaction valuation multiples. Overall, the evidence suggests that earnouts are an economically material and increasingly common source of acquisition financing for acquirers with limited access to external capital.","[Bates, Thomas W.] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Neyland, Jordan B.] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Wang, Yolanda Yulong] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; George Mason University; University of Melbourne,"Neyland, JB (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",thomas.bates@asu.edu; jneylan2@gmu.edu; yulong.wang@unimelb.edu.au,"Bates, Thomas/GZG-5460-2022","Wang, Yolanda Yulong/0000-0002-1558-8033",,,,,45,20,25,13,105,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0165-4101,1879-1980,,J ACCOUNT ECON,J.

However, little is known about how trade policy reacts to trade imbalances. This article aims to address this question by investigating the impact of trade imbalances on domestic trade policy liberalization, including in the context of multilateral trade policy liberalization. This analysis is particularly relevant because countries are currently having appetite for trade protectionist measures, which could ultimately undermine multilateral trade liberalization, and hurt domestic economies and the world economy. The analysis has been conducted on a panel dataset of 166 countries over the period 1998 to 2015. The take home message of the analysis is twofold: first, an improvement in trade balance induces greater domestic trade policy liberalization. However, this impact depends on countries' development level, as the magnitude of this positive impact is higher, the higher the countries' level of development. Second, an improvement in trade balance leads to greater domestic trade policy liberalization only if multilateral trade policy liberalization reaches a certain level.","[Gnangnon, Sena Kimm] World Trade Org, Geneva, Switzerland",World Trade Organization,"Gnangnon, SK (通讯作者)，World Trade Org, Dev Div, Rue Lausanne 154, CH-1211 Geneva 21, Switzerland.",kgnangnon@yahoo.fr,,,,,,,53,4,4,4,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Both static and dynamic total connectedness show that the 14 commercial banks are highly interconnected. Total directional connectedness (including from-connectedness, to-connectedness and net-connectedness) shows that state-owned commercial banks contribute less to volatility connectedness than joint-stock and city commercial banks, and that city commercial banks are the largest (net-) emitters of volatility connectedness. Statically, we find a positive (negative) rank correlation between size and from-connectedness (to-connectedness and net-connectedness) of banks. Dynamically, however, the positive rank correlation loses its statistical significance and the negative rank correlation disappears completely during the recent global financial crisis and the 2015-2016 Chinese stock market turbulence. Our findings suggest (i) that a bank might be too big to fail, but not necessarily too interconnected to fail and vice versa, and (ii) that these two cases may coexist conditional on the system being in distress.

Using causal evidence from a government-initiated policy experiment in Lesotho, in which districts reserved for women village councilors were first randomized and then withdrawn, we find that women win more frequently in previously reserved areas after the policy's removal. We present evidence that this effect is driven by incumbent women's electoral success in formerly reserved districts, as well as by new women candidates who are more likely to win in the absence of incumbent men. This occurs for two reasons: (1) new women candidates have more success against incumbent women than incumbent men and (2) women incumbents run for reelection less frequently than incumbent men, leaving more open seats. Contrary to previous work, we find no evidence that women incumbents increase the number of new women candidates in their districts, increase the vote share new women candidates receive, or increase party support for new women candidates. These findings suggest that, at least in the short term, women's incumbency affects subsequent patterns of women's representation by disrupting patterns of male incumbency rather than changing voters' or parties' demand for women candidates.

This study analyses at a meta-level per capita public transport ridership across 48 European cities based on a rich database collected as part of this study. The dataset includes detailed mode specific information about the public transport networks, hence extending previous research by analysing each public transport mode separately while simultaneously taking into account the main determinants of ridership identified by a thorough literature review of 36 previous studies, e.g. urban demographics and land uses. Factor analysis was deployed revealing four main composite determinants, namely i) metro coverage, network connectivity, and urban density, ii) suburban rail coverage, iii) economic inequality, and iv) light rail coverage. Subsequent multiple regression analysis confirmed the a priori hypothesis of per capita ridership being positively associated with the extent of network coverage in terms of metro, suburban rail and light rail transit. The importance of network connectivity was included with results suggesting that the number of transfer stations was more important than the cyclomatic number of the public transport network. Cities with higher economic inequality in terms of higher unemployment, lower per capita GDP and higher GINI-coefficient showed lower public transport ridership. Finally, the analyses highlighted the importance of proper definitions of urban areas in order to perform consistent analyses of data across cities. This revealed the impact on transit ridership of urban density defined as population and especially job intensity per km(2). As the study is based on aggregate, cross-sectional data from a relatively small sample of European cities, it is not without limitations in terms of mainly revealing correlational structures rather than causations as well as not including all variables related to public transport ridership. Future studies should further investigate these interrelationships before drawing conclusions on the causational relationships.","[Ingvardson, Jesper Blafoss; Nielsen, Otto Anker] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Management Engn, Bygningstorvet 116B, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark,"Ingvardson, JB (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Management Engn, Bygningstorvet 116B, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",jbin@dtu.dk; oani@dtu.dk,"Nielsen, Otto Anker/AAF-2954-2021","Nielsen, Otto Anker/0000-0001-7901-7021",,,,,63,47,49,11,70,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Against this backdrop, there has been substantial penetration of mobile money, moving beyond simple person-to-person exchanges towards adoption by private firms. This study explores whether there is a relationship between firm adoption of mobile money and firm investment. Using firm-level data that are nationally representative of the private sector in three East African countries-Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda-a positive relationship is found between mobile money use and firm's purchase of fixed assets. This relationship is attributed to reduced transaction costs, increased liquidity, and increased credit worthiness associated with the use of mobile phone financial services. The finding is largely driven by small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).","[Islam, Asif; Muzi, Silvia; Rodriguez Meza, Jorge Luis] World Bank, Enterprise Anal Unit, DECIG, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Islam, A (通讯作者)，World Bank, Enterprise Anal Unit, DECIG, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",aislam@worldbank.org; smuzi@worldbank.org; jrodriguezmeza@worldbank.org,"Islam, Asif/AAQ-2113-2020; Islam, Asif/IQR-5824-2023",,,,,,51,35,36,2,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Our results at both the national and firm levels indicate that real estate transactions differ fundamentally from other types of FDI. Specifically, property nation corporate governance, real estate firm headquarter nation corporate governance, and firm governance are negatively associated with the propensity to invest across borders. Further, firm governance is negatively related to the stake acquired in foreign property investment. The firm -level results appear to be driven largely by non-U.S. firms.

Focusing on the transfer of policies and experiences (particularly conjoined demand management-free basic water programs and related social contestation), we provide examples of how neoliberal logics and human right to water principles intersect in evolving hybrid regulatory landscapes, which are characterized by contradiction. The human right to water makes a difference by influencing the drafting and implementation of water-related policies that affect to the lives of poor and vulnerable populations. Yet this process unfolds unevenly, as human right to water principles and practices are contextually applied, often alongside neoliberalizing policy instruments within evolving regulatory landscapes. Our analysis reveals the uneven effects of policy experimentation, transfer, and adaptation. The analysis shows that the principle of the human right to water affects the transformation of policy options circulating in the water sector, but it does so in relation to the institutional histories and policy options associated with uneven patterns of variegated neoliberalization in the water sector.

We find that the labour tax plays a particularly important role in the overall level of the EMTR and that the presence of mark-ups can significantly alter the levels of the multi-factor EMTR, although without significantly altering the ranking of countries.

We use propensity score matching and find that SEOs lead to asset expansion as opposed to any deleveraging. Further, we find a decrease in lending in the short-term followed by a subsequent increase, a reduction in profitability, and an increase in systemic risk. Regulators might not have fully considered this last negative externality when they imposed the tougher Basel III capital requirements.

However, the control group of not married differs between studies, over time and between countries, such that the message remains somewhat fuzzy. It is not clear whether the type of union or the fact of being in a union is responsible for these wage penalties and premiums. This article aims to analyze whether marriage pays more than cohabitation in a country such as France, where cohabiting and married partnerships have both coexisted for years. Thanks to a rich dataset with information on both the marital and work history of both partners, we are able to estimate the effect on hourly wages of being married relative to being in a cohabiting union. Taking into account selections into marriage (rather than cohabitation) and into the labor market with a possible differential in sharing of paid work within the couple, our results show that the men's marriage premium is due entirely to a positive selection into marriage. While the process of within-couple marital specialization strongly reduces a woman's hourly wage, there is no evidence of any additional marriage penalty for women. The within-couple gender wage gap is similar for married and cohabiting partners, after controlling for selection into marriage.","[Bonnet, Carole; Solaz, Anne] INED, F-75020 Paris, France; [Jeandidier, Bruno] Univ Lorraine, CNRS, BETA, Metz, France",Universite de Lorraine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Bonnet, C (通讯作者)，INED, F-75020 Paris, France.",,,,COMPRES project of the ANR (the French National Research Agency),COMPRES project of the ANR (the French National Research Agency),Research carried out with support from the COMPRES project of the ANR (the French National Research Agency).,,67,1,1,0,2,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Evidence from MENA Countries,REVUE D ECONOMIE POLITIQUE,,,English,Article,,,,,,regulation; privatization; competition; telecom industry; MENA region; reforms dynamics,,"Since the late eighties, governments have designed telecommunication policies aiming at introducing competition. This implies new regulation framework and privatization of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs). This paper empirically assesses the effect of reforms sequences in the telecommunications sector on the sector performance, by using a sample of 17 Middle East North African (MENA) countries for the period 1995-2010. Countries are free to choose how to proceed notably whether to establish an Independent Regulatory Authority (IRA) before or after privatizing the SOEs, as well as they can create an IRA before introducing competition rather than after. We assume that the choices of reforms sequences are affected by institutional, political and economic variables. We use IV-2SLS estimation to analyze the outcome of reforms sequences in terms of telecom performance (access, prices, productivity and quality). We find that an IRA established before privatizing the incumbent operator improves the sector access but with an increase in fixed prices. However, the effect of an IRA before introducing competition differs between the fixed and the mobile sector. Regulation still works as an imperfect substitute for competition in the fixed market, which is no more the case for the mobile market.","[Cambini, Carlo] Politecn Torino, Turin, Italy; [Ezzat, Riham] Cairo Univ, Fac Econ & Polit Sci, Cairo, Egypt; [Staropoli, Carine] Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France",Polytechnic University of Turin; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Cairo University; Paris School of Economics,"Staropoli, C (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France.",carlo.cambini@polito.it; Riham.ahmedezzat@gmail.com; carine.staropoli@univ-paris1.fr,,"CAMBINI, CARLO/0000-0002-7471-8133",,,,,40,1,1,0,1,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

As private firms do not have traded stock prices, we devise a methodology to obtain a public-firm equivalent distance-to-default by projection that references the distance-to-defaults of public firms with comparable attributes. The fitted model provides accurate multi-period forecasts of defaults, leading to both economically and statistically significant benefits over benchmark models.

In the short run, we find that a rise in the pollution tax has an ambiguous effect on the skilled-unskilled wage gap. However, the higher pollution tax can cause urban firms to exit in the long run. Capital is released to the rural sector and benefits the production of rural workers. These predictions are empirically validated. The higher pollution tax can yield a double dividend by not only reducing pollution emissions, but also mitigating skilled unskilled wage gap in the economy.","[Ee, Mong Shan] Deakin Univ, Fac Business & Law, Dept Finance, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Chao, Chi-Chur] Deakin Univ, Fac Business & Law, Dept Econ, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Liu, Xiangbo] Renmin Univ China, IMI, Sch Labor & Human Resources, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yu, Eden S.

Prepayment is defined as paying back a part of the mortgage on top of the contractual payment schedule, excluding refinancing. Because interest rates on savings have decreased while the rates on existing mortgages are generally fixed for some years, the value of prepaying a mortgage has increased. This corresponds with the surge in prepayments at the Dutch mortgage market. Using various econometric specifications, that take into account unobserved heterogeneity and endogeneity, the paper finds that incentives to prepay explain only a part of prepayment behavior. However, incentives to prepay explain a much larger part of prepayments for wealthier households and for households with a high net-of-tax interest rate differential.","[Groot, Stefan P.

Only about 25% of the social-democratic partisans wholeheartedly support environment protection policies, whereas 50% of the green partisans, who, in Germany, also belong to the political left, do so; and when controlling for sociocultural influences, social-democratic partisans become undistinguishable from Christian conservative and market-oriented partisans. Focusing on behavioral influences, we find that some of the respondents' psychological traits are not filtered through their political ideology but directly influence their proclaimed attitudes towards environment protection policies.

Yet we know little about how adolescents learn to navigate the financial world or how social class shapes this process. Drawing on interviews with 52 parents and adolescents in the United States, this study explored how children learn about finances from their parents. Middle-class parents in the sample were more proactive in teaching their children about finances. Working-class parents, however, often felt unequipped to teach financial skills and were more likely to shelter their children from financial matters. Ultimately, middle-class adolescents felt more at ease when navigating financial institutions, while working-class adolescents expressed greater uncertainty and were left to grapple with imperfect and sometimes contradictory information about finances.","[Luhr, Sigrid] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Sociol, 410 Barrows Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Luhr, S (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Sociol, 410 Barrows Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",sigridluhr@berkeley.edu,,"Luhr, Sigrid/0000-0003-2490-9254",Russell Sage Foundation [83-09-01],Russell Sage Foundation,This work was supported by the Russell Sage Foundation [Grant Number 83-09-01].,,65,23,32,0,16,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

This is a big problem, since the outages that the households experience are both frequent and long in duration. Efficient electricity infrastructure investment decisions are possible only if the welfare loss of electricity blackouts is determined. We estimate a measure for welfare analysis. We subject respondents to eight power outage scenarios. We use a random parameter panel Tobit model to account for both zero willingness to pay (WTP) and cross-sectional heterogeneity. In addition to exploring more scenarios, this study contributes as it extends basic analysis found in the literature by allowing for a proportion of the sample to have a zero WTP. A zero WTP is in many cases not unrealistic. The picture that emerges is that WTP increases with duration, which was expected. Overall, South African households place a significant value towards avoiding the interruption. The WTP values presented in this paper approximate the value of supply security. Improving reliability of supply to households requires significant and continuous investment in electricity infrastructure.","[Nkosi, Nomsa Phindile; Dikgang, Johane] Univ Johannesburg, Sch Econ, PEERC, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Johannesburg,"Dikgang, J (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, Sch Econ, PEERC, Johannesburg, South Africa.",phindilen@uj.ac.za; jdikgang@uj.ac.za,"Dikgang, Johane/ABB-7214-2021","Dikgang, Johane/0000-0002-8076-4443",National Research Foundation; University of Johannesburg Research Committee (URC); ERSA [727],National Research Foundation; University of Johannesburg Research Committee (URC); ERSA,"The paper has benefitted from input from Fredrik Carlsson, University of Gothenburg, Sweden.

Using data from the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) and Washington State during the Great Recession, we provide the first evidence about the impact of the layoff process on teacher productivity. In both sites we find that teachers impacted by the layoff process are less productive than those who do not face layoff-induced job threat. LAUSD teachers who are laid off and then rehired to return to the district are less productive in the two years following the layoff. Washington teachers who are given a reduction-in-force (RIF) notice and are then not laid off have reduced effectiveness in the year of the RIF. We argue that these results are likely driven by impacts of the layoff process on teachers' job commitment and present evidence to rule out alternate explanations.","[Strunk, Katharine O.] Michigan State Univ, Coll Educ, Educ Policy, 620 Farm Lane,Room 201D, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Strunk, Katharine O.] Michigan State Univ, Coll Educ, Educ Policy Innovat Collaborat, 620 Farm Lane,Room 201D, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Goldhaber, Dan; Brown, Nate] Univ Washington Bothell, Ctr Educ Data & Res, 3876 Bridge Way N,Suite 201, Seattle, WA 98103 USA; [Goldhaber, Dan] Amer Inst Res, Ctr Anal Longitudinal Data Educ Res, Washington, DC USA; [Knight, David S.] Univ Texas El Paso, Educ Leadership & Fdn, 500 W Univ Ave, El Paso, TX 79968 USA; [Knight, David S.] Univ Texas El Paso, Ctr Educ Res & Policy Studies, 500 W Univ Ave, El Paso, TX 79968 USA",Michigan State University; Michigan State University; University of Washington; University of Washington Bothell; American Institutes for Research; University of Texas System; University of Texas El Paso; University of Texas System; University of Texas El Paso,"Strunk, KO (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Coll Educ, Educ Policy, 620 Farm Lane,Room 201D, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.;Strunk, KO (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Coll Educ, Educ Policy Innovat Collaborat, 620 Farm Lane,Room 201D, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",kstrunk@msu.edu; dsknight@utep.edu; nathanael.brown12@gmail.com,,"Brown, Nate/0000-0001-8146-6483","Center for Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research (CALDER); Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education [R305C120008]; [2015DE-033]","Center for Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research (CALDER); Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education(US Department of Education);","The research presented here utilizes confidential data from the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) and Washington State.

To date, much of the empirical research on water governance and urban transformations has examined developed cities, with limited investigation of developing cities. This paper therefore aims to enrich current empirical insights regarding the evolution of, and key shifts within urban water governance in Bangladesh. Drawing on recent developments in sustainability transitions and urban water governance scholarship, the paper charts 250 years of water resource development in Bangladesh. Analysis of primary and secondary qualitative data sources revealed five major periods between 1757 and 2016 that represent key changes to governance approaches that underpinned sectoral changes. Although the shifts in governance approaches have cumulatively improved the adaptive capacity of Bangladesh's urban water system, they have not been framed to provide guidance and facilitation for driving on-ground change, which may be inhibiting a sustainable transformation of Bangladesh's urban water sector. Nevertheless, the insights do provide important foundations for informing the development of new governance models capable of dealing with multi-scale strategies for supporting a sustainability transformation.

While existing studies tend to focus on the individual effects on growth of each innovation activity, we stress that firms adopt heterogeneous innovation strategies, choosing to perform different combinations of the basic innovation activities. We directly address the empirical question as to whether jointly performing two basic innovation activities boosts sales growth above and beyond the separate contribution of each innovation activity when performed individually. Exploiting a panel of Spanish manufacturing firms observed between 2004 and 2011, we document instances of super-modularity of the growth function, and reveal the presence of complementarities between internal R&D and product innovation, and between product and process innovations. As such, the combination of these three basic innovation activities appears to be the most effective strategy for sustaining growth and market shares, while external sourcing does not appear to make any systematic contribution.","[Bianchini, Stefano] Univ Strasbourg, BETA, F-67000 Strasbourg, France; [Pellegrino, Gabriele] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Tamagni, Federico] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Econ, I-56127 Pisa, Italy",Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna,"Tamagni, F (通讯作者)，Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Econ, I-56127 Pisa, Italy.",s.bianchini@unistra.fr; gabriele.pellegrino@epfl.ch; f.tamagni@sssup.it,"Tamagni, Federico/AAF-3143-2020","Tamagni, Federico/0000-0001-6476-6388",,,,,73,30,30,0,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Yet, little distinction is made regarding the type of entrepreneurship, particularly innovative versus non-innovative entrepreneurship. We shall argue that start-up costs and taxes are associated in different ways with innovative versus non-innovative entrepreneurship. Taxes being recurring costs should mainly relate to innovative entrepreneurship, whereas start-up costs being one-off costs should mainly relate to non-innovative entrepreneurship. Analyzing a dataset of 632,116 individuals, including 43,223 entrepreneurs from 53 countries, we can partially confirm our predictions. Corporate taxes show a negative relationship with innovative entrepreneurship, whereas income taxes seem to have no relationship. High start-up costs have a positive relationship with innovative entrepreneurship, although this finding only holds true in cross-sectional investigations.

However, as net gains are often uncertain, irreversible land development may later be regretted. To better inform conservation policies, we use a real options framework to model irreversible forest conversion under uncertain conservation benefits and determine the associated optimal long-run average rate of deforestation. We then analyze the impact of the demand for agricultural products on the rate of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. In a scenario analysis for the nine states of the Brazilian Amazon, we calculate: (i) the expected time for exhaustion of the current forest stock; and (ii) the potential forest coverage for the next 20, 100 and 200 years. Our results suggest that if forest benefits grow over time at a sufficiently high speed, they may significantly slow down deforestation. In contrast, the higher their volatility, the faster deforestation proceeds.","[Di Corato, Luca] Univ Bari, Dipartimento Jonico, Taranto, Italy; [Moretto, Michele] Univ Padua, Dept Econ, Ctr Studi Levi Cases, Padua, Italy; [Vergalli, Sergio] Univ Brescia, Dept Econ & Management, Brescia, Italy",Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro; University of Padua; University of Brescia,"Vergalli, S (通讯作者)，Univ Brescia, Dept Econ & Management, Brescia, Italy.",sergio.vergalli@unibs.it,"Sergio, Vergalli/U-5327-2019","VERGALLI, Sergio/0000-0003-2279-5011; Di Corato, Luca/0000-0002-1023-9504; MORETTO, MICHELE/0000-0002-5892-8165",University of Padova [BIRD 173594],University of Padova,"The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the University of Padova, grant BIRD 173594.",,28,2,2,0,20,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

In this paper, we describe the evolution of this market in the UK. Using an inductive qualitative longitudinal research design, we analyse the emerging views of entrepreneurs and investors towards ECF. Our interviewees include large and small-scale investors, as well as market participants who have chosen not to invest or raise funds via ECF. We find that the large financial flows to entrepreneurs in the UK via the ECF platforms, nearly half a billion GBP since 2011, have probably been largely incremental to traditional sources of early stage entrepreneurial finance. Moreover, our research indicates that for the most part, investors appear to understand and appropriately evaluate the risks that they are bearing; ECF investments are perceived as a high risk, high return component within individuals' portfolios. Investors also use their communication with peers and entrepreneurs via the ECF platform as a learning tool. On the entrepreneurs' side, ECF allows them to test their products, to develop their brand, to build a loyal customer base and to turn customers into investors. We conclude that policymakers, with the support of a locally appropriate regulatory framework, could support equity crowdfunding as one of the market choices available for entrepreneurs looking to start or grow their ventures.","[Estrin, Saul; Khavul, Susanna] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Gozman, Daniel] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Gozman, Daniel] Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, Whiteknights Reading, England; [Khavul, Susanna] San Jose State Univ, Lucas Coll, San Jose, CA 95192 USA; [Khavul, Susanna] San Jose State Univ, Grad Sch Business, San Jose, CA 95192 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Sydney; University of Reading; California State University System; San Jose State University; California State University System; San Jose State University,"Estrin, S (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",s.estrin@lse.ac.uk; daniel.gozman@gmail.com; susanna.khavul@sjsu.edu,"Gozman, Daniel/JDC-4259-2023; estrin, saul/AAC-7000-2020","Gozman, Daniel/0000-0002-7399-9201; estrin, saul/0000-0002-3447-8593",EU Horizon 2020 programme [649378]; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI,EU Horizon 2020 programme(Horizon 2020); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge the research assistance from Lolo Chen, Linde de Nie, Mary Fox, Ioanna Gouseti, Andrea Guerini-Rocco, Ines Steimelweger and Dustin Voss.

Using within-individual level variation, we find that trust does not change meaningfully following a positive financial shock (e.g., winning the lottery or receiving an inheritance). However, trust falls sharply following a negative financial shock (e.g., bankruptcy). In terms of magnitude, this effect is approximately equivalent to the effect observed after one reports being the victim of physical violence or a property crime, but significantly larger than effects from a range of other individual-level shocks (e.g., being fired or getting divorced). We then explore locus of control, which relates to the extent to which people believe they are in control of their circumstances, as a potential explanation for our core results. Indeed, we find evidence consistent with this hypothesis as locus of control tends to change, and become less internal, following a negative financial shock. In turn, locus of control is closely associated with interpersonal trust levels.","[Jetter, Michael; Kristoffersen, Ingebjorg] Univ Western Australia, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Jetter, Michael] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Jetter, Michael] CESifo, Munich, Germany",University of Western Australia; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Ifo Institut,"Jetter, M (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",mjetter7@gmail.com; inga.kristoffersen@uwa.edu.au,"Baldissera, Annalisa/AHD-6334-2022","Jetter, Michael/0000-0001-7967-5200",Australian Government Department of Social Services (DSS),Australian Government Department of Social Services (DSS)(Australian Government),"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.

A tax subsidy helps explain this disparity.

The subsidy for OIP bonds explains additional, previously undocumented empirical facts. In a calibration exercise, the subsidy's expected cost to the U.S. Treasury is estimated at $1.7 billion per year. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We focus on asset confiscation in relation to alleged connections of their owners with organized crime, a highly debated policy measure against organized crime. Extending work on institutions and regional entrepreneurship, we propose that confiscation has contrasting effects on regional entries. On the one hand, confiscation of economic assets associated with criminal organizations' legitimate activities in a region reduces competition and triggers renewal, fostering new entries. On the other hand, seizure of criminal organizations' operational assets weakens their ability to exercise sovereignty, creating an institutional vacuum that lowers founding rates. Our results, based on a longitudinal study of Italian provinces between 2009 and 2013, provide support for both hypotheses. We also find that the negative effect associated with the confiscation of operational assets is mitigated when local governments have policies facilitating asset redeployment.","[Operti, Etisa] ESSEC Business Sch Paris, 3 Av B Hirsch, F-95021 Cergy Pontoise, France",ESSEC Business School,"Operti, E (通讯作者)，ESSEC Business Sch Paris, 3 Av B Hirsch, F-95021 Cergy Pontoise, France.",operti@essec.edu,,,,,,,63,13,15,3,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Based on a simple theoretical model, we give conditions under which the Aggregation Dilemma is expected to play a role in climate change cost-benefit analysis. We then study the importance of the Aggregation Dilemma with the integrated assessment model RICE [Nordhaus and Boyer, (2000) Warning the World: Economic Models of Global Warming. MA: MIT Press]. Aggregating all regions of the RICE-99 model into one region yields a 40% lower social cost of carbon than the RICE model itself predicts. Based on extrapolating the results, a country-level integrated assessment model would give a more than eight times higher social cost of carbon compared to a fully aggregated model. We suggest that these tentative results require researchers to rethink the aggregation level used in integrated assessment models and to develop models at much lower levels of aggregation than currently available.","[Schumacher, Ingmar] IPAG Business Sch, 184 Blvd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France",IPAG Business School,"Schumacher, I (通讯作者)，IPAG Business Sch, 184 Blvd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France.",ingmar.schumacher@ipag.fr,,"Schumacher, Ingmar/0000-0003-2339-982X",,,,,43,5,6,3,16,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2010-0078,2010-0086,,CLIM CHANG ECON,Clim.

However, the current structure of imported goods from the Baltic States to China is different from the results of complementarity analysis.

Existing econometric studies are not able to separately identify the impacts of heat and water stress because higher temperatures cause damages through both mechanisms. To resolve the identification problem, I introduce measures of water deficit and water surplus into a regression analysis that estimates the nonlinear impacts of heat and water stress on nonirrigated rental rates in the central United States. The results indicate rental rate losses of 33% ($9.5 billion annually) by mid-century due to climate change in scenario RCP 4.5. I find that 65% of the projected damages are due to heat stress, 32% due to increasing water deficit, and 3% due to increasing water surplus.

These well-off peasants originated from when the colonization frontier was open in the 13th and 14th centuries, but had been defeated when three peasant-plebeian revolts were crushed. Afterwards, Mallorca followed a latifundist transition towards agrarian capitalism similar to southern Italy or Spain, in sharp contrast with the middle-peasant paths seen in Catalonia or Valencia. The land rent rose, while agricultural wages fell from 1659 to 1800. Peasant families could not survive, and had to supplement wages with the products of their own plots. This set a socio-agroecological limit to growth in this agrarian class structure. The agrarian crisis at the end of the 19th century bankrupted the Mallorcan nobility. Bankers bought much of the land and sold it on as small allotments. This expanded the intensive cropping formerly limited to agro-town belts, giving rise to a new peasantization. Despite their subordination, Mallorcan peasants had survived and created complex agroecological landscapes endowed with a rich biocultural heritage.","[Tello, Enric; Soto, Ricard] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ Hist Inst Policy & World Econ, Diagonal Ave 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Jover, Gabriel] Univ Girona, Dept Econ, Montilivi Campus, Girona 17003, Spain; [Murray, Ivan] Univ Balearic Isl, Dept Geog, Valldemossa Rd Km 7-5, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Spain; [Fullana, Onofre] Univ Balearic Isl, Palma De Mallorca, Spain; [Fullana, Onofre] Organ Farming Assoc Mallorca APAEMA, Palma De Mallorca, Spain",University of Barcelona; Universitat de Girona; Universitat de les Illes Balears; Universitat de les Illes Balears,"Tello, E (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ Hist Inst Policy & World Econ, Diagonal Ave 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",tello@ub.edu,"Murray, Ivan/H-6747-2015; Tello, Enric/M-2843-2014","Murray, Ivan/0000-0001-6594-8423; Soto Company, Ricard/0000-0002-1808-9686; JOVER AVELLA, GABRIEL/0000-0002-6430-2329; Fullana, Nofre/0000-0003-3344-7610; Tello, Enric/0000-0002-4970-1524","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [SSHRC 895-2011-1020]; Secretaria de Estado de Investigacion, Desarrollo e Innovacion [HAR2015-69620-C2-1-P]","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Secretaria de Estado de Investigacion, Desarrollo e Innovacion","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, Grant/Award Number: Partnership Grant SSHRC 895-2011-1020; Secretaria de Estado de Investigacion, Desarrollo e Innovacion, Grant/Award Number: HAR2015-69620-C2-1-P",,258,13,14,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Transmission of shocks to the real economy through changes in the supply of credit, however, played an important role in the recent U.S. financial crisis. This paper explores the extent to which policymakers should consider changes in the supply of credit when making forecasts and monetary policy decisions. More specifically, it considers whether a measure of real credit balances offers consistent and stable information, beyond that of a real interest rate and real money balances, about future output gaps during the U.S. post-war era. Results yield evidence that changes in real credit balances are the only variable, among those considered, to provide consistent and stable information about future output gaps over the entire sample period. Each information variable, however, provides relatively little value added for forecasting future output gaps, beyond a simple autoregressive model. To improve upon forecasts and monetary policy decisions, policymakers therefore should consider a broader range of information variables and occasionally reassess the relative weightings assigned to each.","[Wojnilower, Joshua] Int Monetary Fund, Independent Evaluat Off, 1900 Penn Ave NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Wojnilower, J (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Independent Evaluat Off, 1900 Penn Ave NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",jwojnilower@imf.org,,,,,,,46,2,2,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1062-9408,1879-0860,,N AM J ECON FINANC,N.

Religiosity is associated with lower risk-taking for public banks, but the unique features of private banks may result in a different effect for private banks. We find religiosity is associated with greater asset risk-taking. At the same time, however, religiosity, is negatively associated with solvency risk and return on asset (ROA) volatility and is associated with higher ROAs and fewer failures. We reconcile these results by finding banks in areas with higher religiosity recognize larger fees from providing additional banking services, likely due to relationships formed from more risky lending. As a result, these banks are more (less) likely to realize extreme positive (negative) performance. We also find religiosity is associated with lower earnings management and increased conservatism. Collectively, our results confirm private banks are unique and religiosity can have a significant, and nuanced, effect on bank outcomes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, I examine whether and how FISP has affected dietary diversity in household food consumption and child nutrition. I find that children under the age of five living in households that received a voucher between 2008 and 2013 for the purchase of fertilizer have a statistically significantly higher (at the 1% level) weight-for-age, weight-for-length/height and body mass index than children living in non-recipient households. I also find that households having received a voucher consume cereals, nuts, vegetables, meats and fruits more frequently than non-recipient households. The analysis uses two stage least squares to account for the endogeneity of selection into the fertilizer subsidy program. I test the robustness of these results using child fixed effects. The results indicate that past studies evaluating FISP failing to account for the positive gains in child nutrition and household food consumption diversity may be underestimating its benefits.

Considering China's tendency to maintain control over development projects throughout the entire implementation phase, using Chinese contractors for work performed in the recipient countries, the present paper investigates whether China impacts African labour practices in their capacity as a donor. Specifically, we use a new data material allowing for systematic quantitative analysis of Chinese development finance to investigate whether Chinese development projects affect trade union involvement. Matching geo-referenced data on the subnational allocation of Chinese development projects to Africa over the 2000-2012 period with 41,902 survey respondents across 18 African countries, our estimation strategy relies on comparing the trade union involvement of individuals who live near a site where a Chinese project is being implemented at the time of the interview to those of individuals living near a site where a Chinese project will appear in the future, but where implementation had yet to be initiated at the time of the survey. The results consistently indicate that Chinese development projects - unlike the projects of other major donors - discourage trade union involvement in the local area. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

To address hauliers' poor access management at seaport terminals, five access management services provided by different seaport terminals worldwide were identified as part of an ongoing conversation about such services. This paper offers new insights to both scholars and practitioners by differentiating the services according to the elements of turnaround time, access reliability, access precision and access flexibility, characteristics of which were identified during a review of relevant literature. The potential impacts of the elements for each access management service were investigated during empirical studies involving six semi-structured interviews and two workshops with participants (i.e. two hauliers and a seaport terminal). The chief finding is that access management services able to exchange information in real time have greater potential to improve access management for road hauliers.","[Jacobsson, Stefan; Arnas, Per Olof; Stefansson, Gunnar] Chalmers Univ Technol, Technol Management & Econ, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Stefansson, Gunnar] Univ Iceland, Sch Engn & Nat Sci, IS-107 Reykjavik, Iceland",Chalmers University of Technology; University of Iceland,"Jacobsson, S (通讯作者)，Chalmers Univ Technol, Technol Management & Econ, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden.",stefan.jacobsson@chalmers.se; per-olof.arnas@chalmers.se; gunnar.stefansson@chalmers.se,"Stefansson, Gunnar/A-2209-2008; Stefansson, Gunnar/AAV-9432-2020; /B-5901-2016","Stefansson, Gunnar/0000-0002-2693-9142; Stefansson, Gunnar/0000-0002-2693-9142; /0000-0002-6835-8741",Swedish research funding agency (VINNOVA) [2016-05436]; Swedish Logistics and Transport Foundation (LTS) [857203-9785]; Vinnova [2016-05436] Funding Source: Vinnova,Swedish research funding agency (VINNOVA); Swedish Logistics and Transport Foundation (LTS); Vinnova(Vinnova),The authors wish to thank the anonymous reviewers for their valuable suggestions and comments and both the Swedish research funding agency (2016-05436) (VINNOVA) and the Swedish Logistics and Transport Foundation (857203-9785) (LTS) for their financial support.,,61,4,6,3,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Our arguments are based on the efficiency gains and potential flexibility losses associated with formalizing managerial practices in SMEs. We propose that the developmental stage of the firm may influence this trade-off.

Evidence from the U.S. shows firms making large equity issues when stock prices are high for the purpose of building precautionary cash savings. We confirm this U.S. evidence, and find these effects internationally in countries like the U.S. where external finance is more accessible. In these countries, the relation between precautionary motives and cash savings disappears if the proceeds from net equity issues are removed from cash.

Past studies have suggested several mechanisms such as rising information costs or preference changes to explain the shift away from financial risk. However, these narratives appear to be at odds with the evidence that some domains of cognitive functions improve with age, and many individuals are not cognizant of their intellectual decline. Using data from the Health and Retirement Study, this study examines whether or not cognitive decline leads to a safer portfolio choice and how much can be attributed to causal. Our empirical analysis develops an instrumental variable approach that exploits seasonal variation in cognition triggered by a seasonal affective disorder. While the fixed effects estimates show strong positive correlations between cognition and stock ownership, these estimates lose significance in the instrumental variable models. Our findings suggest that cognitive function is not a major determinant of portfolio riskiness.","[Pak, Tae-Young] Univ Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Pak, TY (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",tpak@ches.ua.edu; pbabiarz@uga.edu,"Pak, Tae-Young/HZJ-0213-2023","Pak, Tae-Young/0000-0003-2380-7256; Babiarz, Patryk/0000-0003-2506-381X",,,,,70,12,13,2,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0167-4870,1872-7719,,J ECON PSYCHOL,J.

In this work we shed a new and fundamental light on optimal estimation procedures of risk measures in terms of bias. We show that once the parameters of a model need to be estimated, one has to take additional care when estimating risks. The typical plug-in approach, for example, introduces a bias which leads to a systematic underestimation of risk. In this regard, we introduce a novel notion of unbiasedness to the estimation of risk which is motivated by economic principles. In general, the proposed concept does not coincide with the well-known statistical notion of unbiasedness. We show that an appropriate bias correction is available for many well-known estimators. In particular, we consider value-at-risk and expected shortfall (tail value-at-risk). In the special case of normal distributions, closed-formed solutions for unbiased estimators can be obtained. We present a number of motivating examples which show the outperformance of unbiased estimators in many circumstances. The unbiasedness has a direct impact on backtesting and therefore adds a further viewpoint to established statistical properties. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Despite theoretical arguments for the influence of emotions, research on susceptibility to this bias, on real investors, has relied primarily on socio-demographic explanations. Some experimental research on student populations has considered emotions more directly, but has not addressed differences in individual susceptibility and has not examined genuinely consequential investor behaviour in real markets. Our research addresses this gap by predicting susceptibility to the disposition effect based on investors' reliance on intuitive (emotion mediated) cognition (System 1), analytical cognition (System 2) and the strategies they use to regulate their emotions. Using investors' trading records from a UK sample, we measure their susceptibility to the disposition effect and assess, through a questionnaire, their reliance on Systems 1 and 2 cognitive processes and use of two emotion regulation strategies. Investors with higher reliance on System 1 processes have greater disposition effect, but reliance on System 2 processes is not related to the disposition effect. Investor reliance on reappraisal (an emotion regulation strategy of changing a situation's meaning to alter its emotional impact) reduces their disposition effect. However, the use of expressive suppression (a strategy that inhibits emotion expressive behaviour) does not show a statistically significant relationship with this bias. These results suggest that investors' intuitive emotional reactions explain susceptibility to bias, and that effective strategies of regulating emotions enable this bias to be overcome.

Instead, they may make choice on the basis of team preferences and/or as participants in a mutually beneficial practice. This paper reflects on the way to account for the rationality of endorsing team reasoning in a strategic decision problem. I focus on the particular issue of the rationality of making choice on the basis of team reasoning rather than other reasoning modes. I argue that the endorsement of team reasoning in specific contexts can be interpreted as a commitment that can be rationally assessed from an agent-subjective perspective. This necessitates making a distinction between preferences, conceived as individual interests, and values, defined as broader motivations and reasons to act. I suggest that this account of the rationality of team reasoning has significant normative implications, in particular regarding the relevance of standard welfare economics.","[Hedoin, Cyril] Univ Reims Champagne Ardennes, Reims, France",Universite de Reims Champagne-Ardenne,"Hédoin, C (通讯作者)，Univ Reims Champagne Ardennes, Reims, France.",cyril.hedoin@univ-reims.fr,"Hédoin, Cyril/AAL-8244-2021","Hédoin, Cyril/0000-0002-5358-7111",,,,,30,0,0,0,0,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

We show that a tariff determined by the current level of accumulated pollution can induce the time path of emissions optimal for the downstream (polluted) country. But if the upstream (polluting) country can lobby the downstream government to impose lower tariffs, distortions brought by corruption and foreign lobbying lead to a rise in the upstream country's social welfare, and to a decrease in social welfare in the downstream country. Thus, the usefulness of trade policy as a tool for encouraging cooperation and internalizing transboundary externalities depends critically on the degree of governments' susceptibility to foreign political influence.","[Mason, Charles F.; Barbier, Edward B.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Mason, Charles F.] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst, London, England; [Umanskaya, Victoria I.] Occidental Coll, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90041 USA",University of Wyoming; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Occidental College,"Mason, CF (通讯作者)，Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.;Mason, CF (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst, London, England.",bambuzlr@uwyo.edu,"Mason, Charles/H-9162-2019","Mason, Charles/0000-0002-9846-0173",,,,,44,6,6,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Thus, firms had a strong incentive to use offset certificates. However, a considerable number of firms did not exhaust their offset quota and, by doing so, seemingly forwent profits. While most literature on emissions trading evaluates the efficiency of regulation in a frictionless world, in practice firms incur costs when complying with regulation. In order to assess the relevance of trade-related fixed transaction costs, this study examines the use of international offset credits in the EU ETS. It establishes a model of firm decision under fixed (quantity-invariant) entry costs and estimates the size of such costs rationalizing firm behavior using semi-parametric binary quantile regressions. Comparing binary quantile results with probit estimates shows that high average transaction costs result from a strongly skewed underlying distribution. For most firms, the bulk of transaction costs stems from certificate trading in general, rather than additional participation in offset trading.","[Naegele, Helene] DIW Berlin, Competit & Consumers, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Naegele, H (通讯作者)，DIW Berlin, Competit & Consumers, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",hnaegele@diw.de,"Naegele, Helene/GLT-9369-2022","Naegele, Helene/0000-0002-9814-2909",DIW Graduate Center,DIW Graduate Center,"The author would like to thank Aleksandar Zaklan, Christian von Hirschhausen, Bernd Fitzenberger, two anonymous referees and the editor for their valuable comments, as well as participants to the Annual Congress of the European Economic Association (Mannheim, 2015), of the European Association for Research in Industrial Economics (Munchen, 2015), of the International Society for New Institutional Economics (Cambridge, USA, 2015), of the European Association of Environmental and Resource Economists (Helsinki, 2015), to the International Workshop on Empirical Methods in Energy Economics (College Park, USA, 2015) and to the DIW seminar.

Using trade-by-trade data, the paper analyzes several trading characteristics including trading volume, trade size, volatility, bid-ask spread, and relative information share. On average, NYMEX is characterized by greater volume, trade size and slightly greater spread. Before the crisis, NYMEX leads the process of price discovery, and volatility and trade size are significant factors explaining this leadership. However, following the financial crisis of 2008, the leadership role of NYMEX declines and trade size and volatility are no longer significant factors. Contrary to results of most equity market research, bid-ask spread is not a significant factor in information share and causality tests indicate that causality runs from spread to information share before the crisis but the opposite holds during the crisis period.","[Adeinat, Iman] King Abdulaziz Univ, Dept Business Adm, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; [Al Rahahleh, Naseem] King Abdulaziz Univ, Dept Finance, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; [Wei, Peihwang] Providence Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung, Taiwan",King Abdulaziz University; King Abdulaziz University; Providence University - Taiwan,"Adeinat, I (通讯作者)，King Abdulaziz Univ, Dept Business Adm, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.",iadeinat@kau.edu.sa; nalrahahleh@kau.edu.sa; peihwangw@gmail.com,"Rahahleh, Naseem Al/B-5955-2015; Adeinat, Iman/AAT-8330-2021; Adeinat, Iman/M-3088-2015","Adeinat, Iman/0000-0001-8482-2009",,,,,35,1,2,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1380-6645,1573-7144,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

However, the relationship between gender and employment growth-a dimension of entrepreneurial performance-still remains unexplored to a large degree. This paper contributes to the empirical literature on gender and entrepreneurial performance in several ways. First, it examines the role played by both innovation and gender ownership as determinants of employment growth rates of young, knowledge-intensive entrepreneurial (KIE) firms. Second, it investigates the indirect impact of contributing factors-such as the characteristics of the market, knowledge-based capital, and human capital-on employment growth. And third, it relies on a rich new cross-sectional data set on young, KIE firms across European Union (EU) countries.

Recent studies have found a link between the presence of cycling infrastructures and gentrification. Few studies have however examined the growth of the cycling networks from the perspective of environmental equity. The main objective of this study is to determine whether the extension of the cycling network in the urban areas of Montreal and Longueuil and the city of Laval over a quarter of a century (1991 to 2016) has reduced or reinforced inequities in accessibility for low-income populations, recent immigrants, children, and older people. Archival maps were employed to reconstruct the cycling networks in the Montreal area in a GIS for six years (1991, 1996, 2001, 2006, 2011, 2016). Census data and spatial analysis methods were then used to measure whether or not inequities in the accessibility of the cycling network increased over the period in question. The results show that, in 25 years, the cycling network has more than doubled in size. It can however be seen that some areas are still very poorly served, and that the network lacks connectivity. Low-income individuals have generally enjoyed good accessibility over the entire period. A strong decrease in inaccessibility for recent immigrants and seniors is also observed. The most important result is clearly that there has been little or no improvement for children, who are found to be in a situation of inequity.","[Houde, Maxime; Apparicio, Philippe; Seguin, Anne-Marie] Inst Natl Rech Sci, Ctr Urbanisat Culture Soc, 385 Sherbrooke St East, Montreal, PQ H2X 1E3, Canada",University of Quebec; Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS),"Houde, M (通讯作者)，Inst Natl Rech Sci, Ctr Urbanisat Culture Soc, 385 Sherbrooke St East, Montreal, PQ H2X 1E3, Canada.",Maxime.houde@ucs.inrs.ca,"Apparicio, Philippe/K-6086-2013","Apparicio, Philippe/0000-0001-6466-9342",Canada Research Chair in Environmental Equity [950-230813]; SSHRC [435-2014-1999],Canada Research Chair in Environmental Equity; SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),The authors would like to thank the three anonymous reviewers for their careful reading of our manuscript and their many insightful comments and suggestions.

Based on household survey data from a large sample in rural China, the present article adopts a panel approach to estimate the potential benefits of long-run adaptation and to identify the determinants of farmers' adaptive capacity. The empirical results suggest that, for various model settings and climate change scenarios, long-run adaptations should mitigate one-third to one-half of the damages of warming on crop profits by the end of this century. These findings support the basic argument of the hedonic approach that omitting long-run adaptations will dramatically overestimate the potential damage of climate change. The paper also finds that household-level capital intensity and farmland size have significant effects on farmers' adaptive capacities.","[Huang, Kaixing] Nankai Univ, Sch Econ, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Huang, Kaixing] Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Wang, Jinxia; Huang, Jikun] Peking Univ, China Ctr Agr Policy, Sch Adv Agr Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Findlay, Christopher] Univ Adelaide, Fac Profess, Adelaide, SA, Australia",Nankai University; University of Adelaide; Peking University; University of Adelaide,"Huang, JK (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, China Ctr Agr Policy, Sch Adv Agr Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jkhuang.ccap@pku.edu.cn,"jiang, lei/IWE-1124-2023; Jiang, Tao/IWM-7503-2023; wei, xiao/ISB-6027-2023",,"National Natural Sciences Foundation in China [71333013, 71161140351]; Ministry of Science and Technology in China [2012CB955700]; Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research [ADP/2011/039]; Collaborative Innovation Center for China Economy [CICCE/2017/09]","National Natural Sciences Foundation in China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Science and Technology in China(Ministry of Science and Technology, China); Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research; Collaborative Innovation Center for China Economy","The authors wish to thank the Ministry of Science and Technology in China (2012CB955700), National Natural Sciences Foundation in China (71161140351 and 71333013), Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ADP/2011/039), and the Collaborative Innovation Center for China Economy (CICCE/2017/09) for funding.

Our setting considers options with a callback feature, namely, callable bull/bear contracts (CBBCs). Such contracts have high skewness when close to callback and thus appeal to cumulative prospect theory preferences. CBBCs with high skewness earn negative average returns, and issuers' gross profits vary positively with CBBC skewness. Over the 2009-2014 period, issuers earn gross profits of about $1.67 billion by trading CBBCs on the Hang Seng Index. These findings highlight the role of behavioral finance in financial innovation.

Using approximately 322,433 residential sales from over 1,300 different U.S. counties over 2012-2015, we find that price spreads for quality differences tend to be lower when market conditions are strong. However, when market conditions weaken, the price changes are relatively larger on the highest quality property condition segment. Lastly, we find that the marginal benefit of including property condition when age is known is worthwhile if the subject property is unusual for the neighborhood. Based on these results, valuation models might be improved slightly with additional information on property condition, especially if a property is in much better or worse condition than is typical for the comparable sales in the neighborhood.","[Miller, Norm] Univ San Diego, San Diego, CA 92110 USA; [Sah, Vivek] Univ Nevada, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA; [Sklarz, Michael] Collateral Analyt, Honolulu, HI 96816 USA",University of San Diego; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Las Vegas,"Miller, N (通讯作者)，Univ San Diego, San Diego, CA 92110 USA.",nmiller@sandiego.edu; vivek.sah@unlv.edu; msklarz@collateralanalytics.com,,,,,,,34,9,11,1,14,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0896-5803,2691-1175,,J REAL ESTATE RES,J.

The redistributive effect of quotas is subject to debate, and their ultimate target is discrimination. To identify the effect of electoral quotas, I take advantage of their rotation across space and over time in India. To proxy discrimination, I use a measure of caste-based exclusion from a public infrastructure (namely, streets). In 2006, 44.5% household members of the marginalized castes labeled Scheduled Castes (SC) still suffered from caste-based exclusions. I document that ongoing SC quotas reduce the likelihood of caste-based exclusion for members of the SCs by about one fifth. The results also imply that the effect is not persistent: it disappears with the end of the SC quota. From a policy-maker's perspective, these results are mixed since electoral quotas do affect everyday discrimination, even if the effect does not last. These results are consistent with a temporary change in the behavior of members of the dominant castes after a one-shot electoral quota. These results are inconsistent with either a change in the stereotypes held by members of the dominant castes, or a change in the aspirations of members of the lower castes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Existing post offices that were bypassed by the railroad at between 5 and 10 km were 20 to 50 percentage points less likely to remain in operation until 2010 than control post offices over 50 km from the railroad. Given the historically close correspondence between the location of post offices and the location of towns, these results provide evidence that the railroads generated an agglomeration shadow - towns that were almost connected to the railroad were more likely to decline than those that remained isolated. I show that the short distances over which the forces of agglomeration act in this setting mean that it is difficult to detect the agglomerative effects of railroad construction using alternative methodologies based on census population data.","[Hodgson, Charles] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, 579 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Hodgson, C (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, 579 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",chodgson@stanford.edu,,,,,,,48,29,31,1,28,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0094-1190,1095-9068,,J URBAN ECON,J.

The strong linkages to food security and the environment place biomass energy at the heart of sustainable development, a fact that is largely ignored by policy makers in favor of modem energy. At the same time, population and GDP growth are exacerbating already existing supply-demand imbalances in highly populated countries such as Malawi. These trends make it imperative to identify policy interventions that promote sustainable biomass energy while simultaneously considering linkages with other sectors. We use new data on demand and supply for biomass energy in Malawi and develop a model that estimates fuelwood demand based on actual diets and project demand in future years. We simulate how demand side interventions in the form of improved cookstoves affect biomass demand and built a behavioral model to analyze the potential of agroforestry for promoting a sustainable biomass energy sector in Malawi. Our findings show that policy measures aimed at increasing cooking efficiency are not enough to decrease demand for cooking energy due to high population growth. Supply side interventions like agroforestry on the other hand will not only increase sustainable supply, but can also enhance food security and protect the environment. We find that biomass energy can be inherently sustainable and should be an integral part of every energy sector strategy in developing countries as well as of the Sustainable Development Goals.

Recent empirical studies suggest that adverse shocks a key driver of poverty can trigger substantial changes in the risk attitudes of poor people, leading to decisions that perpetuate their lives in poverty. Although the temporal variability of risk attitudes is a controversial topic, the literature advocating the temporal variability of risk attitudes suggests that covariate shocks, such as natural disasters, alter risk attitudes over time, whereas idiosyncratic shocks show no such significant impact. This paper aims to test the temporal stability of risk attitudes in rural households in Thailand and Vietnam to determine whether this pattern covariate shocks that affect risk attitudes and idiosyncratic shocks that do not can be confirmed for these households. I use an exogenous measure of shocks to explain temporal variation in risk attitudes. Thus, I estimate variation in consumption using a multilevel model in which variation in consumption at the individual level serves as a proxy for idiosyncratic shocks, while variation in consumption at the aggregate level is used to measure covariate shocks. My study finds temporal variability in risk attitudes that is driven by covariate shocks in Vietnam and in contrast to past research by idiosyncratic shocks in Thailand. The results suggest that Vietnamese respondents may be better in insuring idiosyncratic risks for example through safety nets, while mutual insurance across individuals does not seem to work well in Thailand. In addition, results indicate that the mutual insurance problem in Thailand seems to increase in wealth. The differences that I find between Thailand and Vietnam and across poverty types correspond to the difference in political systems and consequently the focus of socio-political measures. Thailand's recent political volatility and the growing lack of social cohesion in Thai society support these findings. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

As case studies we focus on two of the most intensely redeveloping areas in Santiago, the Estacion Central municipality in inner Santiago which experiences rapid high-rise property-led redevelopment, and the peri-urban growth zone of Chicureo in the municipality of Colina. From the perspective of urban political economy and using mobility-related questionnaires, in-depth interviews with inhabitants and media analysis we detect important differences between inner-city and peri-urban dynamics. While the redeveloping inner area of Santiago, in spite of being an exclusionary space where lower income-oriented affordable housing is absent, is not a disputed space in terms of access to mobility means, the expanding fringes of the city show strong class-related differences among new and old inhabitants. It seems that with view to mobility opportunities urban neoliberalism has variegated geographies that at the same time might show temporarily positive (Estacion Central) and very negative results (Chicureo). In terms of public policy these results indicate that the inner area of Santiago is an opportunity for locating social housing production, given the relatively equal access to mobility opportunity for the different income groups. In the meanwhile, the deepening of mobility-related inequalities on the urban peripheries is highly problematic and needs more scholarly and political attention.","[Lukas, Michael] Univ Chile, Fac Architecture & Urbanism, Dept Geog, Portugal 84, Santiago, Chile; [Lopez-Morales, Ernesto] Univ Chile, Fac Architecture & Urbanism, Dept Urbanism, Portugal 84, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Chile; Universidad de Chile,"Lukas, M (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Fac Architecture & Urbanism, Dept Geog, Portugal 84, Santiago, Chile.",mlukas@uchilefau.cl; elopez@uchilefau.cl,"Lukas, Michael/I-4079-2016","Lukas, Michael/0000-0001-5749-5073; Lopez-Morales, Ernesto/0000-0003-2878-7143",CONTESTED_CITIES - Contested Spatialities of Urban Neoliberalism: Dialogues between Emerging Spaces of Citizenship in Europe and Latin America project - European Union Marie-Curie Action Programs [PIRSES-GA-2012-318944]; Fondecyt Project [1151287],CONTESTED_CITIES - Contested Spatialities of Urban Neoliberalism: Dialogues between Emerging Spaces of Citizenship in Europe and Latin America project - European Union Marie-Curie Action Programs(European Union (EU)); Fondecyt Project(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT),"Part of the research for this paper was funded by the CONTESTED_CITIES - Contested Spatialities of Urban Neoliberalism: Dialogues between Emerging Spaces of Citizenship in Europe and Latin America project, financed by the European Union Marie-Curie Action Programs (Grant Agreement: PIRSES-GA-2012-318944).

The paper further establishes the nexus between land ownership and outputs from homestead food garden programmes. The data was obtained from 500 maize-producing households. The findings demonstrate that participation in homestead food garden programmes could significantly enhance the welfare of rural households by increasing their yield and net returns. Participation in the programme increased maize yield and net returns by 43.37 per cent and 22.01 per cent respectively. Cultivating more than one hectare of farmland enhanced the outcome of participation in a homestead food garden programme more relative to cultivating less than one hectare. Homestead food garden programmes should be run in conjunction with land ownership. Our findings demonstrate the need for policymakers and evaluators of agricultural interventions to consider farmers' decisions to participate, programme outcomes and land ownership in their assessments in order to avoid biased judgement. The willingness of people to participate in farming should be paramount to the homestead food garden programme and land ownership policy, otherwise the redistribution of farmland to people who are not willing to farm will be meaningless.","[Bahta, Y.

The problem is compounded by the considerable diversity of ways in which the influence of the state on development outcomes has been conceptualized, making it hard for practitioners to extract policy lessons from this literature. In this study, I seek to help to address both of these problems through a historical comparative examination of the ways in which state capacity affected infant and maternal mortality reduction in Argentina and Chile over the last half century. I show that Chile's greater investment in health-specific state capacities was behind the remarkable historical reversal of fortune between these two countries in terms of infant and maternal mortality levels from 1960 to the present, as well as behind Chile's notorious reduction in the territorial inequality of these outcomes. I show the key difference between the two countries was the quality, reach, and homogeneity of their respective public health systems. From a theoretical standpoint, I argue that the notions of bureaucratic quality and infrastructural power are both necessary and complementary perspectives through which to conceptualize state capacity and understand its causal influence over health and other desirable developmental outcomes. In turn, this suggests that a useful way to specify calls for better governance and to achieve better long-run health performance may be to invest in the public health system's technical (bureaucratic) autonomy and in its system-wide planning and coordination capacities.

This study uses micro data from the 2010 Italian Agricultural Census to first describe what are the structural and geographical features of Italian farms employing foreign workers and then to group farms through a cluster analysis. Results give a detailed representation of the incidence of foreign workers employed, revealing which part of Italian agriculture relies more on foreign workers. The cluster analysis allows the definition of six groups: foreign workers are especially involved in livestock activities, both indoor and grazing and in farms specialized in permanent crops.

Based on the financial ratio analysis, the performance after the SAF implementation has increased slightly compared to that before SAF. Additionally, the expenditures have raised gradually particularly in regards to operational expenditures. This situation is problematic particularly after the end of SAF period as the portion of locally-generated revenue (LGR) compared the total revenue is smaller than the portion of the operational expenditures.

These different monetary policy regimes display different outcomes for inflation, interest rates, and real consumption growth. This article uses the differences among the outcomes to better understand how monetary policy affects those outcomes. One of the important results is that monetary policy appears to be able to affect long-term real interest rates and real consumption growth during periods of extreme monetary policy in which the Fed holds short-term interest rates abnormally high or abnormally low for an extended period. This article exploits the idea of monetary policy regimes to ask whether monetary policy exacerbated the low real interest rate on safe assets and the low level of consumption during the period in which the range for the Fed's interest rate target was set at 0 to 0.25 percent. Many observers have appealed to real factors such as aging demographics to explain the low level of long-term interest rates. The evidence presented here suggests that policy analysts should also consider the possibility that the Fed was the main cause of the low real interest rate following the 2007-08 financial crisis.","[Gavin, William T.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Res Dept, St Louis, MO 63102 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Gavin, WT (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Res Dept, St Louis, MO 63102 USA.",,,,,,,,41,3,3,0,5,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

The additional effect or the difference that is created from such an interaction is called synergy effect or synergistic effect. A system can be economical, technical or others. The effect of synergy can be both positive and negative. The positive synergy is sometimes expressed as '2+2=5' effect or '1+1=3' effect, negative synergy is expressed as '2+2<4' effect. The negative synergy effect is called dissynergy, zero synergy effect or asynergy. The global population is growing and it has an impact on the environment. In connection with the limited resources and the not limited human needs, it is necessary to save resources. To ensure that there are enough food, water and wealth in future, we need to switch from a linear to a circular economy.

Whatever its form, short-term debt is an inherent feature of a market economy. A run is an information event in which holders of short-term debt no longer want to lend to banks because they receive information leading them to suspect the value of the backing for the debt, so they run. When runs are system-wide they threaten the solvency of the entire financial system, which then requires either public or private intervention to remedy.

The analysis is carried out using the methodology of cointegration error-correction model, which take into account both the long-term and the short-term aspect of interest rate development. Our results point to considerable differences in the size of the pass-through with respect to either different loan and deposit rates. It has also shown a low rate of immediate transmission, the incompleteness of the pass-through, higher efficiency in the process of interbank interest rates pass-through into the interest rates on loans, and we can conclude that the process of interest rates pass-through in our conditions is relatively stable.","[Halamova, Valeria; Kocisova, Kristina] Tech Univ Kosiciach, Ekon Fak, Kosice, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Halamová, V (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosiciach, Ekon Fak, Kosice, Slovakia.",halamova.valeria@gmail.com; Kristina.Kocisova@tuke.sk,"Kocisova, Kristina/AAA-5401-2020","Kocisova, Kristina/0000-0003-0784-441X",,,,,40,1,1,3,8,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

The key conclusions of the research are that there can be observed certain dependence of price to earning valuation multiple on most of the tested size criteria.

It briefly discusses starting-points of inflation targeting regime, individual transmission channels of monetary policy, and routes through which the central bank may influence the investment. There are mentioned selected investment theories. Other factors, whose changes may induce changes in investment, are derived using these theories. Using available data, sources of investment variability are verified for the Czech Republic. Correlation analysis is performed and the vector error correction model is compiled. It seems that rise of aggregate demand is transformed into rise of investment. Similarly in case of asset prices. Appreciation of CZK is reflected in decline of investment. All three relations are consistent with the theory. On the contrary, sensitivity of investment to changes in market expected real interest rates is not clear.","[Kucera, Lukas] Vysoka Skola Ekon, Fak Financi & Ucetnictvi, Prague, Czech Republic",,"Kucera, L (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Ekon, Fak Financi & Ucetnictvi, Prague, Czech Republic.",xkucl21@vse.cz,,,,,,,31,1,1,0,5,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

However, to the best of our knowledge, the Nigerian bond market does not currently have zero-coupon yield curve; what is available is the yield-to-maturity yield curve. This paper seeks to model zero-coupon yield curve for the Nigerian secondary bond market, using piecewise cubic hermite interpolation. It also compares the existing yield curve with the zero-coupon yield curve to analyze the possible effects of relying on only the existing yield curve for financial market decisions. Data is obtained from the FMDQ OTC. The results show that the yield-to-maturity curve used by the Nigerian bond market generally appears flatter and more linear, relative to the modeled zero-coupon yield curve. We believe that adopting the zero-coupon yield curve in addition to the yield-to-maturity curve would add more reliability and accuracy for pricing decisions and monetary policy functions.","[Lartey, Victor Curtis; Li, Yao] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Management & Econ, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Lartey, Victor Curtis; Li, Yao] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Ctr West African Studies, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Lartey, Victor Curtis] Koforidua Tech Univ, Fac Business & Management Studies, POB 981, Koforidua, Ghana",University of Electronic Science & Technology of China; University of Electronic Science & Technology of China,"Lartey, VC (通讯作者)，Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Management & Econ, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China.;Lartey, VC (通讯作者)，Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Ctr West African Studies, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China.;Lartey, VC (通讯作者)，Koforidua Tech Univ, Fac Business & Management Studies, POB 981, Koforidua, Ghana.",viclartey@yahoo.com,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,0,VOLKSON PRESS,KUALA LUMPUR,"C-3A-15 CENTRIO PANTAI HILLPARK, JALAN PANTAI MURNI, BANGSAR SOUTH,, KUALA LUMPUR, WILAYAH PERSEKUTUAN KUALA LUMPUR 59200, MALAYSIA",,,978-1-948012-10-2,,,,2018,,,,,,,76,78,,10.26480/icefs.01.2018.76.78,0.0,,,3,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL6HR,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000454212200015,0

However, the maturity of startups that apply for funding (and are ultimately funded) inversely correlates with the entrepreneurship-friendliness of the country.

Corruption increases the difficulty of corporate governance and decreases the costs to controlling families of misusing firm assets as collateral for bank loans and creating credits for their own high-risk business, thus increasing cyclical fluctuations in inflation and production. Consistent with the predictions of the model, our longitudinal analyses covering 155 countries from 1995 to 2015 suggest that corruption increases the Hodrick-Prescott cyclical volatility of inflation and production in the following 10years.

The question we have posed is whether long-term economic growth can continue while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The answer is yes for most economists who have studied the problem. It should be possible to reduce GHG emissions in several ways. The problem of climate change is clearly related to economic growth.

Discussion of how Eurobonds might work has occupied EU members since 1960s. A single currency for the six founding members was under the discussion in the 1950s and a collective way to borrow using Eurobonds was part of the plan. Where the idea of a shared currency was resurrected in the mid 1990s, borrowing for all countries was extremely cheap and the need for Eurobonds was unclear. They are not to be confused with the Eurobond market, which is a way for corporations, banks and other private entities to borrow money by issuing bonds. As London is the world ' s biggest Eurobond marketplace, nowadays participants in this market are organized under the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) in London. A large number of Eurobond transactions involve elaborate swap deals in which two or more parties may exchange payments on parallel or opposing debt issues to take advantage of arbitrage conditions or complementary financial advantages.

In particular, we investigate the effects of exchange rate misalignment on long-term export performance of the Serbian economy, by using monthly data for the last decade. International trade theories suggest that a deterioration of export performance should be expected in the conditions of real currency appreciation, while depreciated currency tends to benefit the exporters. However, statistical data on real effective exchange rate and aggregated data of Serbian exports indicate that the ambience of overvalued national currency did not harm export performance. Employing the Engle-Granger test of cointegration, we find no stable long-run relation between the time series data of exchange rate and export, while Granger causality test indicates a unidirectional causality that runs from exchange rate to export. These findings suggest that export dynamics is likely to be affected by a combination of various determinants, both demand-and supplyside variables. By estimating a multiple regression model, we test the potential influence of industrial production index, unit labor costs, fiscal balance, and world demand on aggregate export data. The findings confirm the insignificance of real exchange rate as a determinant of Serbian exports, disregarding the normative theory assumptions, while world demand and industrial achievement significantly impact the export performance. Our study offers potential explanations of export growth in the ambience of real currency appreciation and advocates for a flexible exchange rate policy that would take into account long-term effects on trade performance.","[Marinkovic, Srdan; Dzunic, Marija] Univ Nis, Fac Econ, Nish, Serbia",University of Nis,"Marinkovic, S (通讯作者)，Univ Nis, Fac Econ, Nish, Serbia.",srdjan.marinkovic@eknfak.ni.ac.rs; marija_dzunic@ni.ac.rs,"Dzunic, Marija/HME-2028-2023","Dzunic, Marija/0000-0001-5269-1921; Marinkovic, Srdan/0000-0001-9012-9454","Republic of Serbia Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development","Republic of Serbia Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development","The authors are grateful to the Republic of Serbia Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development for the funds and support that made this research possible.",,44,1,1,1,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",1431-1933,,978-3-319-93452-5; 978-3-319-93451-8,CONTRIB ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,51,67,,10.1007/978-3-319-93452-5_4,0.0,,,17,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BQ4NA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000591182600004,0

The Philippine case is greatly influenced by the institutional interventions while the Indonesian case testifies to the validity of the theoretical perspective of Putnam.","[Navarra, Melissa Quetulio; Niehof, Anke; Van der Horst, Hilje; Moerbeek, Hester] Wageningen Univ, Grad Sch Social Sci, Leeuwenborch Bldg 201,Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Navarra, Melissa Quetulio] Presidential Commiss Urban Poor, Relocat & Resettlement Monitoring & Dev Div, Quezon City, Philippines; [Van der Vaart, Wander] Univ Humanist Studies, Social Res Methodol, Utrecht, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Navarra, MQ (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Grad Sch Social Sci, Leeuwenborch Bldg 201,Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",melisnavarra@gmail.com,"Quetulio-Navarra, Melissa/ABA-9034-2021","Quetulio-Navarra, Melissa/0000-0002-5401-6177",Neys Van Hoogstraten Foundation [IN230]; Netherlands Fellowship Programme [Navarra] [CF6698/2010],Neys Van Hoogstraten Foundation; Netherlands Fellowship Programme [Navarra],This work was supported by the Neys Van Hoogstraten Foundation [IN230]; and Netherlands Fellowship Programme [CF6698/2010 - Navarra].,,41,3,3,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

To motivate the analyses, we present a simple theoretical model that highlights the special features of interest rate risk. Consistent with the theory, we find that firms that issue more fixed rate debt have higher liquidity ratios and lower operating income ratios. We also document that individual firms actively vary the proportion of their fixed rate debt to a strikingly high extent. There is a debate as to whether such variation should be interpreted as hedging or speculation. We show that the firms more actively varying their debt mix respond to different hedging motives than those with low activity. We then empirically motivate an alternative indicator of speculative activity: co-variation between ex-post profitability of financial decisions and operating results. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Animal welfare organizations, farmers and politicians have been discussing the need for undercover investigations and their consequences for animal activists. Since the public perspective and its influencing factors had not previously been scientifically investigated an exploratory study with 292 German consumers is conducted. Using structural equation modeling the attitude to undercover investigations and their influencing factors are revealed. Generally the results show a positive attitude towards undercover investigations. They are perceived as necessary for animal welfare reasons because state-owned control mechanisms are unsatisfactory. In addition, the results show that the work of responsible animal welfare organizations receives social approval and the public is unsure about the psychological burden on affected farmers. The positive attitude towards undercover investigations is influenced by the increasingly critical view on livestock farming. However, the public rejects harsher punishment of investigators. Undercover investigations demonstrate the discrepancy between agriculture and society and show that the welfare of farm animals is becoming increasingly important.","[Schulze, Maureen; Risius, Antje; Spiller, Achim] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Schulze, M (通讯作者)，Georg August Univ Gottingen, Dept Agrarokon & Rurale Entwicklung, Mkt Lebensmittel & Agrarprod, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",maureen.schulze@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Spiller, Achim/CAJ-5518-2022",,,,,,34,3,3,0,4,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

To date, most of the empirical work on the influence of regional characteristics on entrepreneurship has focused on developed countries, while empirical work that analyses the regional determinants of micro entrepreneurship in rural areas of emerging markets remains scare. This paper uses three-level binary-logistic random intercept models to analyse the effects of explanatory factors at different levels on micro entrepreneurship in rural Vietnam. Our analyses show that identifying the motivation behind starting a micro enterprise is a good way to split entrepreneurship into two groups: namely opportunity- and necessity-driven entrepreneurship, which are influenced by very different explanatory factors at different levels. We find evidence that in rural areas of emerging markets, the individual level dominates with regard to explaining both opportunity- and necessity-driven entrepreneurship. Nevertheless, the regional level has a significant impact, albeit only on opportunity-driven entrepreneurship.","[Sohns, Franziska; Diez, Javier Revilla] Univ Cologne, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Sohns, F (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",fsohns@uni-koeln.de; j.revilladiez@uni-koeln.de,"Sohns, Franziska/JNS-9985-2023; Sohns, Franziska/AAJ-1064-2020; Revilla Diez, Javier/J-2392-2019","Revilla Diez, Javier/0000-0003-2065-1380; Sohns, Franziska/0000-0002-5641-7433",,,,,72,22,23,3,69,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The content is based on the research, analysis, and synthesis of findings published on this topic in scientific journals. The majority of papers published on this topic begin by introducing the concept of BI, its components, and possible benefits. As could perhaps be expected, two groups of papers can be identified: (a) review papers of existing research and (b) publications of original empirical research findings. Authors of the former group of papers tend to almost unquestioningly support the notion that the introduction of BI solutions is mainly beneficial to companies; authors of the latter group of papers are somewhat divided in their view on this matter. On the one hand, their findings support the notion BI solutions do seem to have positive influence on corporate performance; on the other hand, they warn that there may be more factors coming into play that are to be considered more carefully.","[Spicak, David] Univ Econ Prague, Dept Management Accounting, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Spicák, D (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Dept Management Accounting, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",xspid05@vse.cz,,,"Grant Agency on the University of Economics, Prague [F1/71/2017]","Grant Agency on the University of Economics, Prague","The article is processed as an output of a research project financed by the Grant Agency on the University of Economics, Prague, under the registration number F1/71/2017.",,11,0,0,0,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-68762-9; 978-3-319-68761-2,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,395,401,,10.1007/978-3-319-68762-9_43,0.0,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL3UH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450036900043,0

For this purpose, an analysis of non-observed economy as an alternative method of tax evasion estimation is used. The presented method works as follows: the detailed segmentation of non-observed economy enables to match various types of hidden or concealed income with corresponding liable taxes and therefore to estimate the amount of tax due. The results show that tax evasion is increasing in the Czech Republic (with the exception of 2012) reaching 71 bn CZK in 2008 and more than 120 bn CZK in 2015. This approach also allows us to divide the total tax evasion between direct and indirect taxes. From this point of view, the higher share belongs to direct taxes in the Czech Republic. This, however, may be caused by the nature of non-observed economy which does not cover all types of tax fraud, namely carousel frauds. That is why the presented estimates should be regarded as a bottom level of the total tax evasion in the Czech Republic.","[Stavjanova, Jana] Vysoka Skola Ekonomicka Praze, Fak Financi & Ucetnictvi, Prague, Czech Republic",,"Stavjanová, J (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Ekonomicka Praze, Fak Financi & Ucetnictvi, Prague, Czech Republic.",jana.stavjanova@gmail.com,,,,,,,35,0,0,1,13,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

This is in accordance with Signaling hypothesis that companies that have high profit will give the signal to investors by revealing his social information.

Here we can talk about a real development of the wood culture (wood was used to build the house, the barn, the stables, the gate and the fence, to make the furniture inside the dwelling, for example the dowry chest, the table, the bed, the dish shelf, the kneading-trough, the barrels, the spoons, the loom, the spinning wheel, the spindle, the towing torch). This wood culture was influenced by historical and geographic factors, it had particularities from one area to another regarding the working techniques, especially due to the influence of the German, Polish and Slovak colonists, who came to Bukovina after its annexation by the Austrians (1774). Recently, the preservation of cultural landscape, as a solution that contributes to a sustainable development of the region, was brought again to the attention of specialists. To have access to all written resources, could be a challenge, if we take into consideration that most of them were produced between 1960-1990, in a limited number, with a limited circulation.

It refers to the identification mark of the origin and quality of agricultural product operators and their products, represents the credibility of agricultural product operators and their commitment to consumers, and is the intangible asset of agricultural product operators, which is the bridge between agricultural product operators and consumers. Compared with the brands of industrial products and other service products, the main features of the agricultural product brands are agricultural products. The agricultural production process is carried out in a vast natural space. The influence of labor methods on product quality is difficult to monitor, and thus it is necessary to realize the agricultural industry and standardized production management. The agricultural product brands represent the advantages of natural resources. The creation of most agricultural product brands is often based on the original characteristics. The brand value of agricultural products is greatly affected by original technology. The quality and efficiency determined by the level of science and technology have become the leading factor in enhancing the brand value of agricultural products.","[Wang, Guanzhu] Jilin Engn Normal Univ, Changchun 130000, Jilin, Peoples R China",Jilin Engineering Normal University,"Wang, GZ (通讯作者)，Jilin Engn Normal Univ, Changchun 130000, Jilin, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,5,0,0,1,15,FRANCIS ACAD PRESS,LONDON,"35 IVOR PL, LOWER GROUND, LONDON, NW1 6EA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-912407-05-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,130,133,,,,,,4,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL4HW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450396400029,0

The paper analysed the determinants of taking out crop insurance, using logistic regression and FADN data (2004-2013). The models were estimated for the analysed population and by groups with a different subsidy rate. A novelty is the use of the Horvitz-Thompson estimator which allows us to generalise the results of the models on a national scale. It was found that crop insurance was mainly determined by received compensation and significant losses in the past yields, as well as by: value of the agricultural production, crop production intensity and soil quality. The results obtained in this part are consistent with the expected utility hypothesis. The impact of the level of subsidies received by farmers on insurance crop decisions was not confirmed, however, the models assessed for farms with a different subsidy rate point to the importance of subsidies as an income stabilising factor.","[Was, Adam] Natl Res Inst, Inst Agr & Food Econ, Warsaw, Poland; [Kobus, Pawel] Szkola Glowna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego, Warsaw, Poland",Institute of Agricultural & Food Economy; Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Was, A (通讯作者)，Natl Res Inst, Inst Agr & Food Econ, Warsaw, Poland.",was@ierigz.waw.pl; pawel_kobus@sggw.pl,"Wąs, Adam/ABB-3765-2020; /AAD-2112-2020","Wąs, Adam/0000-0001-8643-5985; /0000-0003-2289-2305",,,,,59,4,5,0,4,"INST AGRICULTURAL & FOOD ECONOMICS, NATIONAL RESEARCH INST-IAFE-NRI",WARSZAWA,"UL.

The enrichment perspective was operationalized as family instrumental (financial) and affective (moral) support, while interference was operationalized as gender-related personal problems. Design/methodology/approach - The study drew upon the work-family interface (WFI) theory from the family embeddedness perspective in the context of institutional economics. In Morocco, a purposive sample of 116 women entrepreneurs completed a self-administered questionnaire using field collection, mail, and phone surveying methods. In Turkey, 147 women entrepreneurs completed the questionnaire online and through personal contacts in business organizations. Findings - The findings indicated a positive relationship of family financial support with business performance of female entrepreneurs in Morocco, a less economically advanced country. However, family moral support is related to better firm performance in Turkey, a more advanced economy. Gender-related personal problems of women entrepreneurs appear to hamper their business performance in Turkey; while in Morocco, the performance of women entrepreneurs seems to improve in the face of such impediments. Practical implications - The results provide initial evidence that female entrepreneurs benefit from the linkages of family-to-business enrichment in different ways, depending on the country's level of economic development. In less economically developed countries, women entrepreneurs benefit more from instrumental rather than affective components of the enrichment dimension of the BFI. Conversely, in more economically advanced countries, female entrepreneurs benefit more from affective rather than the instrumental elements of this dimension. Likewise, the components of the interference dimension of the BFI affect female entrepreneurs differently depending on the economic development of the countries. Women in the less-developed country of Morocco are less impeded by their personal problems compared to their counterparts in Turkey, a more developed economy. Actually, Moroccan women entrepreneurs improved their business performance when facing obstacles, most likely due to their increased inner strength and resilience acquired when battling adversarial institutional conditions. Originality/value - The present study makes three unique contributions to the entrepreneurship literature. First, the study links the two BFI dimensions (enrichment and interference) to firm performance with an exclusive focus on female business owners. Second, within the construct of enrichment, the study employs both family instrumental and emotional support. Third, the study shows that the country's level of economic development moderates the relationships between the BFI dimensions and firm performance.","[Welsh, Dianne H.

Social capital is distinguished into bonding and bridging dimensions, with the former referring to the internal aspect of social capital and the latter the external Guanxi (meaning relationship) possessed by core members. The statistical results display that specific dimensions of social capital may not deliver the benefits expected by cooperative practitioners and academics. Both positive and negative effects of social capital on performances of farmer cooperatives are observed. To be specific, bonding social capital is positively associated with common members' economic benefits. Bridging social capital generates beneficial outcomes for the financial and social performances of cooperatives, while exhibiting negative influence on common members' income increase because of member heterogeneity.","[Xu, Yining; Liang, Qiao; Huang, Zuhui] Zhejiang Univ, China Acad Rural Dev, Sch Management, Yuhangtang Rd 866, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University,"Liang, Q (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, China Acad Rural Dev, Sch Management, Yuhangtang Rd 866, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",liangqiao2323@126.com,,"Liang, Qiao/0000-0001-7473-7863","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71573227, 71333011]; Zhejiang Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science [17NDJC93YB]; National Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science [14CJY042]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Zhejiang Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science; National Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science,"This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71573227, Grant No. 71333011), the Zhejiang Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science (Grant No. 17NDJC93YB), and National Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science (Grant No. 14CJY042).",,63,20,21,9,49,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

Our model of the behavior of profit-maximizing agents demonstrates that under the simplest set of assumptions the regulator has no interest in reducing monitoring uncertainty. However, in the presence of information asymmetry, monitoring uncertainty may hamper the economic and environmental performance of climate policy due to adverse selection. In a mandatory policy, prescribing a reasonable level of uncertainty is preferable if the regulator has enough information to determine this level. For voluntary mechanisms, such as carbon offsets, allowing agents to set their own monitoring uncertainty below a maximum threshold or discounting carbon revenues in proportion to monitoring uncertainty are the best approaches for the regulator to mitigate the negative effects of information asymmetry. These conclusions are much more pronounced when agents do not accrue revenues from their mitigation action, other than carbon. Our analysis of monitoring uncertainty under information asymmetry, which results in heterogeneity in the agents' benefits from abatement, generalizes the classical trade-off between production efficiency and information rents.","[Bellassen, Valentin] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, AgroSup Dijon, CESAER, INRA, F-21000 Dijon, France; [Shishlov, Igor] I4CE Inst Climate Econ, 47 Rue Victoire, F-75009 Paris, France; [Shishlov, Igor] CIRAD, CIRED, 45 Bis,Ave Belle Gabrielle, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France",INRAE; Institut Agro; AgroSup Dijon; Universite Paris Saclay; AgroParisTech; Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; CIRAD,"Bellassen, V (通讯作者)，Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, AgroSup Dijon, CESAER, INRA, F-21000 Dijon, France.",valentin.bellassen@dijon.inra.fr; igor.shishlov@i4ce.org,,"Bellassen, Valentin/0000-0001-8581-2814","Agence Francaise de Developpement; EIT Climate-KIC; Ministere francais de l'Agriculture, de l'Agroalimentaire et de la Foret; Ministere francais de l'Ecologie, du Developpement Durable et de l'Energie; Union des Industries de la Fertilisation","Agence Francaise de Developpement; EIT Climate-KIC; Ministere francais de l'Agriculture, de l'Agroalimentaire et de la Foret; Ministere francais de l'Ecologie, du Developpement Durable et de l'Energie; Union des Industries de la Fertilisation","The authors would like to thank Stephane De Cara (INRA), David Driesen (Syracuse University College of Law), Franck Lecocq (CIRED), Juan-Pablo Montero (Economics Institute of the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile), Romain Morel (CDC Climat Research), Marie-Laure Breuille (INRA) and Sophie Legras (INRA) for their valuable inputs.

Our gravity model predicts that stronger democratic political institutions encourage exports. We also find that stronger rule-based corporate governance imposes positive impact on the export performance. We also note that stronger employee protection, and therefore, rigid labor regulations can distort the exporting decision of firms. In addition, a stronger shareholder protection tends to be associated with lower exports, probably attributed to lower innovative activity. We interpret these results as an indication that (i) countries with a higher quality of institution suffer from less formal and informal trade barriers, which make international trade relations easier, and (ii) both the employee protection and the shareholder protection, on the other hand, trivialize the country's export.","[Bilgin, Mehmet Huseyin; Gozgor, Giray] Istanbul Medeniyet Univ, Fac Polit Sci, Istanbul, Turkey; [Lau, Chi Keung Marco] Northumbria Univ, Newcastle Business Sch, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England",Istanbul Medeniyet University; Northumbria University; Newcastle University - UK,"Gozgor, G (通讯作者)，Istanbul Medeniyet Univ, Fac Polit Sci, Istanbul, Turkey.",mehmet.bilgin@medeniyet.edu.tr; giray.gozgor@medeniyet.edu.tr; chi.lau@northumbria.ac.uk,"Bilgin, Mehmet Huseyin/K-6487-2017; Lau, Chi Keung/T-7850-2019; Gozgor, Giray/K-1372-2017","Lau, Chi Keung/0000-0002-2430-5592; Gozgor, Giray/0000-0003-1238-8105; Bilgin, Mehmet Huseyin/0000-0002-9897-9792",,,,,44,20,20,2,32,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1309-4297,2147-4281,,EURASIAN BUS REV,Eurasian Bus.

Over the previous 30 years, a time of considerable labour market growth and policy change, mature age labour force participation increased significantly in Australia. In this paper, we utilise the National Transfer Accounts methodology to examine the impact that the increases in mature age labour force participation have had on the Life Cycle Deficit - the difference between what age groups consume and what they produce through their own labour. We expected and found that the age entering the life cycle deficit is strongly influenced by changing patterns of mature age labour force participation. Both cross-sectional and cohort analyses show that over this 30 year time horizon, the ages at which the life cycle deficit moves from positive to negative territory and vice versa have gradually increased over time. The growth in mature age labour force participation since the turn of this century has led to large increases in mature age labour income, the most important effect of which appears to have been a substantial increase in private saving by mature age Australians. Implications of a recent slowing in mature age labour force participation in Australia are discussed.

Previous literature has indicated that the number and heterogeneity of partners in an alliance portfolio might have positive effects on innovativeness. Yet, engaging in multiple and heterogeneous collaborations also raises managerial costs and complexity levels disproportionally, potentially causing detrimental performance effects. Analysis of a unique panel dataset suggests that engaging in many alliances generally has a positive influence on a firm's innovation output. Furthermore, maintaining diverse alliance portfolios and a high extent of alliancing jointly affects a firm's innovation output negatively. By additionally showing that younger firms benefit disproportionally from both alliance portfolio diversity and size, this study provides a more nuanced view of alliancing effects.","[Wagner, Marcus] Augsburg Univ, Chair Management Innovat & Int Business, Univ Str 16, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany; [Zidorn, Wilfried] Univ Las Americas, Dept Econ & Business, Ave Granados E12-41 & Colimes Esq, Quito 170513, Ecuador",Universidad de Las Americas - Ecuador,"Zidorn, W (通讯作者)，Univ Las Americas, Dept Econ & Business, Ave Granados E12-41 & Colimes Esq, Quito 170513, Ecuador.",marcus.wagner@wiwi.uni-augsburg.de; wilfried.zidorn@udlanet.ec,,,,,,,99,6,6,2,42,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

At the same time, land markets may not operate in a gender-neutral manner, with restrictions beyond the market continuing to influence the options of female-headed households. Using both qualitative data and household survey data collected in 2014 and 2015, this paper explores the extent and manner in which female heads participate in the sales and rental markets in northwestern Tanzania. A qualitative analysis reveals that female heads do engage with the market, although they find it most difficult to mobilize the necessary capital to participate as buyers or renters. Women also seem to face unique restrictions on selling land. Regression results show that female heads use the market to augment a small land endowment left from their marriage, and this is, particularly true for divorced or separated women. However, female-headed households remain somewhat marginalized in terms of market participation. Our study shows that female heads in Tanzania are far from sidelined in the land market, though the rules of market engagement are decidedly nuanced. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that respondents' WTP is higher the closer they live to their nearest forest, and the scarcer forests are in the area where they live. Interestingly, the higher the ecological value of forests in respondents' area, the more people prefer extending areas of national forest protection.

Further analysis shows that the impact of institutional investors' CSVs on future crash risk is more pronounced when firm managers have higher bad-news hoarding incentives and less information disclosure monitoring, and when firms are plagued more by information asymmetry. Moreover, the economic mechanism analysis shows that the average cumulative abnormal return (CAR) around the announcement day of institutional investors' CSVs is significantly positive, that CSV5 have larger effect for firms with higher CARs and that firms visited more by institutional investors are more likely to make financial restatement in future. Overall, our findings are consistent with the notion that institutional investors' CSVs exacerbate managers' incentives to withhold bad news, which leads to bad news accumulation and future stock price crash risk.","[Gao, Shenghao] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, 3 Shangyuancun, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Cao, Feng] Hunan Univ, Business Sch, 109 Shijiachong Rd, Changsha 410006, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xiangqiang] Southwest Univ, Coll Econ & Management, 2 Tiansheng Rd, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China",Beijing Jiaotong University; Hunan University; Southwest University - China,"Cao, F (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ, Business Sch, 109 Shijiachong Rd, Changsha 410006, Hunan, Peoples R China.",gaosh@bjtu.edu.cn; caofeng@hnu.edu.cn; liuxq0525@163.com,"Gao, Shenghao/AAF-8120-2021","Gao, Shenghao/0000-0001-8705-958X","China National Nature Science Foundation [71602053]; Foundation of Youth for Humanity and Social Science from the Ministry of Education of China [16YJC630024]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2016M602413]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2015RC080, 531107050817]",China National Nature Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Foundation of Youth for Humanity and Social Science from the Ministry of Education of China; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"We would like to thank the editor and two anonymous referees for their valuable comments and suggestions.

A panel quantile regression approach,REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,FOREIGN-AID; RECIPIENT,"This paper investigates whether Aid for Trade (AfT) leads to greater exports in recipient countries. Using panel quantile regression and two strategies to address endogeneity (AfT lagged by two periods and dynamic OLS), our results suggest that total AfT disbursements promote the export of goods and services mainly for the lower quantiles (0.1, 0.25, 0.50) of the conditional distribution of exports. Hence, countries that export less in volume are those benefitting most from AfT. This effect is mainly driven by the impact on exports of goods rather than on that of services. We also investigate which types of AfT are effective when endogeneity is controlled for. The main results show that whereas aid to improve trade policy and regulation is associated with higher exports for all quantiles, aid used to build infrastructure is found to affect exports at only the lowest tails of the distribution (0.10-0.35) and aid to build productive capacity is generally more effective for the lower quantiles of the export distribution (0.10-0.50). In contrast, aid disbursed for general budget support (an untargeted type of aid) is not associated with greater export levels. This finding holds irrespective of the quantile.","[Martinez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada; Nowak-Lehmann D., Felicitas] Univ Goettingen, Gottingen, Germany; [Martinez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada] Jaume I Univ, Castellon de La Plana, Spain; [Rehwald, Kai] Univ Aarhus, Aarhus, Denmark",University of Gottingen; Universitat Jaume I; Aarhus University,"Martínez-Zarzoso, I (通讯作者)，Univ Goettingen, Dept Econ, Pl Goettinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",imartin@uni-goettingen.de,"Martínez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada/K-1633-2014","Martínez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada/0000-0002-3247-8557",MINECO [ECO2014-58991-C3-2-R]; Universitat Jaume I [P1-1B2013-06],MINECO(Spanish Government); Universitat Jaume I,"MINECO, Grant/Award Number: ECO2014-58991-C3-2-R; Universitat Jaume I, Grant/Award Number: P1-1B2013-06",,38,26,26,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

An optimal macroprudential policy, similar to a counter cyclical capital requirement, can eliminate systemic risk raising welfare by about 1.5%.

While some claim that LSAIs are an important catalyst for development in neglected rural areas, others caution that they pose a risk to rural communities' livelihoods. The extent to which LSAIs provide benefits for local communities is hence still contested. This paper sets out to conceptually understand what effects the establishment of a large-scale farm has on the rural labor market in low- and middle-income countries. In addition, we empirically address the question of whether large-scale farming as recorded in the Land Matrix creates or destroys employment. We develop a transition matrix to identify several scenarios based on key determinants of the direct employment creation potential of LSAIs, namely the former land use, the crop type and the production model. We empirically assess the actual importance of these scenarios and the employment creation to be expected from this sample of LSAIs based on labor intensities. We further look into the net employment effects for land formerly used by smallholder farmers. Our analysis shows that LSAIs massively crowd out smallholder farmers, which is only partially mitigated through the cultivation of labor intensive crops and the application of contract farming schemes. This holds true for all regions targeted by LSAIs, although regional differences are found in terms of magnitude. The paper concludes that these effects tend to be large on the local scale (i.e., in the immediate surroundings of the investment site) but small in relation to total national employment in agriculture. However, indirect employment creation related to LSAIs, which is discussed but not empirically addressed in this paper, needs to be taken into account to have the full picture. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Finally, we show that the benefit has been shared by both Bt and non-Bt cotton adopters as the widespread adoption of Bt cotton has successfully suppressed the density of the pest population regionally. We conclude that the benefit of Bt cotton adoption continues 15 years after its introduction, albeit with evidence of a decline in the comparative advantage over non-Bt cotton in late adoption period. We believe that this contribution is theoretically and practically relevant because of the long length of our dataset and because we categorize pesticide use into that for controlling bollworms and that for controlling secondary pests.

This paper evaluates the effects of collective legacies on the agricultural performance after decollectivization. We construct a Collective Legacy Index (CLI) based on the achievements in the areas of rural infrastructure, education, and health under collectives. Using a district-level panel dataset, we find that the CLI has long-term positive effects on agricultural development after decollectivization. That is, districts that already performed well under socialism could still succeed under a different institution because they had superior infrastructure and human capital. At the same time, districts with less successful experience under socialism are less likely to catch up even after dismantling the collective institutions. The results with an instrumental variable (the pace of decollectivization) further reinforce this conclusion. We therefore argue that different collective legacies contribute to the uneven development in rural China. To tackle its problems of regional inequality, China needs to appreciate the role of its collective legacies in development. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The review identifies 19 studies: Fourteen within-country studies from Afghanistan, Iraq, Colombia, Philippines, and India, and five cross-national studies. These studies investigate the impact of six aid types: Community-driven development, conditional cash transfers, public employment scheme, humanitarian aid, infrastructure, and aid provided by military commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan. The evidence for a violence-dampening effect of aid in conflict zones is not strong. Aid in conflict zones is more likely to exacerbate violence than to dampen violence. A violence-dampening effect of aid appears to be conditional on a relatively secure environment for aid projects to be implemented. A violence-increasing effect occurs when aid is misappropriated by violent actors, or when violent actors sabotage aid projects in order to disrupt the cooperation between the local population and the government.

Further, informed agents use less price aggressive (limit) orders before negative events and more price aggressive (market) orders before positive events (buy-sell asymmetry). Motivated by these patterns, we model the execution risk that informed agents impose on each other and relate the asymmetry to costly short selling. When investor base is narrow, security borrowing is difficult, or the magnitude of the event is small, buy-sell asymmetry is pronounced and price discovery before negative events is lower. Overall, we show that the strategies of informed traders influence the process of price formation in financial markets, as predicted by theory. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Our results show that the impacts of volatility expectations in U.S. stock, gold, and oil markets on the correlations are asymmetric based on the level of correlations.

The estimated function can be used in a wide range of applied works in macroeconomics and public finance. In addition, using this function, we investigate the effects of tax exemption increases on properties of the personal income tax system. The main empirical result is that the effective-income-tax function becomes more progressive; however, the trend toward that was halted by tax exemption increases. Furthermore, variations in local progressivity indicate tax reforms had unequal impacts on the redistribution effects across income intervals.

The frequency of these events is projected to increase in the foreseeable future, with developing countries being the worst sufferers. Dealing with this appears to be an additional burden on the resources of such countries, a large part of which is already devoted to providing better living standards for its inhabitants. Does this imply that developmental interventions should be discontinued? Is there a link between these programs and adaptation to environmental shocks? In an effort to answer such questions, the paper examines the impact of the developmental schemes on the livelihood of the households in Western Odisha, India and investigates whether they augment post disaster coping and adaptation as well. The results indicate that overall the programs have made an impact concerning their intended goals but the diffusion of benefits across beneficiary groups is heterogeneous. Additionally, the programs have contributed in post disaster coping, but only in the regions where either they performed well or their penetration was extensive. Activities promoting livelihood diversification, food security, and poverty reduction also tacitly facilitate improvements in the resilience of the individuals and communities thereby enhancing their capacity to deal with climatic risks. Policy implication advocates the continuation of developmental interventions. However, realigning their framework to incorporate actions intended toward disaster risk reduction and management would result in more inclusive impacts. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In the near term, R&D investments, either by the government or the private sector, can reduce the costs of these lower-emitting technologies. However, the returns to R&D are uncertain, and there are many potential technologies that may emerge to play an important role in the future energy mix. In this paper, we address the problem of allocating scarce R&D resources across technologies when uncertainties exist. We develop a multistage stochastic dynamic programming version of an integrated assessment model of the climate and economy that represents endogenous technological change through R&D decisions for two substitutable noncarbon backstop technologies. We demonstrate that near-term R&D investment in the higher cost technology is justified and that the optimal R&D investment in the higher cost technology increases with both higher variance and higher skewness in the distribution of returns to R&D.","[Webster, Mort] Penn State Univ, Energy & Mineral Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Fisher-Vanden, Karen] Penn State Univ, Agr Econ Sociol & Educ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Popp, David] Syracuse Univ, Dept Publ Adm & Int Affairs, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Santen, Nidhi] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Syracuse University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Webster, M (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Energy & Mineral Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",mort@psu.edu; kaf26@psu.edu; dcpopp@maxwell.syr.edu; nrsanten@mit.edu,,,"US National Science Foundation [0825915]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0825915] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We wish to thank the two anonymous reviewers for very helpful and insightful comments.

Based on knowledge-based perspective, we hypothesize that employee characteristics (age, education, and job position) and parent firm characteristics (firm age, firm performance, and firm diversity) are significantly related to entrepreneurial spawning. We identified two inverted U-shaped relationships (age and tenure with entrepreneurial spawning) based on our meta-analytic hierarchical multiple regression analyses.

We posit that a progress paradox is among the possible channels explaining these contrasting trends. Using data from the Chinese Livelihood Survey, we explore the role of reported physical and psychological health. The standard correlates of life satisfaction such as age, income, and health hold. In addition, we find that those with insufficient rest and leisure are significantly less satisfied. Urban, educated respondents are more likely to report depression, while rural and uneducated respondents are more satisfied with their lives and are less likely to report poor mental health. We also find that insufficient rest, stress, and low life satisfaction have a strong correlation with mental health problems. Given the gains in growth and poverty reduction in China, it is time to consider policies that focus on quality of life and mental illness. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The tax also finances unemployment benefit to legal workers at the destination. The number of immigrant smugglers and traffickers is also determined endogenously along with employer penalty and market wage for illegal immigrants.

Although the economic effects of migration increase the efficiency of labour markets, some governments have rigorously rejected solutions proposed for the current refugee crisis. Meanwhile, immigration policies have recently become stricter in several OECD countries. Based on this conceptual framework, several labour market institutions, such as a minimum wage, unemployment benefits, union density, and active labour market policies etc., are analysed in the context of enhancing the employment of immigrants. In order to support the findings of literature this paper concentrates on the determinants of immigration tendencies and dynamic regression models analysed to clarify how these institutions can affect native-and foreign-born migrants.

The innovative character of teaching is given by the method in which the teacher creates his own educational scenario by considering specific learning objectives, age particularities of students, time and space-related resources, the technical requirements of the game and the evaluation method.

There is an abundance of research in innovation and technology management on the topic of radical innovations but surprisingly few studies on the far more common case of incremental innovations. While we acknowledge that incremental innovation is unlikely to lead to sustainable competitive advantage and the development of new capabilities, we argue that it is nevertheless a useful tactic for two reasons. First, incremental innovation is helpful to firms that are competitive laggards by offering them at least temporary competitive relief and the opportunity to reevaluate and redirect their strategic efforts. Looking at the internal context, we follow received theory and identify underperforming firms as those in the middle of the size distribution in a market. Second, looking at the external context, we build on the finding that escalating rivalry pushes firms to pursue radical innovation-a course of action that is disruptive and on average deleterious to performance. Under stiffening competition, incremental innovation is a desirable tactic because it avoids the hazard of core change that accompanies radical innovation while simultaneously allowing the firm to appease stakeholders by demonstrating a proactive response to competition. We test these ideas and discuss their implications for received theory in the context of the artificial reproductive technology (in-vitro fertilization) industry in the United States between 1989 and 2001.","[Verhaal, J.

We answer this question by examining the relationship between equity options markets and standard measures of firm innovation. We find that firms with more options trading activity generate more patents and patent citations per dollar invested in research and development (R&D), after accounting for other confounding factors. These results are confirmed when we use a propensity score matching procedure and an instrumental variable approach to control for the potential endogeneity of options trading. The evidence is consistent with the notion that the enhanced informational efficiency induced by options leads to an improved allocation of corporate resources. We further discuss possible underlying economic mechanisms through which more active options markets boost innovation and show that the effect remains substantial even after controlling for these mechanisms. Considering the average increase in the dollar volume of options traded for our sample firms, we conclude that a 200% move in options volume increases firm innovation by about 31%. 2017 Elsevier B.V.

There is a rationale for countercyclical capital requirements that impose lower capital demands when aggregate bank capital is low. However, such capital requirements also have a cost as they increase systemic risk taking: by insulating banks against aggregate shocks (but not bankspecific ones), they create incentives to invest in correlated activities. As a result, the economy's sensitivity to shocks increases and systemic crises can become more likely. Capital requirements that directly incentivize banks to become less correlated dominate countercyclical policies as they reduce both systemic risk-taking and cyclicality.","[Horvath, Balint L.] Univ Bristol, Bristol, Avon, England; [Wagner, Wolf] Rotterdam Sch Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Wagner, Wolf] CEPR, Washington, DC USA",University of Bristol; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Horváth, BL (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Bristol, Avon, England.",,,"Wagner, Wolf/0000-0002-0355-3263; Horvath, Balint/0000-0002-0240-4231",,,,,33,10,10,1,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

To this end, we apply the multivariate DECO-FIEGARCH model to daily spot indices during the period 1998-2016. The results reveal a significant and asymmetric long memory process for both the developed and the BRICS markets. Moreover, we find a significant variability in the time-varying conditional correlations between the considered markets during both bull and bear markets, particularly from early 2007 to summer 2008. Additionally, we analyze the optimal portfolio weights, time-varying hedge ratios and hedging effectiveness based on the estimates of the model. The results underline the importance of overweighting the optimal portfolios with stocks from the developed countries over those from the BRICS. Finally, we assess the practical implications for mixed developed-BRICS stock portfolios, based on finding strong evidence of diversification benefits and downside risk reductions that confirm the usefulness of using developed market stocks in the BRICS stock portfolio risk management.

We find a strong negative effect from fetal exposure to carbon monoxide (CO) and correlated pollutants (like PM10) on math and language skills measured in fourth grade.

This, in turn, could have ramifications for other development outcomes such as economic growth. We offer the first systematic cross national study on democracy and education quality. Democracy is widely regarded as superior to autocracy in terms of providing access to education, and several studies find that democracy enhances educational enrollment and years of schooling. Yet, we do not know whether democracies provide better education. We argue that democracies should not too readily be expected to outperform autocracies on education quality. First, it is inherently difficult to implement quality-enhancing education reforms, even for well-intentioned (democratic and autocratic) governments with ample resources. Second, education quality is less visible to voters than, e.g., expanding education enrollment, making quality-enhancing policies a less attractive option for office-seeking democratic politicians. We employ a recent dataset comparing international student tests for 128 countries, from 1965 onward. While democracies typically provide more education than autocracies, we find no systematic evidence that democracies offer better education. The result is very robust and holds in both cross-section and panel specifications. The null-relationship is not explained simply by democracies providing education access to more (and different types of) children than autocracies, and it appears both in rich and poor and in low- and high-capacity states. We also present relevant nuances: for instance, autocracies display more variation in education quality outcomes than democracies, and we find some evidence that democracy may be associated, more specifically, with better reading skills. In sum, this study provides new insights to the democracy and education literature, where extant studies often report strong links between democracy and various education outcomes not directly related to education quality, and informs literatures linking democracy to development outcomes such as growth via effects on human capital.

Previous work generally considers stabilization targets under certainty equivalence. Using an integrated assessment model with uncertainty about the sensitivity of the temperature to greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations (the climate sensitivity), learning, and random weather shocks, we calculate the optimal GHG emissions policy with and without stabilization targets. We characterize the range of feasible targets and show that the climate is difficult to control in the short run, although as learning resolves the planner eventually achieves the target with a sustained reduction in emissions over time. We find that uncertainty exacerbates the welfare cost of stabilization targets. First, the targets are inflexible and do not adjust to new information about the climate system. Second, the target forces the emissions policy to overreact to transient shocks. These effects are present only in a model with uncertainty. Introduction of a stabilization target into the baseline model with uncertainty results in a welfare loss of 4.7%, which is 66% higher than the cost of introducing the target in the certainty version of the model.","[Fitzpatrick, Luke G.] Ohio Univ, Dept Econ, Athens, OH 45701 USA; [Kelly, David L.] Univ Miami, Dept Econ, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio University; University of Miami,"Fitzpatrick, LG (通讯作者)，Ohio Univ, Dept Econ, Athens, OH 45701 USA.",fitzpatl@ohio.edu; dkelly@miami.edu,"Kelly, David L/D-1398-2013; Kelly, David/JMQ-6083-2023","Kelly, David/0000-0002-6132-6317",,,,,33,9,10,0,7,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

In this paper, we investigate how real effective exchange rate (REER) uncertainty affects firms' research and development (R&D) investment, using firm-level panel data for Japanese manufacturing firms for the period 1994-2011. Our results show that firms that are more exposed to REER uncertainty are less responsive to changes in demand conditions. Uncertainty makes firms more cautious when investing, since high uncertainty increases the chances of making a costly mistake. Our finding thus provides evidence of the caution effect of uncertainty. The caution effect also increases the persistence of R&D, implying that R&D investment does not increase much even if firms face favorable demand conditions. Reducing REER uncertainty is important to stimulate R&D investment, especially for firms that are more exposed to international competition and REER uncertainty.","[Ito, Keiko] Senshu Univ, Sch Econ, Tokyo, Japan; [Haneda, Shoko] Chuo Univ, Fac Commerce, Tokyo, Japan",Chuo University,"Ito, K (通讯作者)，Senshu Univ, Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Tama Ku, 2-1-1 Higashi Mita, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 2148580, Japan.",keiko-i@isc.senshu-u.ac.jp,"Ito, Keiko/AAA-6255-2019","Ito, Keiko/0000-0002-2162-2517; Haneda, Shoko/0000-0002-2817-9407",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS KAKENHI) [23683003]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23683003] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS KAKENHI)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This research was conducted as part of research projects for the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) and the National Institute for Science and Technology Policy (NISTEP).

However, little is known about whether the mental accounting effect can be observed when people make decisions for others. We conducted 2 studies to investigate this issue. In Study 1, participants were asked to read all A or B scenarios for 3 modified mental accounting problems (the movie ticket problem, the sneaker and umbrella problem, and the basketball game problem) and to make decisions for themselves or for others. The results showed that the mental accounting effect appeared only when the participants made decisions for themselves and not when they made decisions for others. In Study 2, we directly manipulated the self-other intimate relationship (close other vs. distant other) and asked the participants to make decisions for different others in the 3 modified problems. The results showed that regardless of whether the other was socially close or distant, the mental accounting effect was not observed. Taken together, our results extend the findings on mental accounting and indicate that it may cease to apply when individuals make decisions for others.","[Liu, Zhenliang; Mu, Shoukuan] Minnan Normal Univ, Dept Psychol, Zhangzhou 363000, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhenliang] Nanjing Univ, Dept Psychol, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Liu, Tiantian] Shanghai Normal Univ, Dept Early Child Educ, Shanghai, Peoples R China",MinNan Normal University; Nanjing University; Shanghai Normal University,"Mu, SK (通讯作者)，Minnan Normal Univ, Dept Psychol, Zhangzhou 363000, Peoples R China.",msk1967@163.com,"Liu, Zhenliang/N-8550-2019","Liu, Zhenliang/0000-0003-0096-710X; Liu, Tiantian/0000-0001-6259-5474",,,,,65,4,5,6,82,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

We use a sample of six Islamic MSCI indices from the Asian region, namely China, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Korea and Thailand obtained from MSCI (Morgan Stanley Capital International). In this paper we analyze the importance of considering spillover effects between emerging Asian Islamic indexes based on the Bivariate VARMA-BEKK-AGARCH model of McAleer et al. (2009), which includes spillover and asymmetric effects. We compute after the effectiveness of portfolio diversification based on the conditional volatility of returns series. Results show a significant positive and negative return spillover from China to selected Asian Islamic stock market and bidirectional volatility spillovers between China, Korea and Thailand Islamic market showing evidence of short-term predictability on Islamic Chinese stock market movements. However there is no short term volatility persistence in India, Indonesia and Malaysia. GARCH results show no persistence in volatility spillover effect in long term from Chinese to Indian, Indonesian and Korean Islamic stock market. Our findings are beneficial for international portfolio diversification for policy makers and investors since the results of portfolio management and hedging effectiveness ratio are different to previous studies.

The measure is based on the empirical copula process for the multivariate marginals, corresponding to the vectors, and is robust to the within-vector dependence. It is confined to the [0,1] interval and covers the entire range of dependence from vector independence to a monotone relationship element-wise. We study the properties of the new measure under several well-known copulas and provide a nonparametric estimator of the measure, along with its asymptotic theory, under fairly general assumptions. To illustrate the applicability of the new measure, we use it in applications to financial contagion, systemic risk, and portfolio choice. Specifically, we test for contagion effects between equity markets in North and South America, Europe and Asia, surrounding the financial crisis of 2008 and find strong evidence of previously unknown contagion patterns. In the context of sovereign bonds and credit default swaps, we study the evolution of systemic risk in European financial markets and uncover large differences from previous estimates. Finally, based on a real-time portfolio utilizing the new systemic risk estimates, we illustrate the implications of the new measure for portfolio choice and risk management.","[Medovikov, Ivan] Brock Univ, St Catharines, ON, Canada; [Prokhorov, Artem] Univ Sydney, Camperdown, NSW, Australia; [Prokhorov, Artem] St Petersburg State Univ, St Petersburg, Russia; [Prokhorov, Artem] Innopolis Univ, Innopolis, Russia",Brock University; University of Sydney; Saint Petersburg State University; Innopolis University,"Prokhorov, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Camperdown, NSW, Australia.",artem.prokhorov@sydney.edu.au,"; Prokhorov, Artem/M-1401-2015","Medovikov, Ivan/0000-0002-9322-0410; Prokhorov, Artem/0000-0003-4046-7994",Russian Science Foundation [16-18-10432]; Russian Science Foundation [16-18-10432] Funding Source: Russian Science Foundation,Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)); Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)),Helpful comments of the participants of IMS/ASS conference in Sydney are gratefully acknowledged.

By distinguishing between ambiguity aversion to returns and to return predictors, we derive the optimal dynamic trading rule in closed form within the framework of Garleanu and Pedersen (2013), using the robust optimization method. We characterize its properties and the unique mechanism through which ambiguity aversion impacts the optimal robust strategy. In addition to the two trading principles documented in Garleanu and Pedersen (2013), our model further implies that the robust strategy aims to reduce the expected loss arising from estimation errors. Ambiguity-averse investors trade toward an aim portfolio that gives less weight to highly volatile return-predicting factors, and loads less on the securities that have large and costly positions in the existing portfolio. Using data on various commodity futures, we show that the robust strategy outperforms the corresponding non-robust strategy in out-of-sample tests. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We use panel data on the 22 French administrative regions over the 1995-2009 period. We estimate the relationship between regional CO2 emissions per capita, regional GDP, temperature, the annual number of frost days, heating technology and energy prices. We use these results to assess the regional consequences of implementing a carbon tax of 22 per metric ton of CO2, and conclude that this policy would increase inequalities between regions. We show that a region-specific carbon tax that equalizes the tax burden among regions, instead of a homogenous national tax, may compensate these inequalities and reduce total CO2 emissions. Last, we show that taking regional specific effects into account in the design of the environmental tax reform may help make this policy more acceptable.","[Ahamada, Ibrahim; Fodha, Mouez] Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France; [Ahamada, Ibrahim; Fodha, Mouez] Univ Paris 01, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France; [Ahamada, Ibrahim] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Kirat, Djamel] Univ Orleans, CNRS, LEO, UMR 7322, F-45067 Orleans, France",Paris School of Economics; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; International Monetary Fund; Universite de Orleans; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Fodha, M (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France.;Fodha, M (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France.",mouez.fodha@univ-paris1.fr,"Fodha, Mouez/ABD-5876-2020",,Labex Voltaire [ANR-10-LABX-100-01],Labex Voltaire,D.

We measure the distance between people with positive and negative sentiment on a daily basis for 20 countries by using data from status updates on Facebook. The prediction is that a higher divergence of sentiment leads to more diverging views on prospects and risks, and thus to more diverging views on the value of a stock. In line with this prediction, divergence of sentiment is positively related to trading volume. We further predict and find a positive relation between divergence of sentiment and stock price volatility. The observed relations are stronger when individual investors are more likely to trade.

The direct flights that are shown to be determined by bilateral air services agreements are further shown to reduce trade costs through an endogeneity analysis; the main policy implications are twofold: (i) international trade policies through aviation services, such as Open Skies Agreements of the US, are alternative trade policy tools to reduce international trade barriers; (ii) direct flights facilitate the integration of internal markets as in the case of European Union.","[Yilmazkuday, Demet; Yilmazkuday, Hakan] Florida Int Univ, Dept Econ, Miami, FL 33199 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida International University,"Yilmazkuday, H (通讯作者)，Florida Int Univ, Dept Econ, Miami, FL 33199 USA.",demet.yilmazkuday@fiu.edu; hakan.yilmazkuday@fiu.edu,"Yilmazkuday, Hakan/GXZ-6757-2022","Yilmazkuday, Hakan/0000-0002-8629-6230; Yilmazkuday, Demet/0009-0006-1685-3413",,,,,31,10,10,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Using an international sample of banks from 98 countries over the period 1998-2007, I document that sound political institutions stimulate higher bank risk-taking. This is consistent with the hypotheses that better political institutions increase banks' risk by boosting the credit market competition from alternative sources of finance and generating the moral hazard problems due to the expectation of government bailouts in worst economic conditions. While it is contrary to the hypotheses that better political institutions decrease banks' risk by lowering the government expropriation risk and the information asymmetries between banks and borrowers. The results are robust to a number of sensitivity tests, including alternative proxies of bank risk-taking and political institutions, cross-sectional bank-and country-level regressions, endogeneity concerns of political institutions, country income levels, explicit deposit insurance schemes and sample extension from 1998 to 2014.

Large employment subcenters have emerged outside of central cities, competing against the traditional city center for labor and businesses. The existing literature on land use and transportation focuses on passenger travel, providing little insight into the impact of polycentric metropolitan development patterns on freight activity. In this study, we use the Los Angeles region as a case study to examine the relationship between urban spatial development patterns and freight travel. Using the National Employment Time Series (NETS) data, we identify employment subcenters in metropolitan Los Angeles. We characterize freight activities associated with the subcenters using data from the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG). We develop a regression model that estimates freight activity as a function of geographic characteristics, such as whether a location is in an employment subcenter, measures of nearby employment, access to the highway network, and proximity to intermodal freight facilities. The results indicate that employment is an important driver of freight activity; however, employment subcenters have an independent effect on freight activity. The results of this study suggest that further research on urban spatial structure and freight activity should assess the effects of employment subcenters and how their particular employment composition and characteristics are associated with freight activities at the metropolitan level. Such an approach would lead to more precise policy recommendations for urban goods movement. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on a sample of 9978 U.S. listed firms for the period 2001-2010 our evidence is inconsistent with managerial power. For instance, we find that the CPS of a newly appointed CEO does not differ to that of the outgoing CEO and also does not increase over time. Furthermore, we find no relation between the CPS and subsequent firm performance, or between a measure of excess CPS and subsequent firm performance. In addition, we show that most firms are quick to reduce excess CPS levels. However, for a small subsample in which excessive CPS persists, we observe a negative relation between CPS and subsequent firm performance. Overall our evidence is largely consistent with an efficient contracting explanation of CEO compensation as opposed to a managerial power explanation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

But how can this notion-long-run returns and volatilities being horizon dependent-be incorporated into formal pricing models? In this paper, we develop a unified risk-adjusted return metric that is applicable to both private assets and public securities.. Since such metric is based on a pair of empirically determined return and risk characteristic lines that depict the horizon impact on return and volatility, our performance metric is rooted in empirical evidence rather than assumptions. The results suggest that long-run asset performance cannot be adequately measured by single-period return and volatility. Rather, prudent long-run investment decisions must include careful consideration of the anticipated holding period and a proper understanding of the long-run return and risk characteristics.","[Cheng, Ping] Florida Atlantic Univ, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA; [Lin, Zhenguo] Florida Int Univ, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Liu, Yingchun] Univ North Texas, Denton, TX 76203 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University; State University System of Florida; Florida International University; University of North Texas System; University of North Texas Denton,"Cheng, P (通讯作者)，Florida Atlantic Univ, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA.",pcheng@fau.edu; zlin@fiu.edu; yingchun.liu@unt.edu,,,,,,,48,2,3,0,5,AMER REAL ESTATE SOC,CLEMSON,"CLEMSON UNIV, SCH BUSINESS & BEHAVIORAL SCI, DEPT FINANCE, 314 SIRRINE HALL, CLEMSON, SC 29634 USA",0896-5803,,,J REAL ESTATE RES,J.

This study examines the impact of profit warnings on market liquidity and finds that voluntary disclosure of bad news actually improves market liquidity. By conducting an empirical study over the period 1995-2010 on NYSE, NASDAQ and AMEX listed firms, we find that firms that issue profit warnings show enhanced market liquidity during the post-announcement period. We show that profit warnings reduce information asymmetry and lower bid-ask spreads and increase trading volumes. These results are invariant to daily (short run) and monthly (long run) data after controlling for firm specific attributes. The results have major corporate policy implications. By voluntarily disclosing negative earnings guidance by managers, firms will experience significant improvement in market liquidity, thereby lowering the cost of capital. Our results are even more profound for firms that release bad news with extremely negative stock market impact. In other words, voluntary disclosure of bad news is good for market liquidity.

In recent years, large-scale land acquisitions have drastically expanded; it is unclear whether the commons are a preferential target of these acquisitions. Here we argue that the contemporary global land rush could be happening at the expense of common-property systems around the world. While there is evidence that common-property systems have developed traditional institutions of resource governance that make them robust with respect to endogenous forces (e.g., uses by community members), it is less clear how vulnerable these arrangements are to exogenous drivers of globalization and expansion of transnational land investments. In common-property systems, farmers and local users may be unable to defend their customary rights and successfully compete with external actors. We define the notion of commons grabbing and report on an exploratory study that applied meta-analytical methods, drawing from the recent literature on large-scale land acquisitions and land grabbing. Informed by political economy and political ecology approaches, we coded selected cases on the basis of acquisition mechanisms, claims and property rights, changes in production system, and coercive dynamics, and explored the interactions between the different variables using association tests and qualitative comparative analysis. We found that the majority of the cases included in this analysis (44 of 56) could be examples of commons grabbing.

Scarcity of wood and negative impacts on health and environment have motivated efforts to design and distribute improved cook-stoves in developing countries. In India, adoption is limited despite massive promotion over many decades. Existing research suggests that many rural women in India do not want improved stoves, and those who do face obstacles to adoption. We step back from the many good case studies to examine the broader story of improved cook-stoves (ICs) in India. We do so by bringing together technical research of applied science and narrative critique of social science. Rather than assuming a priori that traditional stoves require replacement, we ask why Indian cook-stoves been a magnet for so much attention, why adoptions rates have remained low, and what lessons might be learned from a broad, multi-disciplinary perspective. Our approach is critical and reflexive, given our own involvement in IC efforts, and puts gender at the center. Our big picture review shows that the Indian chulha, for all its problems, is a remarkably successful technology which also satisfies several important household needs. Hence, targeting this device for obsolescence has profound implications that cannot be reduced to energy consumption or environmental hazards. Rural women do not prioritize ICs, but addressing their priorities requires either capital intensive investment or challenging powerful institutions. In contrast, IC interventions are relatively cheap, decentralized, mechanical and seemingly apolitical, hence their popularity in development programs. Our review of chulha research leads us to reject both the optimism of development planners who frame such problems as technical and the antagonistic pessimism of their critics. Searching for a middle ground requires stepping back from the dogma of efforts to improve biomass cook-stoves. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The administrations of Nestor Kirchner and Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner are among the left-of-centre, neo-developmental governments that were elected to power in Latin America in recent decades. This paper engages Gramsci's concepts of passive revolution and hegemony to analyse the political economy of the agrarian boom in Argentina, focusing on the frictions and contradictions of this national-popular project. I inspect the political economy of the agro-export boom, scrutinizing the political alliances and conflicts of the Kirchner governments, and the dilemmas that they have created for peasant movements. Between 2003 and 2015, peasant organizations supported the Kirchners as they discursively confronted Argentine agribusiness. Yet the neo-developmental approach of their administrations did little to address the socio-environmental impacts of the agro-export boom and the glaring material inequalities of rural Argentina, and instead supported authoritarian governors and favoured global agribusiness corporations.","[Lapegna, Pablo] Univ Georgia, Dept Sociol, 113 Baldwin Hall, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Lapegna, Pablo] Univ Georgia, Latin Amer & Caribbean Studies Inst, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Lapegna, P (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Dept Sociol, 113 Baldwin Hall, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",plapegna@uga.edu,,,U.S. Department of Education [P015A140046],U.S. Department of Education(US Department of Education),"U.S. Department of Education, Grant/Award Number: #P015A140046.",,64,24,32,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

In some regions, TOD has generated controversy, seen as impinging on the local populations' preferences for single-family housing, as well as the desire of developers to build that category of housing. In New Jersey, however, there has been increased policy support for TOD. The question addressed here is how, if at all, TOD and TOD-proximate residents' perceptions of the benefits and shortcomings of TOD are perceived and addressed by professionals involved with TOD planning and development A qualitative research approach was used, with focus groups with residents and structured interviews with professionals. A relatively well-fitting correspondence was found: There was broad agreement by residents and professionals on the value of transit and TOD for increased accessibility and walkability. Problems were identified with retail development and traffic problems; the latter expressed as a congestion problem by professionals but as a pedestrian safety problem by residents.

The choice of method matters for the conclusions drawn about the relationship between firm age and financing costs; the cross-sectional age profiles of financing costs are hump-shaped and consistent with hold-up theories, whereas methods that control for cohort fixed effects demonstrate that the financing costs decrease monotonically as the firms mature. The life-cycle profiles of the use of credit also indicate that firms are more dependent on financial intermediaries in the early periods of their lives. Furthermore, the cohorts born during recessions pay higher financing costs and use smaller amounts of bank loans, even after their creditworthiness is controlled for. The recession cohort effect appears to be more related to the experience of starting-up the firm in the recession than to the CEOs growing up in a recession during their early adulthood.

We find that there is always an incentive for the leader fiscal authority to play a three-stage game, which leaves the other fiscal authority worse off under demand shocks. This choice leads to more (less) volatile union-wide fiscal stance for demand (supply) shocks compared to the standard narrow-coordination case.

Undercharging for global warming accounts for 22% of the subsidy in 2013, air pollution 46%, broader vehicle externalities 13%, supply costs 11%, and general consumer taxes 8%. China was the biggest subsidizer in 2013 ($1.8 trillion), followed by the United States ($0.6 trillion), and Russia, the European Union, and India (each with about $0.3 trillion).

We find the relationship between FDI inflows and domestic entrepreneurship to be negative across all economies.

This suggests that a growing share of economic tasks could be performed by this new capital at the expense of labor. This paper evaluates the risk of job destructions induced by computer technology in Japan. We aim at assessing the vulnerability of employment from a technical point of view by considering jobs' differential dotation in non-programmable skills. Relying on machine learning technique, we find evidence that approximatively 55% of jobs are susceptible to be carried by computer capital in the next years. We also show that there is no significant difference on the basis of gender. On the contrary, non-regular jobs (those that concern temporary and part-time workers) are more vulnerable to computer technology diffusion than the others. These findings, based on technical background, shed light on the scale of the potential capital/labor substitution but this dynamics will also depends on economic and social factors.

The design has useful properties that have gone unnoticed in the applied and methodological literatures. This paper shows how to interpret the DRPT design using an instrumental variables (IV) framework. The IV framework reveals that the DRPT separately identifies three different treatment effect parameters: the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT), and the Average Treatment Effect on the Untreated (ATU). The ATE, ATT, and ATU parameters are important for program evaluation research because in realistic settings many social programs are optional rather than mandatory and some people who are eligible for a program choose not to participate. Most of the paper is concerned with the interpretation of the research design. To make the ideas concrete, the final section provides an empirical example using data from an existing DRPT study.

Significant cross-sectional variation exists in SPACs' performance, which can be explained by the strong implicit incentives embedded in contracts. SPAC performance is worse for acquisitions announced near the predetermined two-year deadline, for acquisitions with deferred initial public offering underwriting fees, and for acquisitions with market value close to the required 80% threshold. Also, sponsors' involvement in the merged firm's governance improves long-term performance.

Cognitive limitations leading to hyperbolic discounting and magnitude effects in intertemporal choice may be described in terms of bounded awareness, and represented by phenomena familiar from visualization software such as Google Earth. Cognitive limits on visualization impose constraints on both the area being viewed and the level of detail of the view, with a trade-off between the two. Increasing detail at the expense of limiting the area viewed may be described as zooming. Data from a field experiment were used to assess the theory with an incentive-compatible multiple price list approach involving magnitude levels of 5x, 10x and 20x the basic magnitude level with time horizons of one, three, six and 12 months. Without zooming adjustments in base consumption, very strong hyperbolic and magnitude effects were found, and present bias could not explain the hyperbolic effects. The zooming model provides an explanation of what appear to be significant intertemporal anomalies in the data.","[Holden, Stein T.] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Sch Econ & Business, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway; [Quiggin, John] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Norwegian University of Life Sciences; University of Queensland,"Holden, ST (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Sch Econ & Business, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway.",stein.holden@nmbu.no,"Holden, Stein/AAD-4502-2019; Quiggin, John/C-1621-2013","Quiggin, John/0000-0003-0398-8280",Norwegian University of Life Sciences; International Maize and Wheat Center (CIMMYT),Norwegian University of Life Sciences; International Maize and Wheat Center (CIMMYT)(CGIAR),"Funding for fieldwork for this research comes from Norwegian University of Life Sciences and the International Maize and Wheat Center (CIMMYT).

This paper analyzes the empirical application of a conceptual framework known as the Rural Web to evaluate the socio-economic complexity of a specific agribusiness value chain. This can be used as a complementary approach to traditional value chain analysis. The proposed framework goes beyond linear descriptions of product flows and examines how supply chains are built, shaped and reproduced over time and space, while considering social, cultural, environmental and political aspects. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework is a suitable method for value chain analysis, principally for those whose early stages are based on small and medium-sized rural actors. The Rural Web analysis offers decision-makers a platform to identify key actors not traditionally considered in value chain analysis, as well as the social interrelationships that occur at different dimensions. It also enables the identification of corrective and preventive measures to enhance agribusiness value chains.","[Arato, Miguel; Speelman, Stijn; Dessein, Joost; van Huylenbroeck, Guido] Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, Fac Biosci Engn, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"Arato, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, Fac Biosci Engn, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",marato@global.t-bird.edu,"Dessein, Joost/AAJ-6792-2020; Van Huylenbroeck, Guido/L-9251-2017","speelman, stijn/0000-0001-7692-3459; Dessein, Joost/0000-0001-6879-6269; Arato Garza, Miguel Jaime/0009-0002-8660-8932",,,,,59,6,8,3,30,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

The GF is to expect a negative correlation in a process that is in fact random. The HHF is more or less the opposite of thisto believe that another heads is more likely after a run of heads. The evidence for these fallacies comes largely from situations where they are not punished (lotteries, casinos, and laboratory experiments with random returns). In many real-world situations, such as in financial markets, succumbing to fallacies is costly, which gives an incentive to overcome them. The present study is based on high-frequency data from a market maker in the foreign exchange market. Trading behavior is only partly explained by the rational exploitation of past patterns in the data. There is also evidence of the GF: a tendency to sell the dollar after it has risen persistently or strongly.","[Bleaney, Michael; Bougheas, Spiros; Li, Zhiyong] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham, England",University of Nottingham,"Bougheas, S (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",spiros.bougheas@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Bougheas, Spiros/0000-0001-5561-6521",,,,,29,1,3,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

Given their structural similarities and extreme openness, standard explanations would expect to find similar policy responses over this period. However, between the 1960s and 1990s, bailout policies differed greatly between the two countries, particularly with respect to the use of their sovereign wealth funds (SWFs). This article also shows that the differing uses of SWFs reflected the respective regulatory environments. In line with an emerging stream of studies in comparative politics, the present article finds that these differences take root in the institutional settings of the respective countries and vary across state-business relations.","[Braunstein, Juergen] London Sch Econ, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Braunstein, J (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",J.Braunstein2@lse.ac.uk,,"Braunstein, Juergen/0000-0002-7692-2648",,,,,56,4,4,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1748-7870,1748-7889,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

History, random events (wars, oil crisis, sanctions, etc.) and past government policies are important factors shaping a country's trade patterns. Such factors are recognised in both traditional and new trade theory. Therefore the formulation (and implementation) of industrial and agricultural export policy has to be cognisant of these factors. In the search for new markets or new product opportunities in existing markets to inform both trade policy making and business decision making, a major challenge is making sense of the huge volumes of available product and market information, which is one of the manifestations of big data. Using an example from the South African fruit industry, this paper illustrates how the big data challenge can be tackled using the TRADE-Decision Support Model methodology. By means of this methodology an initial 1221 realistic export opportunties were identified in 107 markets. Of the overall 54 products in the fruit and nuts HS chapter 08 category, 22 have major potential, representing about US$3.5 billion across 102 countries. Most of the potential for mature products lies in new markets from a South African agriculture exports perspective. Of this potential 80 per cent is found in 10 products (including grapes, apples, mandarins, and lemons and limes). Some non-traditional products such as bananas, cashew nuts, kiwifruit and guavas were identified. Europe still represents approximately half of the total estimated realistic potential in the short term, estimated at US$6 billion, followed by North America (22 per cent) and Asia (21 per cent).","[Cameron, Martin] TRADE Advisory Serv Pty Ltd, Centurion, South Africa; [Viviers, Wilma] South Africa North West Univ, NWU, TRADE Trade & Dev Res Focus Area, Potchefstroom Campus, Potchefstroom, South Africa; [Steenkamp, Ezra] Dept Agr Forestry & Fisheries, Int Trade, Pretoria, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"Viviers, W (通讯作者)，South Africa North West Univ, NWU, TRADE Trade & Dev Res Focus Area, Potchefstroom Campus, Potchefstroom, South Africa.",Wilma.viviers@nwu.ac.za,"Viviers, Wilma/R-7877-2016","Viviers, Wilma/0000-0001-7471-7862","Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF), South Africa","Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF), South Africa","The research was supported by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF), South Africa.",,17,3,4,0,34,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2017,56.0,2,,,,,139,157,,10.1080/03031853.2017.1298456,0.0,,,19,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,EW9IJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402831700005,0

The Czech Republic has rankedon the top among the EU countires in the number of local self-governmets per 100 thousand inhabitants. The question, that has to be risen is whether such a number of municipalities are indispensable to ensuring the production and availability of administrative services, or whether it is merely a historical relic, which ultimately leads in many small communes instead of their development to an unavoidable management of scarcity. The aim of this paper is to measure the effectiveness of the local self-government system in the Czech Republic through the expenditures spend for the administration and the total expenditures of communes (villages, towns and cities). Based on the analysis of efficiency, we designed optimization models that could increase the efficiency of the entire system by 6.17%, which would release funds of 12.08 bil. CZK. These funds can thus be used without additional tax burden on the population or companies or any other debt increase to provide additional public services to citizens, thus helping to develop the villages, towns, cities and regions of the Czech Republic.","[Cernenko, Tomas] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Cernenko, T (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",tomas.cernenko@gmail.com,"Černěnko, Tomáš/AAE-3784-2019","Černěnko, Tomáš/0000-0002-2902-911X",VEGA [1/0965/15]; Performance Management in Local Government and its Application in Selected Municipalities in Slovakia,VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)); Performance Management in Local Government and its Application in Selected Municipalities in Slovakia,This paper was supported by the VEGA grant no. 1/0965/15 Performance Management in Local Government and its Application in Selected Municipalities in Slovakia.,,29,2,2,0,0,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

This tendency has been particularly relevant in Zambia, which has also emerged as an important surplus producer in southern Africa in recent years. Its favourable transport differential and non-GM maize has helped Zambia grow its share in Zimbabwean maize imports at the expense of South Africa, but exports into Zimbabwe remains competitive between the two countries and particularly during periods of export control in Zambia, South Africa typically steps in to supply the deficit. This study therefore evaluates the extent of price transmission between Zambia, South Africa and Zimbabwe under two exogenous regimes defined by periods of open trade and trade controls imposed by the Zambian government. It uses secondary data of monthly white maize prices in these three markets to quantify the long and short run price relationships under different regimes. While several authors have noted that trade is not a prerequisite for price transmission between markets, this study finds evidence that the imposition of policies that inhibit trade also influences the rate and nature of price transmission between markets. Periods of open trade were characterised by efficient transmission of prices from Zambia to Zimbabwe, which is in line with typical trade patterns, but during periods of trade controls, no relationship was found between Zambian and Zimbabwean markets, with prices being transmitted from South Africa to Zimbabwe instead.","[Davids, Tracy; Meyer, Ferdi] Univ Pretoria, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, Bur Food & Agr Policy, Pretoria, South Africa; [Westhoff, Patrick] Univ Missouri, Food & Agr Policy Res Inst, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Pretoria; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Davids, T (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, Bur Food & Agr Policy, Pretoria, South Africa.",tracy@bfap.co.za,"Davids, Tracy/AAH-3782-2019","Davids, Tracy/0000-0001-7576-8135",,,,,28,4,5,0,9,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2017,56.0,3,,,,,223,232,,10.1080/03031853.2017.1344133,0.0,,,10,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,FH0YL,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000410866500001,0

Contrary to prior studies, we use a respondent-centric approach to control for substitute sites. We assess each respondent-specific spatial context by computing densities of nature substitute sites within various ranges from each respondent's home. This approach considers the use and non-use values of nature together. Data from three similar discrete choice experiments carried out in Flanders (Belgium) are compared. Different spatial discounting factors are tested to explore how the substitution effect behaves with regard to distance. Latent class analyses are performed to account for preference heterogeneity among respondents. We observe divergent behaviours across groups of respondents. The distance-to-substitutes affects how respondents gauge substitute sites. We find a significant influence of the squared average buffer distance but this effect varies in sign across case studies and classes of respondents. Our results demonstrate that individual-specific GIS data can significantly improve the representation of the spatial context and the transferability of value functions. However, the roles played by preference heterogeneity and nature perception on respondents' capacity to value nature still deserves further attention in future research.","[De Valck, Jeremy; Vranken, Liesbet] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Geo Inst, Div Bioecon, Celestijnenlaan 200E, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium; [De Valck, Jeremy; Broekx, Steven; Liekens, Inge; Aertsens, Joris] Flemish Inst Technol Res VITO, B-2400 Mol, Belgium",KU Leuven; VITO,"De Valck, J (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Geo Inst, Div Bioecon, Celestijnenlaan 200E, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium.;De Valck, J (通讯作者)，Flemish Inst Technol Res VITO, B-2400 Mol, Belgium.",jeremy.devalck@ees.kuleuven.be,"liekens, inge/AGR-0217-2022; De Valck, Jeremy/K-4976-2018; Vranken, Liesbet/Q-1710-2018","liekens, inge/0000-0001-9708-7592; De Valck, Jeremy/0000-0002-5233-426X; Vranken, Liesbet/0000-0003-1170-1139; Broekx, Steven/0000-0002-0036-386X",Flemish Institute for Technological Research (VITO); Flemish Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology (IWT) (SBO project) [120014],Flemish Institute for Technological Research (VITO); Flemish Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology (IWT) (SBO project),"This study was carried out within the context of a PhD research project funded by the Flemish Institute for Technological Research (VITO).

J,"Dhongde, S",,,,"Dhongde, Shatakshee",,,Measuring Segregation of the Poor: Evidence from India,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,distribution; India; inequality; poverty; segregation,ECONOMIC-GROWTH; POVERTY; INEQUALITY,"Compared to the extensive literature on measurement of poverty, the question of how the poor are distributed regionally has received less attention. This paper fills the gap in the literature by providing a conceptual framework to measure inequality in the distribution of the poor. A poverty segregation curve is used to compare a region's share of the poor population with its share in the overall population. A unique contribution of the paper is formulating a generalized version of the poverty segregation curve. Unlike the segregation curve, the generalized segregation curve also takes average poverty rates into account while ranking distributions. Thus the generalized segregation curve may rank a distribution with substantially lower poverty rates above a distribution with higher poverty rates, when differences between their segregation curves are relatively small. The segregation curves are used to analyze changes in the distribution of the poor in India since the economic reforms in the early 1990s. Poverty rates and shares among all states, territories, and districts in India are estimated using data from the National Sample Survey Organization in 1994, 2004, and 2010. In the decades following the reforms India witnessed high growth rates and declining poverty rates. Despite the reduction in poverty, our analysis is the first to reveal that there was a significant rise in segregation of the poor over time. Some states had disproportionately high share of the poor compared to their share in the total population. Within states, the extent of segregation was lower among some of the poorest states and higher in less poor states. The generalized segregation curves show that the substantial decline in poverty rates since the reforms was not adequate to compensate the rise in segregation of the poor. Increase in segregation was also evident when the poor are identified as those who lacked education, health, and access to basic services. Reducing the segregation of the poor is important if India is to attain regionally balanced economic growth. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Dong, SX; Manning, C",,,,"Dong, Sarah Xue; Manning, Chris",,,Labour-Market Developments at a Time of Heightened Uncertainty,BULLETIN OF INDONESIAN ECONOMIC STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,economic growth; employment; labour productivity; training; minimum wages; Indonesia,INDONESIA,"These are testing times for labour-market policies in Indonesia. The country faces two major challenges in an unpredictable international and domestic environment: providing people with better, more secure jobs and raising productivity to help raise living standards and reduce poverty. Over the past several months, new global and domestic threats to economic growth have emerged and may hinder progress in jobs and productivity. In the longer term, the government is searching for new strategies to increase productivity, with a focus on supply-side investments in skills and training. In relation to events abroad, uncertainty has increased over the early initiatives taken by the new US president and his nationalist administration, such as the scuttling of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. At home, likely to be of some significance for economic policy are mass actions that were levelled against Jakarta's governor but de facto also directed against the government. In the medium term, our assessment of the record of the Joko Widodo (Jokowi) government on the labour market is mixed. Over the past two years, growth has been slower than under the previous administration and hence job creation has also been muted. The experience of a handful of countries in Asia suggests that the government might have done more to stimulate economic growth and create jobs. The disappointing performance of manufacturing stands out. Yet inflation has fallen and the slide in the value of international tradeboth exports and importshas reversed in recent months. Improved fiscal management and a generally successful tax amnesty are other pluses. There was also an unexpected but considerable fall in unemployment in 2015-16, according to labour-force statistics. Some policies, such as the new approach to minimum wages, seem to have had beneficial effects for both business and the economy, and Indonesia has done well in some international rankings, such as the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business index. However, the picture for the medium to longer term seems less bright for the labour market. There has been much talk about raising productivity by improving skills through government support for investment in training and apprenticeships, as well as by expanding vocational training along the lines of the German model. Expanding tourism is seen as one solution to the lack of employment for young secondary- and tertiary-educated jobseekers. But we have an impression of policy-making on the run; often, the argument for government intervention has not been made clearly enough. We argue that Indonesia still lacks a coherent, well-thought-out plan to increase jobs and productivity. Saat ini kebijakan-kebijakan pasar tenaga kerja di Indonesia sedang menghadapi ujian. Ada dua tantangan besar di lingkungan domestik dan internasional yang susah diprediksi, yaitu: penciptaan lapangan kerja yang lebih baik dan lebih aman serta peningkatan produktivitas demi memperbaiki standar hidup dan mengurangi kemiskinan. Dalam beberapa bulan terakhir, tantangan-tantangan domestik dan global yang baru telah muncul dan berpotensi memperlambat kemajuan di lingkungan pekerjaan dan tingkat produktivitas. Sedangkan dalam jangka yang lebih panjang, pemerintah tengah mencari strategi baru untuk meningkatkan produktivitas dengan berfokus kepada investasi di sisi penawaran dalam hal keterampilan dan pelatihan. Akan halnya peristiwa-peristiwa internasional, ketidakpastian juga semakin meningkat, dimulai dengan berbagai inisiatif dini yang dikeluarkan oleh presiden Amerika Serikat (AS) yang baru dan pemerintahannya yang bersifat nasionalistik, termasuk mundurnya AS dari Kemitraan Trans-Pasifik (Trans-Pacific Partnership). Di dalam negeri, ketidakpastian juga muncul dalam tindakan-tindakan massa yang tampaknya diarahkan kepada gubernur Jakarta, namun sesungguhnya bisa berdampak kepada pemerintahan negara saat ini. Dalam jangka menengah, telaah kami mengenai rekam jejak pemerintahan Joko Widodo (Jokowi) dalam hal pasar tenaga kerja membawa kepada kesimpulan yang beragam. Dalam dua tahun terakhir, pertumbuhan ekonomi lebih lambat jika dibandingkan dengan pemerintahan sebelumnya, dan oleh karenanya, penciptaan lapangan pekerjaan baru juga lebih sedikit. Pengalaman di berbagai negara di Asia menunjukkan bahwa pemerintah seharusnya bisa melakukan lebih banyak langkah untuk mendorong pertumbuhan ekonomi dan menciptakan lapangan pekerjaan. Kinerja yang mengecewakan di sektor industri pengolahan adalah contoh yang jelas. Namun di sisi lain, inflasi telah turun sementara nilai perdagangan internasional, baik pada ekspor dan impor mulai naik kembali. Perbaikan dalam manajemen fiskal dan keberhasilan program pengampunan pajak secara umum adalah nilai tambah yang lain. Selain itu, ada juga penurunan tak terduga namun cukup baik pada tingkat pengangguran sepanjang 2015-16, menurut Survei Angkatan Kerja Nasional. Beberapa kebijakan, seperti pendekatan baru terhadap upah minimum, nampaknya telah memberikan manfaat bagi dunia usaha dan perekonomian. Indonesia juga telah semakin memperbaiki posisinya pada beberapa pemeringkatan internasional, seperti peringkat dalam Indeks Kemudahan Berusaha yang dilansir oleh World Bank. Meski demikian, gambaran jangka menengah dan panjang nampak lebih redup bagi pasar tenaga kerja. Ada banyak diskusi mengenai cara menaikkan produktivitas dengan peningkatan keterampilan dengan dukungan pemerintah melalui investasi di program pelatihan dan magang serta melalui pengembangan pelatihan vokasi seperti yang dilakukan di Jerman. Pengembangan pariwisata dilihat sebagai salah satu solusi menghadapi kurangnya lapangan pekerjaan bagi pencari kerja muda yang telah menamatkan pendidikan, baik sekunder maupun tersier. Namun demikian, penulis mendapat kesan, bahwa pada pembuatan kebijakan-kebijakan yang tengah berjalan, seringkali argumen bagi perlunya intervensi pemerintah tidak dibuat dengan jelas. Para penulis berpendapat bahwa Indonesia masih kekurangan rencana yang koheren yang dipikirkan dengan baik untuk menambah pekerjaan dan produktivitas.","[Dong, Sarah Xue; Manning, Chris] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Dong, SX (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,,"Dong, Sarah/0000-0002-6682-6644",,,,,24,8,11,2,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

The main results can be summarized as follows. First, there is evidence of a structural break in real GDP toward stronger mean growth and a substantial reduction in volatility. Second, the timing of the breaks suggests that the important changes in economic policies of the 1980s and 1990s have been effective in permanently improving economic growth in the region. These changes in the growth processes imply recessions that are shorter in duration and milder in amplitude. The sustained increase in commodity prices observed in recent years explains an important share of growth in the region since 2003. But after accounting for the effect of commodity prices, there is even stronger evidence of a structural break in real GDP growth.","[Fossati, Sebastian] Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H4, Canada",University of Alberta,"Fossati, S (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H4, Canada.",sfossati@ualberta.ca,,,,,,,29,1,1,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1074-3529,1465-7287,,CONTEMP ECON POLICY,Contemp.

The authors that are studying economic diplomacy have refrained from defining the very term and emphasize that it is a discipline that is constantly changing and evolving. There is no universal solution or a unique model of economic diplomacy, but there are several frameworks through which the system is usually carried out. The analysis presented in this paper was made using the desktop method. Relevant available documents, studies, books and scientific papers were analyzed and interviews were conducted with a dozen of major Croatian businessmen and their qualitative assessments of economic diplomacy in Croatia are summarized. The following theoretical models of economic diplomacy have been analyzed: a unified model, a partially unified model, a third agency model, a model of competition and a model of resignation. These models are presented through a comparative analysis on the case of Croatia, and in the concluding reviews and recommendations it is pointed to the key challenges ahead of Croatian diplomacy connected with economic breakthroughs in the future. The results of the analysis indicate that there is still no consensus in Croatia on which body would be best suited to promote economic interests, whether commercial diplomats from the Ministries of Foreign and European Affairs and other ministries, county offices, cities and municipalities, the Croatian Chamber of Economy and the Croatian Employers' Association, commercial diplomats from other states and associations. The overall conclusion is that in spite of the fact that entrepreneurs recognize the need for services provided by Croatian economic diplomacy, it is clear there is a need for stronger coordination of different bodies, especially when it comes to harmonizing domestic policies that could enhance the competitiveness of entrepreneurs on the foreign market.","[Grgurevic, Davor] Minist Interior, Zagreb, Croatia; [Tisma, Sanja] Inst Dev & Int Relat, Zagreb, Croatia",Institute for Development & International Relations,"Grgurevic, D (通讯作者)，Minist Interior, Zagreb, Croatia.",davor.grgurevic@gmail.com; sanja.tisma@irmo.hr,,,,,,,12,0,0,1,5,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2017,,,,,,,872,884,,,,,,13,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7PJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455302900055,0

These agribusinesses go under the name of mega-farms or agroholdings: horizontally or vertically integrated operations with farm sizes of up to 500,000 hectares and sometimes even more. These types of farms are not only found in crop farming, but also in animal husbandry. Although some information on agroholdings and other forms of mega-farming operations is available, a systematic analysis of their prevalence, economic performance as well as their social and environmental implications in an international perspective is missing. In this special issue of the International Food and Agribusiness Management Review we present a number of papers that highlight the different aspects of such farms. In this editorial we introduce the topic of agroholdings and place the papers in within the context of the available literature.

The research on corporate governance structure is also a very important content in the academic circle. The analysis of this paper is based on the insurance industry in China. Then I collected several major insurance companies' operating data in China's insurance market, collected major insurance companies' information disclosure such as Ping an Insurance Group, Pacific Insurance Company and analyzed China's major insurance company governance structure. Besides, I selected ROA to measure the efficiency of insurance companies. Then I selected some governance structure variables such as board size, proportion of directors with legal background, proportion of independent directors, proportion of female director, the leadership structure of director board and so on. Using the regression analysis model, I analyzed the relationship between efficiency and the variables of insurance companies. Through the above analysis, we want to get the efficiency of the insurance companies, and the relationship between the efficiency of the insurance companies and the variables of corporate governance structure. So the insurance company can compare the factors that affect the efficiency of the insurance company with their own operating conditions, which can help companies achieve the purpose of improving the governance structure of insurance companies.","[Hou Jinyu] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Insurance, Insurance, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Hou, JY (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Insurance, Insurance, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",928129265@qq.com,,,,,,,17,0,0,1,3,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,,,,,2017,,,,,,,541,554,,,,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK8HD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000442810700038,0

The positive effect of innovation output (measured by gross profit margin of enterprise product sales) on innovation performance (measured by labor productivity) is significant. In addition, it also reveals that the enterprise's innovation performance is also influenced by per capita investment in fixed assets, turnover rate of fixed asset, employee quality, government support, spillover effect, etc. But industrial effect and industry-university-research cooperation have no significant impact on enterprise's innovation performance.","[Huang, Yangyang; Gao, Guangkuo] Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol, Business Sch, Shanghai, Peoples R China",University of Shanghai for Science & Technology,"Huang, YY (通讯作者)，Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol, Business Sch, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",,,,"National Social Science Fund of China [15BTJ017]; Climb Plan Project of Humanities and Social Science of USST [SK17PA01]; Municipal and University's Training Programs of Innovation and Entrepreneurship for Undergraduates [SH2017064, XJ2017104]",National Social Science Fund of China; Climb Plan Project of Humanities and Social Science of USST; Municipal and University's Training Programs of Innovation and Entrepreneurship for Undergraduates,"The work in the paper was funded by National Social Science Fund of China (15BTJ017), Climb Plan Project of Humanities and Social Science of USST (SK17PA01), Municipal and University's Training Programs of Innovation and Entrepreneurship for Undergraduates (SH2017064, XJ2017104).

This phenomenon is not well understood from an economic perspective. We rationalize the existence of city walls by developing a simple model that relates the dimensions and quality of city walls to a set of economic and geographic variables. We report an empirical analysis using hand collected and previously unutilized data on city walls in the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) Dynasties. We find that the circumference of a city wall is correlated with local economic and geographic conditions, that wall size is positively correlated with population size in the jurisdiction, and that frontier cities subject to a higher probability of attack tend to have stronger city walls. We examine the physical size distribution of walled cities in late imperial China and show that city sizes above a certain cutoff follow a Pareto law, although the Pareto coefficient decreases algebraically with the cutoff point. This result complements findings in the existing literature that focuses almost exclusively on the population size distribution of cities. We also find that cities with walls in the past have higher employment and population densities at the present time. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The competitive position was evaluated on the basis on evaluation of resulting measures of foreign trade situation, which is relative share in export of one's country food producers among other countries in EU market. There were no statistical dependences between measurements of production potential and its competitive position of food industry stated. Comparison of classification of EU countries among the indicators allowed to form conclusions about dependence between analyzed factors. The biggest impact on the share of export market within food products, has effectiveness of usage of labor factor. The level of this indicator along with low production potential within food industry of evaluated countries, causes that their share in export market is rather irrelevant.","[Juchniewicz, Malgorzata] Univ Warmia & Mazury, Ul Oczapowskiego 4, PL-10 Olsztyn, Poland",University of Warmia & Mazury,"Juchniewicz, M (通讯作者)，Univ Warmia & Mazury, Ul Oczapowskiego 4, PL-10 Olsztyn, Poland.",malgorzata.juchniewicz@uwm.edu.pl,"Juchniewicz, Małgorzata/ABE-5368-2021","Juchniewicz, Małgorzata/0000-0002-7672-6030",,,,,26,1,1,1,5,BC GRUP INC,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH, 2134 SOK, DERELI APT.

We develop new measures of asset redeployability by accounting for the usability of assets within and across industries. We identify plausibly exogenous shocks to economic uncertainty by using major economic and political events. We find that after an increase in uncertainty, firms using less redeployable capital reduce investment more. More redeployable assets exhibit higher recovery rates and are traded more actively in secondary markets. Overall, our results suggest that frictions in redeploying assets affect liquidation values and therefore make firms cautious about investment decisions under uncertainty.","[Kim, Hyunseob] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Kung, Howard] London Business Sch, London, England",Cornell University; University of London; London Business School,"Kim, H (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Samuel Curtis Johnson Grad Sch Management, Sage Hall,114 East Ave, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",hk722@cornell.edu,"Kung, Howard/O-6693-2016; Kim, Hyunseob/C-9051-2014",,Kwanjeong Educational Foundation,Kwanjeong Educational Foundation,"We thank two anonymous referees and the editor Itay Goldstein for their comments and guidance.

This pattern reflects the dynamics of the within-industry distortion measures for most industries and is consistent with the evolving systematic relationship between the age/value added of establishments and their measured idiosyncratic distortions over the sample period.

The method used in this study is Granger Causality Test and used series data from 1986-2014. Granger Causality Test showed that energy subsidy has weak influenced (significant at 10%) to CO2 emissions and statistically proves that energy subsidy is the reason to the change of CO2 emissions. While industrial energy consumption has strong influenced (significant at 1%) to CO2 emissions, and energy price has strong influenced (significant at 1%) to the change in industrial energy consumption. Based on the discussion, it clearly conduces to pro-growth, pro-job and pro-poor but not fully promote pro-environment. Therefore, we suggest that CO2 emissions can be reduced by the cost developing green energy technologies. Energy subsidy should improve its focus on allocating funds on research that seeking renewable energy, applying environmentally friendly technologies, in order to achieve sustainable energy development, and to protect the environment from environmental degradation caused by increasing CO2 emissions in Indonesia.","[Makbul, Dede Supriatna; Wang, Yantao; Rodkrajab, Janthima] Northeast Elect Power Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Jilin, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Dijaya, Satria] South China Normal Univ, Sch Educ & Teaching Curriculum, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Northeast Electric Power University; South China Normal University,"Wang, YT (通讯作者)，Northeast Elect Power Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Jilin, Jilin, Peoples R China.",,,,Social Science Fund of Jilin Province [2017JD45],Social Science Fund of Jilin Province,The work of this study is supported by Social Science Fund of Jilin Province (2017JD45).,,20,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-405-7,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,37.0,,,,,,338,347,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ9PC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000429699600025,0

News implied volatility (NVIX) peaks during stock market crashes, times of policy-related uncertainty, world wars, and financial crises. In US postwar data, periods when NVIX is high are followed by periods of above average stock returns, even after controlling for contemporaneous and forward-looking measures of stock market volatility. News coverage related to wars and government policy explains most of the time variation in risk premia our measure identifies. Over the longer 1890-2009 sample that includes the Great Depression and two world wars, high NVIX predicts high future returns in normal times and rises just before transitions into economic disasters. The evidence is consistent with recent theories emphasizing time variation in rare disaster risk as a source of aggregate asset prices fluctuations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Water supply in rural areas is among the main issues needing attention. Whereas certain improvements were introduced in the legislative and institutional frameworks in recent years, there are still significant problems related to the citizens' access to safe and affordable water services. According to the entity strategies on water management, 40% of country's population does not have access to controlled water supply. This is a considerable challenge in the context of meeting the Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG6) which imposes the task of reducing the inequality in water service provision for all people. Objectives of this paper are to identify the types of water operators in rural areas, analyze their performance and explore outcomes in terms of population coverage, service quality and efficiency, with special attention paid to the affordability issue. The primary data collection was conducted by screening the rural water supply situation in 48 local governments and studying 20 selected cases using structured interviews with local governments, service operators and 600 households. Local governments are legally responsible for water supply, but they operate negligible number of water schemes; public utilities operate 13%, while informal citizen groups operate 74% of water schemes. Due to informal character of the predominant operator, water delivered to rural citizens is of questionable quality. Findings of this research contribute to the empirical base for understanding of how water operators work and how citizens perceive services. Local governments are recommended to design innovative approaches for improved rural water supply, which will contribute to realization of SDG6.","[Mihajlovic, Snezana Misic] Ctr Management Dev & Planning, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg; [Vucijak, Branko] Univ Sarajevo, Fac Mech Engn, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Sarajevo,"Mihajlovic, SM (通讯作者)，Ctr Management Dev & Planning, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg.",snezana.misic@mdpinicijative.ba; vucijak@mef.unsa.ba,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,4,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2017,,,,,,,841,855,,,,,,15,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7PJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455302900053,0

When analysed, the behaviour of market participants indicates that the introduction of investment applications of the cryptocurrency, in parallel with its original payment application, had a tremendous impact on the larger-scale functioning of the system. This was aided by the functioning of many trading platforms allowing for exchange into traditional currencies and a high volatility of quotations. Without doubt, bitcoin may be branded a ground-breaking financial innovation or a work of genius. However, the growing, and even global use of bitcoin has brought some of the system's imperfections to light. As the system developed, bitcoin users started to have a better view of the threats to the correct functioning of the system arising from its construction. The paper aims to indicate the main barriers limiting the functioning of the bitcoin system, and its use in payments in particular. The work has adopted the following research hypothesis: In the early stages of bitcoin functioning, users had little awareness of the technological flaws of the system. The study analyses the literature on the subject and the results of a survey carried out among Polish bitcoin users. The analysis confirms of the research hypothesis, as it shows that in the system's first several years, users identified the following threats to the system's functioning: the speculative nature of bitcoin, the lack of adequate awareness in society which would allow for a widespread use of the innovation, potential too strict regulation of the cryptocurrencies market or its banning. The authors also present threats to the functioning of the system which in their opinion are of greatest importance at the moment. These relate to the existence of intermediaries, the lack of systemic incentives addressed to bitcoin merchants, growing costs and payment processing time. The authors intend to indicate those aspects of bitcoin's functioning in order to make the use of cryptocurrencies more conscious and contribute to limiting financial risk of system users.","[Piotrowska, Anna Iwona] WSB Univ Torun, Torun, Poland; [Piotrowski, Dariusz] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Piotrowska, AI (通讯作者)，WSB Univ Torun, Torun, Poland.",,"Piotrowska, Anna/E-6167-2016","Piotrowska, Anna Iwona/0000-0002-0571-0664",,,,,32,0,0,0,22,INTL INST SOCIAL & ECONOMIC SCI,PRAGUE,"TREBESOVSKA 2038/14, PRAGUE, 193 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87927-38-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,58,68,,10.20472/EFC.2017.008.005,0.0,,,11,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6OC,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426884200005,0

Such changing dynamics in the family may potentially reverse the current preference for sons in China, implying that those with sons, rather than daughters, may be increasingly in need of state support.","[Porter, Maria] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, Justin S Morrill Hall Agr,446 West Circle Dr, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Porter, M (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, Justin S Morrill Hall Agr,446 West Circle Dr, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",mporter1@anr.msu.edu,,,University of Chicago Center on Aging; Oxford Institute of Population Ageing,University of Chicago Center on Aging; Oxford Institute of Population Ageing,"I am grateful to the editor, two anonymous referees, Gary Becker, Michele Belot, Marianne Bertrand, Martin Browning, Kerwin Charles, Pierre-Andre Chiappori, Markus Eberhardt, Marcel Fafchamps, Sarah Harper, Songqing Jin, Leah Lakdawala, Steven Levitt, Jens Ludwig, Paul Menchik, Emily Oster, Albert Park, Junsen Zhang, and Zhenmei Zhang for their valuable comments and suggestions.

The questionnaire was drawn to the target group of university students in Slovakia. One of the main findings of the work is that we do not monitor the statistical significant addiction to smoking among respondents. Differences across genders are reflected in the alcohol consumption and the monthly alcohol expenditure by respondents. We do not record significant dependence on the impact of socio-economic status on the health behavior of respondents. Alcohol and smoking are a global problem. In recent years we follow the growing number of fatal disease. These disease are the main part of the avoidable mortality Reducing the negative determinants of avoidable mortality, especially the disease caused by smoking and alcohol consumption, should be a challenge for the health care system in the Slovak Republic in the coming years.

Over the last decades, technological progress and reorganisation of production activities across industries and national economies has led to an overall decline in employment and value-added shares of manufacturing in advanced countries. After the recent economic crisis, policymakers across the globe called for an `industrial renaissance' and took steps for a re-industrialisation of their economies. On the other hand, outsourcing and continuous fragmentation of global value chains decrease the relevance of direct employment and value-added effects of manufacturing for overall economic performance. Therefore, an analysis of deindustrialisation processes calls for an approach that considers complex linkages among industries. Input-output analysis is a suitable tool for capturing these indirect effects, which cannot be visible in simple statistics. The aim of the paper is to investigate the magnitude and the significance of the so-called deindustrialisation in selected European countries, with emphasis on Slovakia. The analysis is based on data from the World Input-Output Database. In this paper, the version released in 2013 covering the period from 1995 to 2011 including the socio-economic accounts with employment data is used. These data are used for the analysis of indirect effects of manufacturing on production, value added and employment. They are also used for the analysis of both value added and employment development in Slovakia.","[Stracova, Erika] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Stracová, E (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",erika.stracova@euba.sk,"Stracová, Erika/AAO-9690-2020",,[I-17-104-00 Socialno-ekonomicke],,This paper results from research conducted in the framework of the project No. I-17-104-00 Socialno-ekonomicke aspekty deindustrializacie (University of Economics in Bratislava).,,7,0,0,0,0,VYDAVATELSTVO EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"DOLNOZENSKA CESTA 1-B, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-4429-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,437,446,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP5LI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000556157800051,0

Descriptively, indigenous Janajatis and lower caste Hindus exhibit the highest rates of chronic and structural poverty. Panel data models suggest significant roles of human capital and household assets in determining poverty, however, with the evidence of caste/ethnic penalty limited mostly to Janajatis.

China's insurance industry has focused on return to the nature of protection and developed commercial endowment insurance these years, but the commercial annuity market share is far from satisfactory. On the demand side, pensions provided by China's government-sponsored security insurance is not sufficient, and under the pressure of aging population, the commercial annuity is to supplement the basic security insurance as the share of basic security insurance may gradually decline. In addition, enterprise annuity in China takes the form of accumulated personal account, only stressing the accumulation of contribution period but not guaranteeing distribution after retirement. As more and more enterprise annuity individual accounts are about to reach the distribution period, it is urgent to provide annuity products to help the individual accounts converted into lifetime pensions at retirement. Besides, under the high savings rate, a huge number of assets are saving for ageing, so these parts of assets also need to transform into pension funds. On the supply side, China's commercial endowment insurance market is highly undeveloped, and most of the annuity insurances are short-term insurances. Even though there are few annuity insurance products, they provide pensions within a certain period of time or age, and the life-long annuity products are extremely rare in the market. So, what is the main reason constrain the development of commercial pension in China? Why people with pension assets do not choose to buy commercial annuity? Why insurance companies rarely offer lifelong annuity products? Based on the actual research data, this paper mainly uses the money's worth ratio and the implied rate of return and other indicators of the annuity to measure and analyze the impacts of inverse selection cost, longevity risk cost, expense cost and investment opportunity loss cost of several Chinese annuity products. The results show that the adverse selection has a great influence on the actual value of annuity, which will reduce the value ratio of annuity by 16%. The effect of longevity improves the value of annuities; the expense cost reduces the value ratio of annuity by 10.2%; the impact of all the risk factors reduce annuity value ratio by 24.5%. Moreover, the expectations of the annuity of the product rate is far lower than expected in China's insurance market. At the same time, there are bequest motive and liquidity requirements, which also hinder the commercial annuity.","[Wang Xiaojun; Lu Qian; Wang Qiqi] Renmin Univ China, Sch Stat, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,"Lu, Q (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Stat, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",xiaojun_wang@ruc.edu.cn; luqian2016@ruc.edu.cn; qiqiwang@ruc.edu.cn,"wang, qi/IAN-4150-2023; wang, qi/HTN-8786-2023","wang, qi/0000-0002-2794-6897;",,,,,20,0,0,0,3,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,,,,,2017,,,,,,,609,628,,,,,,20,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK8HD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000442810700043,0

The characterisation of urban residents' transit trips can provide a first-hand reference for the evaluation, management and planning of public transport. Over the past two decades, data from smart card have become a new source of travel survey data, providing more comprehensive spatial-temporal information about urban public transport trips. In this paper, a multi-step methodology for mining smart card data is developed to analyse the spatial-temporal characteristics of bus travel demand. Using the bus network in Guangzhou, China, as a case study,.a smart card dataset is first processed to quantitatively estimate the travel demand at the bus stop level. The term 'bus service coverage' is introduced to map the bus travel demand from bus stops to regions. This dataset is Used to create heat maps that visualise the regional distribution of bds travel demand. To identify the distribution patterns of bus travel demand, two-dimensional principal component analysis and principal component analy is are applied to extract the features of the heat maps, and the Gaussian mixture model is used for the feature clustering. The proposed methodology visually reveals the spatial-temporal patterns of bus travel demand and provides a practical set of visual analytics for transit trip characterisation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

First, we focus not only on children's education but also on children's health, which has received rather little attention in the literature. Secondly, we use a new source of exogenous variation in fertility - variations of the strictness of the One-Child policy across localities in China - to construct instrumental variable's (IV's).

Using the local Whittle estimator and some of its variants we assess whether relative per capita missions are long memory processes which, although highly persistent, may revert to their mean/trend in the long run thereby indicating evidence of stochastic convergence. Furthermore, we test whether (possibly) slow convergence or the complete lack of it may be the result of structural changes to the deterministics of each of the relative per-capita emissions series by means of the tests of Berkes et al. (Ann Stat 1140-1165, 2006) and Mayoral (Oxford Bull Econ Stat 74(2):278-305, 2012). Our results show relatively weak support for stochastic convergence of emissions, indicating that only between 30 and 40% of the countries converge to the OECD average in a stochastic sense. This weak evidence disappears if we enlarge the sample to include 4 out of the 5 BRICS, indicating that our results are not robust to the inclusion of countries which are experiencing rates of growth which are far larger than those of the OECD members. Our results also decisively indicate that a slow or lack of convergence is not the results of a structural break in the relative emissions series.","[Barassi, Marco R.; Zhao, Yuqian] Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Spagnolo, Nicola] Brunel Univ London, Dept Econ, London, England; [Spagnolo, Nicola] CNR, ISSM, Naples, Italy; [Spagnolo, Nicola] Natl Australian Univ, CAMA, Canberra, ACT, Australia",University of Birmingham; Brunel University; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Studi Sulle Societa Del Mediterraneo (ISSM-CNR); Australian National University,"Barassi, MR (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",m.r.barassi@bham.ac.uk,,"Barassi, Marco/0000-0001-8945-2457",,,,,45,18,19,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We choose two specifications of the adaptive models: a simple local AR (LAR) model for a univariate implied volatility series and an adaptive dynamic Nelson-Siegel (ADNS) model of three factors, each based on an LAR, to model the cross-section of the TSIV simultaneously with parsimony. Both LAR and ADNS models uniformly outperform more than a dozen alternative models with significance across maturities for 1-20 day forecast horizons. Measured by RMSE and MAE, the forecast errors of the random walk model can be reduced by between 20% and 60% for the 5 to 20 days ahead forecast. In terms of prediction accuracy of future directional changes, the adaptive models achieve an accuracy range of 60%-90%, which strictly dominates the range of 30%-59% of the alternative models.","[Chen, Ying] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Stat & Appl Probabil, Singapore, Singapore; [Han, Qian; Niu, Linlin] Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ WISE, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Han, Qian; Niu, Linlin] Xiamen Univ, MOE Key Lab Econometr, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Niu, Linlin] Xiamen Univ, Gregory & Paula Chow Ctr Econ Res, Xiamen, Peoples R China",National University of Singapore; Xiamen University; Xiamen University; Xiamen University,"Niu, LL (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Rm A306,Econ Bldg, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.",llniu@xmu.edu.cn,,,"Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund [FRC R-155-000-178-114]; Institute of Data Science grant at the National University of Singapore [R-155-000-185-646]; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71528008]; NSFC [71528008, 71471153, 7163000017, 71273007]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Germany through the SFB 649 Economic Risk; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China [20720181004]; Humboldt Universitaet zu Berlin-National University of Singapore Joint Grant [R-155-000-199-114]","Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund(Ministry of Education, Singapore); Institute of Data Science grant at the National University of Singapore(National University of Singapore); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Germany through the SFB 649 Economic Risk(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Humboldt Universitaet zu Berlin-National University of Singapore Joint Grant(National University of Singapore)","Ying Chen acknowledges the support of the Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 1 grant (FRC R-155-000-178-114), Institute of Data Science grant (R-155-000-185-646) at the National University of Singapore, and Humboldt Universitaet zu Berlin-National University of Singapore Joint Grant (R-155-000-199-114) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) Grant (No. 71528008).

Employing a difference-in-difference estimator we find that the loan forgiveness component of the program was effective, reducing mean attrition rates for middle and high school math and science teachers by 10.4 percent and 8.9 percent, respectively. We also find that the impact of loan forgiveness varied with the generosity of payments; when fully funded, the program reduced attrition of special education teachers by 12.3 percent, but did not have a statistically significant impact when funding was substantially reduced. A triple-difference estimate indicates that a one-time bonus program also had large effects, reducing the likelihood of teachers' exit by as much as 32 percent in the short run. A back-of-the-envelope cost-benefit analysis suggests that both the loan forgiveness and the bonus program were cost effective.

Most business enterprises consider it a risky process and therefore resist doing it. In our research, we aim to test the possibility of changing management style in the course of a project from a theoretical point of view. Normally, the classic waterfall is considered as an obvious project management style, while a change would mean a shift to the agile management style. Switching between the classic and agile management style during one project is an area which needs deeper consideration. Since there is a lack of documented samples, a questionnaire was prepared to determine if this switch is possible. The data were collected through an anonymous online survey and controlled by the 4 level scale to avoid concentration in a medium answer (5 Likert scheme) Taken mainly from SMEs, the survey results show that there is a positive overall sign that a transition between classic and agile management style over the project life cycle is possible, but only in the areas suitable for agile management. By analyzing the 119 responses of project managers and using the Fisher's exact test, we have shown that it is possible to change management style during a project. The change increases the competitiveness of SMEs in order to determine how to proceed in the implementation of projects. The research should continue with the monitoring of a real project which is undertaking the switch from the classic to the agile approach.","[Gablas, Branislav] Pan European Univ, Fac Econ & Entrepreneurship, Dept Management & Mkt, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Ruzicky, Eugen] Pan European Univ, Fac Informat, Dept Appl Informat, Bratislava, Slovakia",Pan-European University; Pan-European University,"Gablas, B (通讯作者)，Pan European Univ, Fac Econ & Entrepreneurship, Dept Management & Mkt, Bratislava, Slovakia.",Branislav.gablas@gmail.com; eugen.ruzicky@paneurouni.com; ondrouchovam@email.cz,,"Ruzicky, Eugen/0000-0001-7940-3782",,,,,38,8,17,4,70,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

Two potential channels are identified: the financial constraint channel and the corporate governance channel. Specifically, the negative effect of liquidity on diversification is stronger among financially-constrained firms, since higher liquidity helps firms improve external capital markets and thus reduces the need to broaden the internal capital markets through diversification. Moreover, the effect of liquidity on diversification is strengthened among firms with severe information asymmetry, since enhanced price informativeness caused by increased liquidity promotes market monitoring and deters managers' opportunistic diversification decisions. Meanwhile, we rule out the alternative explanation that liquidity discourages diversification by facilitating blockholders' monitoring on managers' decisions. Our results suggest that stock liquidity plays a positive role in corporate decision making.","[Gu, Lifeng; Yao, Wentao] Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yixin; Zhang, Yilin] Peking Univ, HSBC Business Sch, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong; Peking University,"Gu, LF (通讯作者)，Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Zhang, YL (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, HSBC Business Sch, Beijing, Peoples R China.",oliviagu@hku.hk; wangyixin@sz.pku.edu.cn; yaowt029@connect.hku.hk; ylzhang@phbs.pku.edu.cn,"Gu, Lifeng/I-7964-2013",,,,,,70,11,13,7,47,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5398,1879-1727,,J EMPIR FINANC,J.

Places do not operate in a vacuum and to understand the effect of own density on start-up patterns, we need to account for the urban spillovers or borrowed size that they may experience from other places nearby. The results can explain the empirical ambiguity in the relationship between urbanization and start-up patterns: the relationship between urbanization and start-up rates becomes more similar between countries when controlling for country-specific settlement patterns by including a spatially lagged urbanization variable and variables measuring the distance to urban centers. Accounting for the relative location of places and relevant sorting effects, we find that own density has a consistently negative effect on start-up activity. Yet, access to other places has a generally positive effect. This implies that nearby regions profit from the advantages offered by urban environments without having to deal with the costs involved.","[Hans, Lianne; Koster, Sierdjan] Univ Groningen, Urban & Reg Studies Inst, Dept Econ Geog, Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Hans, L (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Urban & Reg Studies Inst, Dept Econ Geog, Groningen, Netherlands.",l.hans@rug.nl; sierdjan.koster@rug.nl,,"koster, sierdjan/0000-0001-6047-920X",,,,,65,6,8,4,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The capabilities that he discusses are, for the most part, simply technologies that can be thought of as ordinary capabilities. Moreover, his approach isolates capability selection from strategy. Opportunities must be sensed and calibrated and a strategy developed before capability gaps can be identified. Pisano also treats general-purpose capabilities as an option without acknowledging their dependence on the stage of the industry lifecycle. In mature industries, general-purpose technologies are less likely to be relevant. While there is much of value in Pisano's article about technology selection and risk, this is overshadowed by the claims he makes for the magnitude of the article's contribution to dynamic capabilities research.","[Linden, Greg; Teece, David J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business 1930, Inst Business Innovat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Linden, G (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business 1930, Inst Business Innovat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",glinden@berkeley.edu; teece@haas.berkeley.edu,"Teece, David/A-2868-2013",,,,,,15,8,9,1,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

The research is shaped by the high level of competition that investors are exposed to in the economy. Competitiveness is also supported by government plans to reduce investment burden by increasing expenditure in all strategic sectors of the economy. The present paper adds to the existing literature by investigating the effect of disaggregated government expenditure on private investment in Nigeria. The estimation techniques of the study include pre-and post-estimation, including descriptive statistics, correlation matrix, a unit root test and econometric estimation using the Auto Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) method. Government capital expenditures are estimated marginally, while recurrent expenditures are estimated in terms of elasticity, as the variables (recurrent expenditures) show a strict long tail to the right. It was observed in general that the effect of government expenditure on private investment depends on the components of the expenditure. Some were found to crowd out private investment while some crowd in private investment. This implies that not all government expenditure is channeled in such a way that it attracts private investment in the economy. It is therefore recommended that the policymakers should take into consideration the existence of private investors in expenditure plans.","[Omitogun, Olawunmi] Olabisi Onabanjo Univ, Fac Social Sci, Dept Econ, Ago Iwoye, Ogun State, Nigeria",,"Omitogun, O (通讯作者)，Olabisi Onabanjo Univ, Fac Social Sci, Dept Econ, Ago Iwoye, Ogun State, Nigeria.",,,,,,,,27,1,1,1,6,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

More specifically, the authors examine the influence of ownership, IFRS disclosure rules and economic fluctuation on the income smoothing behaviour of South African banks while controlling for the traditional determinants of bank income smoothing via LLPs. Design/methodology/approach The study employs fixed effect regression methodology to estimate the determinants of discretionary LLPs. Findings The authors find that South African banks do not use LLPs to smooth income when they are: under-capitalised, have large non-performing loans and have a moderate ownership concentration. On the other hand, income smoothing is pronounced when South African banks are rather more profitable during economic boom periods, well-capitalised during boom periods and is pronounced among banks that adopt IFRS and among banks with a Big 4 auditor. The authors also find that banks use LLPs for capital management purposes, and bank provisioning is procyclical with economic fluctuations. Practical implications Bank supervisors in South Africa should monitor the bank provisioning practices in South Africa closely to ensure that LLPs are not used as a substitute for bank capital. Banks in South Africa should not use sufficient provisioning as a substitute for sufficient bank capital. Second, the evidence for procyclical bank provisioning shows that provisioning by South African banks reinforce the current state of the economy and might compel bank supervisors in South Africa to consider the adoption of a dynamic provisioning system that is already adopted by bank supervisors in Spain, Peru, Uruguay, Colombia and Bolivia. Originality/value Bank income smoothing is an important issue because it has implications for banking stability and accounting transparency. There are few studies on bank income smoothing for emerging economies particularly in Africa where there are substantial differences in ownership and accounting rules. This is the first South African study to examine the influence of disclosure rules, ownership and economic cycle fluctuations on bank income smoothing behaviour via LLPs.","[Ozili, Peterson K.] Cent Bank Nigeria, Abuja, Nigeria; [Outa, Erick Rading] Strathmore Univ, Nairobi, Kenya",Central Bank of Nigeria; Strathmore University,"Ozili, PK (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Nigeria, Abuja, Nigeria.",petersonkitakogelu@yahoo.com; otxeri001@gsba.uct.ac.za,"Ozili, Peterson/A-8418-2015; Outa, Erick/AFJ-9789-2022","Outa, Erick/0000-0002-2217-3944",,,,,68,13,15,2,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Hence, low precision signals are available before high precision signals. We analyze how this feature affects asset price informativeness when investors can acquire signals of increasing precision over time about the payoff of an asset. As the cost of low precision signals declines, prices are more likely to reflect these signals before more precise signals become available. This effect can ultimately reduce price informativeness because it reduces the demand for more precise signals (e.g., fundamental analysis).

Global liquidity and emerging market central banks' demand for gold after the financial crisis,JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MARKETS INSTITUTIONS & MONEY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Gold reserves; Emerging markets; Central banks; Quantitative easing; Safe assets,SAFE HAVEN; HEDGE; ECONOMICS; RESERVES,"The quantity of gold reserves held by central banks in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) has risen sharply in the years following the global financial crisis of 2008. EMDE central banks' gold holdings rose in both absolute terms and as a share of GDP across the developing regions and in most of the EMDE countries, suggesting a pervasive phenomenon. Using a dynamic panel data model, we find that expansion of central bank balance sheets in the advanced economies and increase in global liquidity are robustly related to the post-crisis increase in EMDE gold reserves, after controlling for domestic factors and changes in the global risk environment. This finding is robust to different model specifications, inclusion of additional covariates, and alternative estimation methods. We argue that quantitative easing undertaken by central banks in the advanced economies resulted in a search for alternative safe assets such as gold, which may explain the continued accumulation of EMDE gold reserves even after the peak of the financial crisis.

In a scale-invariant Schumpeterian growth model with endogenous fertility and a cash-in-advance constraint on consumption, we find a positive effect of an increase in the nominal interest rate on fertility. The increase in fertility decreases labor supplied to production and R&D, which in turn decreases long-run growth. Calibration shows that long-run growth increases 0.12% by reducing the nominal interest rate from 9.6% to 0%, and the welfare gain is equivalent to a permanent increase in consumption of 3.14%. As an empirical test, we build panel data for 12 advanced countries during 2000-2014. We use the degree of central bank independence and money growth as the instruments for inflation. We find that the effect of inflation on population growth is positive and significant in instrumental variables estimation. Our results remain robust to using birth rate or fertility rate as the dependent variable. An increase in annual inflation of 1 percentage point would bring an increase of 0.06 percentage point in the annual growth of the total population. Our empirical findings provide support for our theory.","[He, Qichun] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"He, QC (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",heqichun@cufe.edu.cn,,", Qichun/0000-0001-7643-3150",,,,,31,9,9,2,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

Nevertheless, the relationship between transparency and currency crises has rarely been subjected to systematic cross-national scrutiny. This paper attempts to explore the effect of transparency on currency crises by focusing on a specific dimension of transparency: the public dissemination of aggregate economic data by governments. My analysis provides strong evidence that greater transparency is associated with a lower likelihood of currency crises, regardless of economic conditions.

One hypothesis for this phenomenon is that women may not have the right stuff to be heavily involved in ICT. We use basic ICT scores derived from Statistics Canada's 2012 Survey of Adult Skills, which is the Canadian portion of the 2012 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies as a proxy for the right stuff. We find that, after controlling for appropriate covariates, Canadian women score higher than men on basic ICT skills. However, women with the same ICT test scores are much less likely than men to be employed in ICT occupations. We also find that hourly wages in ICT occupations are lower for women, but this wage gap is no greater than that in the general labour market. Given the current and projected shortages of ICT professionals, women represent a large, yet untapped, pool of talent for this sector.","[Mueller, Richard E.] Univ Lethbridge, Dept Econ, Lethbridge, AB, Canada; [Truong, N.

Gastronomic touristic products incorporate values of environment, landscape, parts of local culture, traditions, local cuisine, traditional costumes, local food and rituals, associated with gastronomic experience - the way the edibles are served and presented, as well as ingredients, preparation methods. Identifying the culinary destination is one of the challenges of creating touristic products, in which an important role goes to guesthouses. The aim of the paper is to analyze the preferences of the tourists for practicing gastronomic tourism and the involvement of the rural tourism operators in the project, taking into account the types of preferred events. In this regard, it has been elaborated a questionnaire for the tourists accommodated in the rural and agro-touristic guesthouses from two micro regions representative of the Sibiu County, respectively Hartibaciului Valley and Marginimea Sibiului. Also, there have been held discussions with the guesthouse's administrators, who are actively implicated in the diversification of the mass tourist services supply by designing new tourist products, which incorporate traditional reinterpreted recipes, accompanied by a story of the place and source of raw material.","[Nicula, Virgil; Popsa, Roxana Elena] Lucian Blaga Univ Sibiu, Sibiu, Romania",Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu,"Nicula, V (通讯作者)，Lucian Blaga Univ Sibiu, Sibiu, Romania.",niculavirgil@yahoo.com,"ELENA ROXANA, POPSA/IAN-1159-2023","ELENA ROXANA, POPSA/0009-0007-8691-7811",,,,,14,5,5,6,38,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2018,20.0,,,,12,,951,966,,10.24818/EA/2018/S12/951,0.0,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GY5HR,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448604700009,0

This paper performs a statistical analysis that examines the consequences of instead basing it on expected shortfall, a switch that has already been set in motion for market risk regulation. The ability to capture tail risk as well as diversification is examined in detail for the two risk measures. In addition, the article compares confidence levels, estimation uncertainty, model validation and parameter sensitivity. The empirical analysis is carried out by both theoretical simulations and real data from a Norwegian savings bank group's corporate portfolio. The findings indicate that the use of correctly calibrated expected shortfall results in similar capital requirement levels, with slightly increased levels for exposures with very low default probability. The estimation precision is not inferior to value at risk, even at very high confidence levels. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Spatial autocorrelation tests are applied in order to identify any spatial organisation in registrations rates and spatial regression models are specified to consider the effect of socioeconomic, household, and transport system characteristics over registrations. Specific attention is paid to the association between Electric Vehicle registrations and the presence of charging infrastructure to consider if registrations are affected by infrastructure in the immediate and intermediate vicinity. The results of the analysis suggest Electric Vehicle demand exhibits a moderate degree of spatial clustering, which indicates the emergence of lead and laggard markets, and that the spatial variation in Electric Vehicle uptake can be partially explained through other characteristics of the local authorities. Characteristics relating to education level, employment status, income level, population density, dwelling type, household size, car availability, and the presence of Hybrid Electric Vehicles are significant factors in explaining the rate of Electric Vehicle registrations. Moreover, the level of charge point infrastructure installed within a local authority is positively associated with EV demand. From a policy perspective, the results reported in this paper indicate that local conditions are likely to be important in the rate of Electric Vehicle adoption, which may be of use when considering the development of geographically targeted interventions to accelerate Electric Vehicle demand.","[Morton, Craig] Loughborough Univ, Sch Architecture Bldg & Civil Engn, Transport Studies Grp, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England; [Anable, Jillian] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Univ Rd, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Cottrill, Caitlin] Univ Aberdeen, Ctr Transport Res, St Marys Bldg, Aberdeen AB24 3UF, Scotland; [Yeboah, Godwin] Univ Warwick, Ctr Interdisciplinary Methodol, Social Sci Bldg, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",Loughborough University; University of Leeds; University of Aberdeen; University of Warwick,"Morton, C (通讯作者)，Loughborough Univ, Sch Architecture Bldg & Civil Engn, Transport Studies Grp, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",c.morton@live.co.uk,"Cottrill, Caitlin/V-3813-2019; Yeboah, Godwin/D-5080-2015","Yeboah, Godwin/0000-0003-4618-3175; Anable, Jillian/0000-0002-4259-1641; Cottrill, Caitlin/0000-0002-1638-8113","ClimateXChange Centre of Scotland; EPSRC [EP/K000438/2, EP/J004758/1, EP/K000438/1, EP/R035288/1] Funding Source: UKRI",ClimateXChange Centre of Scotland; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),The research reporting in this paper was made possible due to a grant provided by the ClimateXChange Centre of Scotland.
