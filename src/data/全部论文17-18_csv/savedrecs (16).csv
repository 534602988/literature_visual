J,"Grybaite, V; Stankeviciene, J",,,,"Grybaite, Virginija; Stankeviciene, Jelena",,,An empirical analysis of factors affecting sharing economy growth,OECONOMIA COPERNICANA,,,English,Article,,,,,,sharing economy; peer-to-peer; information and communication technology; multicriteria evaluation,,"Research background: There are widely recognized benefits of sharing economy for entrepreneurs and consumers. The European Commission emphasizes the importance of European countries being open to new opportunities that sharing economy brings. In order to promote the development of sharing economy, it is important to understand what factors contribute to its development. Purpose of the article: The presented paper aims to identify the main factors relevant for the growth of sharing economy and to determine whether there are factors which are more significant for the development of the sharing economy than others. Based on reviewed literature, the Authors compiled a set of indicators and employed them for research purposes. The selected indicators were assigned into four main groups: technological, political and regulatory environment, economic and social-cultural environment. Methods: The authors used two multicriteria methods (SAW and APH), which were applied to the set of indicators and modeled five different situations by attributing significance to the indicators. The Authors have applied this set of indicators for assessing the following selected countries: Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and the United Kingdom. The data covers the years 2011-2015. Findings & Value added: The results of the research show that technological readiness and social-cultural environment are significant for the development of sharing economy. For further research the Authors recommend the creation of a composite Sharing Economy Index (SHEI).","[Grybaite, Virginija; Stankeviciene, Jelena] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Ave 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Stankeviciene, J (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Ave 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",jelena.stankeviciene@vgtu.lt,"Stankevičienė, Jelena/JVO-8162-2024","Stankeviciene, Jelena/0000-0002-5600-5842; Grybaite, Virginija/0000-0002-7298-6134",,,,,41,14,14,2,23,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

While the literature on public-sector entrepreneurship dates to the mid-1960s, the scholarly foundations on which public-sector entrepreneurship is based date to the writings of Cantillon and Baudeau in the mid-and late-1700s and to Schumpeter in the late-1930s and early-1940s. After summarizing the academic and policy literatures on public-sector entrepreneurship, we illustrate the concept using examples of public-sector initiatives. We conclude the paper with an emphasis on the dynamic nature of public-sector entrepreneurship, and we offer insight into additional areas to which the concept applies as well as policy suggestions for incentivizing further public-sector entrepreneurial actions.","[Hayter, Christopher S.] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Link, Albert N.] Univ N Carolina, Greensboro, NC USA; [Scott, John T.] Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Greensboro; Dartmouth College,"Hayter, CS (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",chayter@asu.edu; anlink@uncg.edu; john.t.scott@dartmouth.edu,,,,,,,71,34,40,5,45,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

We also show that, following an exchange-rate volatility shock in a given country, strongly multi-destination firms increase exports to all other destinations served. This specific behavior of multi-destination firms has significant aggregate implications. First, the bilateral aggregate impact is increasingly negative with the weight of multi-destination firms in total exports towards the considered destination. Second, the reallocation behavior of large, multi-destination firms ultimately translates into stable total French exports (summed over all destinations).","[Hericourt, Jerome] Univ Lille, LEM CNRS, UMR 9221, Lille, France; [Hericourt, Jerome] CEPII, Paris, France; [Nedoncelle, Clement] Univ Paris Saclay, UMR 0210 Econ Publ, INRA, AgroParisTech, Paris, France",Universite de Lille; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite Paris Saclay; INRAE; AgroParisTech,"Nedoncelle, C (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Saclay, UMR 0210 Econ Publ, INRA, AgroParisTech, Paris, France.",jerome.hericourt@univ-lille.fr; clement.nedoncelle@inra.fr,"Nedoncelle, Clément/P-1021-2019","Nedoncelle, Clément/0000-0001-7828-710X; Hericourt, Jerome/0000-0002-1870-7931",French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-11-JSH1 002 01]; CEPREMAP - programme 5,French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); CEPREMAP - programme 5,"We thank the referees and the editor, Ruben Enikolopov, for insightful comments, which helped to improve significantly the paper.

We simulate the unemployment rate implied by the RDD estimates assuming no market-level externalities. The implied response closely approximates the decline in the unemployment rate following the benefit cut, suggesting that, even in a period of high unemployment, the labor market absorbed the influx of workers without crowding out other job seekers.","[Johnston, Andrew C.] Univ Calif Merced, Merced, CA 95343 USA; [Mas, Alexandre] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Mas, Alexandre] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California Merced; Princeton University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Johnston, AC (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Merced, Merced, CA 95343 USA.",,,"Johnston, Andrew/0000-0003-0447-6412",,,,,65,36,44,6,47,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-3808,1537-534X,,J POLIT ECON,J.

We find that not only the diversity effect but also the technology effect can matter for the pattern of POT. We demonstrate that, in the free-trade equilibrium, if the technology effect dominates the diversity effect then the country with a more (less) diverse distribution of talent may export the goods produced by a technology with supermodularity (submodularity). In addition, we prove that the relative technology difference will affect income inequality. If the technological advance for the submodular sector S is better than for the supermodular sector C, then income inequality would increase.","[Kuo, Kuo-Hsing; Lee, Cheng-Te] Chinese Culture Univ, Dept Int Trade, 55 Hwa Kang Rd, Taipei 11114, Taiwan",Chinese Culture University,"Kuo, KH (通讯作者)，Chinese Culture Univ, Dept Int Trade, 55 Hwa Kang Rd, Taipei 11114, Taiwan.",kuo@staff.pccu.edu.tw; lzd4@faculty.pccu.edu.tw,,,,,,,36,1,1,1,6,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

The 2008 crisis would have served as the last straw as China experienced falls and volatilities in industrial output, export and foreign direct investment. The new policy focuses on expansion of domestic consumption and rebalancing. Given the unreliability of Chinese products, there is a need to rebuild product acceptability and market confidence. The structure of industrial enterprises, especially the small- and medium-sized enterprises, will play a crucial role in the next phase of development in the China economy. This paper uses the data on Chinese industrial enterprises to estimate the productivity performance of enterprises across regions and industries. The discussion is placed on the impact of the 2008 financial crisis on the China economy and industries enterprises. By using a simple methodology and OLS regression analysis on the estimation of total factor productivity, the empirical results show that SMEs and non-SMEs do perform differently in different industries and across regions, but SMEs suffered more than non-SMEs since the 2008 crisis.","[Li, Kui-Wai] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ & Finance, Kowloon Tong, 83 Tatchee Ave, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",City University of Hong Kong,"Li, KW (通讯作者)，City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ & Finance, Kowloon Tong, 83 Tatchee Ave, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",efkwli@friends.cityu.edu.hk,,"Li, Kui-Wai/0000-0001-9834-0027",City University of Hong Kong,City University of Hong Kong(City University of Hong Kong),"The author is grateful to the comments on the earlier draft from Euston Quah, the Editor, and the two anomalous referees, and from participants in the 2014 China Economic Conference and seminar presentation in Zhongshan (Lingnan) University.

EC in product development (PD) is a complex process, involving many actors and functions, especially in the late stages of PD. This article builds on an in-depth single case study from a Norwegian automotive supplier. The study identified perceived enablers and disablers of the EC process, both internally initiated and customer driven, in relation to the front-loading concept as an approach to managing ECs. Based on this, we have outlined a framework with the aim to improve the odds of benefitting economically from customer-driven ECs. Different PD strategies are depicted to consider, depending on the current situation of both internal and customer-driven ECs and the degree of front-loading. An interesting finding from this study is that under certain conditions, for instance when a company faces relatively few internal ECs at the same time as customer-driven ECs increase, a more business-oriented strategy may benefit the company more than would a pure front-loading approach. One important industrial implication of this work is a description of different strategies to consider, depending on the current situation of both internal and external ECs and the degree of front-loading. In additional, the article will provide an important contribution to how companies can organize EC process better for future success. This should also be relevant for the academia.","[Lodgaard, Eirin; Ringen, Geir] SINTEF Raufoss Mfg, Prod & Prod Dev, Enggata 40, N-2830 Raufoss, Norway; [Larsson, Catrine Eleonor] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Engn Sci & Technol, Teknol Veien 22, N-2815 Gjovik, Norway",SINTEF; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Lodgaard, E (通讯作者)，SINTEF Raufoss Mfg, Prod & Prod Dev, Enggata 40, N-2830 Raufoss, Norway.",eirin.lodgaard@sintef.no,,,,,,,35,4,5,2,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1868-7865,1868-7873,,J KNOWL ECON,J.

What explains the huge influence of this work, merely 17 pages in length? One factor is that Friedman addresses an important topic. Another is that it is written in simple, clear prose, making it an ideal addition to the reading lists of many courses. But what distinguishes Friedman's address is that it invites readers to reorient their thinking in a fundamental way. It was an invitation that, after hearing the arguments, many readers chose to accept. Indeed, it is no exaggeration to view Friedman's 1967 AEA presidential address as marking a turning point in the history of macroeconomic research. Our goal here is to assess this contribution, with the benefit of a half-century of hindsight. We discuss where macroeconomics was before the address, what insights Friedman offered, where researchers and central bankers stand today on these issues, and (most speculatively) where we may be heading in the future.","[Mankiw, N.

However, when motivated agents value the collective reputation of their place of employment, steady-state equilibria with both high and low aggregate motivation (reputation) in the mission-oriented sector exist. Reforming a low-motivation institution requires a non-monotonic wage path: since the effect of higher wages on motivation is negative for a high-reputation institution, but positive for a low-reputation institution, a transition to a high-reputation steady state requires an initial wage increase to crowd motivated workers in, followed by a wage decrease to crowd non-motivated workers out.

In the current work, an attempt is made to present a systematic review of methodologies and applications of the MCDM utility-determining techniques discussed in recent years. The researchers reviewed 86 papers, describing the use of the MCDM utility-determining techniques, which were published in the period 2004-2015 in more than 42 scientific journals. They mainly refer to the area of management and are extracted from online databases, such as Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar. According to the classification used by the researchers, the papers were grouped based on the five main MCDM utility-determining techniques, including stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA), the weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS), the additive ratio assessment (ARAS), the method of complex proportional assessment (COPRAS), multi-objective optimisation by ratio analysis (MOORA) and MULTIMOORA (MOORA plus a full multiplicative form). Furthermore, the papers were categorised taking into account their authors, publication date, journal name, the technique and method used, research objectives, research gap and problem, solution and modelling and, finally, the results and findings. The results of this study show that, in 2013, scholars published more papers on the MCDM utility-determining techniques than in other years. It is also worth noting that a group of COPRAS methods (COPRAS-Grey and COPRAS-Fuzzy) was ranked number one among the methods used in this area. With regard to journals, the Journal of Civil Engineering and Management was ranked first in the list of journals, which contributed to this review.","[Mardani, Abbas; Jusoh, Ahmad; Ahmad, Ungku Norulkamar U.] UTM, Azman Hashim Int Business Sch, Skudai Johor, Malaysia; [Halicka, Katarzyna; Ejdys, Joanna; Magruk, Andrzej] Bialystok Tech Univ, Fac Engn Management, Bialystok, Poland",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Bialystok University of Technology,"Halicka, K (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Fac Engn Management, Bialystok, Poland.",k.halicka@pb.edu.pl,"Mardani, Abbas/D-5700-2015; Jusoh, Ahmad/U-3868-2018; Magruk, Andrzej/R-7812-2017; EJDYS, JOANNA/D-6654-2013; Halicka, Katarzyna/D-4855-2015","Mardani, Abbas/0000-0003-1010-3655; Jusoh, Ahmad/0000-0002-7172-8416; Magruk, Andrzej/0000-0001-8403-7414; EJDYS, JOANNA/0000-0002-5132-166X; Halicka, Katarzyna/0000-0001-6370-8995",,,,,177,27,27,5,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Following Vandenbussche et al. (J Econ Growth 11(2):97-127, 2006) we also analyse the differential impact of skilled and unskilled human capital on growth. The empirical analysis applies instrumental variables panel data methods which resolve the endogeneity bias. Our results show robust evidence of the significant direct and indirect effects of human capital on the process of total factor productivity (TFP henceforth) growth in euro area countries. When we analyse the impact of different kinds of human capital on different ways of increasing TFP we conclude that, regardless of academic level, the quantity of unskilled human capital boosts imitation in EU countries while, by contrast, highly qualified human capital is essential for growth through innovation.","[Barcenilla-Visus, Sara; Lopez-Pueyo, Carmen] Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Estruct Econ, Gran Via 2, Zaragoza, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Barcenilla-Visús, S (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Estruct Econ, Gran Via 2, Zaragoza, Spain.",sbarceni@unizar.es; clopez@unizar.es,,"Lopez Pueyo, Maria del Carmen/0000-0001-9441-7859","European Social Fund; Government of Aragon (Spain); University of Zaragoza [269-165, 269-190]",European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)); Government of Aragon (Spain)(Gobierno de Aragon); University of Zaragoza,"This research has been supported by the European Social Fund, the Government of Aragon (Spain) and the University of Zaragoza (Research Projects 269-165 and 269-190).",,50,5,5,3,40,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,NOV,2018,45.0,4,,,,,821,847,,10.1007/s10663-017-9394-2,0.0,,,27,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GX1UO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447504200008,0

Our tests are nonparametric in nature, and use sieve estimators of the characteristic function. We provide formal power analysis against global as well as against local alternatives. Moreover, we perform a Monte Carlo simulation study, and apply the tests to analyze the degree of nonlinearity in a heterogeneous random coefficients demand model.

Although there is extensive literature on the military-growth nexus, there is still no consensus on the nature and magnitude of this relationship. Using an expansive dataset and controlling for country-specific effects and potential endogeneity, we revisit this issue and reach two firm conclusions. First, military spending has no statistically significant direct (positive) effect on growth. Second, the nature and level of security threats do not alter the relationship between military spending and growth. Overall, the empirical results documented in the study suggest that military spending is simply not important or large enough in most countries to have a meaningful impact on growth.","[Cevik, Serhan] Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Ricco, John] Univ Penn, 3819 Chestnut St,Suite 310, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",International Monetary Fund; University of Pennsylvania,"Cevik, S (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",scevik@imf.org; johnricco226@gmail.com,,"Cevik, Serhan/0000-0002-2373-2023",,,,,52,8,8,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,NOV,2018,45.0,4,,,,,639,653,,10.1007/s10663-017-9380-8,0.0,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GX1UO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447504200001,0

If innovative R&D is subject to the CIA constraint, then a decrease in the Northern nominal interest rate raises the rate of Northern innovation, the rate of FDI, and the North-South wage gap. Regarding the production pattern, the extent of Northern production decreases as the extent of FDI increases. If adaptive R&D is subject to the CIA constraint, then a decrease in the Southern nominal interest rate causes the same effects on the rates of innovation and FDI as well as the extents of Northern production and FDI as those in the case of a decrease in the Northern nominal interest rate. However, such a monetary policy change reduces the North-South wage gap.

The supplier's adverse-selection problem can be solved if the downstream firm has established a reputation for delivering high quality with the supplier. The supplier may enter the market by initially renting the downstream firm's reputation. The downstream firm may optimally source its input externally, even though sourcing internally would be better in terms of productive efficiency. Since an entrant in the downstream market may lack reputation, it may suffer from a reputational barrier to entry arising from higher input costs-this constitutes a novel theory of downstream barriers to entry.

In a cross-country setup of European countries, we find a significant nonlinear relationship between the minimum wages and employment rate of young individuals. Theoretically, while low minimum wages can indeed be positively associated with employment, after a certain level of the minimum wage, the relationship turns negative. This implies that there is an optimal level of minimum wages that maximizes the employment rate of young individuals. We additionally show that the negative relationship between minimum wages and employment of young workers is stronger if labor markets are otherwise strictly regulated and when workers are relatively unproductive. Using these results, we are able to calculate country-specific turning points and show that some European countries in our sample might in fact contribute to high unemployment rates among young individuals by setting minimum wages too high.

The novel feature of our model is that enforcement capacity is accumulated ex ante and thus subject to depletion ex post. We characterize the effect of shocks that deplete enforcement resources on the aggregate default rate and credit supply. In the model default decisions by entrepreneurs are strategic complements, leading to multiple equilibria. We propose a global game selection to overcome equilibrium indeterminacy and show how shocks that deplete enforcement capacity can lead to a spike in the aggregate default rate and trigger credit rationing.

The relationship is established as skilled and unskilled labor are used in conjunction with capital goods in a nested constant-elasticity-of-substitution (CES) production function, which features capital-skill complementarity and a substitutive relationship between the bundle of capital and skills on the one hand and unskilled labor on the other hand. Incomes differ across countries both within and between types of workers. As trade costs change, relative and absolute incomes of worker types change and so does the worker-type-specific pattern of consumption. A calibration and simulation exercise documents that a consideration of the supply-and-demand-side linkage in this hierarchy-of-needs model matters quantitatively for the role of trade liberalization in the world economy.","[Egger, Peter H.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Zurich, Switzerland; [Nigai, Sergey] Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, 256 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Nigai, S (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, 256 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",sergey.nigai@colorado.edu,,"Egger, Peter/0000-0002-0546-1207",Swiss National Foundation [11-154446],Swiss National Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),The authors would like to thank the discussants and participants of the conference on Creative Perspectives on International Trade and Foreign Direct Investment in the University of Colorado Boulder for helpful comments and suggestions.

The WTO Information Technology Agreement's (ITA) unique setting allows us to overcome the challenges associated with identifying effects of non-discriminatory trade policies due to two reasons: (i) ITA constitutes a quasi-natural experiment of several passive signatories joining the agreement as an unavoidable part of pursuing a larger policy objective, and (ii) ITA's partial coverage of the IT sector provides a natural control group for identification based on cross-product variation. Our analysis finds novel nonlinear impacts of tariff liberalization: Complete tariff elimination results in large additional trade gains - over and above tariff reductions - especially for intermediate goods. The commitment to durable tariff elimination, through WTO bindings, adds another two layers, boosting both imports and exports more than equivalent unilateral reforms. This commitment spurned development of a downstream IT export sector in passive signatories. (C) 2018 International Monetary Fund. Published by Elsevier B.V.

It studies a model where policy is difficult to undo because policy elements are entangled with each other. Policy complexity may accumulate as successive policymakers layer new' rules upon existing policy. Complexity emerges and persists in balanced democratic polities, when policymakers are ideologically extreme, and when legislative frictions impede policymaking. Complexity begets complexity: simple policies remain simple, whereas complex policies grow more complex.

We further investigate this issue by departing from the bulk of the literature in three ways: (1) rather than maximize only tax revenue, governments also put positive weight on the income generated by resident-owned firms; (2) under preferential taxation, firms are distinguished by their country of origin; and (3) the competing regions are allowed to differ in size. Under the assumption of uniformly-distributed moving costs, identical regions always prefer the non-preferential regime. But when a small and large region compete, the small region prefers the preferential regime in some cases. We also identify non-uniform distributions of moving costs where the preferential regime is preferred by identical competing regions. This finding is related to differences in tax-base elasticities.

Empirical studies have found conflicting results for different countries and periods. Possible reasons may include the endogeneity of distributional shares, differences in the monetary policy/exchange rate regimes across countries, and divergence between macro behavior in the short- and medium-runs. I theoretically explore these possibilities using a portfolio balance framework to keep track of asset stocks and wealth effects over time. With fixed exchange rates, the Central Bank's need to intervene in the asset market via official reserve transactions results in assigning a crucial role to the current account in constraining demand and output. The binding nature of this constraint vanishes with flexible exchange rates. Regardless of the exchange rate regime, the most important message that emerges is that, once we impose plausible constraints on dynamic behavior, the demand regime may cease to determine the effect of redistribution on the steady state levels of utilization, profit rates, capital and wealth.","[Razmi, Arslan] Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Razmi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Econ, 814 Thompson Hall, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",arazmi@econs.umass.edu,,,,,,,28,1,1,1,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,NOV,2018,69.0,4,,,,,708,736,,10.1111/meca.12209,0.0,,,29,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GW3VZ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000446838300001,0

Thirdly, I show how this explains the severity of the Soviet output fall.

China's one-child policy (OCP) has significantly reduced the fertility in the country, and popular belief holds that this policy has contributed to the enhancement in China's human capital since 1979. However, the quantity-quality tradeoff dose not present the complete truth-another crucial factor relates to which segment of the population is reduced, a critical issue that has been ignored in the literature. China's OCP is significantly more strictly implemented in urban areas than in rural areas, where human capital investment in children is significantly lower. This two-tier OCP could have significantly increased the rural-urban fertility ratio and brought about important consequences. We first emphasize the importance of such a population compositional effect, which may offset the potentially positive quantity-quality tradeoff effect on human capital. We present a simple analytic framework and quantify the relative sizes of the quantity-quality tradeoff and compositional effects. We find that the former is dominated by the latter, and that the OCP has reduced the average human capital level of China's next generation by approximately 1-2%. This novel evidence indicates that the conventional wisdom on population control may be incomplete and that its policy implications could be misleading.","[Wang, Xuebo] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Junsen] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Zhang, JS (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",wang.xuebo@mail.shufe.edu.cn; jszhang@cuhk.edu.hk,,,,,,,27,13,18,11,54,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

In this paper, we use Chinese Industrial Enterprises Database (CIED) to investigate the relationship between firms' heterogeneity of tax burden and firms' characteristics, such as size, ownership, exportation and location. We measure a firm's tax burden in three ways, the value-added tax (VAT) burden, the corporate income tax (CIT) burden, and the total tax burden. By using a Hausman-Taylor estimation, we find: (1) The CIT burden is positively correlated to the size, while other two tax burdens are not; (2) Both the VAT burden and the total tax burden of SOEs are significantly heavier than those of non-SOEs, while the CIT burden shows the exactly opposite effect; (3) Exporters have a remarkably lower tax burden than non-exporters for all three tax burden measures; and (4) The western region and particularly the central region have lighter tax burden than the eastern region for all three tax burden measures.

This value is a commitment recorded in the Stability and Growth Pact signed by EU members and it has been determining the economic policies implemented by the Spanish Government since 2010. The aim of the paper is to evaluate the costs of a decline in 1.5 pp the ratio of public deficit-GDP on the main macroeconomic variables with alternative fiscal policies. Methodology: The model used is a static disaggregated Computable General Equilibrium model that includes all the elements needed to evaluate the short run effects of fiscal policies aimed to reduce public deficit. This model captures the circular flow of income and accounts for households corporations, government and the foreign sector. Results: The results suggest that the decline of public spending on investment, public administrations and social services has less harmful effects on the economy than the increase of VAT and personal income tax rates. Conclusions: Despite these results, it is important to take into account that the long run effects of declining public investment and social services are not included in the model.","[Alvarez-Martinez, Maria T.] Univ Loyola Andalucia, Dept Econ, Campus Palmas Altas, Seville, Spain; [Polo, Clemente] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ, Campus UAB, Barcelona, Spain",Universidad Loyola Andalucia; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Alvarez-Martínez, MT (通讯作者)，Univ Loyola Andalucia, Dept Econ, Campus Palmas Altas, Seville, Spain.",mtalvarez@uloyola.es; clemente.polo@uab.es,"Alvarez-Martinez, Maria Teresa/HLH-2155-2023",,,,,,20,1,1,0,9,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

A measure of intersectoral distance in task characteristics facilitates the structural estimation of switching costs that vary by gender and across sectors. In a set of trade shock simulations, an import competition shock in the manufacturing sector disproportionately affects male employment and wages. Since manufacturing is male labor intensive and men face higher exit costs from manufacturing, wage and welfare gains from trade are higher for women than men. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We examine the impacts of increased wind electricity on the U.S. economy using a hybrid model that links a detailed electric sector model (the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's Regional Energy Deployment System [ReEDS]) with a computable general equilibrium model of the U.S. economy (the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's U.S. Regional Energy Policy [USREP] model). Increasing wind capacity displaces fossil fuels for electricity generation, which depresses fossil fuel prices and reduces economy-wide CO2 emissions. Competitive wind deployment in the reference scenario achieves these outcomes with lower electricity prices than a scenario with wind capacity fixed at 2016 levels. Lower fossil fuel and electricity prices benefit low-income households, but the dominant economic impacts are driven by increased electric sector investment and capital returns, which primarily benefit those with higher incomes. Overall, cost-competitive wind provides benefits to the U.S. economy that are initially low but rise beyond 2030 to achieve cumulative welfare and GDP improvements of $110 and $111 billion through 2050. Prescribing additional wind deployment (meeting 35% of demand by 2050) increases post-2030 electricity prices but not more so than keeping wind capacity fixed at 2016 levels. The negative effect of higher prices on welfare, however, is outweighed by higher returns from the additional wind investment. While these changes favor higher income classes, we find economy-wide benefits through 2040. These benefits diminish by 2050, but the cumulative additional gains through 2050, beyond the reference case, are $192 billion in welfare and $150 billion in GDP.

In a general equilibrium model, we disaggregate wealth in its capital and land components, and savings in their life-cycle and bequest components. Households are heterogeneous in their taste for leaving bequests. We show that governments have considerable freedom in reducing wealth inequality without sacrificing output: Land rent taxes enhance output due to a portfolio effect and reduce wealth inequality slightly. Bequest taxes have the highest potential to reduce inequality, and their effect on output is moderate. By contrast, we confirm the standard result that capital taxes reduce output strongly and show that they only have moderate redistributive effects.

Moreover, the correlation is stronger for individuals who profess to care most about inequality. The link between happiness and inequality may thus be stronger than previously appreciated.","[Goff, Leonard] Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Helliwell, John F.] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver Sch Econ, Vancouver, BC V6T 1L4, Canada; [Helliwell, John F.] Canadian Inst Adv Res, Toronto, ON M5G 1M1, Canada; [Mayraz, Guy] Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Carlton, Vic 3010, Australia",Columbia University; University of British Columbia; Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR); University of Melbourne,"Goff, L (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",ltg2111@columbia.edu; john.helliwell@ubc.ca; guy.mayraz@unimelb.edu.au,"Goff, Leonard/ABH-2126-2021",,"Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, through its program on Social Interactions, Identity, and Well-Being","Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, through its program on Social Interactions, Identity, and Well-Being","All three authors are grateful for research support from the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, through its program on Social Interactions, Identity, and Well-Being.

We evaluate an incentive-compatible risk and time preference experiment conducted on a sample of student smokers and nonsmokers at the University of Cape Town in 2012. We adopt a full information maximum likelihood statistical framework, which is consistent with the data generating processes proposed by structural theories and accounts for subject errors in decision making, to explore the relationship between risk preferences, time preferences, and addiction. Across different theories and econometric specifications, we find no differences in the risk preferences of smokers and nonsmokers but do find that smokers discount significantly more heavily than nonsmokers. We also identify a nonlinear effect of smoking intensity on discounting behavior and find that smoking intensity increases the likelihood of discounting hyperbolically, which means heavier smokers may be more prone to time inconsistency and more recalcitrant to treatment. These results highlight the importance of the theory-experimental design-econometric trinity and have important implications for theories of addiction.","[Harrison, Glenn W.] Georgia State Univ, Robinson Coll Business, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Harrison, Glenn W.; Ross, Don] Georgia State Univ, Robinson Coll Business, Ctr Econ Anal Risk, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Harrison, Glenn W.; Hofmeyr, Andre; Ross, Don] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Cape Town, South Africa; [Ross, Don] Univ Coll Cork, Sch Sociol Philosophy Criminol Govt & Polit, Cork, Ireland; [Swarthout, J.

Potentially, some households may have benefited from the purchase of cheaper assets. To analyze the impact of these channels. I construct an overlapping-generations model with borrowing constraints in which households choose a portfolio of risky and risk-free assets.

Estimation results from a theoretically founded empirical framework show that ageing as well as the education composition of the population influence economic performance. The estimates and simulations based on population projections and different counterfactual scenarios show that population ageing will have a substantial negative consequence for macroeconomic performance in many countries in the years to come. The results also suggest that education expansions tend to offset the negative effects, but that the extent to which they compensate the ageing effects differs vastly across countries. The simulations illustrate the heterogeneity in the effects of population ageing on economic performance across countries, depending on their current age and education composition. The estimates provide a method to quantify the increase in education that is required to offset the negative consequences of population ageing. Counterfactual changes in labour force participation and productivity required to neutralise ageing are found to be substantial.","[Kotschy, Rainer; Sunde, Uwe] Ludwig Maximilian Univ Munich, Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Kotschy, R (通讯作者)，Ludwig Maximilian Univ Munich, Munich, Germany.",,,"Kotschy, Rainer/0000-0002-4705-7317; Sunde, Uwe/0000-0002-2110-7822",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [395413683]; International Doctoral Program Evidence-Based Economics of the Elite Network of Bavaria,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); International Doctoral Program Evidence-Based Economics of the Elite Network of Bavaria,"The authors wish to thank the editors, four reviewers, the discussants and participants of the 67th Economic Policy Panel meeting in Zurich, and participants of the VfS Annual Conference 2016 on Demographic Change; the Second CREA Workshop on Aging, Culture, and Comparative Development in Luxembourg; the 2017 meeting of the VfS Population Economics Committee; the 2017 ESPE Annual Conference; the 2017 EEA Annual Conference; the DFG SPP 1764 Conference on 'Demographics, Immigration, and the Labor Market'; seminar participants at the Vienna Institute of Demography; the ifo Institute; and at LMU Munich, as well as David Bloom, Lukas Buchheim, David Canning, Christian Dustmann, Oliver Falck, Gustav Feichtinger, Alexia Furnkranz-Prskawetz, Michael Grimm, Wolfgang Lutz, Klaus Prettner, Miguel Sanchez-Romero, Gesine Stephan, Joachim Winter, and Rudolf Winter-Ebmer for helpful comments and suggestions.

Electricity markets allow emissions reductions achieved in the region to be offset by increased emissions in other electricity-producing regions, as local generation is replaced with electricity imports. The empirical analysis is conducted using the synthetic control method. Results indicate that imports increased after RGGI's establishment in 2009-in which the increase predominantly occurred after the emission cap was reduced in 2014-which suggests that electricity production and carbon emissions increased outside RGGI.

To deal with these temporal and spatial discrepancies, one frequently proposed approach is to expand storage capacities and transmission grids. It is often argued that the two technologies substitute each other, such that deploying one reduces the need for the other. Using a theoretical model, we show that storage capacities and transmission grids can also be complements if electricity system costs are minimized. We present the conditions that determine the kind of interdependence at specific storage locations: the characteristics of transmission congestion, i.e., during peak or off-peak and uni- or bidirectional as well as the alignment of marginal generation costs between adjacent regions. By applying our theoretical insights to Italian power system data, we obtain empirical evidence that storage and transmission can act as either substitutes or complements. Planners of long-lasting and costly infrastructure can use the results to avoid design errors such as a misplacement of storage within the system. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The study makes use of survey data collected in 2014 by the National Bank of Cambodia and JICA Research Institute. Specifically, we focus on estimating the determinants of the ratio of commercial bank loans to total assets under circumstances where bank loans are available only in US dollars. To correct for selection bias in a sample that covers only firms that succeeded in obtaining loans, we apply Heckman's sample selection model. Our findings on firm hedging behavior in their financing decisions are complicated. Firms with higher returns on assets, and thus stronger capacity to generate internal funds, are more sensitive to currency mismatch risks in relying on US dollar borrowing than firms with lower returns on assets. Development of a local currency loan market would allow Cambodian firms with predominantly local currency revenues to better hedge their currency mismatch risks, leading to greater financial deepening and inclusion and less exposure of financial institutions to systemic risk. Other findings are that collateral and insurance are positively associated with reliance on borrowing, indicating that problems of information asymmetry may need to be overcome in securing loans.

That view, which is consistent with neoclassical foundations, has become so profoundly entrenched in macroeconomists' thinking that increasing evidence of ` hysteresis' has not as yet dislodged it. The prevailing notion of the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) is constructed in terms of the ` natural' unemployment rate, which has allowed for some changes regarding its microeconomic determinants. However, the macroeconomic features of Friedman's natural rate and the NAIRU remain very much the same and unchanged. The blatant path-dependence of empirically estimated NAIRUs creates a dissociation between macroeconomic theory and empirics which, in our view, is unacceptable and demands a change of perspective. Adopting an alternative theory of distribution and employment might rehabilitate the original approach taken by Phillips vis-a-vis Friedman's legacy.","[Stirati, Antonella; Meloni, Walter Paternesi] Roma Tre Univ, Dept Econ, Via Silvio DAmico 77, I-00145 Rome, Italy",Roma Tre University,"Stirati, A (通讯作者)，Roma Tre Univ, Dept Econ, Via Silvio DAmico 77, I-00145 Rome, Italy.",antonella.stirati@uniroma3.it; walter.paternesi@uniroma3.it,"Paternesi Meloni, Walter/JXL-7768-2024; STIRATI, Antonella/R-8669-2016","Paternesi Meloni, Walter/0000-0001-9293-123X; STIRATI, Antonella/0000-0002-4195-9416",,,,,63,13,14,1,3,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

The empirical analysis is conducted using four wavelet tools: wavelet coherency, phase-difference, multiple correlation and multiple cross-correlation. The first two tools are used to identify the time-frequency co-movement of and lead-lag relationship between price indices of oil and 21 agricultural commodities, and the third and fourth tools are used to identify the leader and follower among all series of price indices across different scales. Our results on wavelet coherency show a high degree of co-movement at a long-run horizon for the entire period between the price indices of oil and coal, cotton, fishmeal, maize, rice, rubber and wheat. Furthermore, the connection between these commodity markets and the oil market strengthened after 2000, indicating the importance of financial crisis phenomena and geopolitical turbulence. Additional findings show that short-run investors should invest in the beef and swine (pork) markets, as they have very little correlation with the oil markets. The results of multiple correlation and multiple cross-correlation analysis show that the coffee price was leader or follower across all time scales, except wavelet scale 16, where barely was a leader or a follower.

Evidence from House Prices,REVIEW OF INCOME AND WEALTH,,,English,Article,,,,,,inequality; Egypt; house prices; top incomes,CONSUMPTION,"Household income surveys often fail to capture top incomes, which leads to an underestimation of income inequality. A popular solution is to combine the household survey with data from income tax records, which has been found to result in significant upward corrections of inequality estimates. Unfortunately, tax records are unavailable in many countries, including most of the developing world. In the absence of data from tax records, this study explores the feasibility of using data on house prices to estimate the top tail of the income distribution. In an application to Egypt, where estimates of inequality based on household surveys alone are low by international standards, the study finds strong evidence that inequality is indeed being underestimated by a considerable margin. The Gini index of household per capita income for urban Egypt is found to increase from 39 to 52 after correcting for the missing top tail.","[van der Weide, Roy; Lakner, Christoph; Ianchovichina, Elena] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"van der Weide, R (通讯作者)，1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",rvanderweide@worldbank.org,"Ianchovichina, Elena Ivanova/AAK-5943-2021",,U.

Next, we exploit shocks to the economies in India, Finland and Sweden, and South Korea and show that changes in the economic structure of a country influence the evolution of its financial system.

We consider six versions of Battle-of-the-Sexes. Recommendations imply monetary payoffs that are equal ex ante, but unequal ex post. So, although following recommendations constitutes a Nash equilibrium under standard preferences, sufficiently inequity-averse players can rationally disobey a recommendation that would lead to a very unfavourable payoff distribution, as long as the cost of doing so is not too large. Our theoretical model incorporates inequity aversion, along with level-k reasoning. Our main experimental result is consistent with the model: as either payoff asymmetry increases or the cost of disobeying an unfavourable recommendation decreases, subjects are more likely to disobey recommendations.

Unlike much of the recent literature, our unique identification strategy separates the SEA effect from date of birth effects. We find that delaying school entry by one year increases fifth grade test scores in Hebrew by 0.29 standard deviations and in math by 0.16. Interestingly, while the advantage in Hebrew decreases in eighth grade, in math it almost doubles. We show that although the bias induced by failing to control for date of birth effects is generally rather small, in some cases it is quite notable. This bias could have mistakenly led us to conclude that the SEA effect on math test scores slightly decreases from fifth to eighth grade while it actually substantially increases.

Unlike dissipative advertising, the cost of inducing shortage is different for different quality types. It is shown that under certain conditions, a high-quality monopoly firm that signals quality by inducing shortage makes more profit than using price alone or combined with dissipative advertising. This is because the forgone profit from the lost sales is always lower for the high-quality firm than for the low-quality firm. The result explains why high-quality firms may prefer to initially limit supply with a price weakly lower than that in the complete-information case.","[Bandyopadhyay, Taradas] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Econ, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Dong, Baomin] Henan Univ, Sch Econ, Kaifeng, Henan, Peoples R China; [Qin, Cheng-Zhong] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Econ, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of California System; University of California Riverside; Henan University; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Dong, BM (通讯作者)，Henan Univ, Sch Econ, Kaifeng, Henan, Peoples R China.",taradas.bandyopadhyay@ucr.edu; baomindon@gmail.com; qin@econ.ucsb.edu,"Dong, Baomin/AAV-7741-2021","Dong, Baomin/0000-0002-4787-021X",,,,,17,3,3,0,4,J C B MOHR,TUBINGEN,"POSTFACH 2040, W-7400 TUBINGEN, GERMANY",0932-4569,1614-0559,,J INST THEOR ECON,J.

Agricultural land, however, suffers from over-exploitation and is subject to environmental shocks which are projected to become more severe due to climate change. We present a stochastic model of a dynamic economy where soil is an essential input and natural disasters are sizeable, multiple, and random. Expansion of economic activities raises effective soil units but contributes to an aggregate loss of soil-protective ecosystem services, which exacerbates soil degradation at the time of a shock. We provide closed-form analytical solutions and show that optimal development is characterized by a constant growth rate of stocks and consumption until an environmental shock arrives causing all variables to jump downwards. Optimal soil management consists of spending a constant fraction of output on preservation measures, which is an increasing function of the shocks hazard rate, degradation intensity of agricultural practices, and the damage intensity of environmental impact. We derive the optimal propensity to save and discuss the impact of human pressure and risk exposure on soil and output. We also discuss quantitative impacts of climate change on optimal soil management. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

The first step is to show that models of industrial interdependencies (in the Leontief and Sraffa formulations) and vertically integrated models (in the Pasinetti formulation) imply profoundly different views on production, distribution, and socio-political conflicts. The next step is to focus on the process of vertical integration in itself on its being a 'bridge' between such different views. Because analytically equivalent representations of economic structures have such different socio-political implications, economic structures cannot be seen as univocally determining economic interests or conflicts in society. This result opens up a new field for structural analysis: studying how the formation of interests in society is influenced, but not determined, by economic structures. The article suggests a route to address the socio-political dimension of economic structures, which is largely left on the background by structural economic analysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

More than a half of the subjects' classifications coincides with their classifications using final choices, supporting a literal interpretation of the level-k model for subject's reasoning process. Lookup analyses reveal that the center area is where most subjects initially look at. This sheds light on the level-0 belief.

We provide an informal meta-analysis that suggests that much of the evidence in favor of collective rationality in the empirical literature appears to be inconsistent with our test. We illustrate the latter using data from a survey we have conducted in Burkina Faso. Consumption efficiency within monogamous households is not rejected using the standard testing procedure while it is clearly rejected using our proposed test procedure. Furthermore, our test also rejects consumption efficiency for bigamous households. We conclude that intra-household efficiency does yield empirically falsifiable restrictions despite being scarcely rejected in the literature.","[Dauphin, Anyck] Univ Quebec Outaouais, CRREP, Dept Social Sci, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Dauphin, Anyck] CDESG, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Fortin, Bernard] Univ Laval, CRREP, Bernard Fortin Dept Econ, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Fortin, Bernard; Lacroix, Guy] CIRANO, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Lacroix, Guy] Univ Laval, Guy Lacroix Dept Econ, CRREP, Quebec City, PQ, Canada",University of Quebec; University Quebec Outaouais; Laval University; Laval University,"Fortin, B (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, CRREP, Bernard Fortin Dept Econ, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.;Fortin, B (通讯作者)，CIRANO, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.",bernard.fortin@ecn.ulaval.ca,"Lacroix, Guy/H-9015-2017","Fortin, Bernard/0000-0002-7820-1916; Lacroix, Guy/0000-0001-6415-4496",,,,,43,7,7,2,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Alas, investor-to-state dispute settlement (ISDS) does not take place in a vacuum. Such cases are decided by a tribunal typically consisting of three arbitrators, one each nominated by the two parties while the president is mutually agreed upon. We demonstrate that the kind of involvement of these arbitrators in previous ISDS cases matters for the case under dispute. Specifically, we show that what we label the presidents' pro-investor appointment biasthe number of times they have previously been nominated by an investor minus the number of times they have represented respondent statesraises the likelihood that an investor wins an ISDS case. The same holds for the pro-investor appointment bias of state-appointed arbitrators. Given the president's crucial role, the main implication of our findings is that presidents should be drawn from among those who have not systematically represented more one side than the other in previous cases.","[Donaubauer, Julian] Helmut Schmidt Univ Hamburg, Holstenhofweg 85, D-22043 Hamburg, Germany; [Neumayer, Eric] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, London, England; [Nunnenkamp, Peter] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Donaubauer, J (通讯作者)，Helmut Schmidt Univ Hamburg, Holstenhofweg 85, D-22043 Hamburg, Germany.",julian.donaubauer@hsu-hh.de,"Neumayer, Eric/ABF-3741-2021","Neumayer, Eric/0000-0003-2719-7563",,,,,37,9,9,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

First, we cover the case of one license and show that competition has a drastic effect on optimal two-part tariffs. We also consider license auctions and design a more profitable dynamic mechanism. Next, we allow the licensor to award multiple licenses and design a dynamic mechanism that extracts the maximum industry profit. It awards licenses to all firms, prescribes maximum permitted royalty rates and positive fixed fees, and is more profitable than other dynamic mechanisms. Finally we show that a slight modification of that mechanism is also optimal for outside patent holders. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Using a sample of 60,058 observations-drawn from the European Central Bank-Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises (ECB-SAFE)-related to small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) chartered in 11 Euro-area countries during the period 2009-2014, we first investigate whether female-led businesses are more likely, than male-led ones, to refrain from applying for bank credit. Finally, we assess whether corruption actually matters in the women's decision not to relying on the bank-lending channel. Our results-robust to various model specifications-highlight that women-led SMEs face a higher probability to self-refrain from applying for loans vis-a-vis their male counterparts. In addition, although corruption appears strongly correlated to the self-restraint attitudes of firms, our empirical analysis reveals that women-led SMEs generally tend to refrain from applying for loans, more than men, regardless of the quality of the surrounding environment.","[Galli, Emma] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Social & Econ Sci DiSSE, Rome, Italy; [Mascia, Danilo Valerio] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham Univ Business Sch, Nottingham, England; [Rossi, Stefania Patrizia Sonia] Univ Trieste, Dept Econ Business Math & Stat DEAMS, Trieste, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; University of Nottingham; University of Trieste,"Galli, E (通讯作者)，Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Social & Econ Sci DiSSE, Rome, Italy.",emma.galli@uniroma1.it; danilo.mascia@gmail.com; stefania.rossi@deams.units.it,"Peter, Serin/ITR-8938-2023","Mascia, Danilo V./0000-0002-3776-0420","Autonomous Region of Sardinia, Legge Regionale 2007 [CRP-59890]","Autonomous Region of Sardinia, Legge Regionale 2007","The authors thank the editor and two anonymous reviewers for their useful and constructive comments.

The current approach presents a large sample panel data evidence not only on the effect of commodity export price shocks on conflict incidence, rather than onsets, but also on the joint impact of both ethnic and religious polarization and fractionalization on political instability. In this regard, we find out that in ethnically polarized societies, the commodity export price shocks increase violence. Nonetheless, in ethnically and religiously fractionalized societies (as well as religiously polarized), the effect of commodity export price shocks on civil conflicts depends on the type of income shocks and category of commodity. These findings contribute to the existing literature by illuminating the compound effect of both income shocks and social diversity on intrastate conflicts. (C) 2018 The Society for Policy Modeling.

One element of this transformation is the reorganisation of traditional ways of business management (on all ontological levels). As a result, agile approach is increasingly often considered one of the key aspects of building the competitive advantage of a company. In this paper, agile approach is understood as the businesses' capability of responding promptly to market needs. Purpose of the article: The aim of this paper is to present the research results on the use of agile approach in chosen organizations. More specifically, the main purpose of this article is to describe how organizations are transformed with use of the agile approach. Methods: In accordance with the goal of the article, the organizations selected for empirical research are characterized by revenue increase levels of over 100% (such organizations undergo a dynamic transformation caused by growth), and employment ranging from 10 to 50 employees. The studied companies operate mainly in the IT industry and use technologies to organize the processes of identification and tracking of customer behaviour to a large extent. Several research methods were used in this paper literature studies. expert interview, panicipant observation, and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Findings & Value added: The article describes the usage level of the agile (and linear) approach in the organiyational transformation (through the dynamic growth of revenues), and presents the agile approach model. which can be used as an accelerator of the business' development. In addition. the authors undertook the first (limited and unrepresentative) attempt to evaluate the use of agile approach in the contest of such indicators us: communication with customers, profit increase, and minimisation of the risk related to introducing a new product on the market.","[Idzikowski, Wojciech; Perechuda, Igor] Univ Sch Phys Educ Wroclaw, Wroclaw, Poland",,"Idzikowski, W (通讯作者)，Univ Sch Phys Educ Wroclaw, Org & Management Dept, Al Ignacego Jana Paderewskiego 35, PL-51612 Wroclaw, Poland.",wojciech.idzikowski@awf.wroc.pl,"Idzikowski, Wojciech/ABC-4039-2021; Perechuda, Igor/I-1773-2018","Perechuda, Igor/0000-0003-3120-7250; Idzikowski, Wojciech/0000-0001-9744-5804",,,,,23,1,1,1,13,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

Firstly, within a multivariate BEKK framework we identify high but volatile correlations with recurring highs around 0.8 and multiple periods of decoupling. OPEC meetings increase the correlation in the short run. Secondly, linear l(1)-trends reveal that long-term movements of WTI and Brent are driven by the same dynamics, confirming the 'one great pool' hypothesis. OPEC meetings have only little impact on long-term price trends. Thirdly, we find leading effects of WTI over Brent by short-term trends of several days, especially in a negative direction. These trends have an asymmetrical effect on volatility; negative trends cause a stronger increase than positive trends. These findings are of interest to policy makers as well as hedging strategies of crude oil portfolios and provide insight into long-term movements of crude prices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In many developing countries, a big proportion of the population still depends on biomass for cooking, and the adoption of clean cooking fuels is still limited. Here, we propose a structural model to estimate household demand and choices for cooking fuel using micro-datasets from nationally representative surveys for a subset of developing countries. We test the model by estimating the demand response to simulated changes in fuel prices and income. We find that the model provides a close approximation to the observed patterns in the data from the surveys. We also find that as long as incomes rise and the relative difference between the prices of biomass and cleaner fuels decreases, households will transition to cleaner cooking fuels. We discuss potential applications of the method for constructing and analyzing future scenarios of cooking energy transitions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Economics-based regime principles should entail recognition that: the China-US bilateral trade imbalance is unique mainly because of macroeconomic and financial factors, not trade; agreements should restrict commercial and government behaviors, not target economic outcomes; Chinese companies must compete and be allowed to succeed in any sector, including high-technology; China is not entitled to US-owned technology, thus intellectual property rights must be enforced; and the US Government should support an increased role for China in global economic governance.","[Posen, Adam S.] Peterson Inst Int Econ, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Peterson Institute for International Economics,"Posen, AS (通讯作者)，Peterson Inst Int Econ, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",aposen@piie.com,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,SEP-OCT,2018,26.0,5,,,SI,,2,11,,10.1111/cwe.12253,0.0,,,10,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GT4FU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000444460400002,0

In spite of widespread consensus on the role of absorptive capacity in innovation, the literature has so far concentrated only on traditional R&D and human capital based indicators of absorptive capacity. Furthermore, most firm-level studies investigating this relationship are cross-sectional in nature and there is need for longitudinal evidence. Employing the IAB Establishment Panel Survey on about 1200 private sector establishments in Germany during 2007-2011, we apply a structural model that links firms' human resource practices, R&D collaboration strategies and finally their innovation outcome. Findings from the first stage of the empirical analysis suggest that adoption of employment practices positively affects horizontal, institutional and consulting-based R&D cooperation, while compensation programs positively affect only horizontal R&D cooperation. In the second stage, the effect of cooperative R&D conditioned upon human resource practices on innovation performance is examined. Results indicate that firms having institutional and consulting-based R&D cooperation relationships are more often associated with higher incremental product, process and new-to-market innovation, whereas the effect is relatively weaker in case of horizontal R&D cooperation.","[Roy, Ipsita] Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Sci & Technol, Ctr Policy Res, New Delhi, India",Department of Science & Technology (India); Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Delhi,"Roy, I (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Sci & Technol, Ctr Policy Res, New Delhi, India.",ipsitaroy.eco@gmail.com,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft Research Training Group [1411],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft Research Training Group(German Research Foundation (DFG)),Financial support from Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft Research Training Group 1411 The Economics of Innovative Change is acknowledged.,,95,10,11,1,42,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Second, a transfer affects wage inequality. Third, a transfer is not neutral to world welfare. Fourth, floating exchange rates do not substitute for deflation.

Specifically, in one treatment for half of the games the payoff dominant and the risk dominant equilibrium coincide and for the other half of the games they conflict; in the second treatment they always conflict. The experiment provides evidence that the payoff range experienced by the participant influences the likelihood of efficient conventions emerging. In particular, experiencing games where payoff dominance and risk dominance coincide appears to make payoff dominance more attractive in games in which they conflict. In the experiment, we also observe conditional behavior emerging with experience. We develop a model of conditional expectations to explain these stylized facts that depends crucially on the assumption that after a brief learning period participants categorize their experience using the same relative bandwidth in both treatments even though the range of experience is twice as large in treatment 1 as it is in treatment 2. The assumption cannot be rejected by the data. The analysis provides a formal example in which increasing experienced diversity by changing the way similar experiences are categorized increases the likelihood of efficient conventions emerging in communities playing similar Stag Hunt games.","[Van Huyck, John] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Stahl, Dale O.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Econ, Austin, TX 78712 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Stahl, DO (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Dept Econ, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",stahl@eco.utexas.edu,,,National Science Foundation; Texas Advanced Research Program,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Texas Advanced Research Program,"Nick McKinney and Chris Ball provided able research assistance.

Using cross-industry variation, I show that the overall labor share decline is driven by the replacement of occupations specializing in routine tasks. I further find that the accelerated decline in the labor share since 2000 is associated with the replacement of higher skill occupations with substantial routine task content. Finally, I estimate the effects of increased import competition on the labor share decline and how this relates to the replacement of occupational tasks. While increased import competition plays a significant role in explaining the overall labor share decline and works through replacing routine occupations, it cannot account for the accelerated labor share decline and replacement of higher skill occupations post-2000.

I extend the collective model (Chiappori 1988, 1997) to allow labor choices to affect future bargaining power by raising the value of outside options. Even if household consumption sharing is efficient, labor choices are no longer efficient. Using data on Malawi, where there is predetermined variation in land rights that determine outside options in marriage, I show that individuals spend more time on agricultural labor and less time on wage labor when household land is theirs. They also have lower overall income and consumption. The results are inconsistent with the fully efficient collective model but consistent with a noncooperative model with limited commitment, where individuals allocate their labor supply to maximize future bargaining power. Limited commitment can lead to inefficient allocations that reduce household welfare.","[Walther, Selma] Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Walther, S (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry, W Midlands, England.",s.walther@warwick.ac.uk,,,,,,,68,15,19,0,13,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

Prominent solutions frequently rely on monitoring and punishment by central authorities. In recent years, the focus has shifted to decentralized approaches with mutual monitoring and social sanctions to foster cooperation. In this paper, we empirically test for the role of a specific form of social punishment, namely sanctions that are unobservable at first and only applied with a delay. We observe that in particular the combination of such unobservable sanctions with immediately observable sanctions strongly enhances cooperation within groups. Strikingly, this improvement is not caused by an extensive use of both forms of punishment.

In light of conflicting findings, this paper (i) reinvestigates the behavioral impact of so-called cognitive style in the PGG; and (ii) connects it with an earlier literature on the role of cognitive failure (confusion). This is motivated by the possibility that the method of time pressure, commonly used to identify cognitive style, invites confusion as a confounding factor. Two channels for such confounds are identified and experimentally tested: A heterogeneous treatment effect of time pressure depending on subjects' confusion status and a direct impact of time pressure on subjects' likelihood of being confused. Our reinvestigation of the behavioral impact of time pressure confirms that cognitive style matters, but that deliberation rather than intuition drives cooperation. The confounding effect of confusion is not found to be direct, but to operate through a heterogeneous treatment effect. Time pressure selectively reduces average contributions among those subjects whose contributions can confidently be interpreted as cooperative rather than confused. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Given an initial international distribution of honest and dishonest taxpayers, the tax system (e.g., tax rates and degrees of progressivity) and the salary in each country, individuals decide where to reside and how much time to spend working. The model allows us to study in a dynamic setting how the distribution of honest and dishonest earners is geographically affected by fiscal reforms (e.g., variations in tax rates) and auditing efforts (e.g., probability of auditing and fines) of different countries. We show that various dynamic long term scenarios can be generated. The particular convergence of the model depends crucially on the initial geographic distribution of dishonest agents. This implies that tax reforms that have been successful in reducing tax evasion in one country may produce very different results in others, if initial conditions are significantly different. Chaotic cyclical behavior may also arise if individual propensity to migrate is sufficiently high.","[Lamantia, Fabio] Univ Calabria, Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy; [Lamantia, Fabio] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Pezzino, Mario] Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Calabria; University of Manchester; University of Manchester,"Lamantia, F (通讯作者)，Univ Calabria, DESF, Via P Bucci 1-C, Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy.",fabio.lamantia@unical.it,,"Pezzino, Mario/0000-0001-9620-7660; Lamantia, Fabio/0000-0003-2147-0979","E.U.

Based on this historical experience, the paper then evaluates the impact of more rapid growth in labor productivity in the service sector in Asia using an empirical general equilibrium model that allows for goods and capital movements across sectors and economies, and consumption and investment dynamics. We find that faster productivity growth in the service sector in Asia contributes to sustained and balanced growth of Asian economies, but the dynamic adjustment is different across economies. In particular, during the adjustment to higher services productivity growth, there is a significant expansion of the durable manufacturing sector that is required to provide the capital stock that accompanies higher economic growth.","[Lee, Jong-Wha] Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Asiat Res Inst, Seoul, South Korea; [McKibbin, Warwick J.] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, ANU Ctr Appl Macroecon Anal CAMA, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Korea University; Australian National University,"McKibbin, WJ (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, ANU Ctr Appl Macroecon Anal CAMA, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",warwick.mckibbin@anu.edu.au,"McKibbin, Warwick J/A-4919-2008; Lee, Jong-Wha/I-1076-2016","McKibbin, Warwick J/0000-0002-1604-1021; Lee, Jong-Wha/0000-0002-3152-4961",,,,,31,24,25,0,22,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

This is the case under pure quantitative easing, where the target is the size of real money balances. In contrast, credit easing policies restrict the composition of the portfolio by targeting a specific expansion in the maturity profile of bonds bought, and thus can implement a determinate path of inflation.

We explore the modes of food acquisition, dietary diversity, caloric and protein intake, and qualitative food insecurity measures for different categories of respondents. We conduct a cross-sectional analysis comparing old clients to newly registered first time borrowers. Next, we compare first time borrowers and nonborrowers using a panel design. While the cross-sectional analysis allows the comparison of women that similarly self-selected into borrowing, the panel analysis complements by providing insights into changes of food security parameters. In both cases, we use Kernel matching, or difference-in-difference with Kernel matching, to control for potential bias in observables, and perform a sensitivity analysis with respect to unobservables using Rosenbaum bounds as well as an individual fixed effects panel analysis. Results show a decline in food security following the uptake of microcredit. In particular, the analysis reveals robustly lower dietary diversity among long-time borrowers than new borrowers, and larger reductions in dietary diversity scores among new borrowers, after 1 year, compared to controls. The reduction in dietary diversity was traced to a reduction in animal-source food, fruit and sugar intake. We find indicative evidence that this is partly explained by a shift from own production to reliance on food purchase by households. Other household members relegating the burden of food provision to women after borrowing may also help explain the observed result.","[Namayengo, Faith M.; Antonides, Gerrit] Wageningen Univ, Urban Econ Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Namayengo, Faith M.] Kyambogo Univ, POB 1, Kampala, Uganda; [Cecchi, Francesco] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Nettelbosje 2, NL-9747 AE Groningen, Netherlands; [Cecchi, Francesco] Wageningen Univ, Dev Econ Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; University of Groningen; Wageningen University & Research,"Antonides, G (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Urban Econ Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",Gerrit.Antonides@wur.nl,"Antonides, Gerrit/AAY-2234-2020; Cecchi, Francesco/AAV-2883-2021","Antonides, Gerrit/0000-0002-9983-1263; Cecchi, Francesco/0000-0002-2571-5411",,,,,120,9,9,0,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

Conducting the comparison from a production perspective can help policymakers pinpoint opportunities to improve the general production system to reduce national emission intensity. This study proposes a spatial production theoretical decomposition analysis (PDA) approach for such a purpose. Built upon the production theory framework, the proposed spatial PDA model quantifies the impacts of carbon technical performance, potential carbon factor and economy structure on regional disparities in emission intensity. Inter-factor substitution effects are further captured by using a two-stage decomposition procedure. Relevant methodological issues are discussed. The spatial PDA model is then applied to compare the emission intensities of 14 global economies in 2007. It is shown that the proposed model reveals the driving forces of regional disparities from viewpoints of production technology and technical efficiency, and is useful to shape pertinent policy measures aiming at promoting national emission intensity.

We focus on China, which experienced fiscal decentralization during 1979-1993 and then partly centralized its revenue with the 1994 fiscal reform. By employing both time series and province-level panel data, we show that Chinese provincial and total government spending was strongly procyclical during the decentralization period before the reform, but both became significantly less procyclical with respect to nationwide output fluctuations after the reform. We suggest several channels through which the procyclicality of subnational government spending in decentralized fiscal federations could be restrained.

In these environments, vertical tax competition occurs as governments share a common sales tax base, and local jurisdictions have autonomy over sales tax rates. As cash-strapped states look to sales taxes for additional revenues, local governments may worry about potentially adverse revenue impacts, as consumers react to combined tax rate increases. This study examines state-municipal and county-municipal fiscal spillovers using an empirical approach that accounts for endogenous tax policy leadership and voter tax fatigue. Employing comprehensive longitudinal data from Oklahoma, we find that state tax hikes significantly crowd out future rate increases for the large group of jurisdictions that are designated as followers. Leader jurisdictions are not found to display crowd-out tendencies, a result that is consistent with recent work suggesting that leaders may be less influenced by vertical fiscal externalities than other jurisdictions.","[Burge, Gregory S.; Rogers, Cynthia L.] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Econ, Norman, OK 73019 USA",University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman,"Burge, GS (通讯作者)，Univ Oklahoma, Dept Econ, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",gburge@ou.edu; crogers@ou.edu,,,,,,,31,2,2,0,6,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

In parallel, there has been substantial reallocation of labor income from occupations relatively substitutable with ICT (routine) to ones relatively complementary (non-routine). These trends are consistent with the view that ICT allows for the mechanization of tasks that traditionally required labor, a process known as automation. Our calibration suggests that automation can account for half of the decline in the labor share, but that it is unlikely to be the sole driver of the decline in the routine labor income share. A representative agent framework suggests welfare gains of 4%. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We estimate a dynamic general equilibrium model with intangible capital (IC) using aggregate data on output, investment and hours and find that it generates profits that are over five times as volatile as output. A similar model without IC relies on preference shocks to generate profits that are 3.5 times as volatile as output. Variance decomposition analysis reveals that shocks to IC productivity account for 85% of the variance of output, and over 50% of hours and investment. The increased volatility of profits is associated with a time-varying wedge between wages and the marginal product of labor which is shown to be highly correlated with the data-based labor wedge. The estimation identifies the sixties and the nineties as periods of rapid IC accumulation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

These results contrast with results under non-payoff dependent deviations from best response behavior, where it has previously been shown that the Kalai-Smorodinsky and Nash bargaining solutions emerge as long run norms. We complement the theory with experiments on human subjects, results of which suggest that non-best response play is payoff dependent and displays intentional bias.

We find that married men choose on average about 2.8% of their hours of work to shield against wage shocks. The effect is strongest for self-employed, who we find to be unconstrained in their hours choices, but also relevant for other groups with more persistent hours constraints.

For this purpose, we build a dynamical system composed of four variables (the rate of utilization, the wage share, the nominal rate of interest and the expected rate of inflation) and examine the properties, especially stability, of this dynamical system. We then find that the existence of (adaptive) inflation-deflation expectations always destabilizes our Kaleckian system (irrespective of the revision speed of expectations) while that the monetary authority's intensive inflation-targeting policy can make the system stable but the effect of this policy depends heavily upon the public credibility of it.

In this setting, we find that information aggregation works well with voting rules other than simple majority: as voters vote less often against their information than in conventional models, they can deliver higher-quality decisions, including in the canonical 12 jurors case. We obtain voting equilibria with many instances, in which other voting rules, including unanimity, clearly outperform simple majority.","[Pan, Addison; Fabrizi, Simona; Lippert, Steffen] Univ Auckland, Dept Econ, Owen G Glenn Bldg,12 Grafton Rd, Auckland 1010, New Zealand; [Pan, Addison; Fabrizi, Simona; Lippert, Steffen] ATE Res Network, Owen G Glenn Bldg,12 Grafton Rd, Auckland 1010, New Zealand; [Lippert, Steffen] Univ Auckland, Te Punaha Matatini & Publ Policy Inst, Owen G Glenn Bldg,12 Grafton Rd, Auckland 1010, New Zealand",University of Auckland; University of Auckland,"Pan, A (通讯作者)，Univ Auckland, Dept Econ, Owen G Glenn Bldg,12 Grafton Rd, Auckland 1010, New Zealand.;Pan, A (通讯作者)，ATE Res Network, Owen G Glenn Bldg,12 Grafton Rd, Auckland 1010, New Zealand.",addison.pan@auckland.ac.nz; s.fabrizi@auckland.ac.nz; s.lippert@auckland.ac.nz,"Lippert, Steffen/M-8808-2019; Fabrizi, Simona/L-8229-2016","Fabrizi, Simona/0000-0001-5804-2762; Lippert, Steffen/0000-0002-4045-1266",Royal Society of New Zealand [UOA1617]; Massey University,Royal Society of New Zealand(Royal Society of New Zealand); Massey University,"This work was supported by Royal Society of New Zealand, Funder Id: 10.13039/501100001509, Grant Number: Marsden Grant UOA1617 and Massey University, Funder Id: 10.13039/501100001554, Grant Number: Massey University Research Fund (MURF) 2015.",,22,2,2,0,1,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

Unlike all previous studies that use time invariant linear models, our approach reveals that the pre 1600 period is a turbulent economic period of high volatility that is only repeated in the 20th century. The repeating patterns in the conditional volatilities follow from aggregate supply shocks, while most of the inflation responses follow from aggregate demand shocks. Thus, we uncover that despite the technological growth and the various changes in the structure of the U.K. economy in the last century, the recurring patterns call for an examination of the true impact of the various policies on the economy.

The determinants of electricity production have been neglected in the literature that favours the relationship between energy consumption, growth and development, and despite of the major challenges on electricity supply systems. We empirically establish that weighted conflict index, as well as sub-items as anti-government demonstrations, government crises and riots negatively influence electricity production per capita, after controlling for income per capita. Country conflicts affect electricity production mostly in the long-run. Our results imply that conflicts may affect electricity production substantially and consequently the economy as a whole. Policy should emphasize the institutional framework to avoid conflicts within countries in order to secure electricity production. (C) 2018 The Society for Policy Modeling. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Furthermore, students can specify financial aid in their preferences, and they can be matched with multiple colleges simultaneously. This clearinghouse keeps the desirable properties of decentralized college admissions, like commitment and yield management, while getting rid of the undesirable aspects, such as unfairness and unraveling. To study centralized college admissions, I advance the theory of stability for many-to-many matching markets with contracts. In particular, I show that the student-proposing deferred acceptance algorithm (SPDA) produces a stable matching even when college choice rules do not satisfy path independence (or substitutability) but when they have path-independent modifications. In addition, I provide a comparative statics for SPDA and introduce a new monotonicity condition on choice rules when contracts may have different weights to study yield management. My framework opens new avenues for market-design research and raises questions about the standard assumptions made in the literature. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","[Yenmez, M.

How is it affected when the tax rate changes along with the generosity of these transfers? In our search model, taxes are levied on formal-sector workers as a proportion of their wage. Transfers, in contrast, are lump-sum and are received by both formal and informal workers. This implies that high-wage formal workers subsidize low-wage formal workers as well as informal workers. We calibrate the model to Mexico and perform counterfactuals. We find that the size of the informal sector is quite inelastic to changes in taxes and transfers. This is due to the presence of search frictions and to the cross-subsidy in our model: for low-wage formal jobs, a tax increase is roughly offset by an increase in benefits, leaving the unemployed approximately indifferent. Our results are consistent with the empirical evidence on the recent introduction of the Seguro Popular healthcare program.","[Alonso-Ortiz, Jorge] ITAM, Ctr Invest Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Leal, Julio] Banco Mexico, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico; Bank of Mexico,"Leal, J (通讯作者)，Banco Mexico, Colonia Ctr, Ave 5 Mayo 2, Mexico City 06059, DF, Mexico.",jleal@banxico.org.mx,,,,,,,26,4,4,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Controlling for genetic and environmental factors, the completion of upper secondary education significantly lowers the probability of conviction for total, property, and violent crimes for males. Family factors matter education lowers crime earlier in the life cycle for children of low educated parents and later in life for children of high educated parents. Exposure to crime during childhood similarly impacts the dynamics of the crime reducing effects of education across the life cycle. Examining different educational programs reveals completing high school is important for crime reduction, while vocational education has a smaller impact on crime. Results are robust to controlling for differences in early health, directly estimating reverse causality between education and crime, and using data on prison sentences instead of convictions.

We then use it to compare the short- and long-term effects of immigration restrictions on the world distribution of income. Our calibration strategy replicates the economic and demographic characteristics of the world, and allows us to proxy bilateral migration costs and visa costs for two classes of workers and for each pair of countries. In our benchmark simulations, the world average level of income per worker increases by 12% in the short term and by approximately 52% after one century. These results are highly robust to our identifying strategy and technological assumptions. Sizable differences are obtained when our baseline (pre-liberalization) trajectory involves a rapid income convergence between countries or when we adjust visa costs for a possible upward bias. Our quantitative analysis reveals that the effects of liberalizing migration on human capital accumulation and income are gradual and cumulative. Whatever is the size of the short-term gain, the long-run impact is 4 to 5 times greater (except under a rapid convergence in income).","[Delogu, Marco] Univ Sassari, DISEA, Via Muroni 25, Sassari, Italy; [Docquier, Frederic] Catholic Univ Louvain, IRES, 3 Pl Montesquieu Bte L2-06-01, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Machado, Joel] Luxembourg Inst Socioecon Res LISER, Maison Sci Humaines, 11 Porte Sci, L-4366 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg; [Docquier, Frederic] Natl Fund Sci Res FNRS, 5 Rue Egmont, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium",University of Sassari; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Docquier, F (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, IRES, 3 Pl Montesquieu Bte L2-06-01, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.;Docquier, F (通讯作者)，Natl Fund Sci Res FNRS, 5 Rue Egmont, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.",mdelogu@uniss.it; frederic.docquier@uclouvain.be; joel.machado@liser.lu,,"Machado, Joel/0000-0001-9832-8044; Docquier, Frederic/0000-0003-3581-6141; Delogu, Marco/0000-0003-2761-5569",CESifo sponsorship; ARC convention on Geographical Mobility of Factors [09/14-019]; Luxembourg National Research Fund [9037210],CESifo sponsorship; ARC convention on Geographical Mobility of Factors; Luxembourg National Research Fund(Luxembourg National Research Fund),"This paper benefited from the helpful suggestions from four anonymous referees.

Using a dynamic general equilibrium model we analyze the social welfare response to a negative technology shock under different capital requirement regimes, Basel II and III. In Basel III, we consider alternative indicators, such as output gap and credit-to-output gap. We then consider the scenario where the default rate is augmented in different capital requirement regimes. We show that it is welfare improving by including the default rate as an additional indicator for all capital requirement regimes. A more aggressive reaction to default can effectively mitigate the negative effect of the shock on welfare and this attenuation effect works through the bank funding channel.","[Garcia-Barragan, Fernando; Liu, Guangling] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Econ, Stellenbosch, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"Liu, GL (通讯作者)，Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Econ, Stellenbosch, South Africa.",garcia.barragan@gmail.com; gliu@sun.ac.za,,"GARCIA-BARRAGAN, FERNANDO/0000-0003-0811-5884",,,,,32,0,1,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Parental discrepancies in assessing child behavioral and educational outcomes,REVIEW OF ECONOMICS OF THE HOUSEHOLD,,,English,Article,,,,,,Child development; Informant discrepancies; Reporting bias; Response heterogeneity,HEALTH; SYMPTOMS; BIAS,"We investigate the degree of correspondence between parents' reports on child behavioral and educational outcomes using wave four of a rich Danish longitudinal survey of children (the DALSC). All outcomes are measured at age 11 when the children are expected to be in fifth grade. Once discrepancies are detected, we analyze whether they are driven by noisy evaluations or by systematic bias, focusing on the role of parental characteristics and response heterogeneity. We then explicitly assess the relative importance of the mother's versus the father's assessments in explaining child academic performance and diagnosed mental health to investigate whether one parent is systematically a better informant of their child's outcomes than the other. Our results show that parental psychopathology, measured as maternal distress, is a source of systematic misreporting of child functioning, that the parent-child relationship matters, and that mothers are not necessarily a better informant of child functioning than fathers. This last finding should not only be valid for Denmark but also for many other countries, where the father's role in childcare has been growing.","[Gupta, Nabanita Datta] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Fuglesangs Alle 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark; [Lausten, Mette] SFI, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Pozzoli, Dario] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark",Aarhus University; Copenhagen Business School,"Gupta, ND (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Fuglesangs Alle 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark.",ndg@econ.au.dk; mel@sfi.dk; dp.eco@cbs.dk,"Datta Gupta, Nabanita/JXN-4176-2024","Datta Gupta, Nabanita/0000-0001-7904-445X; Lausten, Mette/0000-0003-3492-9099",,,,,27,4,5,1,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

In doing so, the paper analyzes the shape of the upper income tail as well as the national income shares accruing to different groups within the richest decile. The findings suggest that systemic banking crises reduce income concentration within the top decile of the US pre-tax and transfers income distribution, and more generally, that the effect is highly heterogeneous across different top income groups. While the richest income group loses ground, the lower half of the top decile appears to gain in relative terms. However, evidence suggests that the estimated short-term effect of market forces stemming from banking crises can be relatively small in magnitude and even temporary in nature, as it may be quickly reabsorbed. These findings lend indirect support to the idea that only substantial changes in government policies and institutional frameworks can bring about radical changes in income distribution.","[Morelli, Salvatore] CUNY, Stone Ctr Socio Econ Inequal, Grad Ctr, New York, NY 10021 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Morelli, S (通讯作者)，CUNY, Stone Ctr Socio Econ Inequal, Grad Ctr, New York, NY 10021 USA.",salvatore.morelli@gmail.com,"Morelli, Salvatore/AAA-6202-2021","Morelli, Salvatore/0000-0002-1935-3565",,,,,70,5,5,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

J,"Stern, N",,,,"Stern, Nicholas",,,Public economics as if time matters: Climate change and the dynamics of policy,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,UNCERTAINTY; POVERTY; UTILITY; FUTURE; WORK,"Tony Atkinson played a crucial role in shaping modern public economics, but throughout his life challenged whether we were making the right assumptions and were building models which captured the essence of the issues under examination. This paper examines questions discussed with Tony concerning public policy to foster change where the pace and nature of change are critical to any serious policy assessment. The primary example is climate change. The paper argues that subjects such as the dynamics of innovation, of potentially immense and destabilising risks, and of political economy, together with technicalities around non-linearities and dynamic increasing returns, all of which are at the heart of the challenge of climate change, will require a series of focused models for their investigation. Attempts to build integrated assessment models (IAMB) for the analysis of climate change have been largely misplaced and omit key effects and questions of the above kind. Intertemporal issues and values are at the core of policy towards climate change and the paper shows that much of the intertemporal economic analysis of the issues around climate change has been misguided and has ridden roughshod over the analytical underpinnings and the underlying ethics of discounting. Where major decline is possible, discounting is fiercely endogenous; and where capital markets are imperfect and risk intense, discount rates cannot be read off from markets. Notwithstanding the modelling difficulties and the challenging research agenda, the paper argues that the urgency of the problem (for example, world infrastructure will double in the next 15-20 years and there are major dangers of lock-in of dirty and damaging capital) require strong action and we know enough about policy to begin travelling down the path of an attractive low-carbon transition.

Middle managers may curtail the rate and scope of innovation when executives are expected to reduce their innovation involvement. We test our prediction by exploiting a natural experiment in Delaware where court rulings increased takeover protection for Delaware firms. Difference-in-differences estimates show that increased takeover protection reduced the rate of innovation by firms, and that it also reduced the scope of innovation across several key dimensions (technological, temporal, organizational, and international). Consistent with our argument, we find that the negative effect of takeover protection on innovation was weaker for larger firms, where innovation decision making authority is more likely to be delegated to middle managers and executive involvement is lower. Finally, we examine the substitutive relationship between competitive pressures from the takeover market and the product market, and find that the negative effect of takeover protection on innovation was stronger for firms facing low competitive pressure from the product market.

The intermediate input structure is also closely related to the production technology level. Therefore, this study recommends a new technology adjusted consumption-based carbon accounting framework that distinguishes between direct and cumulative exports, forward and backward industrial linkages, and different trade patterns. Based on the consideration that production-based accounting will remain the core indicator for regional emissions in the near future, this study proposes a technology-adjusted production-based accounting framework. The empirical study is based on the World Input-Output Database, and the results indicate that technology-adjusted carbon accounting will redraw the global emissions map if the intermediate input linkage is considered. The technology-adjusted carbon accounting method satisfies the conditions of additivity, sensitivity, monotonicity, and scale invariance, through proper selection of the world average emissions multipliers.

Firstly, we decompose stock index return into different independent intrinsic mode functions and wavelet decomposition functions. Secondly, we reconstruct the independent IMFs and wavelet decomposition functions into three components: a high-frequency component (effects of irregular events), a low frequency component (effects of extreme events) and the long-term trend. Thirdly, we assess the accumulated impulse response and analyze the stock markets contagion under time- varying frequencies. Results show that shocks caused by irregular events and extreme events can be transmitted between different stock markets. Moreover, shocks caused by irregular events can pose sudden and short-term risk contagion to stock returns. And shocks caused by extreme events can pose positive and sustained risk contagion to stock returns. Also, we compare our results with those from the discrete wavelet transform model and findings in the literature.","[Zhou, Zhongbao; Lin, Ling; Li, Shuxian] Hunan Univ, Sch Business Adm, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China",Hunan University,"Lin, L (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ, Sch Business Adm, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China.",Z.B.Zhou@hnu.edu.cn; llhnfx@126.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71371067, 71431008]; Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [2017JJ1012]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province),"We gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71371067, 71431008) and Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 2017JJ1012).",,50,35,38,5,39,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Using panel data from 1984 to 2014, I document that (i) developed countries exhibit larger inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI), (ii) countries subject to high investment risk (IR) receive low FDI inflows, and (iii) IR is higher in fractionalized and politically unstable economies. These findings suggest a negative relationship between political instability and FDI through the IR channel. I inspect the theoretical mechanism using a dynamic political economy model of redistribution, wherein policymakers can expropriate resources from foreign investors. The proceeds are used to finance group-specific transfers to domestic workers but hinder economic growth by discouraging FDI. I show that the political equilibrium exhibits overexpropriation and underinvestment.","[Azzimonti, Marina] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Econ, 100 Nicolls Rd, Stony Brook, NY 11790 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook,"Azzimonti, M (通讯作者)，SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Econ, 100 Nicolls Rd, Stony Brook, NY 11790 USA.",marina.azzimonti@gmail.com,,"Azzimonti, Marina/0000-0001-6253-1622",,,,,40,14,16,3,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-6598,1468-2354,,INT ECON REV,Int.

Using the US O*NET database and its definition of green jobs, 19.4% of US workers could currently be part of the green economy in a broad sense, although a large proportion of green employment would be 'indirectly' green, comprising existing jobs that are expected to be in high demand due to greening, but do not require significant changes in tasks, skills, or knowledge. Analysis of task content also shows that green jobs vary in 'greenness', with very few jobs only consisting of green tasks, suggesting that the term 'green' should be considered a continuum rather than a binary characteristic. While it is easier to transition to indirectly green rather than directly green jobs, greening is likely to involve transitions on a similar scale and scope of existing job transitions. Non-green jobs generally appear to differ from their green counterparts in only a few skill-specific aspects, suggesting that most re-training can happen on-the-job. Network analysis shows that the green economy offers a large potential for short-run growth if job transitions are strategically managed. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Following early market euphoria after the elections on the account of expected decisive pro-market policies, uncertainty regarding the composition and timing of the new administration's economic policies has been the norm. Early proposals included a substantial fiscal stimulus which, combined with a tightening monetary stance, was expected to drive up long-run interest rates and the dollar, leading to widening global imbalances and potential instability. Today the expansionary impact of the fiscal plans is the subject of a heated debate while monetary policy continues to tighten steadily and risks related to a protectionist trade agenda remain pronounced. Contrary to initial expectations, real interest rates and the dollar have weakened, while global imbalances persist. Addressing policy and structural needs in the US - and abroad - is a necessary condition to rein in global imbalances. In this context, this paper will discuss the role of the G20/G7 to promote a coordinated policy approach and in particular to what extent the G20/G7 can deal with the transition from crisis management to the balancing of heterogeneous preferences among the policy makers to promote global growth and stability.

Bundling is beneficial to the originator when it discourages investors from analyzing idiosyncratic risks and focuses their attention on aggregate risks. But it is optimal to sell aggregate risks separately in order to exploit investors' heterogeneous expertise in learning about them and thus lower the risk premium. This analysis rationalizes the common securitization practice of bundling loans by asset class, which is at odds with existing theories based on diversification. The analysis also offers an alternative perspective on conglomerate formation (a form of asset bundling), and its relation to empirical evidence in that context is discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, the fiscal equalization scheme largely compensates municipalities for the loss in the LBT base when they increase the LBT rate.

The literature has predominately focused on the case in which bidders are ex-ante symmetric and privately informed, and finds that aggressive bidding such that payoffs are negative is common (the winner's curse). In practice, bidders often only have access to public information, and use this information to form (possibly differing) beliefs. In addition, a bidder who is not privately informed may face bidders who are. We examine bidding behavior of both informed and uninformed bidders, and vary the information structure they face. We find that uninformed bidders underbid dramatically and persistently, while informed bidders tend to overbid in the two bidder case.

After 1914, citations to recent research from abroad decreased and paper titles became less similar (evaluated by latent semantic analysis), suggesting a reduction in international knowledge flows. Reduced international scientific cooperation led to a decline in the production of basic science and its application in new technology Specifically, we compare productivity changes for scientists who relied on frontier research from abroad, to changes for scientists who relied on frontier research from home. After 1914, scientists who relied on frontier research from abroad published fewer papers in top scientific journals, produced less Nobel Prize nominated research, introduced fewer novel scientific words, and introduced fewer novel words that appeared in the text of subsequent patent grants. The productivity of scientists who relied on top 1% research declined twice as much as the productivity of scientists who relied on top 3% research. Furthermore, highly prolific scientists experienced the starkest absolute productivity declines.

Different from the defined-benefit scheme, where aging harms the financial sustainability of the social security system, the NDC determines pension benefits while taking into account life expectancy and demographic trends, turning the issue of financial sustainability into one of pension adequacy. This paper explores the balance sheet effects when life expectancy, retirement thresholds and entry age in the labor market vary by cohorts. The study suggests some solutions for practical issues concerning aging in NDC systems, such as (a) the bias related to the forecasts of survival rates, (b) the indexation of pension benefits and (c) the setup of tenure and age requirements for retirement.","[Patriarca, Fabrizio] Roma Tre Univ, Rome, Italy",Roma Tre University,"Patriarca, F (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tre, Dept Law, Via Ostiense, I-00100 Rome, Italy.",fapatri@hotmail.com,"Patriarca, Fabrizioa/AAZ-9890-2020","Patriarca, Fabrizio/0000-0002-3840-492X",,,,,29,2,2,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,MAY,2018,69.0,2,,,,,396,408,,10.1111/meca.12191,0.0,,,13,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GB2MW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428888200004,0

Equivalence scales and indifference scales can be estimated using off-the-shelf household-level consumer expenditure data and standard econometric techniques for nonlinear equation systems. I offer a short introduction to the identification, estimation and use of equivalence scales and indifference scales and argue that these are complementary tools in the analysis of inequality and poverty. The methods are illustrated with Canadian household expenditure data from the Surveys of Household Spending 2004-2009.

The rate of overall economic growth in this model is a simple average of sectorial growth in a closed economy, but will depend on trade parameters in an open economy as openness to trade shifts resources toward fast-growing sectors. We find that the overall growth rate is unambiguously higher as the number of trading partners increases. These conclusions survive even after trade cost is introduced. Nevertheless, trade share and growth rate may not move in the same direction as trade liberalization is pursued or as the number of trading partners is increased.

We find that cross-border marriages mainly involve men from the low tail of the HK attribute distribution. We also find that HK women's position in the marriage market and within households deteriorated following the reduction in cross-border marriage costs and that their disadvantaged position exerts an incentive effect on their labor market behavior.

Mandarin has become a very important trade language for the Belt and Road countries. This paper uses the difference-in-difference model and the Mahalanobis distance and the nearest neighbor distance matching methods to study the internal relationship between culture going out and foreign trade. We find that cultural affinity is an important factor in promoting trade, and that the HSK project has expanded China's exports to the Belt and Road countries. Culture's promotion effect in Asia is stronger than that in Europe. Culture's promotion effect shows the characteristics of regional differences, a time-lag and a fluctuating upward trend. Therefore, further enhancing the international influence of its culture would help China to find a new source of export growth.","[Xie, Mengjun] Shandong Technol & Business Univ, Coll Int Educ, Yantai, Peoples R China",Shandong Technology & Business University,"Xie, MJ (通讯作者)，Shandong Technol & Business Univ, Coll Int Educ, Yantai, Peoples R China.",mjxie3@163.com,,,"Shandong Natural Science Fund [ZR2018QG004]; Shandong Social Science Fund [18CGLJ44, 15CGLJ19]",Shandong Natural Science Fund; Shandong Social Science Fund,The author thanks the Chinese Testing International Limited Company for the data.

Importantly, I use constitutionally prescribed two-round elections to measure electoral closeness and thereby improve on existing work that mostly uses ex post measures that are prone to endogeneity. The results suggest that electoral closeness matters: a one standard deviation increase in closeness increases turnout by 1.27 percentage points, which corresponds to 1/7 of a standard deviation in this variable. I also evaluate how other factors such as electorate size or rain on election day affect turnout differentially depending on the closeness of the race. While rain decreases turnout on average, this effect is mitigated in close elections, as indicated by a positive interaction effect of the two variables.","[Arnold, Felix] DIW Berlin, DE-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Arnold, Felix] FU Berlin, DE-10117 Berlin, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Free University of Berlin,"Arnold, F (通讯作者)，DIW Berlin, DE-10117 Berlin, Germany.;Arnold, F (通讯作者)，FU Berlin, DE-10117 Berlin, Germany.",farnold@diw.de,,,,,,,43,13,13,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,1467-9442,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

Studying household savings and credit patterns is a fundamental key to financial development. Methods: This paper uses a synthetic panel to provide a semi-parametric estimation of savings and debt patterns over life cycle. Result: It shows that the beginning of family life mainly depends on credit, while at the end, there is a high monetary saving profile, sustained and different from the reduction predicted by the life cycle model. Human capital and income explain most of differences between families' financial patterns. Conclusions: Results show persistence of inequalities in the financing process; financial literacy and saving incentives should be main goals for the country's inclusion strategy.","[Ceballos Mina, Owen Eli] Univ Autonoma Metropolitana Azcapotzalco, Dept Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana - Mexico,"Mina, OEC (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Metropolitana Azcapotzalco, Dept Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",oecm@azc.uam.mx,"Mina, Owen Eli Ceballos/ITV-4905-2023","Mina, Owen Eli Ceballos/0000-0003-1931-8388",,,,,41,1,2,0,7,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

This article attempts to fill the void by surveying and evaluating the situation in the Member States of the European Union (EU) and some other countries. Farmers are often exempted from VAT for administrative and political reasons. But this means that the VAT on their inputs cannot be 'washed out' through the tax deduction/credit mechanism. It then has to be borne by the farmers themselves or becomes an indeterminate and capricious element in consumer prices. To compensate farmers for the uncompensated VAT on inputs, the EU has devised a flat-rate scheme that permits them to charge a presumptive rate (approximately equal to the effective VAT rate on sector-wide inputs) on their sales to taxable agro-processing firms which, in turn, are permitted to take a deduction for this flat-rate addition from the VAT on their sales. Obviously, the flat-rate scheme is an arbitrary way of trying to achieve equal treatment between exempt and taxable farmers and between exempt farm products and other taxable goods and services. Full taxation, subject to the general threshold, appears to be the preferred choice.","[Cnossen, Sijbren] CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, The Hague, Netherlands",CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy,"Cnossen, S (通讯作者)，CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, The Hague, Netherlands.",cnossen@ese.eur.nl,,,,,,,40,6,6,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Under high profitability conditions, output levels are U-shaped in the strictness of the policy. The latter result is new in the literature.

Advocates point to the ease of use, lower prices, and shorter wait times compared to hailing a taxi or prearranging limousine service. Others argue that proper government oversight is necessary to protect ride-share passengers from driver error or vehicle parts failures and violence from unlicensed strangers. Using U.S. county-level data from 2007 through 2015, we investigate whether the introduction of the ride-sharing service Uber is associated with changes in fatal vehicle crashes and crime. We find that Uber's entry lowers the rate of DUIs and fatal accidents. For some specifications, we also find declines in arrests for assault and disorderly conduct. Conversely, we observe an increase in vehicle thefts.","[Dills, Angela K.] Western Carolina Univ, Coll Business, Dept Econ Management & Prod Management, Forsyth 224A,1 Univ Way, Cullowhee, NC 28723 USA; [Mulholland, Sean E.] Western Carolina Univ, Coll Business, Dept Econ Management & Prod Management, Forsyth 224D,1 Univ Way, Cullowhee, NC 28723 USA",University of North Carolina; Western Carolina University; University of North Carolina; Western Carolina University,"Mulholland, SE (通讯作者)，Western Carolina Univ, Coll Business, Dept Econ Management & Prod Management, Forsyth 224D,1 Univ Way, Cullowhee, NC 28723 USA.",angeladills@gmail.com; seanemulholland@gmail.com,,"Dills, Angela/0000-0001-9527-9902",,,,,51,65,74,5,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

I document a concave life-cycle pattern in the payoffs to personality traits, with the largest effects between the ages of 40 and 60. An interaction of traits with education reveals that personality matters most for highly educated men. The largest effects are found for Conscientiousness, Extraversion, and Agreeableness (negative), where Conscientiousness operates partly through education, which also has significant returns.

The growth rates of liability of foreignness (LOF) and advantages of foreignness (AOF) finally determine whether cultural distance cause conflicts or improve innovation. In addition, we find that how China's OFDI activities are related to the difference of cultural distance hinges on the particular cultural dimension in question. The latter suggests that that the relative weight of cultural dimensions should be considered in the calculation of cultural distance.

The questionnaire survey data were processed using a multivariate approach of the Fisher linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and its partial least squares algorithm (pIsLDA) considering two-set cases and the functional relation of both methods depending on a parameter. It was revealed that although the differences between bachelor and master requirements in communication competencies are more pronounced considering the results of the classical approach to discriminant analysis, this is not the case in its partial least squares variant. The differences are to a great extent variable, filling the whole set of individual competencies. However, the most significant competencies demanded from master graduates are: providing a complex view summary, providing feedback, time management, leadership and planning, considering both boundaries of eigenvalues with corresponding eigenvectors analytical (resp. smooth) path.

Overbuilding of durable capital such as housing requires a reallocation of productive resources to other sectors, which is facilitated by a reduction in the interest rate. When monetary policy is constrained, overbuilding induces a demand-driven recession with limited reallocation and low output. Investment in other capital initially declines due to low demand, but it later booms and induces an asymmetric recovery in which the overbuilt sector is left behind. Welfare can be improved by ex post policies that stimulate investment (including in overbuilt capital) and ex ante policies that restrict investment.","[Rognlie, Matthew] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, 2211 Campus Dr, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Shleifer, Andrei] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Littauer Bldg, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Shleifer, Andrei; Simsek, Alp] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Simsek, Alp] MIT, Dept Econ, Bldg E52, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA",Northwestern University; Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Rognlie, M (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, 2211 Campus Dr, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",matthew.rognlie@northwestern.edu; shleifer@fas.harvard.edu; asimsek@mit.edu,,"Simsek, Alp/0009-0005-9128-3249","NSF [SES-1455319]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1455319] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",Simsek acknowledges support from the NSF under Grant Number SES-1455319.

Excessive impatience created by the presence of temptation in preferences causes a bias in favour of present consumption and a two-dimensional problem: under-saving and over-supply-of-labor. In such an environment, the two-dimensional problem requires two-dimensional tax policy tools. In particular, we first show that subsidizing savings alone improves welfare because it mitigates the under-saving problem i.e. inter-temporal allocation distortion. However, the optimal subsidy rate is not as high as in Krusell et al. (2010) because the savings subsidy amplifies the over-supply-of-labor problem, i.e. intra-temporal allocation distortion. Next, we find that labor income tax policy alone improves welfare because it mitigates the intra-temporal allocation distortion; however, its welfare gains are constrained by its adverse effects on savings. Finally, we demonstrate that a combination of capital and labor income taxation appears to be a more effective policy.","[Tran, Chung] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",Australian National University,"Tran, C (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",chung.tran@anu.edu.au,,"Tran, Chung/0000-0001-8252-469X",,,,,30,2,2,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

We measured institutional quality by the sum of control of corruption and rule of law indicators. We provide evidence that institutional quality positively and significantly impacts F.D.I. in developed countries; specifically, we find that a one standard deviation change in governance significantly affects F.D.I. by a factor of 0.2225 (using common law and the lagged values of the independent variables as instruments). Ceteris paribus, the results for the developing countries demonstrate that the institutional quality impact is insignificant because of the weak structure of institutions. Result findings strongly support the significance of governance indicators in attracting F.D.I. inflows. From our results, we infer that the relevance of governance indicators tends to be a key point in attracting F.D.I. inflows.","[Peres, Mihaela; Ameer, Waqar; Xu, Helian] Hunan Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China",Hunan University,"Xu, HL (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.",xuhelian@163.com,,,Major Project of National Social Science Foundation of China [16ZDA038],Major Project of National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),This work was supported by the Major Project of National Social Science Foundation of China [grant number 16ZDA038].,,79,96,110,3,44,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We study the behaviour of the UK energy and non-energy intensive sectors firms in a real business cycle (RBC) model using unfiltered data. The model is econometrically estimated and tested by indirect inference. Output contraction during the Great Recession was largely caused by energy price and sector-specific productivity shocks, all of which are non-stationary and hence tend to dominate the sample variance decomposition. We also found that the channel by which the energy price shock reduces output in the model is via the terms of trade: these fall permanently when world energy prices increase and as substitutes for energy inputs are strictly limited there are few reactions via production channels. Therefore, there is no other way to balance the deteriorating current account than through lower domestic absorption. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Temin and Vines (2016) argue forcefully that Keynes was interested primarily in the world economy, and we seek in this article to present a view that emphasises Keynes's contribution to national economic policy. Keynes shifted his attention away from the international economic system when it failed to work effectively in the 1920s and 1930s, and towards this economic system in the period 1941-1944, when the time was right to rebuild it. Given the difficulties experienced by the current monetary system, particularly in Europe, we seek to show the value of Keynes's writing on the national economy in the 1920s and 1930s.","[Bordiss, Bradley] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Padayachee, Vishnu] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Sci, Dev Econ, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand; University of Witwatersrand,"Bordiss, B (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa.",bradley@bproperties.co.za; vishnu.padayachee@wits.ac.za,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,7,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

We identify Chinese supply and demand shocks and examine their contributions to global price dynamics and the transmission mechanism. Our main findings are as follows: (i) Chinese supply and demand shocks affect prices in other countries significantly. Demand shocks matter slightly more than supply shocks. Producer prices tend to be more strongly affected than consumer prices by Chinese shocks. The overall share of international inflation explained by Chinese shocks is notable (about 6 percent on the average over all countries but not more than 13 percent in each region). (ii) Direct channels (via import and export prices) and indirect channels (via greater exposure to foreign competition and commodity prices) both matter.

These are repeated games in which each player may have quitting actions that terminate the game. We provide three simple geometric and strongly related conditions for the weak approachability of a convex target set. The first is sufficient: it guarantees that, for any fixed horizon, a player has a strategy ensuring that the expected time-average payoff vector converges to the target set as horizon goes to infinity. The third is necessary: if it is not satisfied, the opponent can weakly exclude the target set. We analyze in detail the special cases where only one of the players has quitting actions. Finally, we study uniform approachability where the strategy should not depend on the horizon and demonstrate that, in contrast with classical Blackwell approachability for convex sets, weak approachability does not imply uniform approachability.

Less equal societies tend to have less educated populations, higher fertility rates, and lower investment shares. These effects are particularly prevalent if credit availability is limited, while public education spending attenuates the negative effects of inequality. Public redistribution, measured as the difference between Ginis of market and net income, hampers growth via lower investment and increased fertility. Yet, combined with its positive effect through lower inequality, the impact of redistribution is insignificant. In developing countries redistribution can even be growth enhancing.","[Gruendler, Klaus; Scheuermeyer, Philipp] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Econ, Sanderring 2, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany",University of Wurzburg,"Gründler, K (通讯作者)，Univ Wurzburg, Dept Econ, Sanderring 2, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany.",klaus.gruendler@uni-wuerzburg.de,,"Grundler, Klaus/0000-0002-5303-973X",,,,,81,24,28,0,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0164-0704,1873-152X,,J MACROECON,J.

This paper assumes that they may be either face-to-face and take place at city centers or via referrals from social contacts. The paper presents a model of an economy whose urban structure consists of cities of different types. All cities produce a non-tradeable final good using ranges of tradeable intermediate varieties. Each city has an internal spatial structure: individuals commute to the CBD in order to work, when employed, and to seek jobs, when unemployed. Hiring by each intermediate producing firm is subject to frictions, which are modeled in the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides fashion. City type is conferred by specialization in producing one of two types of intermediate varieties and there is intercity trade in intermediate varieties. The paper examines properties of equilibrium with intercity trade and its dependence on various parameters and their consequences for unemployment, output and welfare across the economy along a steady state. The model's use of international trade tools confers a central role to labor market tightness, akin to factor intensity. A natural dependence of unemployment on city size is generated. Equilibrium outcomes generically diverge from the planner's optimum: there exists mismatch generically. Socially optimal unemployment trades off the probability of employment to search costs of firms independently for each skill type and independently of city size. Socially optimal city sizes are independent of the matching model and therefore labor market tightness considerations but reflect both market size effects and the skill composition of the economy.

Within a framework of Minsky-Veblen cycles, where relative consumption concerns, a debt-led growth regime and financial sector confidence constitute the main causes of economic fluctuations, we use computer simulations to assess the effectiveness of such measures. We find that the considered policy measures help mitigate the impact of financial crises, though they do so at the cost of shortening the time between financial crises. This result is due to a relatively fast recovery of solvency and confidence induced by the policy measures under study which contribute to an increase in private credit and, thereby, effective demand.

It shows, too, that measures of massive capital flight actually reflect data errors.

This article attempts to fill this gap by examining China's changing role in the multilateral trading system from political and legal perspectives, seeking to shed light on how Chinese characteristics have reshaped the power structure and rule-based system of the WTO. While its accession has made the WTO more relevant in regards to global trade governance, China has been accused of upsetting the WTO's rules-based system because of its unique political and economic regime. The WTO and its members should take the Chinese characteristics into consideration and regulate China's practices through using the dispute settlement mechanism, promoting China's accession to plurilateral agreements and adopting a soft law approach.","[Li, Siqi; Tu, Xinquan] Univ Int Business & Econ, China Inst WTO Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of International Business & Economics,"Li, SQ (通讯作者)，Univ Int Business & Econ, China Inst WTO Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China.",lisiqi_uibe@126.com; tuxinquan@126.com,,,National Social Science Fund of China [17ZDA098],National Social Science Fund of China,This research is supported by the National Social Science Fund of China (No. 17ZDA098).,,36,7,7,3,44,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAR-APR,2018,26.0,2,,,SI,,107,126,,10.1111/cwe.12239,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FZ3EJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427468900006,0

Despite the fact that most of the papers focus on tax burden as a fundamental determinant of the shadow economy, the authors of this article believe that institutional tools can expand the boundaries of research on the content of the shadow economy as an economic category. Statistical analysis of 105 countries with different development levels revealed a stronger correlation between the quality of institutions and the size of the shadow economy than the one between total tax burden and the size of the shadow economy.

More concretely, this paper emphasizes a computable general equilibrium (CGE) modeling approach to evaluate the following issues: economic impacts of subsidies for promotion of an EVS, the possibility of price reductions, industrial structure change toward an EVS, and modal shift occurring toward an EVS. Our simulation results demonstrate that after applying 5-25% up subsidies to five industries, such as electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing, EV transport, solar power, cogeneration and other transport, the total industrial output and city GDP increase. A large growth rate is found in industries where subsidies are introduced alone with non-ferrous metal industry. However, it is interesting that decreasing proportions are found in oil and coal product, mining, heat supply and gasoline vehicle (GV) transport industries. Moreover, all the commodity prices decrease since subsidies are given to some industries. Hence Toyohashi City's economy shows a direction where the demand for conventional vehicles and energy use are decreased, conversely, the demand for EVs and renewable energy are increased illustrating a different life style from the current one. However, it does not mean that the total CO2 emission is decreased. EV society makes some industrial outputs larger. Due to the fact that some industrial outputs are increased, CO2 emissions of EV manufacturing and nonferrous metal are increased more than decreased industries. Thus, introducing 5-25% subsidies to EV manufacturing, EV transport, solar power, cogeneration and other transport can really represent a realistic alternative society to EVS if the total CO2 emission can be reduced. Therefore, we have to think what can make the total CO2 emission reduced.","[Miyata, Yuzuru; Shibusawa, Hiroyuki; Fujii, Tomoaki] Toyohashi Univ Technol, Grad Sch Architecture & Civil Engn, Toyohashi, Aichi, Japan",Toyohashi University of Technology,"Miyata, Y (通讯作者)，Toyohashi Univ Technol, Grad Sch Architecture & Civil Engn, Toyohashi, Aichi, Japan.",miyata@ace.tut.ac.jp; hiro-shibu@tut.jp; f.tomo.a@gmail.com,"Shibusawa, Hiroyuki/AAV-3428-2021",,,,,,12,8,8,3,29,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

J,"Tran, N",,,,Ngan Tran,,,Debt threshold for fiscal sustainability assessment in emerging economies,JOURNAL OF POLICY MODELING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Fiscal sustainability; Government debt; Sovereign risk premium; Panel threshold regression models,,"This paper explores the debt threshold for fiscal sustainability assessment for 14 emerging economies during the period 1999-2016. The threshold point is identified as the level which, if exceeded, promptly raises sovereign risk to an unsustainable level. As such, we employ a panel threshold analysis to the determination of debt limit, which can serve as a distinctive feature from other studies on fiscal sustainability. Our results demonstrate that non-Latin American economies are considered to be sustainable in the short run, as their debts remain below the threshold bounds of 40-55% of GDP. However, the long-run sustainability risk may emerge from a continuous upward trend in debt paths, implying the need for rebuilding fiscal buffers. It is important to emphasize that fiscal sustainability is far more challenging for most Latin-American economies. This is indicated by their debt accumulation beyond the threshold level of roughly 35% of GDP which is relatively lower than that estimated for the other countries. Indeed, during times of high debt, emerging countries in Latin America also face higher default risk since their sovereign risk premium respond more strongly to debt rise. Their paths toward fiscal sustainability, hence, requires an immediate imposition of strict fiscal discipline to relieve the debt pressure. (C) 2018 The Society for Policy Modeling.

However, these studies do not consider that authors select into coauthorships according to the incentives identified. We develop a model of endogenous selection into single and coauthorships around the principle that no one wants to be second author when they expect to provide the larger contribution (i.e., are of higher quality). We test it with authorship data from economics, with management (which does not use default alphabetical ordering) as a benchmark. We predict for economics that lower quality authors with an early surname initial would be less desirable coauthors, whereas higher quality authors with a late initial would have a lower desire to coauthor. Most desired are early initial authors of high quality, who are therefore advantaged in forming high-quality collaborations. The combined effect predicts citation rank increases with surname initial for single-authored papers and decreases for coauthored. We find both effects for economics when compared to management and absolutely.

This paper shifts the beginnings of polio eradication by three decades and argues that the vaccine developed in the nexus of liberal internationalism and socialist international networks. The result of a collaboration between Albert Sabin, Soviet and Eastern European virologists and public health officials, the live polio vaccine used today in polio eradication programs began its global journey in the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Cuba. The paper argues that socialist ideas and practices of health provided fertile ground for a disease elimination program that rested on a combination of primary health structures and top-down initiatives. Taking the case of the Sabin vaccine, it considers the role of political systems in disease eradication.","[Vargha, Dora] Univ Exeter, Med Humanities, Exeter, Devon, England",University of Exeter,"Vargha, D (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Med Humanities, Exeter, Devon, England.",d.vargha@exeter.ac.uk,"Vargha, Dora/AAK-1136-2021","Vargha, Dora/0000-0003-0758-5091",,,,,67,4,4,0,3,NECPLUS,PARIS,"16, RUE CLAUDE TILLIER, PARIS, 75012, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

In this paper, we extend the existing literature by measuring the degree of bank efficiency in ten frontier African countries. We also attempt to analyse the determinants of banking efficiency in the sample countries. We employ a bank-level panel data set over the period 2008-2012 to measure banking efficiency in a two-stage procedure. In the first stage, we use the Data Envelopment Analysis technique to estimate technical, pure technical and scale bank efficiency. In the second stage, we use Simar and Wilson (J Econom 136:31-64, 2007) truncated bootstrapping approach to analyse the determinants of banking efficiency. The results of our analysis show that, to a greater extent, banks in the countries studied have efficient banking sectors. The results of truncated regression indicate that bank size is negatively related to banking sector efficiency while the degree of risk is positively related bank efficiency. Overall, the present study provides empirical information that may be used to guide future financial reform policies in the Frontier African countries.","[Banya, Roland; Biekpe, Nicholas] Univ Cape Town, Grad Sch Business, Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Biekpe, N (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Grad Sch Business, Cape Town, South Africa.",nicholas.biekpe@gsb.uct.ac.za,"Biekpe, Nicholas/GNH-1675-2022; Biekpe, Prof Nicholas/AHB-9529-2022","Biekpe, Nicholas/0000-0002-9702-1232",,,,,85,19,20,2,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1573-9414,1574-0277,,ECON CHANG RESTRUCT,Econ.

In February 2013, a Central Government reform permitted gasoline stations to operate in industrial and commercial areas. Over the following 2-year period, this deregulation led to a high number of new market entrants in these newly designated free entry areas. By isolating markets exposed to entry and markets unaffected by new entrants, and adopting a difference-in-difference approach, results show that gasoline stations exposed to a new market entrant within a one-mile radius lower their prices by an average 1.04%. This result is significant, representing almost one fifth of the average retail margin. Additionally, the results show that the reduction in the equilibrium price is caused by the first market entrant and that the effect decreases over time.","[Bernardo, Valeria] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econometr Stat & Appl Econ, GiM IREA, 690 Diagonal Av, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Bernardo, V (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Econometr Stat & Appl Econ, GiM IREA, 690 Diagonal Av, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",valeriabernardo@ub.edu,,,"Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2015-69193-R, ECO2016-76866-R]; Catalan Government [SGR2014-325]",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); Catalan Government,"I am specially grateful to Jordi Perdiguero for sharing with me his rough price data and to Joan-Ramon Borrel for his advice and support.

In artists' labor markets, indefinable features such as talent and artistic creativity apparently contribute more to success or higher rates of payment than education and training. In this article, we will readdress this question by looking at the artists' survival in the arts occupations. We find it reasonable to expect than an artistic education can have a significant impact on artists' careers because of the importance of technical skills, networks and signaling effects. We analyze the question by using a unique longitudinal dataset for five different groups of artists in Denmark, using the Cox model to apply survival functions and semi-parametric analysis. The results show, among other things, that an artistic education has a significant impact on artists' careers in the arts, and we find important industry differences.","[Bille, Trine] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Management Polit & Philosophy, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Jensen, Soren] Danish Natl Ctr Social Res, SFI, Copenhagen, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Bille, T (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Management Polit & Philosophy, Copenhagen, Denmark.",tbi.mpp@cbs.dk,,"Bille, Trine/0000-0002-0139-166X",,,,,30,19,22,1,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

We show how the optimal reserve prices in bundled/separate auctions and the seller's bundling decisions are affected by the correlations of the valuations across buyers and objects. Interestingly, when each object's valuations are sufficiently negatively correlated across buyers, the seller's revenue is higher under unbundling than under bundling. The result is in contrast with that obtained by Palfrey (1983), who showed that, without considering optimal reserve prices, the seller's revenue is always higher under bundling regardless of correlations across either buyers or objects when there are two buyers.

We then show that the decline in auctions was not driven by compositional shifts in seller experience or items sold, but by changing seller incentives. We estimate the demand facing sellers and document falling sale probabilities and falling relative demand for auctions.

The paper argues that the recent increase in skill premium in Chinese manufacturing can be partly attributed to the decline in intra-industry trade. A reasonable explanation on this is that the decline in intra-industry trade occurred in the period studied is associated with a decrease in output. This led to a reduction in relative demand of low-skilled workers, which supports the hypothesis of the output-skill substitutability, and finally an increase in skill premium. Further, this paper finds that the negative effect of intraindustry trade on skill premium is larger for high-skilled manufacturing than low-skilled manufacturing. One more result in this paper is that the increase in capital input reduced the skill premium in Chinese manufacturing. The empirical evidence is consistent with a modified model of intra-industry trade with differentiated products and three factor inputs: high-skilled labor, low-skilled labor and capital.","[Feng, Xiaohua] Hubei Univ, Sch Business, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China",Hubei University,"Feng, XH (通讯作者)，Hubei Univ, Sch Business, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",sherryxiaohua@126.com,,,"National Social Science Foundation of China [16ZDA039, 12BJL028]; Soft Science Foundation of Science and Technology Department of Hubei Province in China [2017ADC030]",National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Soft Science Foundation of Science and Technology Department of Hubei Province in China,I am deeply grateful to the anonymous referees and the editors for their constructive comments and instructions during the work on this paper.

Tax authorities hope that such policies will generate new tax revenue by increasing overall tax compliance. We present an experimental design to investigate the effect of a stylized anti-avoidance tax policy on tax compliance behavior. We highlight that anti-avoidance tax policies that reduce tax avoidance can also induce an increase in tax evasion (substitution effect), which limits the additional tax revenue these policies will generate. We show that the degree of substitution depends crucially on behavioral factors such as tax morale. Policymakers therefore also need to consider behavioral features while designing such policies and estimating their potential effects.","[Malik, Samreen] New York Univ Abu Dhabi, New York, NY 10276 USA; [Mihm, Benedikt; Timme, Florian] Otto Von Guericke Univ, Magdeburg, Germany",Otto von Guericke University,"Malik, S (通讯作者)，New York Univ Abu Dhabi, New York, NY 10276 USA.",samreen.malik@nyu.edu; benedikt.mihm@ovgu.de; florian.timme@ovgu.de,"Mihm, Benedikt/IAR-6897-2023","Mihm, Benedikt/0000-0002-4002-2525",,,,,51,7,8,13,81,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Results support cointegration and suggest a single common I(1) factor driving all three variables. Impulse responses to a permanent shock to the common factor indicate an important long-run relationship between oil prices, producer prices, and consumer prices. Impulse responses to a transitory oil price shock show no consumer price index response and only weak evidence of a short-run response in the producer price index. Hence, the conclusion is that oil price shocks have to be perceived as permanent before there is a strong link to consumer prices. Policy focused on ameliorating the effects of oil price shocks should pay close attention to whether shocks are permanent or transitory. Conclusions are robust to alternative measures of consumer prices and over different sub-samples of the data, although there is some evidence that the cointegration relationships disappear in the latter part of the sample.

Model uncertainty and the perils of policy model complacency,METROECONOMICA,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MACROECONOMIC STABILITY; INFLATION-EXPECTATIONS; ECONOMY; CRISIS; FACE,"The question addressed in this paper is: can monetary policy succeed in stabilizing the economy even when the policy model on which it is predicated is mis-specified? Using variants of the 3-equation macroeconomic model, it is shown that this question can be answered in the affirmative. The purpose of the paper is not to encourage indifference toward model uncertainty, however, but rather to warn against the perils of policy model complacency. This arises if the success of policy is misinterpreted as successful understanding of the workings of the economy, which makes the policy maker vulnerable to surprises: events with systematic origins in the true model of the economy that are not anticipated by the (mis-specified) policy model. To safeguard against this problem, policy makers should always entertain eclectic views of the workings of the economy. This task is easily accomplished by paying attention to heterodox macroeconomics, which frequently makes predictions that are very much at variance with those of the dominant policy model.","[Setterfield, Mark] New Sch Social Res, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10011 USA",The New School,"Setterfield, M (通讯作者)，New Sch Social Res, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10011 USA.",mark.setterfield@newschool.edu,,,,,,,35,1,2,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,FEB,2018,69.0,1,,,,,2,15,,10.1111/meca.12163,0.0,,,14,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FR5HG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000419096900001,0

Valuation of VAs has been studied extensively in past decades. However, most of the studies focus on a single contract. These methods can be extended neither to valuate nor to manage the risk of a large variable annuity portfolio due to the computational complexity. In this paper, we propose an efficient moment matching machine learning method to solve this problem. This method is proved to be a good candidate for risk management in terms of the speed of and the complexity of computing the annual dollar deltas, VaRs and CVaRs for a large variable annuity portfolio whose contracts are over a period of 25 years. There are two stages for our method. First, we select a small number of contracts and propose a moment matching Monte Carlo method based on the Johnson curve, rather than the well known nested simulations, to compute the annual dollar deltas, VaRs and CVaRs for each selected contract. Then, these computed results are used as a training set for well known machine learning methods, such as regression tree, neural network and so on. Afterwards, the annual dollar deltas, VaRs and CVaRs for the entire portfolio are predicted through the trained machine learning method. Compared to other existing methods Bauer et al. (2008); Gan (2013); Gan and Lin (2015), our method is very efficient and accurate. Finally, our test results support our claims. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

One of the challenges of twenty-first century is to meet demand and provide the world with enough energy in a safe and sustainable way. A range of case study data is used, from which a sample of 10 countries within Europe with similar institutional quality, political stability and regulatory platform was selected. Recommendations for petroleum sector governance and sustainable administrative design, respectively, which will positively impact petroleum sector performance and meet stakeholders' expectations, were defined. This study indicates that a country implementing separate functions in administrative design will improve petroleum sector performance and address identified key success factors which will correspondingly meet stakeholders' expectations, but most importantly, it will manage the petroleum sector in order to create wealth for the nation and ensure sustainability.","[Doric, Barbara; Dimovski, Vlado] Univ Ljubljani, Ekon Fak, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Doric, B (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljani, Ekon Fak, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",barbaradoric@yahoo.com,,"Dimovski, Vlado/0000-0002-2545-3167",,,,,19,5,7,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Higher fundamental inequality, working through the aspirations gap, motivates people to work and save more. Economic outcomes improve but income and consumption inequality worsen because the poor have less capacity to respond on the labor market. By diverting resources from health production, aspirations also worsen mortality, especially for the poor.

I exploit a reform at Universidad de Los Andes, which in 2006 reduced the amount of coursework required to earn degrees in economics and business by 20% and 14%, respectively, but did not change the quality of incoming or graduating students. The size of the entering class, their average high school exit exam scores, and graduation rates were not affected by the reform, indicating that selection of students into the degrees remained the same. Using administrative data on wages and college attendance, I estimate that wages fell by approximately 16% in economics and 13% in business. These results suggest that human capital plays an important role in the determination of wages and reject a pure signaling model. Surveying employers, I find that the reduction in wages may have resulted from a decline in performance during the recruitment process, which led students to be placed in lower-quality firms. Using data from the recruitment process for economists at the Central Bank of Colombia, I find that the reform reduced the probability of Los Andes graduates' being hired by 17 percentage points.","[Arteaga, Carolina] UCLA, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Arteaga, C (通讯作者)，UCLA, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",caroartc@ucla.edu,,,,,,,27,27,39,1,29,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",0047-2727,,,J PUBLIC ECON,J.

We employ a composite panel unit root procedure -incorporates nonlinearity, gradual structural shifts, and cross-section dependency-with a sequential panel selection model which classifies stationary and non-stationary series in the panel. The analysis covering 24 real commodity prices for 1900-2010 identifies that when the behavior of commodity prices is investigated under the composite panel unit root perspective, the number of trend-stationary series increased dramatically and revealed 16 out 24 commodity prices to be stationary. A more careful examination of the findings shows that the majority of stationary prices (11 out of 16) are for livestock and agricultural commodities. However, we find only partial support for the Prebisch-Singer Hypothesis, where only 7 out of 24 commodities display negative long-term trend.","[Aslan, Murat] Yildirim Beyazit Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey; [Nazlioglu, Saban] Pamukkale Univ, Dept Econometr, Denizli, Turkey",Ankara Yildirim Beyazit University; Pamukkale University,"Aslan, M (通讯作者)，Yildirim Beyazit Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey.",maslanim@ybu.edu.tr; snazlioglu@pau.edu.tr,"ASLAN, Murat/ADZ-3034-2022","Nazlioglu, Saban/0000-0002-3607-3434",,,,,56,1,1,0,0,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

Intra-industry trade (IIT) is often viewed as a way of achieving economic as well as political integration. This article tests for the effect that political regime and governance may have on the intensity of IIT. We particularly examine if quality of political institutions which includes corruption and democracy indices as well as economic factors comprising corporate tax rate, regional FDI flow, flexibility of exchange rate regime, size of the market, economic distance affect the intensity of horizontal and vertical IIT. The study finds that control of corruption and good governance both increase the vertical IIT but not the horizontal IIT. The study further finds that intra-economy FDI flow, stable exchange rate regime, market size and proximity positively affect IIT within the trade bloc. However the negative effect of corporate tax rate suggests that if countries were to coordinate their tax policies, they could avoid harmful tax competition and promote IIT across their borders. The findings regarding the effect those economic and political factors have on the intensity of IIT certainly warrants the attention of policy makers and researchers alike.","[Aziz, Nusrate] Algoma Univ, Dept Econ & Business, Marie, ON, Canada; [Hossain, Belayet] Thompson Rivers Univ, Dept Econ, Kamloops, BC, Canada; [Mowlah, Irfan] Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry, W Midlands, England",Algoma University; University of Warwick,"Hossain, B (通讯作者)，Thompson Rivers Univ, Dept Econ, Kamloops, BC, Canada.",Bhossain@tru.ca,"Aziz, Nusrate/I-3698-2019","Aziz, Nusrate/0000-0002-2596-0679",,,,,40,5,6,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In this context, the aim of the article is to conduct analysis of similarities between European member states in regard to fulfilling the climate change and energy objectives, which were declared in Europe 2020 plan. In the research five criteria provided by the European Commission were applied, which justifies application of taxonomic tools in the study. To obtain the objectives of the article the Ward's clustering method was used, which enabled to group the countries into homogeneous clusters. The research was done for the years 2005 and 2015 and was based on data form Eurostat. The study showed significant disparities between EU-15 and new member states. Additionally, the differences among EU-15 have been confirmed. The conducted research showed high stability of these disparities in time. These factors should be taken into consideration in the political decisions affecting situation of European countries in regard to energy security.","[Balcerzak, Adam P.] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Dept Econ, Ul Gagarina 13a, PL-87100 Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Balcerzak, AP (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Dept Econ, Ul Gagarina 13a, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.",adam.balcerzak@umk.pl,"Balcerzak, Adam/D-7224-2016","Balcerzak, Adam/0000-0003-0352-1373",,,,,38,1,1,0,6,"LETRA INTERACTIVE, SRO",BRATISLAVA,"NA REVINE 29-D, BRATISLAVA, 831 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-89962-08-2,,,,2018,,,,,,,7,14,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7OT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455265500001,0

This observation has led some economists, most notably Friedrich Hayek, to conclude that recessions often reflect periods of needed liquidation resulting from past over-investment. According to the main proponents of this view, government spending or any other form of aggregate demand policy should not be used to mitigate such a liquidation process, as doing so would simply result in a needed adjustment being postponed. In contrast, ever since the work of Keynes, many economists have viewed recessions as periods of deficient demand that should be countered by activist fiscal policy. In this paper we reexamine the liquidation perspective of recessions in a setup where prices are flexible but where not all trades are coordinated by centralized markets. The model illustrates why liquidations likely cause recessions characterized by deficient aggregate demand and accordingly suggests that Keynes' and Hayek's views of recessions may be closely linked. In our framework, interventions aimed at stimulating aggregate demand face a trade-off whereby current stimulus postpones the adjustment process and therefore prolongs the recessions, but where some stimulative policies may nevertheless remain desirable.","[Beaudry, Paul] Vancouver Sch Econ, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Beaudry, Paul] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Beaudry, Paul] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Galizia, Dana] Carleton Univ, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Portier, Franck] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Portier, Franck] CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA",University of British Columbia; National Bureau of Economic Research; Carleton University; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Portier, F (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France.;Portier, F (通讯作者)，CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA.",Franck.Portier@TSE-fr.eu,"PATTANAYAK, MANORANJAN/N-7858-2017","Portier, Franck/0000-0001-9409-3946",,,,,36,20,20,0,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

The conducted research has shown that the social deficit caused by smoking both in the V4 countries and in the EU on average was always in positive numbers during the years 2008 to 2015. This means that the tax imposed on tobacco products fails to cover the social costs of tobacco consumption. The social deficit per unit of manufactured tobacco in the V4 countries is lower than the average value of this indicator within the EU. The social deficit increased in the V4 countries apart from the Czech Republic during the examined period. Although the absolute social deficit as well as the social deficit per capita developed differently in the respective V4 countries, they also reached positive values.

In this paper we change the demographic assumptions at the bases of the model of Lacomba and Lagos (2010), assuming increasing life expectancy over time. As a consequence, we find that, in the presence of pay-as-you-go pension systems, there are cases in which an open borders policy would not be implemented and that retirement age and immigrants' skill play an important role in determining the effect of immigration on the welfare of native population.

Then, it uses the smooth transition vector error-correction model (STVECM) to explore the adjustment efficiencies of the short-run house and corresponding stock return dynamics when there is disequilibrium between house and stock prices. The empirical results indicate that there is a nonlinear cointegration between the house prices and corresponding stock prices in China, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan, and that the speed of price adjustment to equilibrium is always greater for houses than stocks when there are large positive and negative deviations. Moreover, the short-run speed of adjustment of the large negative and positive deviations is equal in China, South Korea, and Taiwan, but unequal in Singapore. With the exception of South Korea, the results of the Granger causality test indicate that stock prices clearly lead used house prices, which means a wealth effect exists in most Asian countries. Our study confirms that the STVECM can be used to analyze the short-run adjustment efficiency of house and stock return dynamics in China, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan; thus, supporting models of interaction between noise and arbitrage traders.","[Fang, Hao] Hwa Hsia Univ Technol, Dept Assets & Property Management, Taipei, Taiwan; [Lee, Yen-Hsien] Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Finance, Taoyuan, Taiwan; [Chang, William S.] Ming Chuan Univ, Dept Finance, Taipei, Taiwan",Chung Yuan Christian University; Ming Chuan University,"Lee, YH (通讯作者)，Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Finance, Taoyuan, Taiwan.",hihaoa@gmail.com; yh@cycu.edu.tw; shulienchang@yahoo.com,"張, 書濂/GRX-6678-2022; Fang, Hao/AAW-3714-2021","Fang, Hao/0000-0003-3874-5537",,,,,39,2,2,0,2,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2018,65.0,1,,,,,37,63,,10.2298/PAN140125018F,0.0,,,27,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GC6HG,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000429890100003,0

More than 1800 hostile deaths occurred during Operation Enduring Freedom (in and around Afghanistan) through 2014 and about 20,000 were WIA. A larger proportion of wounded personnel survived in Iraq and Afghanistan than during the Vietnam War, but the increased survival rates were not as high as some studies have asserted. The survival rates were 90.2% in Iraq and 91.6% in Afghanistan, compared with 86.5% in Vietnam. The casualty rates varied between the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan and before, during, and after the respective surges. Amputation rates are difficult to measure consistently, but I estimate that 2.6% of all WIA and 9.0% of medically evacuated WIA from the Iraq and Afghanistan theaters combined resulted in the major loss of a limb. Elevated non-hostile death rates (including deaths due to accidents, illnesses, homicides, or suicides) resulted in about 220 more deaths in Iraq and about 200 more deaths in Afghanistan than would have been expected in peacetime among populations of the size deployed to those two conflicts.","[Goldberg, Matthew S.] Congress Budget Off, Washington, DC 20515 USA",Congressional Budget Office,"Goldberg, MS (通讯作者)，Congress Budget Off, Washington, DC 20515 USA.",matt.goldberg@cbo.gov,,,,,,,49,9,14,0,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

Simultaneously they are often quoted as handicapped given the notorious state interference, management problems and agency tensions. They used to be regarded as a mainly domestic issue but in the context of globalisation and the fact that states enter treaties with new obligations, SOEs' performance ceased to be solely a domestic problem, increasingly so as state-owned multinational enterprises (SOMNEs) emerge. This article presents the results of research on Polish SOEs' outward foreign direct investment (OFDI). It offers an overview of overseas activities of nine major Polish firms with a state stake and aims to contribute to the conceptual literature on foreign investments conducted by SOMNEs. We distinguish between FDI by SOMNEs as specific - privileged (facilitated) or discriminated (hampered) - investments subject to the home country's state power and the host country's state perception.","[Gotz, Marta] Vistula Univ, Akad Finansow & Biznesu Vistula, Warsaw, Poland; [Jankowska, Barbara] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Fac Int Business & Econ, Poznan, Poland",Vistula University; Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Götz, M (通讯作者)，Vistula Univ, Akad Finansow & Biznesu Vistula, Warsaw, Poland.",m.gotz@vistula.edu.pl,"Jankowska, Barbara/AFJ-9013-2022; Gotz, Marta/K-2586-2017","Jankowska, Barbara/0000-0003-1984-3449; Gotz, Marta/0000-0002-8764-871X",Narodowe Centrum Nauki (National Science Center) [DEC-2014/13/B/HS4/00165],Narodowe Centrum Nauki (National Science Center),This work was supported by the Narodowe Centrum Nauki (National Science Center) under Grant allocated on the basis of decision number DEC-2014/13/B/HS4/00165 titled 'State role in (post)crisis European economy - policy towards foreign direct investment'.,,51,5,5,2,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2018,30.0,2,,,,,216,237,,10.1080/14631377.2017.1361695,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FU1LY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000423612600004,0

The arrival rate of revision opportunities in the best response dynamics is high, so that the resulting joint dynamical system is a slow-fast system and we can use Tikhonov's theorem to study its solutions, employing practical asymptotic stability as a stability criterion. For two-strategy population games with a unique Nash equilibrium that is in mixed strategies, we find that the stable sampling bias is generically non-zero and that it is highest when the equilibrium is most asymmetric, yet that the stable sampling bias vanishes in the sample size.

By virtue of their location and socioeconomic differences, these cities provide a natural experiment for contrasting consumer choices and retail market power related to milk physical and marketing characteristics. Results reveal that, regardless of location, consumers negatively value price increases, fat content and ultra-high temperature (UHT) treatment. However, location matters with respect to brand and type of milk purchased. While in Turin (the higher-income region) demand for the leading manufacturers' brands is the most price inelastic, in Naples consumers have the lowest price elasticities in case of cheaper milk, often small manufacturer or private label brands. Unlike previous studies, we do not find price elasticities for private labels to be consistently lower (or markups to be higher) compared to manufacturer brands, indicating that private labels have reached maturity in these markets. Further, while demand for fresh milk is more price inelastic in Turin, it is more inelastic for UHT milk in Naples. Likewise, markups and Lerner indexes are higher for fresh milk in Turin and for UHT in Naples corresponding to the more inelastic demands under Bertrand price competition.","[Hirsch, Stefan] Tech Univ Munich, Sch Management, Munich, Germany; [Hirsch, Stefan] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Agr Econ & Policy Grp, Zurich, Switzerland; [Tiboldo, Giulia; Lopez, Rigoberto A.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Coll Agr Hlth & Nat Resources, Storrs, CT USA",Technical University of Munich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Connecticut,"Hirsch, S (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, Sch Management, Munich, Germany.",stefan.hirsch@tum.de,"Hirsch, Stefan/H-3552-2018","Hirsch, Stefan/0000-0003-2668-6824",,,,,49,4,5,3,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Significance of differences of averages and standard deviation of specific motivation factors at the level of significance alpha =0.05 in terms of nationality and the age of respondents was verified in tests. Subsequently, the samples were tested using the Tukey's HSD test. Following the research, the order of 8 most important motivation factors in analysed countries was defined. The subtle difference was observed in the order of their importance. Differences are dependent on the nationality; however, they do not depend on the age. The importance of motivation factors in Lithuania differs from those in Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Basic salary, atmosphere in the workplace, supervisor's approach, fringe benefits are the most important motivation factors in all three countries. The importance of further motivation factors is almost equal in Slovakia and the Czech Republic (motivation factors relating to finances and relationships). The difference is seen in Lithuania, where the motivation factors relating to personal development and career are considered the most important.

This article develops new tools to address such issues and illustrates their usefulness in applications. The central development is a condition called quasi-concave differences, which implies concavity of the policy function in optimization problems without imposing differentiability or quasi-concavity conditions. The general take-away is that many distributional questions in economics which cannot be solved by direct calculations or the implicit function theorem, can be addressed easily with this article's methods. Several applications demonstrate this: the article shows how increased uncertainty affects the set of equilibria in Bayesian games; it shows how increased dispersion of productivities affects output in the model of Melitz (2003); and it generalizes Carroll and Kimball (1996)'s result on concave consumption functions to the Aiyagari (1994) setting with borrowing constraints.","[Jensen, Martin Kaae] Univ Leicester, Leicester, Leics, England",University of Leicester,"Jensen, MK (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Leicester, Leics, England.",Mj182@le.ac.uk,,,,,,,37,17,20,1,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

A benchmarking concept is developed to compare policies across countries, which takes account of country structural features, the way policies are embedded in the national STI policy context and the country's development stage. We focus on policies aiming at fostering technology transfer and commercialisation of public research in selected OECD and emerging economies, drawing on the recent EC/OECD STI Outlook Policy database. Countries combine instruments across different policy domains, including business innovation, entrepreneurship and industrial policies in accordance with their public research orientation and business absorptive capacities. Policy interventions focus on upstream and/or downstream stages of knowledge transfer as attention is given to adjusting the supply of public research to social and economic needs or to encouraging business demand for public research results. Transfer and commercialisation of public research is increasingly integrated into STI policy governance. Policy sets for knowledge transfer tend to be denser in more advanced STI systems.","[Kergroach, Sandrine] Org Econ Cooperat & Dev, Sci Technol & Innovat, Paris, France; [Meissner, Dirk; Vonortas, Nicholas S.] Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, Inst Stat Studies & Econ Knowledge, Moscow, Russia; [Vonortas, Nicholas S.] George Washington Univ, Inst Int Sci & Technol Policy, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Vonortas, Nicholas S.] George Washington Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Vonortas, Nicholas S.] Univ Estadual Campinas, Campinas, SP, Brazil",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); George Washington University; George Washington University; Universidade Estadual de Campinas,"Vonortas, NS (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, Inst Stat Studies & Econ Knowledge, Moscow, Russia.;Vonortas, NS (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Inst Int Sci & Technol Policy, Washington, DC 20052 USA.;Vonortas, NS (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20052 USA.;Vonortas, NS (通讯作者)，Univ Estadual Campinas, Campinas, SP, Brazil.",vonortas@gwu.edu,"Meissner, Dirk/O-3112-2013; Vonortas, Nicholas/O-6321-2015","Meissner, Dirk/0000-0003-4573-0376; Vonortas, Nicholas/0000-0002-6745-4926","the Russian Academic Excellence Project ['5-100']; FAPESP through the Sao Paulo Excellence Chair in technology and innovation policy at the University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Brazil","the Russian Academic Excellence Project; FAPESP through the Sao Paulo Excellence Chair in technology and innovation policy at the University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Brazil","The article was prepared within the framework of the Basic Research Program at the National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE) and supported within the framework of a subsidy by the Russian Academic Excellence Project '5-100'.

While the conventional production function approach only captures the direct effects of R&D, this methodology captures both the direct impact of a change in R&D on output and the indirect impact through changes in efficiency of use of factor inputs in the production process. Moreover, technical inefficiency is introduced in the model allowing it as a function of R&D. Using a unique state-level dataset covering the period 1995-2007, this empirical study finds that once both the direct and indirect effects are taken into consideration, R&D investments significantly increase outputs. The results also show that there are substantial variations in the effects of R&D on output across the state-level average farm through technology parameters as well as through technical inefficiency. Such variations need to be taken into account when designing policies for investing public R&D in agriculture.","[Khan, Farid] Univ Rajshahi, Dept Econ, Rajshahi, Bangladesh; [Salim, Ruhul] Curtin Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Perth, WA, Australia; [Sun, Kai] Shanghai Univ, Sch Econ, Room 352,Econ & Management Bldg, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China",University of Rajshahi; Curtin University; Shanghai University,"Sun, K (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ, Sch Econ, Room 352,Econ & Management Bldg, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China.",ksun1@shu.edu.cn,"Sun, Kai/AAX-1669-2020","Sun, Kai/0000-0002-5245-0439",,,,,56,2,2,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In this paper, I use recent foreign aid data from 15 European donors to 45 African, Caribbean and Pacific countries (ACP) to assess the importance of each motive. Although all the motives are important, their relative importance varies from one sub-group of donors to another. In particular, big donors such as France, Germany and the United Kingdom seem to weight more their commercial interests than other European donors; besides, recipient needs appear to be less important. Contrary to other European donors, international cooperation, measured by the correlation in the votes at the United Nations General Assemblies influences their decision to allocate aid to ACP recipients. This last finding probably reflects their relatively high political power in international fora. Finally, I introduce a dummy variable for economic partnership agreement (EPA) and find that donors do not give to support trade liberalization per se. However, large donors give more aid to ACP exporters of raw materials that engage in the EPA. This result implies that foreign aid is a device to secure access to raw materials.","[Kilolo, Jean-Marc Malambwe] Univ Pedag Natl, Econ & Management, Kinshasa, DEM REP CONGO",,"Kilolo, JMM (通讯作者)，Univ Pedag Natl, Econ & Management, Kinshasa, DEM REP CONGO.",malambwe@yahoo.com,"Kilolo, Jean-Marc Malambwe/AAU-1967-2021","Kilolo, Jean-Marc Malambwe/0000-0001-7671-2360",,,,,31,3,3,2,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

The results suggest the presence of state dependence. Individual characteristics and growth background have a significant effect on the choice of employment status. Gender is still an important employment factor; males are more likely to be employed and this gender effect is highest for regular employment (RE). One's educational attainment and age operate in opposite directions. That is, educational attainment (age) has a positive (negative) impact on the choice of a regular job and a negative (positive) impact on the choice of a non-regular job. Contrary to our expectations, a wealthy family background reduces the probability of individuals being wage workers, and raises the probability of them being unemployed.

To this end, we measure the lifetime pension deficit, i.e. the difference between total pension benefits and total pension contributions in an individual's lifetime. We find that the benchmark pension system is expected to run an average lifetime deficit of 22.36 million won (approximately $22,360), and the current pension fund is unlikely to finance the sum of future deficits. The optimal pension reform for the zero average lifetime deficit reduces social welfare by as much as a 2.06% fall in consumption and is characterised with the contribution rate of 20.3% and an average replacement rate of 66.4%. These values are much higher than the respective benchmark values, 9% and 40%, because the increase in pension benefits, combined with the increase in pension contributions, can reduce the income inequality due to the progressivity of pension benefits and the proportionality of pension contributions.","[Lee, Kyung-woo] Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea; [Shim, Younghun] Univ Chicago, Kenneth C Griffin Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Yonsei University; University of Chicago,"Lee, KW (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea.",kwlee76@yonsei.ac.kr,,,Yonsei University [2016-22-0004],Yonsei University,This work was supported by Yonsei University [grant number New Faculty Grant 2016-22-0004].,,27,2,2,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

Additionally, we note that they compare states that newly adopted laws with states that already had laws, that their standard errors are biased downward, that they exclude highly significant individual state trends, that they run multiple tests without adjusting significance levels, and that they fail to report significance tests on pre-and post-law dummy coefficients.","[Moody, Carlisle E.] Coll William & Mary, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA",William & Mary,"Moody, CE (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA.",cemood@wm.edu; marvell@cox.net,"Marvell, Thomas/ABH-3954-2020",,,,,,27,2,2,0,1,INST SPONTANEOUS ORDER ECONOMICS,FAIRFAX,"9745 KINGS CROWN COURT #102, FAIRFAX, VA 22031 USA",1933-527X,,,ECON J WATCH,Econ.

Previous empirical evidence demonstrated that more advanced (nonlinear) price schemes may be successfully used effectively to manage consumers' electricity demand in highly developed market economies. This article shows that it is as possible in moderately developed countries with less experience with a market economy. Data were taken from a unique field study conducted in a midsize city in central Poland (Kalisz), in which approximately 750 households voluntarily agreed to use time-varying rates, instead of the flat rate previously used. The study is based on a detailed analysis of changes in average usage patterns in 15-minute intervals. On average, consumers reacted to price signals as predicted by the traditional economic model of a rational consumer, the change in usage depended on the rate design. It can be argued that at the initial stage, when nonlinear pricing schemes are introduced, simpler rates are preferred, as consumers may have difficulty understanding new rates. Simplicity seems to be the key factor that helps to overcome possible cognitive problems and behavioral anomalies when consumers are exposed to new pricing practices.","[Morawski, Leszek] Vistula Univ, Akad Finansow & Biznesu Vistula, Ul Stoklosy 3, PL-02787 Warsaw, Poland; [Morawski, Leszek] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Econ, Warsaw, Poland; [Czupryna, Marcin] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Financial Markets, Fac Finance & Law, Krakow, Poland; [Mycielski, Jerzy] Univ Warsaw, Dept Econ Sci, Warsaw, Poland; [Raczka, Jan] Alternator Sp Zoo, Warsaw, Poland",Vistula University; Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Economics of the Polish Academy of Sciences; Cracow University of Economics; University of Warsaw,"Morawski, L (通讯作者)，Vistula Univ, Akad Finansow & Biznesu Vistula, Ul Stoklosy 3, PL-02787 Warsaw, Poland.",lmorawski15@gmail.com,"Morawski, Leszek/ABA-3220-2020; Mycielski, Jerzy/ABB-1147-2020; Mycielski, Jerzy/G-9797-2019","Morawski, Leszek/0000-0003-3464-3963; Mycielski, Jerzy/0000-0003-4874-030X; Czupryna, Marcin/0000-0002-8858-4615",Cracow University of Economics; [CJ00137/14],Cracow University of Economics;,"The authors would like to thank ENERGA-OPERATOR SA for providing access to documentation of Consumer Test in Kalisz under agreement no.

Additionally, the subjects were asked to note the reason for their decisions in real time. We used the subjects' descriptions for a coding analysis, which is a classification method of the motivations. Integrating this coding methodology and behavioural data revealed that full contributions are the result of two motives. One is the conditional cooperation motive to achieve the socially optimal outcome. The other is the motive to lead the other group member to contribute all of their endowment in the following periods by signalling one's own act (i.e. a teaching motive). The study further reveals that the two identified motives play a key role in driving cooperative behaviour, and that other motives (such as confusion and altruism) play a minor role.","[Nihonsugi, Tsuyoshi] Osaka Univ Econ, Fac Econ, 2-2-8 Osumi Higashiyodogawa Ku, Osaka 5338533, Japan; [Nakano, Hiroshi] Osaka Univ Commerce, Fac Econ, Osaka, Japan; [Nishizaki, Katsuhiko] Momoyama Gakuin Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Osaka, Japan; [Yamakawa, Takafumi] Osaka Univ, Inst Social & Econ Res, Osaka, Japan",Osaka University,"Nihonsugi, T (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ Econ, Fac Econ, 2-2-8 Osumi Higashiyodogawa Ku, Osaka 5338533, Japan.",t.nihonsugi@gmail.com,"Nishizaki, Katsuhiko/AAJ-8867-2020","Nishizaki, Katsuhiko/0000-0002-1995-3659",Global COE program of Osaka University; JSPS KAKENHI [JP16K17094],"Global COE program of Osaka University(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported by the Global COE program of Osaka University, a grant-in-aid for JSPS Fellows and JSPS KAKENHI [Grant Number JP16K17094.].",,42,0,0,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This lumpy response is due to adjustment costs that are inherent in the act of adjusting the mix of inputs applied in the underlying production technologies. This study aims to provide a solid conceptual framework for these nonlinearities in factor demand relationships. Industry-specific implications of convex and non-convex adjustment costs for the linearity of the factor demand relationships as well as price and substitution elasticities are explored. A two-regime threshold system of factor demand equations is estimated for several manufacturing industries in the United States. Empirical results suggest significant threshold effects in the factor demand relationships in most nondurable goods sectors. The size and the nature of thresholds depend upon industry characteristics, including input composition and (non)convexity of underlying adjustment costs. Complete matrices of price and substitution elasticities for each industry are derived using estimates of threshold factor demand systems. Discussion of two contrasting cases in greater detail sheds light on how the effect of price shocks on factor demand relationships varies across industries with different adjustment cost structures.","[Onel, Gulcan] Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Onel, G (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",gulcan.onel@ufl.edu,,"Onel, Gulcan/0000-0002-1446-1356",,,,,43,1,1,2,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

A beggar-thy-neighbor tactics of keeping large trade surpluses by countries successfully suppressing wages and domestic demand is likely to be unproductive. Overcoming the secular stagnation may not be possible without safeguarding equilibrium (or balance) in international transactions between major industrial countries - even if this may necessitate that in most (or all) of them the public sectors run large fiscal deficits permanently.","[Podkaminer, Leon] Vienna Inst Int Econ Studies, Vienna, Austria",Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies,"Podkaminer, L (通讯作者)，Vienna Inst Int Econ Studies, Vienna, Austria.",podkaminer@wiiw.ac.at,,,,,,,26,3,3,0,2,AKADEMIAI KIADO RT,BUDAPEST,"PRIELLE K U 19, PO BOX 245,, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

It emphasizes the role PPI may play in developing countries due to its ability to target a wide range of firm sizes and to contribute to a more even diffusion of technical progress. Using microdata from RAIS and coarsened exact matching, results show that treated firms present on average a higher intensity of innovative efforts than the control sample. In small firms, PPI has a positive effect on the probability of carrying out innovative activities. Once small firms have decided to carry out these activities, treated and control samples have similar innovative effort intensities. The treatment's effect on large firms' probability of performing innovative activities is positive but lower than small firms. Nonetheless, there is a significant and positive effect on the intensity of these efforts. The paper suggests that, due to its effects over a wide range of firm sizes, PPI may be a worthwhile policy to implement for the reduction of structural heterogeneity present in developing countries.","[Rocha, Frederico] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Econ, Av Pasteur 250, BR-22290902 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,"Rocha, F (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Econ, Av Pasteur 250, BR-22290902 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.",fred@ie.ufrj.br,,,CAPES,CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),This paper has benefitted from funding from CAPES.,,39,9,9,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

Subsequent to George Akerlof s famous article The Market for 'Lemons, discussions of the problems created by asymmetric information gradually became standard fare, but the issues raised by thinking of asymmetric information in economic matters extend far beyond the used car and health insurance markets that are normally used as the paradigm cases. In fact, consideration of the problems of information will inevitably lead to an examination of the problems of market manipulation and fraud, especially in light of the 2008 financial crisis. Akerlof has travelled this path himself as indicated by his recent book with Robert Shiller, Phishing for Phools (2015). Akerlof and Shiller provide a litany of examples of manipulation and deception in advertising and in many markets including financial markets. They also have a chapter on The Resistance and its Heroes that highlights some of the people and agencies that have worked to expose and reduce phishing, but this chapter is remarkably sparse. What this article attempts to do is to fill out some of this history by focusing on the work of American institutional economists from Veblen to Galbraith, who critically examined the issues of manipulation and deception in advertising, salesmanship, and finance. Some general considerations relating to the problem of fraud are also discussed.","[Rutherford, Malcolm] Univ Victoria, Econ, Victoria, BC, Canada",University of Victoria,"Rutherford, M (通讯作者)，Univ Victoria, Econ, Victoria, BC, Canada.",,,,,,,,38,4,4,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

According to our results, the impact on the host economy differs in the four service industries. We found a positive and significant impact on exports in vertical business services and in horizontal telecommunications services, and on employment in business services and, to a lesser extent, in financial services. The positive impact either diminished or disappeared during the global recession of 2008-2009.

We find that among participating transplant centers, the program increased the number of living donor kidney transplants by approximately 14%.","[Schnier, Kurt E.] Univ Calif, Dept Econ, Econ, Merced, CA 95343 USA; [Merion, Robert M.] Univ Michigan, Arbor Res Collaborat Hlth, Sect Transplantat, Surg, Ann Arbor, MI 48103 USA; [Turgeon, Nicole] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Surg, Surg, Atlanta, GA 30122 USA; [Howard, David] Emory Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",University of California System; University of California Merced; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Arbor Research Collaborative for Health; Emory University; Emory University,"Schnier, KE (通讯作者)，Univ Calif, Dept Econ, Econ, Merced, CA 95343 USA.",kschnier@ucmerced.edu; bob.merion@arborresearch.org; nturgeo@emory.edu; david.howard@emory.edu,"Turgeon, Nicole/M-9969-2019",,,,,,65,8,10,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

In this vein, it identifies economic policy tools that can devalue RER, covering a theoretical issue neglected by the economic literature, which argues that competitive exchange rate enhances growth. After discussing the Trilemma, we identify those variables that could affect RER without constraining monetary policy or exchange rate regime choice. In what follows, we model the probability of achieving an undervalued (small or large) RER for a sample of 14 developing countries from 1980 to 2010 (30 years) by applying econometric techniques for discrete choice and censored data. Afterwards, we compare the results for Latin American nations with Asian ones. They suggest that competitive exchange rate requires different approaches depending on the region. Moreover, Latin American countries need to take on additional policies so that interventions in the foreign exchange market become effective.","[Seixas Barbosa, Lucio Otavio] Minas Gerais Fed Univ, Planning Dept, Econ, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Jayme, Frederico G., Jr.; Missio, Fabricio Jose] Minas Gerais Fed Univ, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil",,"Barbosa, LOS (通讯作者)，Minas Gerais Fed Univ, Planning Dept, Econ, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.",,"Jayme, Frederico G./C-2822-2019; Missio, Fabricio J./Q-8116-2017","Jayme, Frederico G./0000-0002-4617-0107; Missio, Fabricio J./0000-0003-4561-6039; Barbosa, Lucio/0000-0002-7949-1177",,,,,40,4,5,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Empirical results indicate that co-movement and causality between interest rate differentials and exchange rates vary across frequencies and evolve over time, and they are more pronounced during the period of the recent global financial crisis in these countries. In particular, in the short run, exchange rates and interest rate differentials often move together in BRICS countries. In the long run, positive causality runs from interest rate differentials to exchange rates in South Africa and Russia, while reverse causality between these features occurs in China, and in India and Brazil, there exist bidirectional causalities between interest rate differentials and exchange rates in different sub-periods. These findings provide important implications for monetary authorities, suggesting the adoption of suitable policies to maintain exchange rate fluctuations in a well-balanced range and thereby improve the effectiveness of monetary policy. Moreover, our findings may also help investors respond appropriately to avoid the risk of changes in exchange rates and interest rates.","[Si, Deng-Kui] Qingdao Univ, Sch Econ, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Li, Xiao-Lin; Bai, Lu] Ocean Univ China, Dept Finance, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Chang, Tsangyao] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung, Taiwan",Qingdao University; Ocean University of China; Feng Chia University,"Li, XL (通讯作者)，Ocean Univ China, Dept Finance, Qingdao, Peoples R China.",smileman2004@126.com,"bai, lu/HPG-8137-2023",,National Social Science Foundation of China [16CJY069],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),This research is supported by the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant number: 16CJY069).,,38,6,6,0,10,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

These opinion leaders (i.e., gurus) may manipulate the information when the information is disseminated to their followers. It is unclear whether herding behaviors will still emerge in this situation and if so, how these behaviors would influence the market volatility. In this paper, we model agents who choose either to follow the gurus with different precisions of information, or to be a chartist based on evolutionary considerations. Numerical simulations show that increasing the quality of gurus' private information would lead to more intensive herding behavior of followers and produce a U-shaped effect on the market volatility. Besides, increasing the proportion of gurus in the market would lead to more intensive herding but would decrease the market volatility. Interestingly, the market environment also affects investors' choices. Investors are more willing to herd on gurus in boom times or in depression. This paper sheds light on how informed gurus affect investors' behavior and market volatility through direct communication.","[Wang, Guocheng] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst Quantitat & Tech Econ, Beijing 100732, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yanyi] Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; Renmin University of China,"Wang, YY (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",wanggc@aliyun.com; wangyanyi@ruc.edu.cn,,"Wang, Yanyi/0000-0002-5761-800X",National Basic Research Program of China (973 project) [2012CB955802]; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71471177]; CASS-ESRC partnership project of China-UK governments [ES/N00762X/1]; ESRC [ES/N00762X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/N00762X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,National Basic Research Program of China (973 project)(National Basic Research Program of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); CASS-ESRC partnership project of China-UK governments; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We want to thank the Editor as well as two anonymous referees for their thoughtful comments that permitted to highly improve the manuscript.

We introduce variables not considered before for explaining multiplier size differentials, such as capital flows and the openness of capital markets, while controlling for domestic conditions and exchange rate regimes. We also disaggregate GDP into its main components in order to identify the channels through which external and internal factors can influence GDP after a change in fiscal policy. Our results point to the existence of a new channel through which fiscal policy effectiveness is affected. Capital flows, especially FDI flows, play an important role in determining the sizes of fiscal multipliers, and a country's external conditions largely explain GDP changes after fiscal expenditure shocks.

In the control treatment, the commodity price is constant across all periods. In the small (large) price-fluctuation treatment, the price rate of change is always 1% (20%). Regardless of the treatment, the commodity price and subjects' savings change at the same rate over time. Therefore, the optimal amount of consumption is the same in all three treatments. Our main findings are twofold. First, the magnitude of misconsumption (i.e., the deviation from optimal consumption) is significantly high, with the large price-fluctuation treatment being the highest, followed by the small price-fluctuation treatment and then the control treatment. Second, regardless of the presence of price fluctuations, subjects exhibit underconsumption (oversaving) behavior, and price fluctuations strengthen this tendency. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This study attempts to explain how education expansion affects income inequality by education distribution and the rate of return to education. We decompose the effect of education expansion on wage gaps into price effect and structure effect. We compare the income inequality from 2002 to 2013 using the Chinese Household Income Project (CHIP) 2002 and CHIP2013 survey data and employ FFL decomposition method. Our findings suggest that income inequality increased in 2013 and that income inequality among the high-income groups increased even more significantly. The structure effect of education expansion on income inequality is negative, when average education increases one year, the income gap between 80th and 20th will decrease 1.2%, in other words, education expansion decreases income inequality by allowing a wide range of individuals to attend college. However, this effect is offset by the price effect, which is positive and much more significant in magnitude. One extra year of average education will increase income gap by 29% which means that the demand for high-skilled labour is increasing faster than the supply and thus lead to the increasing premium for higher education return.","[Yang, Juan; Gao, Man] Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University,"Gao, M (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",gaoman@mail.bnu.edu.cn,,,,,,,27,16,19,9,76,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the production-supply strategies of Korean firms over foreign and domestic affiliates, using industrial proximity between Korean parent firms and their affiliates. Design/methodology/approach - In this paper first, using the Survey of Business Activities provided by Statistics Korea, the authors build a matching data set between a parent firm and each affiliate both in domestic and foreign countries. Second, the authors define their vertical relationship based on the input requirement coefficients of the Input-Output table (IO table). Furthermore, using the same IO table, the authors define the proximity for the pairs of the parent firm and the affiliates in domestic and foreign markets. Then, the authors test the relationship between the parent firm's choice for foreign affiliate and their proximity index. Findings - The main result shows that the stronger the industrial proximity between a final good producing firm and its input supplying affiliate is, the more likely the cross-border vertical integration is to be observed than the domestic vertical integration. Also, the authors find that the firms whose production structure accords the main result outperform and conduct more self-R&D and less R&D on trust than the other firms. Originality/value - The finding is novel and original in a sense that the authors showed for the first time at firm-level microdata evidence that there is an optimal pattern of organizing supply chains within a multinational firm.","[Yoon, Haeyeon; Hur, Jung] Sogang Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Sogang University,"Hur, J (通讯作者)，Sogang Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",ecsjhur@sogang.ac.kr,"Hur, Jung/AAV-7700-2021","Yoon, Haeyeon/0000-0002-9956-1785",,,,,12,3,3,2,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

Allowing access to information regarding manipulated orders confuses sentiment traders, leading to an overestimation of the true asset value which actually remains the same. We find that sentiment factor has a nonmonotonic impact on the responsiveness to order information and price informativeness. Furthermore, it is shown that informed traders behave like a contrarian, and can use order information to reassess the price, which results in the multiplicity of equilibria.","[Zeng, Qingduo; Liu, Shancun] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Qu, Yi] Univ Nottingham, Sch Comp Sci, Nottingham, England; [Zhang, Qiang] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beihang University; University of Nottingham; Beijing University of Chemical Technology,"Zhang, Q (通讯作者)，Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jqx_zhq@buaa.edu.cn,"zhang, qiang/HZJ-9551-2023; Zhang, Qiang/GXF-3105-2022; Zhang, Qiang/IWU-5000-2023","Qu, Yi/0000-0002-7773-8949","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71371023, 71371024]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 71371023 and 71371024].,,10,1,1,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Determining the origin of this premium can help to guide the gas industries and policy makers in Asia, especially when the traditional oil-indexed price mechanism fades away. Using a new systemic time-series approach, this paper explores the extent to which oil prices and market fundamentals contribute to variations in gas prices in Japan, the United States, and Germany. We find clear cross-country differences and time-varying patterns. Gas prices are much less affected by supply and demand factors than oil prices in Japan and Germany, whereas these factors are more important than oil prices in the US market, which has a pricing hub. Through rolling-windows and subsample analysis, we discover that oil prices were important in Japan and Germany, but the level of importance has declined significantly in recent years, though the contribution of fundamentals does not change much. The results show that Asian gas prices are determined more by oil prices than by the market fundamentals; thus the Asian premium is more likely due to this oil indexed pricing mechanism, rather than market fundamentals. This suggests that developing Asia's benchmark prices (through trading hubs) with a better reflection of regional specific fundamentals can lead to a more efficient allocation of gas resources.

FDI has a positive and significant effect on product in high-income countries, while in upper-middle-income countries the effect is uneven and non-significant. Finally, the effect in lower-middle-income countries is negative and statistically significant.

Results, obtained analyzing 2004-2014 data and confirmed by a placebo test, show that sickness absence is sensitive both to the length of the intervals in which random medical inspections are carried out and to a 20% wage cut on short sick leaves. Monitoring was more effective for men while women were more sensitive to the monetary incentives.

I compare several possible proxies for students' expectations of the lifetime earnings gains from college. Students may base their expectations on the earnings of current workers or they may have some information about future earnings. Since 1970, a forecast of future earnings based on static expectations has been a poor predictor of the ex post college premium for successive cohorts. Nonetheless, high relative earnings for college-educated workers at the time a student graduates high school increases his probability of enrolling in college, while his cohort's future realized earnings do not. A10 percentage point increase in the contemporaneous college premium is associated with a 1 percentage point rise in college enrollment rates, controlling for tuition and student characteristics.(C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This paper examines a particular form of shadow banking business embedded in the operation of non-financial firms in China and transition economies in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), in which firms borrow in order to lend. We verify its existence, especially in China and Russia, by two strategies to track the abnormal correlations between financial accounts. By exploring the national/regional variations, we find that a better development of financial market and legal system deters firms in both CEE and China from engaging in re-lending business. We also confirm that Chinese firms participate less actively in re-lending if they have better growth prospects and are located in cities with better development of high-tech industries.

To do this, I augment both features into a standard business cycle framework with an equity market and a banking sector. The model is calibrated to real U.S. data and used for simulations. The findings suggest that a countercyclical capital adequacy rule and CoCos provide an effective dual approach to macroprudential policy. On the one hand, a capital adequacy rule mitigates the build-up of systemic risk through a capital buffer. On the other hand, CoCos are able to reduce the impact of a sudden decline in bank capital.

Thus, we investigate firms' technology adoption behavior under an emission taxation system. We also examine the possibility of using a welfare-maximizing public firm with eco-friendly production technology to reduce environmental damage. Private firms can choose clean or normal technology for their production process. The analysis indicates several main results. First, under the emission taxation system, private firms adopt clean technologies even though they bear additional abatement costs in the production process if environmental damage caused by their production process is large. Second, mixed oligopoly is socially desirable when environmental damage is low. Thus, private firms take normal technology. Finally, when private firms adopt clean technology, mixed oligopoly is better than emission taxes if environmental damage is low and if the market is less competitive from a social welfare perspective.","[Lee, Woohyung] Keimyung Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, 1095 Dalgubeol Daero, Daegu 42601, South Korea; [Naito, Tohru] Doshisha Univ, Dept Commerce, Kamigyo Ku, Kyoto 6028580, Japan; [Lee, Ki-Dong] Keimyung Univ, Dept Int Commerce, 1095 Dalgubeol Daero, Daegu 42601, South Korea",Keimyung University; Doshisha University; Keimyung University,"Lee, KD (通讯作者)，Keimyung Univ, Dept Int Commerce, 1095 Dalgubeol Daero, Daegu 42601, South Korea.",iuh1231@kmu.ac.kr; tnaito@mail.doshisha.ac.jp; kdlee@kmu.ac.kr,"Lee, Ki-Dong/L-4195-2017",,National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean government [NRF-2014S1A3A2044643],National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean government,"This research was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean government (NRF-2014S1A3A2044643).

Changing the national accounts treatment of retained earnings of corporations to include retained earnings in the income of shareholders would provide improved insight into the roles of holding gains and saving in changes in the wealth of households and governments.

In 2001, Bogomolnaia and Moulin presented the probabilistic serial (PS) mechanism that is an anonymous, Pareto optimal, and weak strategyproof mechanism when the preferences are considered with respect to stochastic dominance. The result holds when agents have strict preferences over individual objects. It has been an open problem whether there exists a mechanism that satisfies the same properties when agents may have indifference among the objects. We show that for this more general domain, there exists no extension of PS that is ex post efficient and weak strategyproof. The result is surprising because it does not even require additional symmetry or fairness conditions such as anonymity, neutrality, or equal treatment of equals. Our result further demonstrates that the lack of weak SD-strategyproofness of the extended PS mechanism of Katta and Sethuraman (2006) is not a design flaw but is due to an inherent incompatibility of efficiency and strategyproofness of PS in the full preference domain.

These are consumers that have no choice between the suppliers. Usual population of shoppers are modeled performing a sequential search in order to decide where to buy a homogenous good. These two simple departures from the original setup have sharp consequences. First, we find that duopolistic price competition is not robust to inclusion of captives. The equilibrium results starkly differ and the only possible equilibrium now includes duopolists charging monopolistic prices. Second, addition of sequential search introduces multiplicity of pure strategy Nash equilibria. In this setup, we observe perverse optimal response to competitor's price changes. Notably, we find that the firm might want to reduce the price in response to the competitor's price increase, which is at odds with the usual undercutting principle. Third, we investigate the behavior of equilibrium prices depending on the heterogeneity in consumer risk attitudes. We find that the higher consumer heterogeneity with respect to acceptance of risky gambles leads to higher prices in equilibrium.","[Babutsidze, Zakaria] SKEMA Business Sch, Dept Strategy Entrepreneurship & Econ, F-06560 Sophia Antipolis, France; [Babutsidze, Zakaria] OFCE Sci Po Paris, Paris, France",SKEMA Business School,"Babutsidze, Z (通讯作者)，SKEMA Business Sch, Dept Strategy Entrepreneurship & Econ, F-06560 Sophia Antipolis, France.",zakaria.babutsidze@skema.edu,,"Babutsidze, Zakaria/0000-0001-8734-8429",,,,,21,0,0,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,NOV,2017,68.0,4,,,,,903,926,,10.1111/meca.12151,0.0,,,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FL1GT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413963400012,0

We compare changes in the growth of lending provided by foreign banks' branches versus subsidiaries in the United Kingdom in response to changes in capital requirements, lending standards and reserve requirements in foreign banks' home countries. Our results suggest that a tightening of capital requirements at home reduces UK branches' interbank lending growth by 5.7 pp more relative to subsidiaries. We link this effect to the higher degree of control which parent banks hold over operations of their foreign branches compared to subsidiaries. Supporting this hypothesis, a set of further tests illustrates that the response of foreign affiliates operating under a branch structure is stronger where parent banks are more likely to delegate more decision making authority to the board of directors of their subsidiaries.

This paper calculates endogenous government debt limits given the markets assessment of the probability to default. The estimated primary balance reaction function to growing debt has the fiscal fatigue property (a loosening fiscal effort makes the primary balance insufficient to support rising debt) at high debt levels. The combination of this feature of the primary balance reaction function with the market interest rate reaction to growing debt determines the government debt limit beyond which debt cannot be rolled over. An application to OECD countries over the period 1985 2013 with a model-based risk premium shows that current debt limits are high for most of the OECD thanks to particularly low risk-free interest rates. It also shows for some countries that current debt levels are not sustainable without a change in government behaviour. Most importantly, the framework illustrates the state contingent nature of debt limits and therefore the vulnerability of governments to a change in macroeconomic conditions and to market reactions. Last, computations with an estimated interest rate reaction to public debt illustrate that debt limits are lower in the euro area than in other countries because of a sharper market interest rate reaction to rising debt.","[Fournier, Jean-Marc; Fall, Falilou] OECD Econ Dept, Paris, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Fall, F (通讯作者)，OECD Econ Dept, Paris, France.",Falilou.fall@oecd.org,,,,,,,29,17,21,0,27,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Our approach accounts for time-varying parameters, transitional dynamics and non-linear trends. We find that increased productivity in the service sector, facilitated by a structural shift toward services, is the principal driver of India's economic growth. Our measures also suggest that the allocation of inputs across sectors has not improved over this period, and in the case of labor appears to have significantly worsened. We further find that fluctuations in output around its trend are due primarily to fluctuations in sector-specific total factor productivity, with fluctuations in labor market distortions and labor taxes also playing important roles. In the period 1960-1980, productivity fluctuations in the agricultural sector are the dominant source of cycles. Since then, productivity fluctuations in the manufacturing and service sectors have been more important.","[Jones, John Bailey] SUNY Albany, Dept Econ, BA-113B, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Sahu, Sohini] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Fac Bldg 603, Kanpur 208016, Uttar Pradesh, India",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kanpur,"Sahu, S (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Fac Bldg 603, Kanpur 208016, Uttar Pradesh, India.",jbjones@albany.edu; ssahu@iitk.ac.in,,,,,,,36,1,1,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1573-9414,1574-0277,,ECON CHANG RESTRUCT,Econ.

We present a flexible heterogeneous-firm trade model with either limited or strong scope for quality differentiation. Using customs data for China during 2002-2006, we empirically establish that firms allocate activity across products in line with a product hierarchy based on quality. Firms vary output quality across their products by using inputs of different quality levels. Their core competence is in varieties of superior quality that command higher prices but nevertheless generate higher sales. In markets where they offer fewer products, firms concentrate on their core varieties by dropping low-quality peripheral goods on the extensive margin and by shifting sales towards top-quality products on the intensive margin. The product quality ladder also governs firms' export dynamics, both in general and in response to the exogenous removal of MFA quotas on textiles and apparel. Our results inform the drivers and measurement of firm performance, the effects of trade reforms, and the design of development policies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We argue that knowledge acquired by emigrants abroad can flow back to their country of origin through diaspora networks. IPR protection in the sending country facilitates this channel by increasing returns to skills and encouraging workers to move into the innovation sector. An expansion of the innovation sector allows diaspora knowledge to be absorbed by a larger range of workers. Strong IPR enforcement therefore makes it more likely for brain drain to be transformed into brain gain.,"[Naghavi, Alireza] Univ Bologna, Bologna, Italy; [Strozzi, Chiara] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy; [Strozzi, Chiara] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of Bologna; Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Naghavi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Bologna, Italy.",alireza.naghavi@unibo.it,"Strozzi, Chiara/G-7344-2016",,European Commission; Fondazione Cassa Risparmio di Modena; MIUR through PRIN,"European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); Fondazione Cassa Risparmio di Modena; MIUR through PRIN(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)Research Projects of National Relevance (PRIN))","We would like to acknowledge the European Commission for financial support through the 7th Framework Programme Project INGINEUS.

To this aim, cointegration and Granger causation are used to investigate the long run relationship between GDP and government expenditure. Moreover, DOLS method is applied to estimate consistent long run elasticity between these two variables. In contrast to previous studies, we evaluate WL for both total government expenditure and some specific items of spending. Our main findings are that WL does not hold in the long run for total government expenditure. However, we find strong support for WL in the shorter time span from 1862 to the end of the 19th century. Here WL is confirmed as regards both total government expenditure and all the specific items of spending we have considered. Conversely, in the post -Second World War years, WL holds only for capital expenditure, compensation of employees, justice and national security, welfare and redistribution by the state. Thus, it seems that Italy invested a great deal and for a long period in infrastructures, justice, national security, and welfare, and less in items such as education and culture that play a paramount role in the formation of human capital.

Method: We construct and analyze a Financial Conditions Index (fCI) for Mexico using the principal components methodology. Accordingly, we included 30 variables related to the behavior of the financial markets. We classified them into nine groups: short and long-term interest rates; foreign exchange, stock, derivative, and credit markets; risk premium; private debt; and inflation expectations. Results: The results show that this fCI adequately captures moments of astringency in financial markets in Mexico, such as the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the crisis in Europe in mid-2011, the beginning of the tapering talk in the United States in the second half of 2013, among others.

Instead of an inverted-U shape, we obtain an unambiguous positive relationship between competition and patents. To explain this positive relationship, we modify their theoretical model to introduce the possibility of inefficient firms facing the threat of exit when competition intensifies. The modified model may explain both a positive and an inverted-U relationship between competition and innovation. The estimated results also support the theoretical conjecture that competition induces firms' exit that, in turn, explains our empirical finding of a negative relationship between competition and within-industry technological gap.","[Beneito, Pilar] Univ Valencia, Dept Anal Econ, Avda Naranjos S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Beneito, Pilar; Engracia Rochina-Barrachina, Maria; Sanchis, Amparo] ERICES, Valencia, Spain; [Engracia Rochina-Barrachina, Maria; Sanchis, Amparo] Univ Valencia, Dept Estruct Econ, Valencia, Spain",University of Valencia; University of Valencia,"Beneito, P (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Dept Anal Econ, Avda Naranjos S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain.;Beneito, P (通讯作者)，ERICES, Valencia, Spain.",Pilar.Beneito@uv.es,"Llopis, Amparo Sanchis/ABE-8264-2021; Beneito, Pilar/AAD-9619-2022; ROCHINA BARRACHINA, MARIA ENGRACIA/K-8929-2014","Llopis, Amparo Sanchis/0000-0002-0872-7859; Beneito, Pilar/0000-0001-5767-7010; ROCHINA BARRACHINA, MARIA ENGRACIA/0000-0002-9263-1023","Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2014-55745-R]; Fundacion-BBVA, Programa de Ayudas a Proyectos de Investigacion en Socioeconomia; Generalitat Valenciana [PROMETEOII/2014/054]","Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); Fundacion-BBVA, Programa de Ayudas a Proyectos de Investigacion en Socioeconomia(BBVA Foundation); Generalitat Valenciana(Center for Forestry Research & Experimentation (CIEF))","This work was supported by the Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2014-55745-R]; Fundacion-BBVA, Programa de Ayudas a Proyectos de Investigacion en Socioeconomia, 2014; and from the Generalitat Valenciana [PROMETEOII/2014/054].",,35,19,21,1,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

There are also strong game-day effects in truancy, in both boys and girls, with truancy declines on game days more than offset by subsequent absenteeism. Important heterogeneity by race, gender, and family structure may serve to substantially reduce racial gaps in truancy and achievement.","[Cuffe, Harold E.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Econ & Finance, Wellington 6011, New Zealand; [Waddell, Glen R.] Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Bignell, Wesley] Univ Washington, Dept Sociol, Seattle, WA USA",Victoria University Wellington; University of Oregon; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Cuffe, HE (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Econ & Finance, Wellington 6011, New Zealand.",harold.cuffe@vuw.ac.nz; waddell@uoregon.edu; wesbignell@hotmail.com,,,,,,,45,9,19,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

Energy footprints are consumption-based indicators which record the energy used to produce a country's final demand. In order to disentangle key characteristics of global value chains and their effects on the global energy footprint, we employ structural decomposition analyses(SDA). Furthermore, the analysis combines a retrospective with a prospective SDA approach. After an analysis of the global energy footprint for the period between 1995 and 2009, we discuss three scenarios of international integration and their implications for energy footprints for the period from 2009 to 2030. Our results show that the global energy footprint has increased by 29.4% from 1995 to 2009, and the scenarios indicate that it will increase by another 23.5% until 2030. Economic activity is the most important driver for the increase in energy footprints. Rising final demand alone would have increased the global energy footprint by 47.0% between 1995 and 2009. The composition of countries from where consumption and investment goods come adds another 12.6%. Sectoral energy intensity reductions are the most important decelerator of energy use (-27.8%). There is a substantial contribution of changing global value chains on the rise in the global energy footprint (7.5%): Stronger backward linkages in global value chains increased the global energy footprint by 5.5% between 1995 and 2009. Changes in the regional composition of intermediate inputs raised it by another 1.8%. The shift of the world economy towards East Asia alone would have increased the global energy footprint by 3.0%. The sectoral composition of global value chains, on the other hand, had a negligible effect on energy footprints. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Drawing on the literature on corruption and open innovation, we develop a model to illustrate that bribery fails to ease bank lending when red tape is endogenous whereas openness for innovation smooths bank lending no matter whether red tape is exogenous or endogenous. Openness for innovation is more effective than bribery in helping a firm reduce red tape to secure bank finance. Based on a dataset of Chinese firms provided by the World Bank, our findings strongly support the argument. We find that openness for innovation has a positive relationship with both the access to bank finance and the size of bank finance, whereas bribery is related to neither. Supplementary tests further suggest that the positive relationship is mainly driven by private firms and manufacturing firms. Our findings help firms make decisions to select an effective and yet socially responsible approach to securing bank finance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, for a range of growth probabilities, ongoing subsidization may not be credible and this can have negative efficiency implications.","[Van Tassel, Eric] Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Econ, 777 Glades Rd, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University,"Van Tassel, E (通讯作者)，Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Econ, 777 Glades Rd, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA.",vantasse@fau.edu,,,,,,,42,0,0,0,4,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Using a genetically informative data set, we decompose the variation in financial management behavior into genetic, shared environmental and non-shared environmental factors. We find that about half of the variation in financial distress is genetically influenced, and personality and cognitive ability are associated with financial distress through genetic and within-family pathways. Moreover, genetic influences of financial distress are highest at the extremes of SES, which in part can be explained by neuroticism and cognitive ability being more important predictors of financial distress at low and high levels of SES, respectively.

Based on the aforementioned database, the authors evaluate apparent premium of exportation and innovation. In addition, they demonstrate the effectiveness of the export premium for high exportation firms that implement process and organization innovations. Finally, the authors analyse the effect of conscious self-selection from the export process that transforms an intention to export into the capacity to export in short term. The conscious self-selection to export is revealed by simultaneously endogeneizing productivity and innovation output based on recursive non-linear model.","[Movahedi, Mohammad; Gaussens, Olivier] Univ Caen Normandy, CREM, UMR 6211, Caen, France; [Shahbazi, Kiumars] Urmia Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Orumiyeh, Iran",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite de Caen Normandie; Urmia University,"Movahedi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Caen Normandy, CREM, UMR 6211, Caen, France.",mohammad.movahedi@unicaen.fr; k.shahbazi@urmia.ac.ir; olivier.gaussens@unicaen.fr,"Shahbazi, Kiumars/HGA-1862-2022; Movahedi, Mohammad/HJY-5035-2023","Shahbazi, Kiumars/0000-0001-7702-6928; movahedi, mohammad/0000-0003-1047-7710",Center for International Scientific Studies & Collaboration (CISSC),Center for International Scientific Studies & Collaboration (CISSC),This work has been supported by the Center for International Scientific Studies & Collaboration (CISSC).,,52,11,11,1,16,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,SEP 20,2017,11.0,,,,,,,,201725.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2017-25,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FI8YR,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412289700001,0

Cross-country panel evidence,JOURNAL OF POLICY MODELING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Corruption; Bureaucracy; Principal-agent model; Game theory; Panel data analysis,ADMINISTRATIVE CORRUPTION; MATCHING ESTIMATORS; PERFORMANCE; GOVERNANCE,"Prior studies have lent mixed evidence on the effectiveness of increasing government wages to reduce corruption. Based on a dynamic principal agent model, this study uses cross-country data over ten years (1999-2008) and various statistical models to present updated evidence. Our analyses show that increasing government relative wage by one unit (i.e., by the amount of the average manufacturing wage in a country) is associated with a decrease in the level of perceived corruption by 0.26 units. The effect appears to be particularly significant for non-OECD countries (where corruption is more rampant) or for countries with a relatively low government wage. The overall policy implication is: increasing government wages can help curtail corruption, but solely relying on increasing government wages to reduce corruption can be very costly. For example, to reduce the level of corruption in non-OECD countries to that in OECD countries, the government wage would have to be increased by about seven times.

This high share somehow automatically becomes a source of causes and effects of differences both at the regional and local level. Development disproportions in rural areas become vividly visible in the places of accumulation of developmental barriers, which derive from the effect of social, economic, environmental and historical factors. The arguments which refer to the place-based policy stress the fact that making use of the unused potential of intermediate and poorly developed territories may actually influence the local and national level of development (Farole et al., 2011). Rural areas, especially peripheral areas, are undoubtedly the territories of unused potential. Purpose of the article: The aim of the research is to measure the socioeconomic development, including the spatial diversification leading to the development of rural peripheral areas. Methods: Development is a multidimensional phenomenon. There-fore, its level will be determined by means of the synthetic feature. The synthetic feature will be used as the starting point for identification of peripheral areas and their delimitation. The Jenks method was applied to group entities into classes characterised by similar levels of development (Jenks Natural Breaks Classifica-tion, Jenks, 1967). The spatial scope of the research com-prises rural areas in Poland in the western borderland, i.e. West Pomeranian, Lubuskie and Lower Silesian Voivodeships. The research subject were rural and rural-urban communes of the regions under investigation. The empirical material were obtained from the following sources: the Local Data Bank of the Central Statistical Office, unpublished data of the Agricultural Property Agency. Measurements referred to 2015. The object of the study was the development of rural areas in the western borderland, which was identified by comparison of the synthetic features of the following factors: location rent, technical infrastructure, social infrastructure, human capital, social capital and local finance. Findings & Value added: The results of the analysis showed significant differences level of socioeconomic development of rural areas in the western borderland. The research findings did not show a simple dependence between rural development and the share of former state-owned farms in the communes. Areas with a high share of former state-owned farms could be found both in the group of best-and least-developed communes. Due to the range of research, it is illegitimate to make other than intuitive inferences. Thus, we can intuitively indicate that the following group of factors triggered the process of development and helped to break the barriers resulting from the liquidation of state-owned farms: location in an urban agglomeration, natural and tourist values as well as the activity of local authorities. The research should be continued in order to identify the factors and pathways of development in individual areas under analysis.","[Bartkowiak-Bakun, Natalia] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Ul Wojska Polskiego 28, PL-60637 Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Life Sciences,"Bartkowiak-Bakun, N (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Life Sci, Ul Wojska Polskiego 28, PL-60637 Poznan, Poland.",natalia.bartkowiak@up.poznan.pl,,"Bartkowiak-Bakun, Natalia/0000-0003-3377-8540",,,,,41,32,32,0,18,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

The study relies on 2003-2013 American Time Use Survey (ATUS) data. Accounting for a variety of personal demographic characteristics, as well as state and year fixed effects, we find that an increase in state-level unemployment rates is associated with an increase in enriching child-father time in families with small children (ages 0-4). However, there is heterogeneity in results by race, education and marital status, with results being statistically significant for white, married and college-educated fathers. Additionally, we find some evidence that an increase in unemployment rates is also associated with an increase in primary childcare for fathers in families with small children, as well as some declines in total time that fathers spend with older children. In contrast to this result, we find that mothers' total time with children, as well as primary childcare time, is invariant to macroeconomic fluctuations in the labor market, however, as the unemployment rate goes up we do observe small declines in enriching time that white mothers in families with small children devote to enriching activities.","[Bauer, Patrick] George Washington Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Sonchak, Lyudmyla] SUNY Coll Oswego, Dept Econ, Oswego, NY 13126 USA",George Washington University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) - Oswego,"Sonchak, L (通讯作者)，SUNY Coll Oswego, Dept Econ, Oswego, NY 13126 USA.",Lyudmyla.sonchak@oswego.edu,,,,,,,29,10,12,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

This is valid also on the macroeconomic level where the switch from the domestic market to the export market and vice versa takes place in a smooth manner. Areas of weak reaction of exports to changes in domestic demand are widened by uncertainty. Our econometric model for six euro area countries suggests domestic demand and capacity constraints as additional variables for export equations. We apply the exponential and logistic variant of a smooth transition regression model and find that domestic demand developments and uncertainty are relevant for short-run export dynamics particularly during more extreme stages of the business cycle. A substitutive relationship between domestic and foreign sales can most clearly be found for France, Greece, and Ireland (exponential smooth transition regression (ESTR) model) and France, Portugal, and Italy (logistic smooth transition regression (LSTR) model), providing evidence of the importance of sunk costs and hysteresis in international trade between the member states of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). What is more, our empirical results are robust to the inclusion of a variable measuring European policy uncertainty. In some cases (Italy, Greece, and Portugal) the results underscore the empirical validity of the export hysteresis under uncertainty model.","[Belke, Ansgar; Wagemester, Jan] Univ Duisburg Essen, Duisburg, Germany; [Belke, Ansgar] CEPS Brussels, Brussels, Belgium; [Belke, Ansgar] IZA Bonn, Bonn, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Belke, A (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Duisburg, Germany.;Belke, A (通讯作者)，CEPS Brussels, Brussels, Belgium.;Belke, A (通讯作者)，IZA Bonn, Bonn, Germany.",ansgar.belke@uni-due.de; jan@wagemester.com,,,,,,,41,2,2,1,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1610-241X,1612-7501,,CESIFO ECON STUD,CESifo Econ.

Following Del Negro and Otrok (2008), we estimate a dynamic factor model, with time varying parameters and stochastic volatility, that decomposes the observed variation in bond yields for each country into a common factor, a regional factor (EMU/non-EMU), and an idiosyncratic country specific factor. We find that prior to the financial crisis of 2008, the common factor played a dominant role for most countries in our sample. In the post financial crisis period there is substantial heterogeneity in the relative importance of the EMU and the idiosyncratic factors across different countries. For instance, our results suggest that there was a decoupling between the EMU and bond markets of the periphery economies of Greece, Ireland and Portugal in the post-2008 period. We find that after the onset of sovereign debt crises in these economies, the idiosyncratic factor assumed an important role in driving the bond yield variation. Thereafter, the EMU's share in bond yield changes in Ireland and Portugal increased considerably since 2012, whereas for Greece the idiosyncratic factor continued to play a significant role in driving bond yields. In contrast, the EMU factor consistently played a dominant role in explaining bond yield changes in Italy and Spain, the other two economies that also experienced severe debt crisis during this period. We argue such differences in the importance of the EMU factor between core and periphery economies can be attributed to the systemic importance of core members for the EMU.

The authors measure the importance of the food sector by employing both the constant market share (CMS) and the input-output analysis. The results indicate that a loss in competitiveness in the Croatian food industry was the most important factor that determined the decreasing share of national companies in the period from 2009, when the global recession started, up to 2013, when Croatia joined the EU. EU membership strongly and positively influenced the performance of Croatian food exports. The negative trend regarding the share of the international food market was reversed. Besides having a direct impact on the export performance of the food industry, the international competitiveness of food producers indirectly affects other domestic companies whose products are used as intermediate inputs in the food industry. The study also presents a benchmark of results with previous research for EU countries, which rarely included Croatia before the accession in 2013. As far as output and value added are concerned, multipliers for the food industry are relatively significant and higher than the national average, and the food industry could be assessed as one of the key Croatian economic sectors.","[Buturac, Goran; Lovrincevic, Zeljko; Mikulic, Davor] Inst Econ, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb; Institute of Economics Zagreb (EIZ),"Buturac, G (通讯作者)，Inst Econ, Zagreb, Croatia.",gbuturac@eizg.hr; zlovrincevic@eizg.hr; dmikulic@eizg.hr,"Buturac, Goran/Y-6211-2019; Mikulić, Davor/AAA-2279-2020","Buturac, Goran/0000-0002-0903-4587; Mikulić, Davor/0000-0002-9847-6116",,,,,39,12,12,0,32,AKADEMIAI KIADO RT,BUDAPEST,"PRIELLE K U 19, PO BOX 245,, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

Therefore, the primary condition for the security of the state and its citizens is to ensure the essential minimum of energy on its territory. We can observe, however, an increasing dependence of the Polish energy sector on external sources. Purpose of the article: The aim of this paper is to examine and evaluate the economic aspects of the Polish energy security considering the fact of growing de- pendency on foreign supplies of energy carriers. Methods: In this paper we analyze the Polish energy security using several indicators: fuel/price efficiency ratio, energy intensity of the economy and Herfindahl- Hirschman rate of market concentration. For calculations we use statistical data provided by Energy Market Agency publications, including Energy Situation in Poland covering the years of 2000-2015. Findings & Value added: On the one hand, the Polish energy security depends on its internal conditions and resources - in this context, the available resources of coal and lignite play an extremely positive role because they provide access to a reliable source of energy. On the other hand, Poland is becoming dependent on external commitments that restrict the free use of domestic resources, thus lowering the energy security of the country, speaking in particular of oil and natural gas resources. The analysis carried out in this paper will allow to evaluate the effectiveness of using various energy carriers with respect to their price, market structure and geopolitical conditions.","[Czech, Anna] Univ Econ Katowice, Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Czech, A (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Int Econ Relat, 1 Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland.",anna.czech@ue.katowice.pl,"Czech, Anna/U-6395-2018","Czech, Anna/0000-0002-8188-3022",,,,,28,8,8,0,4,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

With many states and school districts ending social promotion, policy makers and researchers have gained renewed interest in the role of grade retention and remedial education in US schools. This paper examines the potential effects of summer school and grade retention on high school completion and juvenile crime. To do so, we use administrative data from a number of state agencies in Louisiana and a regression discontinuity design to analyze Louisiana's statewide test-based promotion policy administered to students in fourth and eighth grades. Our results indicate that potential grade retention increases the propensity of a student to drop out of school. In addition, eighth grade remedial education assignment in the form of summer school appears to provide a positive benefit by decreasing the likelihood that a student drops out. As for fourth grade students, however, we do not find any effect of summer school assignment. Finally, for eighth graders, we find that the net effect of the test-based promotion policies is to decrease the probability of being convicted of a juvenile crime. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We show that direct advertising can fragment the market into local monopolies. Further, under high consumer loyalty, or under low loyalty and weak product differentiation, the use of the database yields perfect targeting, i.e. monopoly pricing does not generate quantity distortions and all informed consumers buy a product. By contrast, low consumer loyalty and high product differentiation yields imperfect targeting, i.e. there are quantity distortions and some informed consumers do not buy any product. We find that, compared to the case where firms can use only the mass media, when targeting is perfect, price competition yields an intertemporal transfer of market power and, although the impact of database advertising on profits and consumer surplus is ambiguous, it is always welfare improving. However, when targeting is imperfect, sellers charge lower intertemporal prices, which strongly benefit consumers, but the level of profits decreases, and we prove that the use of a more cost-efficient advertising technology can lead to a welfare loss.","[Esteban, Lola; Hernandez, Jose M.] Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Anal Econ, Gran Via 2, Zaragoza 50005, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Hernández, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Anal Econ, Gran Via 2, Zaragoza 50005, Spain.",lesteban@unizar.es; hernande@unizar.es,"Hernández, José/JKI-8418-2023","Hernández, José/0009-0006-6689-6980",,,,,21,2,5,1,23,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

We compare and contrast the stable outcomes under two imitation procedures: one, where each firm immediately imitates the most profitable firm, and the other when a firm imitates another firm only if it is more profitable while being sufficiently similar (in context of the market segment it operates in) or sufficiently close. In either case, the symmetric pure strategy Nash equilibrium is always a. stable outcome. However, when imitation of the most profitable firm is immediate and market differentiation is 'moderate', states with prices lower than the Nash equilibrium are also stable. In contrast, when imitation of the most profitable firm is more gradual and market differentiation is below a threshold, states with prices above the Nash equilibrium are also stable. Thus, while competitive evolutionary pressure in this imitation based model does result in the Nash equilibrium always being stable, other outcomes may be stable as well. Interestingly, the states that are stable under gradual imitation give the firms a higher profit than the stable states under immediate imitation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Kucerová, V",,,,"Kucerova, Vladimira",,,VAT and its influence on buying behaviour in the Czech Republic,OECONOMIA COPERNICANA,,,English,Article,,,,,,Value Added Tax; price elasticity of demand; buying behaviour; food retail; case study,,"Research background: Value added tax (VAT) is nowadays the most widely used indirect tax system in developed countries. Value added tax, is an instrument of fiscal policy and also a very important source of income for the state budget. It is one of the universal indirect taxes, which has a significant influence on the price level in the country. The European Union's system of value added tax on goods and services is primarily governed by the 6th VAT Directive set by the European Commission. Purpose of the article: The paper deals with the question of how changes in the rates of value added tax influence the buying behaviours of customers. Buying behaviour could be expressed as decisions of customers about spending their own resources such as money, effort and time, on items related to their consumption in order to meet their needs. Methods: The area of the research is the Czech retail food market. Due to the nature of VAT, the influence of this tax on buying behaviour was quantified by price elasticity of demand and indirect tax elasticity of demand, respectively. The article is conceived as a case study, according to the principles of R.K. Yin. The evaluation of buying behaviour is based on real data, which deals with the volumes of sales and sales prices realized in a specific Czech retail chain, which associates more than 200 shops. Findings & Value added: The goal of the study is not only to propose the way to identify buyers' response to the changes in the VAT rate, but also to bring the knowledge about customers' response to the realized changes, and finally to propose how to use this knowledge in a development of pricing strategy in case of further changes in the VAT rate.","[Kucerova, Vladimira] Brno Univ Technol, Brno, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,"Kucerová, V (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Kolejni 2906-4, Brno 61200, Czech Republic.",kucerova@fbm.vutbr.cz,,,,,,,15,1,1,3,15,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

However, the siting and operation of a biofuel production facility can impact the members of the host community both positively (e.g. local jobs and income) and negatively (e.g. pollution and noise). Such ambivalent and heterogeneous external impacts result in either local support or opposition to the facility, which in turn becomes a key factor affecting biorefinery location decisions, and subsequent success of biorefineries. While a number of prior studies have analyzed economic and environmental impacts of biofuels, systematic analysis of local acceptability of biofuel production facilities is lacking. Our study explores factors that influence community attitudes towards biofuel facilities. We assess the strength of acceptability or opposition by estimating the local community's willingness to pay (WTP) either to support or to oppose a proposed biorefinery. We posit that such WTP estimates provide a more comprehensive measure of local acceptability. Results also suggest that county level socio-economic characteristics significantly influence these attitudes and WTP. (C) 2017 The Authors.

We also conduct a risk management analysis at the sector level for commodity-Islamic stock sector index portfolios, using different risk exposure measures. For comparison purposes, we add the aggregate conventional Dow Jones global index and the Dow Jones sistainability world index. The results show evidence of time-varying risk spillovers between these markets. Moreover, there are increases in the correlations among the markets in the aftermath of the 2008-2009 GFC. Further, the oil, gold, energy, financial, technology and telecommunications sectors are net receivers of risk spillovers, while the sustainability and conventional aggregate DJIM indexes as well as the remaining Islamic stock sectors are net contributors of risk spillovers.

This task is greatly burdened by the fact that creative industries are a heterogeneous concept. Evidence suggests that indirect state aid is one of the most effective ways to stimulate growth and development of audiovisual segment. Lithuanian indirect state aid case suggests that there is still a great deal of confusion and misconception with the implementation and exploitation of this tool. Purpose of the article: To analyze how effectively indirect state aid is constructed to stimulate growth and development of the Lithuanian animation industry. Methods: This paper uses two methods to gather data. The first one is a quantitative questionnaire design to evaluate the overall situation of Lithuanian animation industry. The second method involves qualitative semi-structured interviews to collect specific data about Lithuanian film tax incentive from representatives of government institutions that administrate local fiscal incentive scheme and representatives of audiovisual industries. Findings & Value added: Results show that although Lithuanian film tax incentive can be considered as a successful cultural policy tool that brought a noticeable inward investment to the local film industry and economy in general, it had no positive effect on the local animation industry. The gathered evidence suggests that indirect aid tool should be constructed with more of surgical precision for each industry, rather than a fit-for-all cultural policy tool.","[Mitkus, Tomas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Vilnius, Lithuania; [Maditinos, Dimitrios I.] Eastern Macedonia & Thrace Inst Technol, Kavala, Greece",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Mitkus, T (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Business Management, Dept Int Econ & Business Management, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",tomas.mitkus@vgtu.lt,,,,,,,25,5,5,1,15,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

This slow adaptation may be due to high adjustment costs, such as those associated with the disposal of existing physical capital. In practice, these costs may explain why we observe that countries export goods at both ends of the comparative advantage spectrum. This article investigates what happens if the cost of adjusting to the dynamics of comparative advantage is unexpectedly reduced. We use hurricanes to evaluate whether a negative exogenous shock to firms' physical capital leads to a reorganization of exports towards comparative advantage industries. Using a panel of 46 countries and 4-digit industries over the period 1980-2000, we show that the effect of hurricanes on exports is monotonically increasing in comparative advantage. Specifically, export levels drop for industries with a low comparative advantage and grow for industries with a high comparative advantage. Our results also indicate that the process of shifting resources towards higher comparative advantage industries intensifies within the three years following the shock. These findings suggest that if the opportunity cost of adjustment decreases, firms tend to build back better and move up the spectrum of comparative advantage. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We first derive closed-form expressions linking the signal-noise matrix ratio to the parameters of the VARMA representation of the model. We then show that the parameters can be estimated using a recently introduced method, called Moment Estimation Through Aggregation (META). This method replaces traditional multivariate likelihood estimation with a procedure that requires estimating univariate processes only. This makes the estimation simpler, faster, and better behaved numerically. We prove that our estimation method is consistent and asymptotically normal distributed for the proposed framework.

Two parties differ in their preferred size of unproductive public spending which is financed by taxes and external debt. Electoral outcomes are characterized by the economic benefits from the incumbent's policies and stochastic idiosyncratic ideological aspects. Quantitative findings suggest that endogenous political turnover increases the discrepancies between the optimal borrowing and default policies of the two parties. Prior to a debt crisis, the incumbent government accumulates external debt to foster the probability of remaining in power. The dynamic interaction of electoral outcomes, external debt, and sovereign default supports arguments for imposing institutional constraints on incumbent governments. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In addition to dynamic changes in market structure, the U.S. automobile market experienced significant public, policy changes in the form of price and export controls. This experience provides a unique opportunity to test the effect of changing concentration on prices and the effectiveness of controls in a highly visible, dynamic industry. We identify a threshold concentration level below which prices converge to competitive equilibrium. Above this threshold, pricing is essentially consistent with monopoly pricing. Price controls appear to have reduced automobile prices while export controls had little discernible overall effect. (C) 2017 The Society for Policy Modeling. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In addition, we find that these firms face more difficulties to access public debt and bank debt (particularly, short-term bank debt), and they have to rely on trade credit as an alternative source of short-term financing. Analyzing the associations in two subsamples based on firm size, we find that our results essentially driven by smaller companies, which are those affected by higher information asymmetries.

Our main finding, obtained using a spatial regression discontinuity technique in a diff-in-diffs framework, is that voter turnout greatly increased in those areas where the Pica Law was applied, compared with bordering and otherwise similar areas.

We postulate that firms' capital structure decisions are affected by target leverage (i.e., the reference point) as well as the observed leverage. Market conditions combined with firms' capital structure will put firms in either loss or gain domains, where firms behave differently. In general, the leverage-return relationship is positive in the gain domain and negative in the loss domain. Firms are then subject to asymmetric risk preference in different domains. Our empirical evidence shows strong support for the theoretical model. Compared to the conventional approach where only observed leverage is used, our model is more flexible and realistic in revealing the underlying structure of the leverage-returns relationship.

Analyzing this question empirically is difficult because bailouts are not granted randomly. This paper suggests a method to evaluate the fiscal consequences of subnational bailouts that does not rely on institutional details to obtain quasi-exogenous variation. The main idea is to combine matching and difference-in-differences designs. In a second step, I apply this method to study how bailouts affect the fiscal policy of recipient municipalities in the German federal state of Hesse. Combining disaggregated budget data with data on bailout payments over more than a decade, I find that municipalities consolidate their budgets after they receive a bailout from the state government. While this finding is specific to the German federal context, the proposed methodology can be used, due to its flexibility, to study the fiscal consequences of bailouts in various other settings.","[Baskaran, Thushyanthan] Univ Siegen, Sch Econ Disciplines, Unteres Schloss 3, D-57072 Siegen, Germany",Universitat Siegen,"Baskaran, T (通讯作者)，Univ Siegen, Sch Econ Disciplines, Unteres Schloss 3, D-57072 Siegen, Germany.",baskaran@vwl.uni-siegen.de,,,German Research Foundation (DFG) [DFG BA 4967/1-2],German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"I thank conference participants at the IIPF 2014 in Lugano, theEEA2014 in Toulouse, and seminar participants at the DIW Berlin and the European Central Bank for comments and suggestions.

Testing modern products purchased in local markets, we find that 30% of nutrient is missing in fertilizer, and hybrid maize seed is estimated to contain less than 50% authentic seeds. We document that such low quality results in low average returns. If authentic technologies replaced these low-quality products, however, average returns are high. To rationalize the findings, we calibrate a learning model using data from our agricultural trials. Because agricultural yields are noisy, farmers' ability to learn about quality is limited and this can help explain the low quality equilibrium we observe, but also why the market has not fully collapsed.","[Bold, Tessa] Stockholm Univ, Ctr Econ & Policy Res, Inst Int Econ Studies, Stockholm, Sweden; Natl Agr Res Labs, Kampala, Uganda; Univ Zurich, Natl Bur Econ Res, Zurich, Switzerland",Stockholm University; University of Zurich,"Bold, T (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Ctr Econ & Policy Res, Inst Int Econ Studies, Stockholm, Sweden.",,,,Swedish Research Council [421-2013-1524]; International Growth Center,Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); International Growth Center,"We gratefully acknowledge coeditors Larry Katz and Andrei Shleifer, and four anonymous referees for many valuable comments and suggestions.

In this game, each player's payoff depends only on his own contribution and the contributions of his immediate neighbors in a circle network. As in the standard public goods game, we find substantial heterogeneity in behavior across subjects, including both unconditional free-riding and full cooperation, as well as conditional cooperation. We first examine the impact of different information conditions on conditional cooperation. At the aggregate level, we find that players who observe average payoff information about others contribute significantly less than those who observe average contribution information. We then investigate the extent to which conditional cooperators facilitate the spread of cooperation and free-riding behavior across the network. In groups with a single free-rider type, we show that individual contributions decay faster for players who are closer in the network to the free rider. On the other hand, in groups with a single unconditional full contributor type, players do not respond by converging to full cooperation. Instead, we find that proximity to the unconditional full contributor seems only to mitigate (or delay) the typical decline in contributions over time. These contrasting effects are consistent with the widespread claim that conditional cooperation is imperfect, or exhibits a self-serving bias. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Although taxes play a crucial role, we cannot argue that taxes drive all of the movements in hours worked. In particular, the model underpredicts the large decrease in hours in 1975-1986 and the large increase in hours in 1994-2007.

Individual preferences are interdependent because they depend on other people's consumption and, thus, change over time. In equilibrium, investors herd and hold the same portfolio of risky assets, which is biased toward stocks of sectors that produce a socially preferred good. Price-dividend ratios, expected returns, and return volatility are time-varying, and their dynamics are directly linked to changes in preferences. These results hold even in economies with very simple ingredients, such as logarithmic preferences, and are in stark contrast with those obtained in standard models where preferences are not interdependent.

Because smuggling occurs through the diversion of imports from the official port of entry in the south to the north, our modelling framework also captures the spatial effects of higher tariffs on changes in rural and urban prices, production and consumption, the flow of trade, and welfare, across different parts of the country. Results show that tariff rates that exceed about 40% introduce some smuggling through the north when it becomes more profitable than importing through official channels in the south. It is also at this tipping point that government tariff revenues are maximised. At higher tariff rates with smuggling, the south experiences greater welfare losses, especially in urban areas.","[Johnson, Michael E.] CARE, Res & Learning Food & Nutr Secur Unit, 1899 L St,Suite 500, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Dorosh, Paul] IFPRI, Dev Strategy & Governance DSG Div, 2033 K St, Washington, DC 20006 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Johnson, ME (通讯作者)，CARE, Res & Learning Food & Nutr Secur Unit, 1899 L St,Suite 500, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",Michael.Johnson@care.org,,"Dorosh, Paul/0000-0001-6049-6018",United States Agency for International Development (USAID),United States Agency for International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"This study was made possible by the financial support of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to the Nigeria Strategy Support Program (NSSP) of the International Food Policy Research Institute's (IFPRI) in Abuja, Nigeria.",,15,5,7,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

Empirical results suggest that income inequality induces lower share of employment in services sector, and this negative effect gets stronger as income level rises. To explain these facts, I present a multi-sector model with non-homothetic preference and heterogenous agents in terms of different income levels. In equilibrium, the individuals will not consume all the goods available in the market. While the income elasticity falls as income increases at the individual level, it may not at the aggregate level. The extensive margin of consumers is important to understand this result. Within this framework, I show that income inequality may have negative effects on an industry with income elasticity larger than 1. More importantly, this effect is getting stronger as income levels increase.","[Liu, Yue] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, South Coll Rd 39, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Liu, Y (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, South Coll Rd 39, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",liuy9.08@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn,,"Liu, Yue/0000-0002-8040-9564",,,,,19,0,0,0,6,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Long-term equilibrium rates depend crucially on the covariances between international bond yields anticipated by investors. Positively anticipated covariances amplify the phenomena of fundamental contagions related to the degradations of public finance and solvency of sovereign debt issuer, while negatively anticipated covariances amplify the phenomena of Flight-to-quality. The two-step econometric approach over the period January 2006 to September 2016 analyses 21 European market pairs in a bivariate GARCH framework. Empirical results show that the decline in German and French long-term rates from March 2011 is partially due to the decrease in both risk premium and covariances with periphery countries. These declines actually amplify the mechanisms of Flight-to-quality. Finally, a lower sensitivity of rate to volatility and co-volatility risks during the crisis period gives credit to the hypothesis of a occasional fragmentation of the European sovereign bond markets (De Santis and Stein, 2016; Ehrmann and Fratzscher, 2017).","[Zhang, Jiangxingyun] Univ Rennes 1, Rennes, France; CREM CNRS, Paris, France",Universite de Rennes; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Zhang, JXY (通讯作者)，Univ Rennes 1, Rennes, France.",,,,,,,,31,1,1,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

In the last few decades since the 1950s many of the changes observed in the world climate have been meaningful. This paper presents an analysis of energy efficiency and of greenhouse gas emissions in the Chilean manufacturing industry by region and sector taking into consideration time sequences. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) models are used for the analysis. Three ways to handle undesirable outputs are compared, the source of inefficiency in each decision making unit (DMU) is calculated using scale efficiency, and the evolution over time is analyzed using the Malmquist index. The results indicate that the industries located in the Chilean regions of Coquimbo, La Araucania and Aysen were the most efficient while the industries in the regions of Tarapaca, Antofagasta and Biobio were less efficient. The most efficient industrial sectors were those involving communications equipment, base metals, and clothing; the least efficient were those concerned with food and beverages, textiles and nonmetallic minerals. Due to the treatment of the undesirable outputs, differences were found in the efficiency indexes obtained by the three models. This finding suggests using a model better adapted to the characteristics of the outputs in question and the viability of improving industrial practices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This article studies the global rebound effects on energy use and related emissions caused by an energy efficiency improvement. We adopt a global computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to design a scenario of energy efficiency improvement, which is compared to a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario to identify the global rebound effect. Our results show very large rebound effect on energy use (70%) and related emissions (90%) in 2040 at the global level with regional and sectoral differences. Important determinants, among others, are induced labor movement among economic activities and labor supply, and substitution elasticity between energy and other goods. Labor mobility has a marked impact on both rebound effects and on fuel mix. The global rebound effect is still considerable even with a low substitution elasticity between energy and other goods. The effect of capital accumulation over time contributes marginally to the global rebound effect as it is utilized to promote economic growth by using energy input more efficiently.

Although this is attributed to decreasing effects of distance across countries, the workhorse models of gravity fail to capture it, the so-called missing globalization or distance puzzle. This paper shows that this puzzle may be due to the restricting assumption of constant elasticity of substitution (CES) preferences working behind the gravity models. We test the validity of this assumption for different trade intervals and show that it is violated as a result of the distance elasticity of trade decreasing with the amount of trade. Accordingly, we consider a type of non-CES utility function, namely constant absolute risk version (CARA), and analytically show that the negative relation between trade and distance elasticity of trade is captured by CARA preferences. We estimate the gravity equation implied by CARA preferences, empirically confirm the endogenous relation between trade and distance elasticity of trade, and show that the distance puzzle is solved under CARA preferences. According to the data set used, CARA preferences are also econometrically selected over CES preferences based on their goodness of fit.","[Yilmazkuday, Hakan] Florida Int Univ, Dept Econ, Miami, FL 33199 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida International University,"Yilmazkuday, H (通讯作者)，Florida Int Univ, Dept Econ, Miami, FL 33199 USA.",hyilmazk@fiu.edu,"Yilmazkuday, Hakan/GXZ-6757-2022","Yilmazkuday, Hakan/0000-0002-8629-6230",,,,,41,8,8,1,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

We exploit the variation in Basel II implementation across countries to use a differences-in-differences approach. Risk is considered according to insolvency risk and credit risk indicators.

The Case of Box Officials,TRIMESTRE ECONOMICO,,,Spanish,Article,,,,,,economic theory; rationality; behavior; Homo Economicus; self-interest,PUBLIC-GOODS; POLITICUS,"Background: From an empirical case, we studied the decision of the people to voluntarily participate as poll officials on the election day in Mexico. In this regard, it was interesting to analyze whether this participation was motivated by a pro social behavior, where the citizen contributed to the existence of a public good through involvement in democracy. If this is the case, the behavior of Homo Economicus would be ruled out. Methods: Given the lack of information to do this study at the individual level, it was decided to do so at a more aggregated level, the municipal level. By means of a logistic regression, the probability of the citizens within a municipality having a high acceptance rate to participate in the polling day, as poll officials, is explored. Specifically, we study to what extent the dependent variable is explained by variables associated with a pro-social behavior or a Homo Economicus behavior. Results: The results show that, indeed, part of the participation is motivated by citizen responsibility and social commitment; that is, a divergent behavior of the Homo Economicus. The other part of the participation responds to non-explicit incentives that would be associated with self-interest. Conclusions: This article concludes that a part of those who accept the invitation to participate as poll officials do so in response to pro-social behavior; but for the rest, it is not possible to rule out Homo Economicus behavior. All of this information points to the need to continue working to consolidate the quality of Mexican democracy.","[Barragan Robles, Miroslava; Escalante Semerena, Roberto; Dominguez Villalobos, Lilia] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Robles, MB (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",miroslava.barragan@gmail.com; semerena@unam.mx; ldv@unam.mx,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,7,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

During the colonial era, intergroup relations changed considerably due, in part, to the uneven spread of the English language on the island and its role in British governance. Accordingly, our measure is sensitive to regional differences in English language acquisition before independence. By using a data set on victims of terrorist attacks by district and war period during the protracted war in Sri Lanka, we find that our measure is more strongly correlated with the number of victims, and is associated with 70% more victims, on average, than is a polarization measure based on the context-independent linguistic distances between groups. Thus, the historical underpinnings of our measure illustrate in a quantitative manner the relevance of history for understanding patterns of civil conflict.","[Dower, Paul Castaneda] Florida Int Univ, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Dower, Paul Castaneda; Weber, Shlomo] New Econ Sch, Ctr Study Divers & Social Interact, Skolkovo, Moskovskaya Obl, Russia; [Ginsburgh, Victor] Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, Brussels, Belgium; [Ginsburgh, Victor] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium",State University System of Florida; Florida International University; New Economic School; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Weber, S (通讯作者)，New Econ Sch, Ctr Study Divers & Social Interact, Skolkovo, Moskovskaya Obl, Russia.",sweber@nes.ru,"Weber, Shlomo/AAQ-5651-2020","Weber, Shlomo/0000-0002-7832-2769; Castaneda Dower, Paul/0000-0001-5902-6799",Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation [14.U04.31.0002],"Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation(Ministry of Education and Science, Russian Federation)","The authors are grateful to Dmitry Plotnikov for sharing data and giving us permission to reproduce several maps and figures in the Online Appendix A.

We present two hypotheses after reviewing series of policy documents and related organizational adjustment descriptions. First, we argue that China's pro-liberal reform in trade and FDI institutions helped trade to take off. Second, China is ambitious in acquiring advanced technology and building up a sophisticated system to promote technological capability. An analysis of Grubel and Lloyd IIT index on intermediate goods trade belonging to SITC 7 and SITC 8- the key components of regional value chain in East Asia- suggests that the structural changes taking place in China's intermediate goods trade are in agreement with the stated hypotheses.

J,"Lustig, N",,,,"Lustig, Nora",,,The Impact of Taxes and Social Spending on Income Distribution and Poverty in Latin America. An Application of the Commitment to Equity (CEQ) Methodology,TRIMESTRE ECONOMICO,,,Spanish,Article,,,,,,fiscal incidence; inequality; poverty; taxes; transfers; Latin America,BRAZIL; INEQUALITY; SYSTEM,"Background: Using standard fiscal incidence analysis and the new methodological developments by the Commitment to Equity (CEQ) Institute, this paper estimates the impact of fiscal policy on inequality and poverty in sixteen countries in Latin America around 2010. Methods: With information on incomes, consumption, and other dimensions available in household surveys, and knowledge about the characteristics of the fiscal system, the CEQ method consists in allocating to each individual the burden of personal income and consumption taxes, and the benefits from cash transfers, consumption subsidies, and government spending on education and health. This process yields the pre-fiscal and post-fiscal income concepts of interest. These income concepts, in turn, are used to calculate the corresponding indicators of inequality and poverty. Thus, one can estimate, for each country, the impact of the fiscal system and each of its components on inequality and poverty. Since the methodology that was applied is the same, results are comparable across countries. Results: The countries that redistribute the most are Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica, and Uruguay. Guatemala, Honduras, and Peru are the countries that redistribute the least. Fiscal policy reduces extreme (income) poverty in twelve out of the sixteen countries. The incidence of poverty after taxes, subsidies, and cash transfers, however, is higher than market income poverty in Bolivia, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua, even though fiscal policy reduces inequality in these four countries. Contributory pensions have a heterogeneous effect on inequality and, contrary to some expectations, their impact is equalizing in nine of the countries. In the sixteen countries, spending on pre-school and primary education is equalizing and pro-poor (per capita benefits decline with income per capita). Spending on secondary education is always equalizing; it is also pro poor in some of the countries. Spending on tertiary education is never pro-poor but it is equalizing in all the countries except for Guatemala. Spending on health is always equalizing but pro-poor only in some countries. Conclusions: Latin America presents a great deal of heterogeneity in the size of the state and the countries' capacity to use their fiscal power to reduce inequality and poverty. A higher share of social spending (to GDP) is associated with a larger redistributive effect but countries with similar, or even lower, shares of social spending show heterogeneous redistributive effects implying that other factors beyond size such as the composition and targeting of social spending (and taxes) are at play. It is important to emphasize that a higher redistributive effect is not necessarily a desirable outcome since in this article there is no estimation of the impact of redistributive policy on fiscal sustainability and efficiency. In some countries, the burden of consumption taxes is such that a portion of the poor are net payers into the fiscal system (before receiving in kind transfers in education and health). Governments should examine whether this undesirable effect could be avoided, or at least reduced, through an expansion of targeted cash transfers and/or reduction in the consumption taxes that are particularly burdensome for the poor.","[Lustig, Nora] Tulane Univ, Econ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Lustig, Nora] Tulane Univ, Catedra Samuel Z Stone Econ Latinoamer, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Lustig, Nora] Tulane Univ, Inst CEQ Compromiso Con Equidad, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Lustig, Nora] Ctr Global Dev, Washington, DC USA; [Lustig, Nora] Dialogo Interamer, Coimbra, Portugal",Tulane University; Tulane University; Tulane University,"Lustig, N (通讯作者)，Tulane Univ, Econ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.;Lustig, N (通讯作者)，Tulane Univ, Catedra Samuel Z Stone Econ Latinoamer, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.;Lustig, N (通讯作者)，Tulane Univ, Inst CEQ Compromiso Con Equidad, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.",nlustig@tulane.edu,,,,,,,62,9,9,1,19,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

In randomly selected villages in West Bengal, India, we implemented trader-agent-intermediated lending (TRAIL), in which local trader-lender agents were incentivized through repayment-based commissions to select borrowers for individual liability loans. In other randomly selected villages, we organized a group-based lending (GBL) program in which individuals formed 5-member groups and received joint liability loans. TRAIL loans increased the production of the leading cash crop by 27% and farm incomes by 22%. GBL loans had insignificant effects. We develop and test a theoretical model of borrower selection and incentives. Farmers selected by the TRAIL agents were more able than those who self-selected into the GBL scheme; this pattern of selection explains at least 30-40% of the observed difference in income impacts.","[Maitra, Pushkar] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton Campus, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Mitra, Sandip] Indian Stat Inst, Sampling & Official Stat Unit, 203 BT Rd, Kolkata 700108, India; [Mookherjee, Dilip] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, 270 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Motta, Alberto] UNSW Australia, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Visaria, Sujata] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Lee Shau Kee Business Bldg, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Monash University; Indian Statistical Institute; Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata; Boston University; University of New South Wales Sydney; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Maitra, P (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton Campus, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",Pushkar.Maitra@monash.edu; Sandip@isical.ac.in; dilipm@bu.edu; motta@unsw.edu.au; svisaria@ust.hk,"mitra, sandip/S-1332-2017; Maitra, Pushkar/R-9003-2019","mitra, sandip/0000-0002-7024-9341; Maitra, Pushkar/0000-0003-0247-4069; Motta, Alberto/0000-0001-6907-8525; Visaria, Sujata/0000-0001-7406-4929",Australian Agency for International Development [CF09/650]; International Growth Centre [1-VRA-VINC-VXXXX-98120]; United States Agency for International Development [AID-OAA-F-13-00007]; Hong Kong Research Grants Council [16503014],Australian Agency for International Development(Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD); International Growth Centre; United States Agency for International Development(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Hong Kong Research Grants Council(Hong Kong Research Grants Council),"Funding was provided by the Australian Agency for International Development (Grant #CF09/650), the International Growth Centre (Grant #1-VRA-VINC-VXXXX-98120), United States Agency for International Development (Grant #AID-OAA-F-13-00007) and the Hong Kong Research Grants Council (Grant #16503014).

The international comparison between samples collected from entire countries and specific regions reveals interesting similarities, but also remarkable differences. The main similarities are the fulfillment of the intertemporal budget constraint, the volatility of the budgetary components, and the importance of the intergovernmental transfers as an adjustment instrument. The most remarkable difference is the preponderant role of the own revenues in the USA, probably reflecting the larger fiscal autonomy of US municipalities. In most cases, the large municipalities seem to be more dependent on grants than their small counterparts, although this pattern is broken in Japan.

The novel feature here is our focus on the temporal evolution of the two projections. The personal networks exhibit cores of highly central directors who are densely connected among themselves, while the institutional networks show a persistent core of large corporations whose identity remains mostly the same. This results in the persistent presence of a core network of very large corporations, despite substantial turnover in the identity of directors and significant changes in Germany's corporate governance during the investigated period. Our findings strongly suggest that core persistence originates from the board appointment decisions of the very largest corporations and is largely independent of personal destinies.","[Raddant, Matthias] Inst World Econ, Kiellinie 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Raddant, Matthias] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; [Milakovic, Mishael] Univ Bamberg, Dept Econ, Feldkirchenstr 21, D-96052 Bamberg, Germany; [Birg, Laura] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Ctr European Governance & Econ Dev Res, Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); University of Kiel; Otto Friedrich University Bamberg; University of Gottingen,"Raddant, M (通讯作者)，Inst World Econ, Kiellinie 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.;Raddant, M (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.",raddant@economics.uni-kiel.de; mishael.milakovic@uni-bamberg.de; laura.birg@wiwi.uni-goettingen.de,"Milakovic, Mishael/ABA-9718-2020; Raddant, Matthias/JZT-3513-2024","Raddant, Matthias/0000-0001-6157-7733; Milakovic, Mishael/0000-0002-3114-204X",Volkswagen Foundation,Volkswagen Foundation(Volkswagen),This research was supported by the Volkswagen Foundation through their grant on Complex Networks As Interdisciplinary Phenomena.

J,"Rodríguez-Reyes, LR",,,,"Raul Rodriguez-Reyes, Luis",,,Managing Longevity Risk in Public Pension Systems. A Proposal to Use Longevity swaps for Mexico,TRIMESTRE ECONOMICO,,,Spanish,Article,,,,,,longevity; swap; pension,,"Background: Longevity risk, defined as the possibility of people outliving its expected life span, hurts pension systems because it implies a potential underestimation of reserves kept in order to fulfill future liabilities. Nevertheless, this has a positive connotation for life insurers, given that these companies may face a deferral in their liabilities when people live longer than expected. Methods: In this research paper, a longevity swap is proposed as an alternative to manage longevity risk, using the natural hedge arising from opposite positions regarding the same risk. In order to apply it to the management of the longevity risk faced by Mexico's federal government, some changes were made in the general framework used to construct and value this kind of derivatives, adding a proportional longevity index and a monetization variable. Results: These modifications give the referred framework a wider scope; e.g., it can be applied to systems with growing number of pensioners, as the one created by the Mexican reform of 1997. Furthermore, a 50 year longevity swap between the Mexican government and a syndicate of life insurers and reinsurers is proposed, analyzed, and simulated and an ex post cost of 1.6 billon of 2017 pesos for the federal government is estimated. Conclusions: Protection provided to the Mexican government by the proposed longevity swap is remarkable. However, its cost has to be considered, as it is biased by the expected longevity behavior.","[Raul Rodriguez-Reyes, Luis] Univ Panamer, Escuela Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Campus Guadalajara, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Universidad Panamericana - Ciudad de Mexico,"Rodríguez-Reyes, LR (通讯作者)，Univ Panamer, Escuela Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Campus Guadalajara, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",lurodriguez@up.edu.mx,"Rodríguez-Reyes, Luis Raul/C-4610-2017","Rodríguez-Reyes, Luis Raul/0000-0003-0568-9356",,,,,18,1,1,0,6,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

Differing from previous research into hospital competition, this article captures the impact of price subsidy of public hospitals on the quality of private hospitals, considering both horizontal and vertical product differentiation by employing a two-stage dynamic game under Cournot and Stackelberg competition. Firstly, the results of this study indicate that medical reimbursement of public hospitals has stimulating effects on the quality of private hospitals and the improvement of quality is related to the degree of hospital competition. Second, the quality of health care and patients' surplus and social welfare are the highest under Stackelberg competition if the public hospital is the leader while the private hospital is the follower. Finally, the demand for health care rises with the price subsidy of public hospitals.

In practice, however, they opt for a denominational structure with a relatively low density. The literature holds that this is because of the production costs involved. To test this proposition, we introduce a per-denomination fixed cost into the matching model of Lee et al. (2005) and parameterize the model with data on the production of US dollar banknotes. Our simulations demonstrate that central banks could increase the density of their currency systems beyond the observed level without the efficiency gains for transactors being dwarfed by the additional production costs for the central bank itself. This suggests that the explanation for the low density rather lies with costs incurred by consumers and merchants - and anticipated by central banks - that are not yet in any of the extant models.

Effectively, the way to progress towards an ACU is by forming it among ASEAN-9 members with Singapore maintaining its existing zero tariffs against non-members, thereby creating a Partial ACU. Using applied general equilibrium modeling exercise based on GTAP, the findings suggest that there are potential net positive welfare gains to be collectively reaped by ASEAN if it moves from an AFTA to a partial ACU post-2015. However, not all ASEAN members will individually gain from such an ACU and members may need to devise a feasible mechanism wherein some member country welfare losses in an ACU can be compensated by the members who gain. The paper argues that in spite of political economy challenges due to ASEAN's unique characteristics and diversity in the levels of economic development among members, such a Partial ACU could be considered by ASEAN leaders due to its strategic imperatives.","[Das, Sanchita Basu] ISEAS Yusof Ishak Inst, Econ Affairs, ASEAN Studies Ctr, Singapore, Singapore; [Sen, Rahul; Srivastava, Sadhana] AUT, Sch Econ, Auckland, New Zealand",Auckland University of Technology,"Das, SB (通讯作者)，ISEAS Yusof Ishak Inst, Econ Affairs, ASEAN Studies Ctr, Singapore, Singapore.",sanchita@iseas.edu.sg; rahul.sen@aut.ac.nz; sadhana.srivastava@aut.ac.nz,"Sen, Rahul/AFK-4535-2022; Srivastava, Sadhana/ABE-5126-2021","Sen, Rahul/0000-0002-8067-7876; Srivastava, Sadhana/0000-0002-1260-267X",,,,,52,0,0,0,4,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

To this end, we analyze time-variation in the Greenbook coefficients in forecast encompassing regressions. Assuming that model coefficients change continuously, we estimate unobserved components models using Bayesian inference techniques. To verify that our results do not depend on the specific way change is modeled, we also allow the coefficients to change discretely rather than continuously and test for structural breaks using classical inference techniques. We find that the Greenbook forecasts have been consistently superior to the commercial forecasts at all horizons throughout our sample period. Although the forecasting performance gap has narrowed at more distant horizons after the early-to-mid 1980s, it remains significant.","[Eksi, Ozan; Tas, Bedri Kamil Onur] TOBB ETU, Dept Econ, Sogutozu Cad 43, TR-06560 Ankara, Turkey; [Orman, Cuneyt] Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",TOBB Ekonomi ve Teknoloji University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Tas, BKO (通讯作者)，TOBB ETU, Dept Econ, Sogutozu Cad 43, TR-06560 Ankara, Turkey.",onurtas@etu.edu.tr,,"Tas, Bedri/0000-0001-5418-777X",,,,,33,2,2,0,5,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

While empirical studies provide supporting evidence for the predicted productivity effects, the results on the wage effects are mixed. This article extends the model to reconcile the empirical findings. It takes into account that collective-bargaining coverage not only limits redistribution activities but also strengthens the effectiveness of performance-enhancing work practices negotiated between employers and works councils.","[Jirjahn, Uwe] Univ Trier, Trier, Germany",Universitat Trier,"Jirjahn, U (通讯作者)，Univ Trier, Lehrstuhl Arbeitsmarktokonom, Fachbereich 4, Univ Sring 15, D-54286 Trier, Germany.",jirjahn@uni-trier.de,"Jirjahn, Uwe/W-9001-2019",,,,,,65,14,14,1,5,J C B MOHR,TUBINGEN,"POSTFACH 2040, W-7400 TUBINGEN, GERMANY",0932-4569,1614-0559,,J INST THEOR ECON,J.

The simulations employ an expected intertemporal welfare function and the parameters from a three variable structural VAR estimated using data for sixteen European countries. The VAR captures the potential interaction effects between output, government spending and revenue. We find welfare gains from many, but not all, of the fiscal rules. The best rules target a zero structural deficit and cause government spending volatility to fall by about one third. However, a simple rule, where government expenditure is set equal to a one-period ahead forecast of revenue, performs almost as well. In particular, this simple rule yields a welfare gain and a reduction in volatility similar to that of the more complicated zero structural deficit rule adopted by Switzerland and several other countries. Balanced budget rules perform less well than rules that target the structural deficit. A rule that keeps real per capita government spending equal to a constant a type of rule adopted by some U.S. states yields relatively low welfare and often leads to significant debt accumulation. These results highlight the importance of the appropriate design of a fiscal rule.","[Landon, Stuart; Smith, Constance] Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB, Canada",University of Alberta,"Smith, C (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",stuart.landon@ualberta.ca; constance.smith@ualberta.ca,,,,,,,90,12,12,1,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Results indicate that cofiring wood pellets with coal is generally not a commercially viable option. However, lower-level (with wood pellets < 15%) cofiring could have been feasible during the infancy period (2009-2011) when wood pellet price was declining. Sensitivity analysis shows that our conclusions are robust and the most important factors are relative prices of coal and mixed fuel. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis that cofiring is economically feasible and suggest using policy vehicles to stimulate the bioenergy market and meet the greenhouse gas emission reduction target. In particular, a subsidy of $1A0/mmbtu to the 10% mixed fuel or a tax of $1.50/mmbtu on coal would prompt the conversions of coal-only power plants to cofiring ones, and a subsidy of $0.45/mmbtu to the 10% mixed fuel or a tax of $0.50/mmbtu on coal would maintain existing cofiring power plants in the status quo.

The analysis shows that there are large differences concerning the focus of granted funds which can be explained by different policy objectives, differences in the level and degree of network access charges and different cost coverage ratios of public transport services. We identify a tendency towards two main financing models. In our data-set countries either focus their support payments on the operation of the infrastructure, which implies lower network charges and thus a lower amount of necessary Public Service Compensations, or they focus on the support of transport services with a higher degree of cost coverage of network charges and thus a lower amount of operating contributions paid to the infrastructure manager. The structure of funds, different approaches of infrastructure financing and differences in the treatment of historical debt are likely to have an influence on the performance of the investigated railway systems.","[Schaefer, Jan Thomas; Goetz, Georg] Justus Liebig Univ, Giessen, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Götz, G (通讯作者)，Justus Liebig Univ, Giessen, Germany.",georg.goetz@wirtschaft.uni-giessen.de,,"Goetz, Georg/0000-0001-7878-6726",Deutsche Bahn AG,Deutsche Bahn AG,Jan Schafer thanks Deutsche Bahn AG for funding a PhD fellowship.,,27,6,6,0,1,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

The strength of our approach is that in contrast to the previous work that has focused on average FDI flows across countries, we are able to explain both the variations in FDI flows across and within countries for a given year. Our core hypothesis is that in countries with high quality of contract enforcement, multinationals are more likely to invest in the industries, where by their very nature investments are relationship specific. Conversely, in countries with low quality of contract enforcement, multinationals are more likely to invest in industries where investments to a large degree are not relationship specific. Using-three dimensional panel data for US FDI flows to 50 countries and 6 sectors for the period 1984-2010, we find strong support for our hypothesis. Our findings suggest that countries that want to attract US FDI in sectors that are highly intensive in technology and institutions such as transportation and electronics should improve their property rights and contracting environment.","[Sen, Kunal] Univ Manchester, Global Dev Inst, Sch Environm Educ & Dev, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Sinha, Chaitali] Univ Manchester, Sch Environm Educ & Dev, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester; University of Manchester,"Sen, K (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Global Dev Inst, Sch Environm Educ & Dev, Manchester, Lancs, England.",kunal.sen@manchester.ac.uk; chai_sinha@yahoo.co.in,"SINHA, CHAITALI/AAG-4059-2021","Sinha, Chaitali/0000-0002-6668-6661",,,,,61,13,13,0,38,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Our results show relatively high medium/long-run own price elasticities indicating that an increase in the electricity price due to, for instance, policy intervention would, in fact, decrease electricity use. Cross price elasticities indicate that electricity and gas are substitutes. Additionally, the income quintiles analysis shows significant differences in the elasticities depending on the income group.

It is found that the existence of a speculator increases the financial system's vulnerability by serving as a coordinating device for the investors and thus triggering the crisis. We then compare three different intervention policies imposed by the authority aiming to counteract this effect: deterring the speculator, rewarding holding investors, and eliminating the preemption motives among investors. We argue that the first method may not work because of the multiplicity problem; the second one is useless when a crisis is about to happen; the last tool works given enough effort. We also include a discussion of different intervention polices employed by governments during the 1997 Asian financial crisis to illustrate the theoretical results. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The forecasted values of the chosen model can assist in mitigating any potential negative impacts, as well as in the preparation of a tourism development plan for the country.","[Petrevska, Biljana] Goce Delcev Univ, Fac Tourism & Business Logist, Stip, North Macedonia",Goce Delcev University of Stip,"Petrevska, B (通讯作者)，Goce Delcev Univ, Fac Tourism & Business Logist, Stip, North Macedonia.",biljana.petrevska@ugd.edu.mk,"Petrevska, Biljana/R-8438-2019","Petrevska, Biljana/0000-0002-1238-4158",,,,,40,37,45,4,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Using the variation in DSM activity within utilities and across utilities over time we identify the impact of DSM programs and find that their presence reduces per customer residential electricity consumption by around 5%. If we consider monetary spending, the effect of a 10% increase in DSM spending causes a 0.14% reduction in per customer residential electricity consumption. The cost of saving a kilowatt hour is around 0.04CHF while the average cost of producing and distributing electricity in Switzerland is around 0.18CHF per kilowatt hour. We conclude that current DSM practices in Switzerland have a statistically significant effect on reducing the demand for residential electricity. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Little is known about their ability to persist over time and spill across contexts. These latter aspects can reinforce or offset the direct impacts depending on the policy instrument choice. Through an online experiment with 1486 subjects, we compare four widely used policy instruments in terms of their ability to enforce a norm of fairness in the Dictator Game, and to persist over time (i.e., to a subsequent untreated Dictator Game) or spill over to a norm of cooperation (i.e., to a subsequent Prisoner's Dilemma). As specific policy interventions, we employed two instances of nudges: defaults and social information; and two instances of push measures: rebates and a minimum donation rule. Our results show that (i) rebates, the minimum donation rule and social information have a positive direct effect on fairness, although the effect of social information is only marginally significant, and that (ii) the effect of rebates and the minimum donation rule persists in the second game, but only within the same game type. These findings demonstrate that, within our specific design, push measures are more effective than nudges in promoting fairness. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Utility functions and production technologies may be affected by the consumption and production activities of all other agents in the economy. We use homotopy techniques to show that the set of competitive equilibria is non-empty and compact. Fixing the externalities, the assumptions on utility functions and production technologies are standard in a differentiable framework. Competitive equilibria are written in terms of first order conditions associated with agents' behavior and market clearing conditions, following the seminal paper of Smale (J Math Econ 1:1-14, 1974). The work of adapting the homotopy approach to economies with externalities on the production side is non-trivial and it requires some ingenious adjustments, because the production technologies are not required to be convex with respect to the consumption and production activities of all agents.","[del Mercato, Elena L.] Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Paris Sch Econ, 106-112 Blvd Hop, Paris 13, France; [del Mercato, Elena L.] Ctr Econ Sorbonne, 106-112 Blvd Hop, Paris 13, France; [Platino, Vincenzo] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Econ & Stat, Via Cintia Monte S Angelo, I-80126 Naples, Italy; [Platino, Vincenzo] CSEF, Via Cintia Monte S Angelo, I-80126 Naples, Italy",Paris School of Economics; University of Naples Federico II,"Platino, V (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Econ & Stat, Via Cintia Monte S Angelo, I-80126 Naples, Italy.;Platino, V (通讯作者)，CSEF, Via Cintia Monte S Angelo, I-80126 Naples, Italy.",Elena.delMercato@univ-paris1.fr; vincenzo.platino@gmail.com,", Vincenzo/KAL-8852-2024","Platino, Vincenzo/0000-0001-8190-9627","Alliance Joint Project Asymmetric Information, Externalities and Restricted Participation, Columbia University; Universite Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne","Alliance Joint Project Asymmetric Information, Externalities and Restricted Participation, Columbia University; Universite Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne","This paper dates back to 2011 and it has been available on the website: http://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/fr/del-mercato-elena/publications.

In a partial equilibrium (PE) mechanism a sector authority (SA) aims to elicit agents' preference rankings for outcomes at hand, presuming separability of preferences, while such presumption is false in general and such isolated rankings might be artifacts. This paper studies what can be Nash implemented if we take such misspecification of PE analysis as a given institutional constraint. The objective is to uncover the kinds of complementarity across sectors that this institutional constraint is able to accommodate. Thus, in our implementation model there are several SAs, agents are constrained to submit their rankings to each SA separately and, moreover, SAs cannot communicate with each other. When a social choice rule (SCR) can be Nash implemented by a product set of PE mechanisms, we say that it can be Nash implemented in PE. We identify necessary conditions for SCRs to be Nash implemented in PE and show that they are also sufficient under a domain condition which identifies the kinds of admissible complementarities. Thus, the Nash implementation in PE of SCRs is examined in auction and matching environments. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper I show that activity by Colombian insurgent group FARC increased disproportionately in Colombian municipalities next to the border with Venezuela after Hugo Chavez became president of the latter. I argue that FARC's reliance on short-range weaponry and non-mechanized transportation limited the area in which the group could expand its operations as a result of access to a cross-border safe haven. In consequence, the finding above constitutes evidence of increased FARC presence in Venezuela during the Chavez administration. Exploiting the plausibly exogenous change of government in Venezuela, I find that Colombian municipalities more exposed to a cross-border guerrilla sanctuary experience large increases in the intensity of violence, as well as reductions in local tax revenue and educational enrolment.","[Martinez, Luis R.] Univ Chicago, Harris Sch Publ Policy, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Martínez, LR (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Harris Sch Publ Policy, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",,,,,,,,116,20,26,1,16,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

The model is a two-period durable goods monopoly game with demand uncertainty. First, a non-boycott equilibrium is characterized. Under regularity assumptions ruling out multiplicative uncertainty, there are additional equilibria in which the firm sets a low price in period 0, based on the anticipation that consumers will boycott whenever the price exceeds a threshold. Also, the augmented game, with a publicly observed sunspot, has equilibria in which boycotts occur on the equilibrium path with positive probability. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Using data from the third Community Innovation Survey, covering 23 European countries, this paper estimates a system of three equations in which investments in training and in the stock of R&D personnel are treated as endogenous in relation to the amount of innovative sales on which they are presumed to have an effect. Empirical evidence confirms that investments in training and in the stock of R&D personnel have a positive effect on firms' innovativeness and that returns on them are not affected by the degree of knowledge intensity of the firm. However, the returns are always statistically significantly higher in large firms than in SMEs.","[Ciriaci, Daria] European Commiss, Directorate Gen Econ & Financial Affairs, Brussels, Belgium; [Ciriaci, Daria] European Commiss, Inst Prospect Technol Studies, Brussels, Belgium",,"Ciriaci, D (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Directorate Gen Econ & Financial Affairs, Brussels, Belgium.;Ciriaci, D (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Inst Prospect Technol Studies, Brussels, Belgium.",daria.ciriaci@ec.europa.eu,,,,,,,64,7,7,0,36,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

We find that an increase in the government size leads to a significant rise (decline) in economic growth rate when the government size is below (above) the threshold level, confirming the predictions of Armey curve.

Workers differ in manual and cognitive skills and sort into jobs that demand different combinations of these two skills. To study this multidimensional sorting problem, I develop a theoretical framework that generalizes the unidimensional notion of assortative matching and sufficient conditions on the technology under which sorting obtains. I derive the equilibrium in closed form and use this explicit solution to study biased technological change. The main finding is that an increase in worker-job complementarities in cognitive relative to manual inputs leads to more pronounced sorting and wage inequality across cognitive relative to manual skills. This can trigger wage polarization and boost aggregate wage inequality. I then estimate the model for the U.S. and identify sizable technology shifts: during the last two decades, worker-job complementarities in cognitive inputs strongly increased, whereas complementarities in manual inputs decreased. In addition to this bias in complementarities, there has been a cognitive skill-bias in production. Counterfactual exercises suggest that these technology shifts (as opposed to changes in skill supply and demand) can account for observed changes in worker-job sorting, wage polarization and a significant part of the increase in U.S. wage dispersion.","[Lindenlaub, Ilse] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Yale University,"Lindenlaub, I (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",,,,DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service),DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),"I am very grateful to Jan Eeckhout, Omiros Papaspiliopoulos and Nicola Pavoni for their advice.

This is achieved in two treatments; first, we determine the information subjects receive about the demand revealed by other subjects in a similar decision making situation, second, collective action is implemented whereby all subjects are required to purchase the group's median quantity at a given price. Participants in the experiment were offered the opportunity to contribute to voluntary climate change mitigation by purchasing European Union Allowances. Purchased allowances were withdrawn from the European Emissions Trading Scheme. In our experiment, information about other subjects' behavior has no effect on the demand for voluntary climate change mitigation. Under collective action, however, WTP, aggregate demand and the probability of purchasing allowances are higher compared to an individual contribution mechanism. Thus collective action curtails free riding, although it has no traceable effect on the provision level of the public good outside the experiment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We find perceived institutional trust to be positively correlated with stated inter-personal trust. At the same time, there is significant social distance among various faith groups in our data: both Hindus and Muslims trust their coreligionists more than they trust those from other religions. Moreover, Hindus trust Christians, Buddhists and NGO workers more than Muslims, and are not distrustful of the wider society. Trust towards non-Muslims is negatively correlated with Islamic school attendance among Muslim respondents, while religiosity tends not to play any role. Compared to religion, the effects of institutional trust and local economic development are modest. These findings are robust to control for a range of individual-and community-level correlates, and enumerator fixed effects.","[Asadullah, M.

This paper uses data for up to 137 countries for the period 1998-2013 to investigate the importance of financial capital for changes in the use of each energy type. I find that financial capital supports transition to more capital-intensive energy types. For high-income countries, financial capital facilitates transitions from fossil fuels to modern renewable energy sources, especially wind. Both private credit from banks and domestic private debt securities support greater shares of wind energy. For lower-income countries, financial capital supports progression from biomass towards fossil fuel energy sources such as coal. I also find that countries with larger stocks of financial capital are more likely to move to more capital-intensive electricity generation systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We present an overlapping-generations model that replicates the empirically observed pattern and study the impact of demographic transition on output volatility. We find that the change in age composition itself has only a marginal influence on output volatility, as the mitigating effect of more individuals with lower labor supply volatilities is compensated for by higher age-specific labor shares. Instead, the driving force behind the Great Moderation in our model is the downward shift of the age-specific labor supply volatility curve.","[Heer, Burkhard; Rohrbacher, Stefan; Scharrer, Christian] Univ Augsburg, Augsburg, Germany; [Heer, Burkhard] CESifo, Munich, Germany",University of Augsburg; Ifo Institut,"Heer, B (通讯作者)，Univ Augsburg, Dept Econ, Univ Str 16, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany.",burkhard.heer@wiwi.uni-augsburg.de,,"Heer, Burkhard/0000-0002-6627-7550; Scharrer, Christian/0000-0002-6612-7472",Research Center Global Business Management at the University of Augsburg,Research Center Global Business Management at the University of Augsburg,"We would like to thank two anonymous reviewers for their helpful and constructive comments, which greatly contributed to improving the final version of the paper.

A natural monopoly is regulated i) for economic purposes; ii) because it can cause losses of substantial size to third parties (the environment or people). The regulator observes the production cost without being able to distinguish the initial type (an adverse selection parameter) from the effort (a moral hazard variable). In addition, the investment in prevention is non observable (another moral hazard variable) and the monopoly is protected by limited liability.

However, there are concerns that inefficiencies occur when funding is received from multiple sponsors, especially when this originates from different sectors. This study investigates complementarities between public/non-profit and private sector sources of research funding with regard to academic output in terms of publications, research impact and research orientation. The empirical analysis is based on novel data on external public/non-profit research grants and industry funding for tenured engineering academics employed at fifteen UK universities. The results suggest that while research grants are generally associated with higher research outcomes, industry funding decreases the marginal utility of public/non-profit funding by lowering the increase in publication rate associated with public/non-profit grants. At the same time, for more commercially oriented research, measured as its patentability score, we find some support for complementarities between public and private-sector research funding. These results suggest that provision of public grants is crucial to the production of research that is distributed openly through publications and proceedings. Private sector grants are important as they may enable more applied research trajectories for those capable of combining publicly and industry sponsored research. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis is conducted in two stages. First, a non-parametric frontier analysis is implemented to estimate efficiency scores, including a measure of technological innovation based on patent stocks. Second, econometric methods are applied to analyse the role of policy stringency and policy design on efficiency. Our estimation sample covers thermal power plant sectors in 20 countries from 1990 to 2009. The results show that the stringency of environmental regulations is a significant determinant of productive efficiency with respect to pollutant emissions as well as fuel use. However, these effects turn negative once the level of stringency leaps over a certain threshold. In addition, the paper concludes that the positive effect of regulatory stringency can be diminished by a negative effect of regulatory differentiation with measures which vary in stringency across plant size and age having negative consequences, and these effects are increasing over time. Finally, it is found that integrated approaches to environmental innovation are more likely to bring about efficiency improvements than end-of-pipe technologies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We obtain a number of robust empirical results based on a variety of different econometric methods. The lowest volatility occurs during or shortly after the Great Moderation period. Volatility is reduced during that time for most of the countries; however, these reductions in volatility pale in comparison with stability gains achieved during two other periods. One of those periods is the Postwar Moderation, which began near the end of World War II for each country. Not only is the decline in volatility impressive, but also the volatility is typically at the lowest level up to that point in a sample or at least has fallen to a low not seen for decades. And those reductions in volatility are statistically significant, in contrast to the Great Moderation. A second fall in volatility that in nearly all cases exceeds that of the Great Moderation is for inflation during the 1920s. And this moderation in inflation during the 1920s is statistically significant in almost every case. Overall, these and a number of other notable changes in volatility are remarkably robust across countries, different data sources, and alternative econometric methodologies. For example, implementation of a broad-based fixed exchange rate system is typically associated with a substantial reduction in macroeconomic volatility. Another finding, obtained from structural vector autoregression models, is that the changes in volatility for each variable are primarily driven by a fundamentally different type of disturbance.

We suggest that if China and Germany (as major surplus countries) switch their present VAT systems from a destination principle to an origin principle, and the US (as the major deficit country) adopts a VAT on a destination principle VAT, jointly these actions can significantly reduce the three countries' joint imbalances and so contribute to global rebalancing. We use a numerical general equilibrium model with a monetary structure incorporating inside money to capture endogeneity of trade imbalances, and to also investigate the potential impacts of such initiatives. These confirm that VAT structures are not only good for global rebalancing but also the changes we consider are beneficial for welfare and revenue collection.

With the help of a macroeconomic model, we show that introducing a Golden rule and smoothing public investment expenditure would be welfare-improving, and mostly for countries where taxation rates and the productivity of public investment are highest, and for the most closed countries. It would also be the most beneficial for countries where the monetary transmission parameter, the propensity to consume, and the price elasticity of supply are weakest, whereas supply-side distortions are the strongest.","[Menguy, Severine] Univ Paris 05, Paris, France",Universite Paris Cite,"Menguy, S (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 05, Sorbonne Paris Cite, 12 Rue Ecole Med, F-75270 Paris, France.",severine.menguy@orange.fr,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,3,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Theory suggests that lower child care costs, through subsidized care or the provision of free or low-cost arrangements, would increase the use of ECE and parents' employment and work hours. This paper reviews the research literature examining the effects of child care costs and availability on parental employment. In general, research suggests that reduced out-of-pocket costs for ECE and increased availability of public ECE increases ECE attendance among young children, and has positive impacts on mothers' labor force participation and work hours. However, there is considerable heterogeneity in findings. Among U.S. studies that report the elasticity of employment to ECE price, estimates range from -0.025 to -1.1, with estimates clustering near 0.05-0.25. This indicates that a 10 % reduction in the price of child care would lead to a 0.25-11 % increase in maternal employment, likely near 0.5-2.5 %. In general, studies using more recent data or data from non-U.S. countries find smaller elasticities than those using U.S. data from the 1990s. These differences may be due to historical and cross-national differences in ECE attendance, labor force attachment, and educational attainment among mothers with young children, as well as heterogeneity in the methodological approaches and data used across studies. More research in the U.S. using contemporary data is needed, particularly given recent changes in U.S. ECE policy.","[Morrissey, Taryn W.] Amer Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Dept Publ Adm & Policy, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA",American University,"Morrissey, TW (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Dept Publ Adm & Policy, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",taryn.morrissey@american.edu,"Morrissey, Taryn/J-1960-2015","Morrissey, Taryn/0000-0002-2916-0820",Division of Human Services Policy in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE); U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,Division of Human Services Policy in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE); U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,"This literature review was supported by the Division of Human Services Policy in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE), in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

The nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag bounds testing approach is applied to examine the asymmetric cointegration between the variables. An asymmetric causality test is also employed to examine the causal association between the considered variables. The results indicate cointegration between the variables in the presence of asymmetries. The asymmetric causality results show that only negative shocks to energy consumption have impacts on economic growth. In the same vein, only negative shocks to financial development have impacts on economic growth. By contrast, symmetrically, capital formation causes economic growth. Finally, over the study period, a neutral effect exists between the labour force and economic growth in India. The implications of these results for growth polities in India are also discussed.

The substructure of a real overlapping-generations business cycle model is assumed to be underlined by the long-term character of firms' rational expectations. This model is combined with the workers' bell-shaped'' optimism-pessimism about a fractional-reserve-banking economy. An exogenous shock will be propagated through this workers' psychology. Policy-wise, the public sector is ignored and the only purpose of the monetary authority is to secure the efficiency of intergenerational income distribution in a business environment with zero full-employment general-equilibrium profit. Within this context, monetary policy is found to be in the spirit of the Old Chicago quantity theory in that monetary expansion is antirecessionary, and the increase of the reserve ratio is shown to be anti-inflationary.

Theoretical analysis is still not able to settle the question of why they found this design preferable to other alternatives. We approach this question in a new way, adopting an analytical paradigm we dub computational mechanism analysis. Specifically, we sample position auction games from a given distribution, encode them in a computationally efficient representation language, compute their Nash equilibria, and calculate economic quantities of interest. We considered seven widely studied valuation models from the literature and three position auction variants. We found that wGSP consistently showed the best ads of any position auction, measured both by social welfare and expected number of clicks. In contrast, we found that revenue was extremely variable across auction mechanisms and was highly sensitive to equilibrium selection, the preference model, and the valuation distribution.

Because of this fact it is not surprising that not only owners of the companies, but also another interested groups are focused on the prediction of the company's financial health. Purpose of the article: The first studies concerned with this issue are dating back to 1930 but from this time a hundreds of bankruptcy prediction models have been constructed all over the world. Some of them are known world-wide and some of them are known only on the national level. Many researchers share their opinion, that it is not appropriate to use foreign models in the domestic conditions non-critically, because they were constructed in the different conditions. One of the main problems are used variables. Methods: We mention three studies which were focused on the used variables in the bankruptcy prediction models. Our comparative study was concerning with 42 models constructed in the seven chosen transit economics with the aim to realize which variables are relevant and which could be reduce from the bankruptcy prediction models. We focused only on the used variables and abstracted from the used methodology, the date of their construction or the model's power of relevancy. Findings & Value added: The result of our comparative study is the identification of 20 variables, which were used in three or more prediction models, so we assume that these variables have the best prediction ability in the condition of transit economics and their application should be consider in the construction of new models.","[Zvarikova, Katarina; Spuchlakova, Erika] Univ Zilina, Zilina, Slovakia; [Sopkova, Gabriela] Univ Econ Bratislava, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Zilina; University of Economics Bratislava,"Spuchlakova, E (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",erika.spuchlakova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Zvarikova, Katarina/P-2328-2015; Kovalova, Erika/O-8625-2015","Zvarikova, Katarina/0000-0001-5278-9275; Kovalova, Erika/0000-0002-3635-4332",Slovak Research and Development Agency [APVV-14-0841],Slovak Research and Development Agency(Slovak Research and Development Agency),This research was financially supported by the Slovak Research and Development Agency - Grant NO.

We present an original model to investigate formally the distributional and welfare implications of FD. In contrast to the standard approach that compares the implications of full FD with that of centralization, we consider that the central government chooses the level of FD to maximize welfare in a heterogeneous country. Noncooperatively, local governments choose their tax collection effort to maximize local utility. We show that an increase in the tax rate leads optimal FD to increase so as to compensate for the welfare loss from decreasing optimal local tax effort. Hence, welfare and income distribution improve in FD at its intermediate, rather than extreme, levels. We coin this result as the decentralization-Laffer curve. As regional spillovers increase, FD is less desirable as it deteriorates welfare and income distribution. This finding provides a novel support for the decentralization theorem and contributes to the fiscal policy debate.","[Aslim, Erkmen Giray] Lehigh Univ, Dept Econ, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [Neyapti, Bilin] Bilkent Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey",Lehigh University; Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University,"Neyapti, B (通讯作者)，Bilkent Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.",era314@lehigh.edu; neyapti@bilkent.edu.tr,"Aslim, Erkmen/T-9458-2019; Neyapti, Bilin/AAE-5557-2020",,,,,,38,28,28,2,37,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Contrary to earlier research, we show that in a large part of our sample the natural gas price leads the price of crude oil with price spillover effects lasting up to two weeks. This result is robust to a battery of tests including out-of-sample forecasting exercises. However, after 2006, we detect little price dependencies between these two energy commodities. These findings arise due to a conjunction of both demand and supply-side shocks arising from both natural and economic events, including Hurricane Katrina, the Tohoku earthquake and the Global Financial Crisis, as well as infrastructure and technological improvements. The increased use of new technologies such as hydraulic tracking for the extraction of gas and oil in particular affected supply in the latter part of the study. We conclude that the long term relation present in the early part of the sample has decoupled, such that price determination of these two energy sources is now independent. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The results suggest that increases in the price of a country's exported commodities raise the country's risk of civil conflict and its duration. The effect on conflict risk is mainly driven by the price of point-source commodities, in line with the rapacity effect theory of conflict. Intense trading with contiguous countries is associated with lower duration of conflict, consistent with the idea that such trade reduces the incentive of these countries to fuel conflict in their neighbor. Trading with neighbors is also associated with a lower risk of conflict when such trade occurs under trade agreements. On the other hand, we find no support for the opportunity cost theory via exported and imported commodities, nor via the economic cycle in export markets. We also identify a number of conditions under which the changes in the value of exported commodities cease to matter for conflict probability.","[Cali, Massimiliano; Mulabdic, Alen] World Bank, Trade & Competitiveness Global Practice, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Calì, M (通讯作者)，World Bank, Trade & Competitiveness Global Practice, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",mcali@worldbank.org; amulabdic@worldbank.org,,"Mulabdic, Alen/0000-0002-2541-8847",,,,,62,7,7,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

As a source of exogenous variation in kinship placement, I use recent major reform of foster care state policies that prefer kin placement over other types of foster care settings. Using individual-level panel dataset, the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS), and employing differencein- differences identification strategy, I find that in the short-run children exposed to law benefit from higher stability of placement and shorter length of foster care episode, but do not experience significant changes in either mental or physical health. In the longer term, kinship foster homes are more efficient in terms of improving safety and providing permanent home through discharge from foster care with a relative.

The analysis covers 10 EU countries from Central and Eastern Europe over the years 2001-2012. The reallocation of labour across sectors was substantial during the boom, very extensive in 2009 at the depth of the crisis and modest in the subsequent recovery period. The contribution of sectoral change to aggregate productivity growth is computed using various decomposition methods. Changes in labour productivity within sectors play the dominant role for aggregate productivity growth, while reallocation of labour between sectors is less important. This pattern is found through most of the sample period despite large differences in the extent of sectoral change during the boom, crisis and recovery.","[Kuusk, Andres; Varblane, Uku] Univ Tartu, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Narva Mnt 4, EE-51009 Tartu, Estonia; [Staehr, Karsten] Tallinn Univ Technol, Dept Finance & Econ, Akad Tee 3-486, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia",University of Tartu; Tallinn University of Technology,"Staehr, K (通讯作者)，Tallinn Univ Technol, Dept Finance & Econ, Akad Tee 3-486, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia.",karsten.staehr@ttu.ee,"Staehr, Karsten/G-4707-2016; Varblane, Urmas/IAP-9851-2023; Varblane, Urmas/AAL-5484-2020","Staehr, Karsten/0000-0002-2128-6672; Varblane, Urmas/0000-0001-8811-1706",project Structural Change as the Factor of Productivity Growth in the Case of Catching up Economies'' [IUT20-49],project Structural Change as the Factor of Productivity Growth in the Case of Catching up Economies'',"The authors would like to thank, without implicating, two anonymous referees, the editor of Economic Change and Restructuring, Jaan Masso, Jaanika Merikull and Tairi Room for useful comments to earlier versions of the paper.

We incorporate time variation in the model parameters for the plain stochastic volatility model as well its extensions with: Leverage, volatility feedback effects and heavy tailed distributed innovations. With regards to estimation, we rely on one recently discovered result, namely, that when an unbiasedly simulated estimated likelihood (available for example through a particle filter) is used inside a Metropolis Hastings routine then the estimation error makes no difference to the equilibrium distribution of the algorithm, the posterior distribution. This in turn provides an off the shelf technique to estimate complex models. We examine the performance of this technique on simulated and crude oil returns from 1987 to 2016. We find that (i): There is clear evidence of time variation in the model parameters, (ii): Time varying parameter volatility models with leverage/Student's t-distributed innovations perform best, (iii): The timing of parameter changes align very well with events such as market turmoils and financial crises.","[Nonejad, Nima] Aalborg Univ, Dept Math Sci, Fredrik Bajers Vej 7G, DK-9220 Aalborg O, Denmark; [Nonejad, Nima] CREATES, Fredrik Bajers Vej 7G, DK-9220 Aalborg O, Denmark",Aalborg University; CREATES,"Nonejad, N (通讯作者)，Aalborg Univ, Dept Math Sci, Fredrik Bajers Vej 7G, DK-9220 Aalborg O, Denmark.;Nonejad, N (通讯作者)，CREATES, Fredrik Bajers Vej 7G, DK-9220 Aalborg O, Denmark.",nimanonejad@gmail.com,,,,,,,78,2,2,0,6,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Binding capacity mirrors the non-negativity constraint on storage and leads to negative price spiking and higher volatility when the market is in deep contango, i.e. low current prices at high stock levels. With bounded storage there is no need to restrict storage to be costly to ensure a rational expectations equilibrium. This allows the model to cover a wide range of storage technologies, including free and productive storage. We also provide an alternative expression for speculative prices that highlights the key role of the storage boundaries. The competitive equilibrium price is the sum of discounted future probability weighted boundary prices. The boundary prices can be viewed as dividends on commodities in storage reflecting the realization of economic profits from storage. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

First, the paper tries to understand the definition of competition and hence the type of competition policy that can be drawn from the modern so-called Neo-Schumpeterian literature. We will see that this literature is abundant and diversified. In spite of its variety, it has also common features regarding the theory of competition as well as competition policy. Secondly we will also emphasize the various aspects of Schumpeter's legacy that were or are under-estimated by his contemporary followers concerning the concept of competition. We will argue that these aspects are not negligible and that they may also influence the impact of Schumpeter's own contribution to the characterization but also the criticism of present developments that claim to build a conception of competition policy in line with Schumpeter's original message. Finally, and more generally, we will stress how Schumpeter's and Neo-Schumpeterian developments and preoccupations in the field of competition can help us to enlighten the present developments related to competition and industrial policies and to set up their limits.","[Arena, Richard] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, GREDEG, Univ Cote dAzur, Nice, France; [Arena, Richard] CNRS, Nice, France",Universite Cote d'Azur; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Arena, R (通讯作者)，Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, GREDEG, Univ Cote dAzur, Nice, France.;Arena, R (通讯作者)，CNRS, Nice, France.",arena@unice.fr,,,,,,,80,1,1,1,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

We find that the urbanization process stimulates the transition from farm to non-farm activities in rural areas. More specifically, urbanization tends to reduce farm income and increase wages and non-farm income in rural households. This suggests that total income and consumption expenditure of rural households are more likely to increase with urbanization.

Management accounting was introduced to it in the early 90-s of 20 century. First it was just an academic concept, later received some adoption in practice. The process of applying management accounting tools was accelerated by big foreign investments, joint ventures and formation of complex native business structures, by European integration and internationalization of education, knowledge and business practices. Management accounting tools were mostly intuitively used by the greater majority of companies in Bulgaria, being small or medium sized ones. Professionals who had to deal with the management accounting problems, to choose management accounting tools, to search for new ones or more adequate ones, had humble knowledge for them. Managers underestimated the role of management accounting and had no vivid interest in developing it on a company level. The hard transitional process and world economic crisis slowed down the application of management accounting tools. It led to the application of management accounting tools that are more operational than strategic, more traditional than newly introduced, closer to financial accounting and combined often in a contradictory way. That conclusion is confirmed by our survey of the application of management accounting in Bulgaria. It clearly defines the necessity of a broader education in management accounting not only of accountants, but of managers too.","[Atanassova, Anita] Univ Econ, Fac Finance, Varna, Bulgaria; [Atanassova, Anita] Univ Econ, Accounting Dept, Varna, Bulgaria",University of Economics Varna; University of Economics Varna,"Atanassova, A (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Varna, 9002 Blv 77,Kniaz Boris 1, Varna, Bulgaria.",aatanasova@ue-varna.bg,,,,,,,13,0,0,1,7,UNIV PALACKEHO V OLOMOUCI,OLOMOUC,"OLOMOUC 771 47, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-244-5233-3,,,,2017,,,,,,,22,28,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO0QL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000492966900002,0

While the optimal prize allocation in tournaments of symmetric agents is relatively well understood, little is known about the impact of the allocation of prizes on the effectiveness of tournament incentive schemes for heterogeneous agents. We show that while multiple prize allocation rules are equivalent when agents are symmetric in their ability, the equivalence is broken in the presence of heterogeneity. Under a wide range of conditions, loser-prize tournaments, that is, tournaments that award a low prize to relatively few bottom performers, are optimal for the firm. The reason is that low-ability agents are discouraged less in such tournaments, as compared to winner-prize tournaments awarding a high prize to few top performers, and hence can be compensated less to meet their participation constraints.

This paper also considers how much the leadership depends on individual differences of managers. It was found out that the culture from which the leader comes has impact on their style of leadership. Nowadays, the international and global companies have to create different kind of tactics. These tactics depend on the culture of the country where the company is placed. Many managers had not realised that when they moved to another country they should have changed their tactics in leadership. They thought that they could use the same tactic of leadership in different countries. But it was found out that the culture level values has the biggest effect on optimal leadership. Managers from international companies have to change their tactics according to the culture where they work, so they can become an effective leader.","[Bazantova, Ilona; Charvatova, Dagmar] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Law, Dept Econ, Nam Curieovych 901-7, Prague 11640 1, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Bazantová, I (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Law, Dept Econ, Nam Curieovych 901-7, Prague 11640 1, Czech Republic.",bazantov@prf.cuni.cz; charvdag@prf.cuni.cz,"Bazantova, Ilona/J-8827-2015",,,,,,14,0,0,1,9,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,79,86,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455325300009,0

In this article, we employ an automated text linguistic approach to create an indicator that measures the tone of the 1,618 speeches delivered by members of the Governing Council (GC) during the period 1999M1-2014M4. We then relate this variable to euro area and national macroeconomic forecasts. Our key findings are as follows. First, inflation and growth expectations have a positive and significant impact on the hawkishness of a speech. Second, different growth expectations across the euro area and different preferences significantly explain discrepancies across speakers. Third, the voiced preferences of presidents of the national central banks (NCBs) largely coincide with the level of independence their central banks had at the time of the Maastricht Treaty. However, in general, there are not much differences between members of the Executive Board and the NCB presidents. Fourth, we find some evidence that central bankers adjust the gist of their speeches depending on whether they talk at home or abroad and before or after a GC meeting. Finally, differences in central banker preferences are the key source of variation in their speeches before the financial crisis.","[Bennani, Hamza] Paris West Univ Nanterre La Def, Paris, France; [Neuenkirch, Matthias] Univ Trier, Dept Econ, D-54286 Trier, Germany",Universitat Trier,"Neuenkirch, M (通讯作者)，Univ Trier, Dept Econ, D-54286 Trier, Germany.",neuenkirch@uni-trier.de,"Bennani, Hamza/AAF-6997-2021; Bennani, Hamza/AAA-7967-2022","Bennani, Hamza/0000-0002-0042-8897; Bennani, Hamza/0000-0002-0042-8897; Neuenkirch, Matthias/0000-0002-7451-3613",,,,,44,33,34,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Effort levels at different times are strategic substitutes and, as a result, the unique equilibrium effort and wage paths are single-peaked with seniority. Moreover, for any wage profile, the agent works too little, too late. Commitment to wages by competing firms mitigates these inefficiencies.

We analyze motivational and contextual predictors of intentions to become an entrepreneur within a framework based on the theory of planned behavior, social identity theory, and self-categorization theory. Relying on survey data of scientists, our analysis finds that, among those scientists who indicate entrepreneurial intentions, a rather low, but non-negligible share shows entrepreneurial intentions based on a Schumpeterian attitude - i.e., acting against all odds - whereas the rest of the potential entrepreneurs seem to choose an entrepreneurial career in order to comply with the expectations of their social environment - they seem to follow the crowd.

Employer returns are typically involuntary and lead to lower earnings. To understand these features, the paper then develops an equilibrium model of worker recall and on-the-job search in which job seekers hold onto information they acquire about job opportunities as insurance in the event of a job destruction shock. Allowing workers to recall contacts increases the probability of a job-to-job transition with the number of jobs previously held during the employment spell while the probability of a job-to-unemployment transition decreases.

It constructs a large panel of countries for the period 1970-2014 to explore the long-run equilibrium relationship between military spending and economic growth, applies the more flexible pooled mean group estimator, and compares the results with the more restrictive dynamic fixed effect method used in earlier influential studies. It also compares results from different time and country samples.

We show that the presence of a retail sector with sticky prices is an important factor in this result. With respect to the dynamics of the model, we find that the pricing regime matters if the shock is to uncovered interest parity, while the model's behavior is similar when the shocks are to productivity. Because shocks to uncovered interest parity account for only a small fraction of volatility of aggregate variables (other than exchange rates and terms of trade), we conclude that differential effects under the two polar international pricing regimes may not be as extensive as standard analyses may suggest.

Traditionally used methods in this field are usually very time-consuming and it can take days or even weeks to obtain estimates of liability for an average-sized portfolio. In general insurance companies test the sensitivity of liability estimation with respect to the change of many assumptions. Reduction of computational time could improve the efficiency of the task of testing different assumptions because the estimations need to be fast and should reflect current market development. Furthermore, a fast calculation is a crucial condition for successful optimization of investment strategy and deeper analyses of liability sensitivity. A new approximating approach which reduces computational time and provides results with a tolerable difference from the results of the traditional methods is more than welcome in an actuary practice.

The overall objective is to verify whether more educated individuals are more likely to go to sports events than their less educated counterparts. If education socializes persons to focus on sports, it would then partially offset negative alternatives such as alcohol, drug abuse and unlawful behaviours, creating a positive externality. Sport events consumption is extensive, highlighting the potential economic importance of the sports-education externality. To establish the role of education in sport attendance, this article applies a probabilistic linear regression model to data from the UK. The econometric formulation associates sport event attendance in the left hand side with education in the right hand side, while controlling for the socioeconomic variables that are known to affect a consumer's decision to go to a sport event: gender, age, income, employment status, children, marital status, and geographical location, among others. These findings add to a somewhat limited literature on both the effect of education on sports attendance and secondarily, on the impact of other socioeconomic variables on attendance.","[Friedman-Soza, Antonio M.; Friedman, Jorge R.; Galvez-Silva, Tomas A.] USACH, Fac Adm & Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Yevenes, Carlos F.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Universidad de Santiago de Chile; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Friedman-Soza, AM (通讯作者)，USACH, Fac Adm & Econ, Santiago, Chile.",antonio.friedman@usach.cl,"friedman, jorge/ABC-4538-2021; Galvez-Silva, Tomas/AAB-1017-2021","friedman, jorge/0000-0002-3262-1296; Galvez-Silva, Tomas/0000-0001-9898-2724","VRIDEI of the Universidad de Santiago de Chile (USACH), DICYT [031762FR]","VRIDEI of the Universidad de Santiago de Chile (USACH), DICYT","This research was supported by the VRIDEI of the Universidad de Santiago de Chile (USACH), DICYT project 031762FR.",,33,3,4,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In addition, for the first time, these relations were analyzed among different retail formats. By using POS estimation method, shelf based out-of-stock rates were measured for 80 different FMCG products in 97 retail stores. For analyzing the impact of employee density on the average shelf based OOS rate in modern and traditional retail formats, curvilinear hierarchical regression and moderation analyses were used. The results showed that the relation between employee density and shelf based out-of-sock varied among different formats. While it was not significant in convenience stores, in modern formats it was quadratic (stores with too many or too few employees per square meter were related to higher levels of shelf based OOS). The obtained results suggest that store managers should be aware of the effects of employee organization on product availability. The attention was also dedicated to potential problems and managerial implications concerning the employees' number in retail stores, regarding traditional and modern trading formats.","[Grubor, Aleksandar] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ Subotica, Educ, Segedinski Put 9-11, Subotica 24000, Serbia; [Milicevic, Nikola; Djokic, Nenad; Berber, Nemanja] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ Subotica, Segedinski Put 9-11, Subotica 24000, Serbia",University of Novi Sad; University of Novi Sad,"Grubor, A (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ Subotica, Educ, Segedinski Put 9-11, Subotica 24000, Serbia.",agrubor@ef.uns.ac.rs; milicevic.nikola@ef.uns.ac.rs; djokicn@ef.uns.ac.rs; berber@ef.uns.ac.rs,"Berber, Nemanja/JFS-1642-2023; Berber, Nemanja/C-8235-2018; Milicevic, Nikola/JSK-6433-2023; Djokic, Nenad/HIK-2985-2022; Grubor, Aleksandar/AAM-4219-2020","Berber, Nemanja/0000-0002-1433-6416; Milicevic, Nikola/0000-0003-4834-6994; Djokic, Nenad/0000-0001-8229-8354; Grubor, Aleksandar/0000-0001-9798-0401",,,,,49,0,0,0,7,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We are the first to test the implications of this theory for over-and undereducation by means of direct information about promotions to managerial positions. Using German administrative data entailing an employer-reported - and hence objective - measure of educational requirements, we show that overeducated workers are indeed more likely to be promoted and that this career mobility advantage is more pronounced in the early stages of their working lives. By contrast, undereducated workers are less likely to be promoted to managerial positions. Moreover, in terms of wage growth, while overeducated workers benefit more, undereducated workers benefit less from promotions than their well-matched educational peers. Altogether, these findings strongly support the career mobility theory. Furthermore, by differentiating between internal and external promotions, we provide evidence that promotions are more likely for overeducated workers within the establishment, whereas the opposite applies for undereducated workers. This finding indicates the relevance of both over-and undereducation as signals of true ability to other employers.","[Grunau, Philipp] Inst Employment Res IAB, Nurnberg, Germany; [Pecoraro, Marco] Univ Neuchatel, Swiss Forum Migrat & Populat Studies SFM, Neuchatel, Switzerland",University of Neuchatel,"Grunau, P (通讯作者)，Inst Employment Res IAB, Dept Estab & Employment D1, Regensburger Str 100, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany.",philipp.grunau@iab.de,"Pecoraro, Marco/AAO-7843-2020","Pecoraro, Marco/0000-0002-6243-6112; Grunau, Philipp/0000-0003-3761-3495",NCCR - On the Move [SNSF grant] [51NF40-142020],NCCR - On the Move [SNSF grant],This work was supported in part by the NCCR - On the Move [SNSF grant number 51NF40-142020].,,47,9,10,4,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Using non-parametric kernel methods, we find that most traditional schooling inputs are irrelevant in determining test scores (even in a very general setting). Property tax caps are the only relevant factor that is related to districts' financial constraints and have predominantly negative associations with test scores. Therefore, insufficient resources may be partially responsible for the lack of growth in test scores. For most other relevant inputs, we find substantial heterogeneity in the returns, which helps reconcile some of the puzzling results in the literature.

It is one of the main criteria for countries to be superior, to remain competitive, and to produce high technology products. Countries allocate different types of incentives to encourage innovation activities in their countries. Innovation is also one of the strategic issues for the European Union (EU). The aim of this study is to compare the innovation performance of four EU candidate countries, Macedonia (FYR), Iceland, Serbia and Turkey. The entropy-based Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) approach is proposed in this paper. First, the importance of each variable is computed by the entropy method to reflect on the differences among the variables in the calculation process. Subsequently, the TOPSIS method is performed by using the value and importance of variables for prioritisation of the candidate countries with respect to their innovation performance. Four case studies are conducted to show the viability of the proposed approach. Each cases study uses different reports, namely The Global Competitiveness Index, Innovation Union Scoreboard, Knowledge Assessment Methodology (KAM) and Global Innovation Index. The results of this study show that the proposed approach provides the same ranking as Innovation Union Scoreboard and KAM.","[Kaynak, Selahattin] Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Dept Econ, Samsun, Turkey; [Altuntas, Serkan] Yildiz Tech Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Istanbul, Turkey; [Dereli, Turkay] Iskenderun Tech Univ, Off President, Iskenderun, Turkey; [Dereli, Turkay] Gaziantep Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Gaziantep, Turkey",Ondokuz Mayis University; Yildiz Technical University; Iskenderun Technical University; Gaziantep University,"Altuntas, S (通讯作者)，Yildiz Tech Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Istanbul, Turkey.",serkan@yildiz.edu.tr,"Altuntas, Serkan/ABA-3083-2020; Kaynak, Selahattin/AAH-6408-2021; Dereli, Turkay/ABH-6430-2020; Dereli, Turkay/AAG-5801-2020","Altuntas, Serkan/0000-0003-4383-4710; Dereli, Turkay/0000-0002-2130-5503; Dereli, Turkay/0000-0002-2130-5503",,,,,72,41,41,1,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

This article estimates the joint impact of seven categories of capital on three dimensions of performance, using a seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR) method and panel data from MFIs in Eastern Europe and Central Asia during the period 2005-2009. The results suggest that performance is influenced by the preferences of the stakeholders who provide the capital. Grants are associated with a better depth of outreach. Concessional loans are useful in improving outreach without affecting financial results. Loans from social investors are related to a lower return on assets but also an improvement in outreach to lower-income clientele. The evidence regarding the influence of savings on financial performance is less clear, but the results are interpreted to mean that savings should be encouraged to serve the needs of the poor as well as to lower the cost of capital.","[Khachatryan, Knar; Grigoryan, Aleksandr] Amer Univ Armenia, Manoogian Simone Coll Business & Econ, 40 Ave Baghramyan, Yerevan 0019, Armenia; [Hartarska, Valentina] Auburn Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Hartarska, Valentina] Auburn Univ, Dept Finance, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University; Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Khachatryan, K (通讯作者)，Amer Univ Armenia, Manoogian Simone Coll Business & Econ, 40 Ave Baghramyan, Yerevan 0019, Armenia.",kkhachatryan@aua.am,,"Grigoryan, Aleksandr/0000-0003-0233-8972; Khachatryan, Knar/0000-0003-0910-9224",,,,,53,25,26,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

To perform this analysis, I construct a measure of prejudicial attitudes using responses from the General Social Survey and estimate the relationship between self-employment and this index using the American Community Survey. I find that an amount of prejudice equal to the difference in least and most prejudiced census divisions increases the black-white self-employment rate gap in high start-up cost industries by 10.4-16.8%, depending upon whether parental self-employment is controlled for, and represents the entire impact of racial prejudice on the black-white selfemployment rate gap. Additionally, racial prejudice widens the black-white self-employment income gap by between 6.4% and 8.2% in my full specification, dependent upon how income is measured. Evidence indicates that racial prejudice is causing blacks difficulty in financing their businesses.

However, these vary between the genders and across sports. Specifically, the results suggest that team sports contribute most to employability, but that this varies by age across genders and that outdoor activities contribute most towards higher incomes.","[Lechner, Michael] Univ St Gallen, Swiss Inst Empir Econ Res SEW, Varnbulestr 14, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland; [Downward, Paul] Univ Loughborough, Sch Sport Exercise & Hlth Sci, Loughborough, Leics, England",University of St Gallen; Loughborough University,"Lechner, M (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, Swiss Inst Empir Econ Res SEW, Varnbulestr 14, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland.",Michael.Lechner@unisg.ch,"PATTANAYAK, MANORANJAN/N-7858-2017",,,,,,69,28,30,4,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Such an idea is at the root of both the endogenous growth theory and the Kaldorian approach. While in Kaldor's view, a country's growth is demand-driven, in the endogenous growth theory, growth is determined by the growth of the factors of production and hence growth is supply-constrained. This article empirically tests both assumptions for Verdoorn's law by using a dynamic panel of manufacturing industries for seventy countries at different stages of development for the years between 1963 and 2009. In order to distinguish between these approaches, two different specifications are estimated where the growth of output and the supply of factors of production are instrumentalized by system generalized method of moments (GMM) estimators. The results show that, if it is assumed that the growth rates of countries are demand-driven, a faster growth of output increases productivity growth due to the existence of increasing returns. Alternatively, if it is assumed that output growth is driven by the growth of the supply of the factors of production, it is not possible to conclude that productivity growth is induced by output growth.","[Magacho, Guilherme R.] Univ Cambridge, Land Econ, Cambridge, England; [McCombie, John S.

Our derivation shows that the direct effect of the labour share on output is ambiguous. Furthermore, theory suggests that the expected labour share negatively affects output. Empirically, we find that the labour share plays a significant role in driving output dynamics. However contrary to theoretical expectation, the expected labour share positively affects output in some cases, a finding we call the 'abour share puzzle'. We also find that over time, there seems to be a general shift in aggregate demand dynamics towards being profit-led, i.e. rising labour share decreases output. We conclude that policymakers should not ignore the labour share in their decisions.","[Malikane, Christopher] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Sci, Macrofinancial Anal Grp, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Malikane, C (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Sci, Macrofinancial Anal Grp, Johannesburg, South Africa.",christopher.malikane@wits.ac.za,,"malikane, christopher/0000-0001-7757-3331",,,,,34,2,2,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Firms have a common discount factor unknown to consumers and a common cost i.i.d. over time. Consumers observe prices over time and update their expectations about firms' ability to collude, which affects consumers' price expectations. Reference-dependent preferences make consumers lose utility when the actual price is higher than the expected one, which forces colluding firms to raise prices alongside consumers' price expectations. This increasing price path is capped by the price arising when consumers are sure that firms collude. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Our analysis was conducted for real gross wages during the past 11 years, between 2005 - 2015. For our research, we used the Czech Statistical Office's data showing the trend in the number of ICT Professionals divided into ICT Specialists and ICT Technicians. To analyze the wages of ICT Professionals, we also used data from a sample survey that Trexima, s.r.o. conducts for the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs on a yearly basis. Our analysis shows considerably higher wages in the Prague region, which are higher by more than 20% as compared to the average of the Czech Republic.

Since then, studies seek empirical evidences about the effects of monetary policy communication over agent's expectations. The recent literature on central bank communication draws attention to the importance of clarity of central bank communication. However, researches on this theme are still scarce, and there are few empirical studies with conclusive findings. Our study seeks empirical evidences on the relation between clarity of central bank communication and credibility of monetary policy. Estimates through different methods aim to identify whether clarity of central bank communication improves credibility. The study is the first to provide empirical evidence that a clearer communication can improve credibility. We also consider the differences between the two governors who ruled the Central Bank of Brazil in the period under analysis. The results indicate that a clear communication can improve credibility, but it depends on the commitment of the central banker with the goal of inflation control. Furthermore, estimates based on quantile regression indicate that the benefit brought by the clarity to the credibility depends on the commitment of the monetary authority with the goal guiding inflation expectations.","[Montes, G.

We hypothesize that a greater foreign-investor presence in a real estate market results in a lower capitalization rate and examine whether this holds true in the Helsinki CBD office market in Finland. This market provides an interesting case study by being part of a small open economy, in which the presence of foreign investors has substantially varied over time. The Dynamic OLS estimations using data for the period 1990-2015 provide support for the hypothesis. The baseline results show a highly statistically significant negative impact of foreign-investor participation on the capitalization rate, the point estimates indicating that a 10% point growth in the share of foreign buyers of the total transaction volume decreases the cap rate by approximately 30 basis points.","[Oikarinen, Elias] Univ Turku, Dept Econ, Sch Econ, Turku, Finland; [Falkenbach, Heidi] Aalto Univ, Dept Built Environm, Espoo, Finland",University of Turku; Aalto University,"Oikarinen, E (通讯作者)，Univ Turku, Dept Econ, Sch Econ, Turku, Finland.",elias.oikarinen@utu.fi,"; Falkenbach, Heidi/E-6066-2012","Oikarinen, Elias/0000-0003-4988-9130; Falkenbach, Heidi/0000-0002-8644-538X",Academy of Finland [268310]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [268310] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA),Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); Academy of Finland (AKA)(Research Council of Finland),We are grateful to two anonymous referees for many helpful comments and for Catella Property Ltd. and KTI Finland for providing us with data.

This article deals with synchronized distribution during time periods. It is based on optimization using classical capacitated vehicle routing problem while providing different customers' demands among time periods. The goal is, except the minimization of the total distance, to achieve the stability of solution among the time periods, which contributes to simplification of transportation planning. Although using of the presented model can lead to a partial increase of distribution cost, on the other hand it ensures more transparent routes and eliminates the need for daily optimization. Therefore it brings a positive effect for distributors, drivers and customers that may result in greater economic benefits than the benefit from the optimization on a daily basis.","[Pekar, Juraj; Brezina, Ivan; Cickova, Zuzana] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Econ Informat, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235 5, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Pekár, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Econ Informat, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235 5, Slovakia.",pekar@euba.sk; brezina@euba.sk; cickova@euba.sk,,"Cickova, Zuzana/0000-0002-6045-6654",Grant Agency of Slovak Republic - VEGA [1/0245/15],Grant Agency of Slovak Republic - VEGA(Grant Agency of the Czech RepublicVedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),"This paper is supported by the Grant Agency of Slovak Republic - VEGA, grant No. 1/0245/15 Transportation planning focused on greenhouse gases emission reduction.",,14,4,4,0,7,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

Earlier research suggested that output distribution can be approximated by Zipf's law. We find that the top institutions produce more than predicted. This is suggested to be related to scale economies, as greater numbers of top performing staff generate significant externalities in output.

The first finding results primarily from a smaller effect of children's ability on status, the second from an increased correlation between parental status and educational attainment.

We isolate the effects on quality of education due to the type of regime of provision of public goods from those due to mobility restrictions. Our results suggest that average quality of education might be higher in a decentralized regime compared to a centralized provision, under the assumption of student mobility restrictions, since decentralized provision would allow all students with high academic performance to access higher education. In case that public expenditure in higher education by regional governments was larger to that of a central government, the previous result would be reinforced. However, this comparison is undetermined as far as the central government decided to provide higher education in each region, which would occur if fixed costs were small and if the impact on quality of education of those students that would then have access to higher education was large.","[Rossello-Villalonga, Joan] Univ Illes Balears, Palma De Mallorca, Spain",Universitat de les Illes Balears,"Rosselló-Villalonga, J (通讯作者)，Univ Illes Balears, Palma De Mallorca, Spain.",,,"Joan, Rossello/0000-0002-1933-6191",,,,,45,2,2,3,15,INST ESTUDIOS FISCALES,MADRID,"AVDA CARDENAL HERRERA ORIA, 378, MADRID, 28035, SPAIN",0210-1173,2386-4176,,HACIENDA PUBLICA ESP,Hacienda Publica Esp.,,2017,,220,,,,,13,55,,10.7866/HPE-RPE.17.1.1,0.0,,,43,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FQ0CG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418016900001,0

In this study, I explore the personality-related heterogeneity - measured by differences in control beliefs - in the labor-supply response to health shocks. To identify such behavioral differences, I follow the labor-supply trajectories of 649 initially full-time employed and healthy men who experience at some point in time an episode of ill health. When compared with men who have positive control beliefs, men with negative control beliefs are on average 100% more likely to drop out of the labor force - a drop out unrelated to early retirement - and work on average 12% less hours per week the year after the health shock. These behavioral differences remain robust to alternative estimation samples and health-shock definitions. They are strongest for men from low socioeconomic backgrounds, who do not have access to private health insurance, or who experience high intensity shocks. Heterogeneous labor supply responses are also observed for conscientiousness and risk tolerance, traits that have been linked with willingness to invest and treatment compliance. An important conclusion from the findings is that a small set of non-cognitive skills produces long term labor-market benefits in the advent of adversity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Commons, among other original institutional economists, argued for the interests of the common people against the power of vested interests in politics and business. Against this backdrop, a new book by Thomas C. Leonard contends that, in fact, these same economists were actually illiberal and only promoted the interests of certain groups, such as Anglo-Saxon men, and were against the progression of minority populations, women, or the disabled. But Leonard's argument that these economists were illiberal, and that their entire reform program related to the role of government in the economy and the creation of the administrative state, is essentially defunct. As Leonard (2016, xiv) writes in the prologue, expertise in the service of the administrative state, what progressives call social control, has survived the discredited notions once used to uphold it. We respond to Leonard's book by offering a direct critique of the arguments he makes.

Despite many government attempts to weaken private retirement pension savings and strengthen the public ongoing pension system, expected goals were not met, which was why the National Assembly of the Slovak Republic undertook to weaken retirement pension savings using a set of measures that include changes of the percentage rate of levy, as well as making the entry into the so-called second pillar voluntary. Since the introduction of voluntary entry into the second pillar, only 30% of those entering the labor market joined the second pillar. The low share of entrants increases current income of the pension system at the expense of future expenses. In the long run, this will cause increased deficits in the ongoing pension system, as well as lower future retirement pensions. If more people joined the second pillar, it would have meant a higher deficit of the first pillar in 2080 due to a larger income gap.

That is especially connected with tax conditions. The value of default receivables could be adjusted for tax purposes. There has occurred a change in the legal framework in recent years and therefore the discussion is focused on these consequences. The issue of default receivables is also influenced on the way of enforcement (individual or collective). The way of enforcement has an impact on recovery rates gained by creditors at the end and also on possibilities of the value accounting adjustment.

Among the explanatory forces recent improvements in the information and communication technology play a dominant role. The reason is that those improvements facilitate certain forms of cooperation among agents which changes the division of the economic surplus. Methods: In order to study how different forms of cooperation affect inequality, I develop a model of cooperation among heterogeneously talented agents allowing for two types of cooperation: Between-task cooperation and within-task cooperation. The former reflects the assignment of different agents to different tasks. The latter represents the reassignment of tasks in case of non-compliance of some agent. The costs of this form of cooperation decreased substantially due to the spread of internet, e-mail, cellular phones, and wireless technology. The equilibrium allocation is characterized, particularly the equilibrium sorting of agents into cooperations and the matching between agents. Results: Cooperation leads to increasing inequality at the top and decreasing inequality at the bottom of the talent distribution in comparison to a hypothetical situation without any division of labor. Additionally, within-task cooperation is shown to be more inequality-enhancing than between-task cooperation. Thus, the model is able to generate the recent spike in income inequality due to the ICT revolution in recent years. Moreover, the model implies a positive correlation between higher moments of the talent distribution and the skill premium which is consistent with the empirical evidence and sheds some light on potential evolutions in inequality due to changes in the distribution of task difficulty over time. Conclusions: Recent improvements in the information and communication technology is likely to cause new spikes in inequality. The society has to be aware of those tendencies to fight poverty and the exclusion of large parts of the society when it comes to economic development.","[Strauss, David] CIDE, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C.

The results suggest that those firms that offshore their innovative activities tend to be more productive than domestic firms, exporters, and other multinational corporations. This finding implies that firms with superior productivity are more likely to exploit the global task distribution in innovative activities, which may provide an explanation for why such low participation is observed in the data.","[Tabrizy, Saleh S.] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Econ, 308 Cate Ctr Dr,CCD1,325, Norman, OK 73019 USA",University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman,"Tabrizy, SS (通讯作者)，Univ Oklahoma, Dept Econ, 308 Cate Ctr Dr,CCD1,325, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",tabrizy@ou.edu,"Tabrizy, Saleh S./AAD-5409-2020","Tabrizy, Saleh S./0000-0003-2537-8686",Bruegel Institute,Bruegel Institute,"I am grateful to Rebecca Neumann for her supervision.

The model predicts the developments of real activity based on monthly indicators, such as sales, employment, employers' health care contributions, export and foreign surveys. The forecast accuracy of the model prevails over naive models that ignore monthly data. This result holds especially on the shortest horizon of one quarter ahead and on the evaluation period including the crisis of 2008-2009. Thus we may conclude that our small DFM is a valuable indicator of business cycle turning points in Slovakia. Further, the model allows for frequent and automatic updates of the GDP forecast each time new monthly data becomes available. This makes it useful for institutions which monitor the developments of monthly indicators of real activity.","[Toth, Peter] Natl Bank Slovakia, Res Dept, Imricha Karvasa 1, Bratislava 81325, Slovakia",National Bank of Slovakia,"Tóth, P (通讯作者)，Natl Bank Slovakia, Res Dept, Imricha Karvasa 1, Bratislava 81325, Slovakia.",peter.toth@nbs.sk,,"Toth, Peter/0000-0002-2087-5037",,,,,61,0,0,0,7,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

Here better-quality' means more educated and older/more experienced workforces; and also better-quality capital proxied by its ICT content. Economic theory predicts that these trends should raise TFP. To assess these predictions, we use EU-KLEMS data, with information on the age/education mix of the workforce, as well as the importance on ICT in total capital, for 34 industries within 16 OECD countries, between 1970 and 2005. We generalize the Hellerstein-Neumark labour-quality index method to simultaneously capture workers' age/experience or education contribution to TFP growth, alongside that of ICT. The conclusion of the article is that the quality of inputs matters for TFP. We find robust microeconometric evidence that better-educated and older/more experienced workers are more productive than their less-educated and younger/less-experienced peers. Also, ICT capital turns out to be more productive than other forms of capital. And when used in a growth accounting exercise covering the 1995-2005 period, these estimates suggest that up to 40% of the recorded TFP growth could be ascribed to the rising quality of inputs.","[Vandenberghe, V.] Univ Catholique Louvain UCL, Dept Econ, Econ Sch Louvain ESL, IRES, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium",,"Vandenberghe, V (通讯作者)，Univ Catholique Louvain UCL, Dept Econ, Econ Sch Louvain ESL, IRES, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.",vincent.vandenberghe@uclouvain.be,"Vandenberghe, V./L-9544-2013","Vandenberghe, V./0000-0002-1645-1127",,,,,25,10,12,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Following the philosophy of well-established hybrid linear and nonlinear modeling framework, Holt(I) and MSVR are committed to capture the linear and nonlinear patterns hidden in ITS, respectively. Different from the previous studies considering to model the highs and lows of intervals separately, the proposed hybrid method (termed as Holt(I)-MSVR) is used to model and forecast the daily highs and lows of ITS simultaneously, taking into account the possible interrelations between the bounds. Three ITS datasets extracted from finance market and energy market are used to compare the prediction performance of the Holt(I)-MSVR with five selected competitors. The experimental results are judged on the basis of statistical criteria, i.e., the goodness of forecast measure and the accuracy compared to competing forecasts test, and economic criteria, i.e., the returns obtained from a simple trading strategy based on the interval forecasts. The results obtained suggest that the proposed Holt(I)-MSVR is a promising alternative for ITS forecasting. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This article examines the effect of regional industrial land price distortions on the overinvestment of Chinese manufacturing enterprises. Chinese industrial enterprises data and land price monitoring data of 49 major cities in China between 1998 and 2007 are employed. This article has found that industrial land price distortions will significantly stimulate the overinvestment of manufacturing enterprises. Such a promoting effect varies among manufacturing enterprises of different ownership and industry attributes. Industrial land price distortions have the most significant promoting effect on the overinvestment of foreign-invested firms, followed by private firms, while state-owned enterprises are the least affected. Compared with private heavy-industry firms, industrial land price distortions have a more significant effect on the overinvestment of private light-industry firms. Compared with foreign-invested heavy-industry firms, industrial land price distortions have a more significant effect on the overinvestment of foreign-invested light-industry firms. This study represents a positive exploration and supplement to the existing studies on the effects of subsidy competition on corporate investment behaviours and the studies on Chinese-style subsidy competition.","[Xu, Zhen; Huang, Jianbai] Cent S Univ, Business Sch, Main Campus,932 South Lushan Rd, Changsha 410083, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Xu, Zhen; Huang, Jianbai] Cent S Univ, Strateg Res Inst Met Resources, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Feitao] Chinese Acad Social Sci CASS, Inst Ind Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Central South University; Central South University; Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Huang, JB (通讯作者)，Cent S Univ, Business Sch, Main Campus,932 South Lushan Rd, Changsha 410083, Hunan, Peoples R China.",jbhuang@csu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71633006],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the Key Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71633006].,,86,26,26,13,63,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The results show that the Shanghai A-share stock index has significant negative autocorrelations in the lower regime and has significant positive autocorrelations in the higher regime. It attributes that Chinese investors overreact and underreact in two different states. These results are similar when we employ individual stocks. Besides, we investigate stock return autocorrelations by different stock characteristics, including liquidity, volatility, market to book ratio and investor sentiment. The results show autocorrelations are significantly large in the middle and higher regimes of market to book ratio and volatility. Psychological biases can result into return autocorrelations by using investor sentiment proxy since autocorrelations are significantly larger in the middle and higher regime of investor sentiment.

The SDM is for prescribing methods of evaluating and selecting the most favourite plan (a system) from a group of feasible ones concerning influences of time-varying criteria system under dynamic external environment. Through detailed analysis, we separate a SDM problem into multi-period MCDM sub-problems, and then a plan can be a combination of time sequential strategies in which each strategy (a subset of actions) is a feasible decision choice of corresponding MCDM sub-problem. After clarifying variety of interdependences, interactions and interrelationships in the SDM problems, such as criteria-interdependences, action-interdependences, interactions between criteria and criteria system, interactions between actions and strategies, interactions between strategies and plans, interactions between internal environment (criteria system) and external environment, feedbacks from external environment to the corresponding MCDM sub-problems, and interrelationships among MCDM sub-problems and so on, we transform the SDM into multi-period interrelated MCDM model which can be dealt with more easily by using multiple optimization models.

Using panel data for 136 countries from 2001 to 2010, we estimate the effect of trade liberalization under RTAs and the effect of environmental regulations under RTAs with environmental provisions. Moreover, paired countries are used to examine the effect of RTAs with environmental provisions on the convergence of PM2.5 concentrations. Human behaviours and natural characteristics are added as control variables, and the potential endogeneity and environmental provisions of RTAs as well as the gross domestic product and openness of specific regions are addressed using instrumental variables or difference-in-differences after propensity score matching. The main results indicate that RTAs without environmental provision terms lead to worse air quality in terms of PM2.5 concentrations, whereas RTAs with environmental provision terms are likely to be associated with a lower level of PM2.5 concentrations. In addition, RTAs with environmental provisions, especially environmental cooperation provisions, facilitate the convergence of PM2.5 concentrations between contracting countries, which can be explained by the late-mover advantage after distinguishing North-South, South-South and North-North trade forms.","[Zhou, Li; Tian, Xi; Zhou, Zhengyi] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Room 5012,Yifu Bldg, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing Agricultural University,"Tian, X (通讯作者)，Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Room 5012,Yifu Bldg, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",tian@njau.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71403126]; Key Project of the National Social Science Fund of China [14ZDA037]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Nanjing Agricultural University [SKCX2016001]; Project of Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD); China Center for Food Security Studies, Nanjing Agricultural University in China","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Project of the National Social Science Fund of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Nanjing Agricultural University; Project of Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD); China Center for Food Security Studies, Nanjing Agricultural University in China","This research was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China: [Grant Number 71403126]; Key Project of the National Social Science Fund of China: [Grant Number 14ZDA037]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Nanjing Agricultural University: [Grant Number SKCX2016001]; Project of Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD), as well as China Center for Food Security Studies, Nanjing Agricultural University in China.",,26,15,17,6,50,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The research problem is connected to the scientific valorization of the importance and prospects of the management teams through research of their effects and the creation of more effective models. The functioning of the management teams is determined according to subjective perspectives of managers, effective communication quality, and problem solving and conflict resolution. This paper seeks to identify and analyze the success factors of management teams in both public and private sector organizations. The main goal is determining ways to overcome and resolve conflict situations, degree of cooperation and openness in communication, leadership styles in relation with management tools and innovative solutions in business. The results show that most of the respondents think that well-functioning management teams represent a significant business potential of an organization, supporting the basic hypothesis. Also, the results of the study indicate several problems in the functioning of management teams related to behavioral aspects of the investigation. This study, both in social and economic terms, reflects the projected potentials for the region's future development, based on the part of the reality, which is statistically the best representative of certain aspects of our past and present.","[Zubanovl, Violeta] Univ EDUCONS, Radnicka 30a, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia; [Katic, Ivana; Grubic-Nesic, Leposava] Univ Novi Sad, Trg Dositeja Obradovica 6, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia; [Berber, Nemanja] Univ Novi Sad, Segedinski Put 9-11, Subotica 24000, Serbia",University of Novi Sad; University of Novi Sad,"Zubanovl, V (通讯作者)，Univ EDUCONS, Radnicka 30a, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia.",violeta.zubanov@tims.edu.rs; ivana.katic@uns.ac.rs; nesle@uns.ac.rs; berber@efuns.ac.rs,"Berber, Nemanja/C-8235-2018; Berber, Nemanja/JFS-1642-2023","Berber, Nemanja/0000-0002-1433-6416; Grubic-Nesic, Leposava/0000-0001-7112-0948; Zubanov, Violeta/0000-0002-7554-8308",,,,,39,2,7,0,11,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Numerous studies indicate that there is a dependency between these parameters at various construction markets. The paper shows the results of a research conducted on a group of 40 projects related to water supply systems carried out in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina from 2001 to 2012. Collected data, obtained through interviewing chief engineers of construction companies, have been used as input parameters for implementation of single linear regression by applying the BTC (Bromilow time-cost) algorithm. The final result is a model in the form of an exponential equation. Whereas it was obtained based on effectuated values, it can be considered appropriate for assessing and testing the construction time in the early planning stage, as well as at work contracting. Since the parameter values in the model depend on circumstances of the specific area under consideration, the application of the model is recommended primarily in the area where the research was conducted. Results of the price overrun and construction overrun interdependence have not resulted in determining the exponential model. The paper also proposes application recommendations and guidelines for further research.","[Zujo, Vahida; Cecez, Marko] Dzemal Bijed Univ Mostar, Fac Civil Engn, USRC Mithad Hujdur Hujka, Mostar, Bosnia & Herceg; [Car-Pusic, Diana] Univ Rijeka, Fac Civil Engn, Radmile Matejcic 3, Rijeka, Croatia; [Zileska-Pancovska, Valentina] Univ Ss Cyril & Methodius, Fac Civil Engn, Bld Partizanski Odredi 24, Skopje 1000, Fyr, Macedonia",University of Mostar; University of Rijeka; Saints Cyril & Methodius University of Skopje,"Cecez, M (通讯作者)，Dzemal Bijed Univ Mostar, Fac Civil Engn, USRC Mithad Hujdur Hujka, Mostar, Bosnia & Herceg.",marko.cecez@unmo.ba,"Cecez, Marko/HPG-3287-2023; Ćećez, Marko/AAK-6502-2021; Car-Pušić, Diana/S-3374-2019","Cecez, Marko/0000-0002-5938-2985; Ćećez, Marko/0000-0002-5938-2985; Car-Pušić, Diana/0000-0003-2555-335X",,,,,42,10,10,0,6,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

The model is calibrated for a stylized middle-income economy in Latin America and used to perform a range of experiments, including both individual labor market reforms (cuts in the minimum wage and unemployment benefit rates) and composite reform programs involving additional measures. The results show that individual reforms may generate conflicting effects on growth and welfare in the long run, even in the presence of positive policy externalities. A reduction in training costs may also create an oversupply of qualified labor and higher unemployment in the long run.

Agents receive a private signal and an endogenous public signal, which is a noisy aggregate of individual actions, and causes an information externality. Agents in equilibrium underweight private information for a larger payoff parameter region in relation to when public information is exogenous. In addition, the socially optimal endogenous degree of coordination is lower than the socially optimal exogenous degree of coordination. The welfare effect of increasing the precision of the noise in the public signal has the same sign with endogenous or exogenous public information, but its magnitude differs. The social value of private information may be overturned in relation to when public information is exogenous: from positive to negative if agents in equilibrium coordinate more than is implied by the socially optimal exogenous degree of coordination, and the opposite if they coordinate less.","[Bayona, Anna] Univ Ramon Llull, ESADE Business Sch, Av Pedralbes 60-62, Barcelona 08034, Spain",Universitat Ramon Llull; Escuela Superior de Administracion y Direccion de Empresas (ESADE),"Bayona, A (通讯作者)，Univ Ramon Llull, ESADE Business Sch, Av Pedralbes 60-62, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",anna.bayona@esade.edu,"Bayona, Anna/ABF-5095-2021","Bayona, Anna/0000-0002-4560-3185",,,,,33,6,6,1,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Own account work, fixed-term contracts and contracts with variable hours all have become more prevalent since the early 2000's. This paper describes the growth of flexible work arrangements from three perspectives. The institutional perspective reveals that the Dutch institutions provide incentives and possibilities for employers to circumvent institution-based risks and costs, and for workers to avoid taxes and social security contributions. The individual perspective shows that most workers nevertheless prefer an open-ended employment contract, which some groups manage to obtain more often than others. Over the life cycle the share of flexible employment contracts decreases among all cohorts and all social groups, but more so among the higher educated and men. Own account work, which is mostly a positive choice, increases over the life cycle. The job perspective shows that flexible work arrangements have grown in all sectors of the economy. In some sectors the increase is predominantly in own account work, in other sectors predominantly in flexible employment contracts, without a clear relation to sector characteristics.","[Bolhaar, Jonneke; Scheer, Bas] CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, The Hague, Netherlands; [de Graaf-Zijl, Marloes] UWV Employee Insurance Agcy, Amsterdam, Netherlands",CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy,"Bolhaar, J (通讯作者)，CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, The Hague, Netherlands.",j.a.bolhaar@cpb.nl,,,,,,,22,9,10,1,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,DEC,2018,166.0,4,,,SI,,403,432,,10.1007/s10645-018-9328-9,0.0,,,30,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GY7HZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448780600002,0

In particular, monopolies and near monopolies, which have small number of producers or service providers, have high valuations.

Due to rising inequality, a shrinking numbers of large banks, and a ceiling on Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insured deposits, there is a shortage of safe assets. The private supply of safe assets has occurred through the system of shadow banks, and is based on repos, or Treasury Bonds. But the supply of US Treasury bonds is limited by the ceiling on public debt, and is constrained by neoliberal theories of limits to the size of government. As a result, there is a presumed shortage of safe assets, just when the levels of inequality have increased the order of magnitude of assets under management which are in need of protection. There are also large accumulations of cash pools by large multinational corporations, often held overseas to evade taxes. The private provision of safe assets tends to reduce liquidity and increase costs of information, potentially leading to financial instability. Possible resolutions of this issue include (1) progressive taxes to reduce the size of the cash pools, (2) an increase in the ceiling for insured deposits, and (3) increasing support by the Fed for the role of market maker of last resort. This paper concludes with the implications of each alternative.","[Davis, Ann E.] Marist Coll, Econ, Poughkeepsie, NY USA",Marist College,"Davis, AE (通讯作者)，Marist Coll, 3399 North Rd, Poughkeepsie, NY 12601 USA.",ann.davis@marist.edu,,,,,,,48,3,4,1,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

Mexico's integration with global production chains, however, has failed to produce sustained output and productivity growth. In this paper we propose an explanation for slow growth that hinges on the negative demand externalities of input outsourcing. We make two contributions. First, using input-output data we show that outsourcing has lowered domestic demand for the manufacturing sector, especially for capital-intensive basic industries. Second, we develop a model of outsourcing and capital accumulation and show that lower costs of outsourcing can hurt accumulation if, for the aggregate manufacturing sector, the negative effect of domestic demand shortfalls on profitability exceeds the offsetting effects of lower input costs and of export expansion. Our findings complement the broader literature on the apparent paradox of Mexico's success as an exporter of manufactures amid sluggish growth. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The survey provides rich quantitative information of a wide range of financing sources and tangible and intangible investment types for a representative sample of EU28 firms in 2016. We provide new evidence and contribute to previous research in the following ways: first we consider the heterogeneous effect of internal and external finance on different tangible and intangible investment types. Second, our analysis focuses on a broad spectrum of non-financial corporations across size classes from different countries. By using a multinomial fractional response model to estimate the finance-investment link, we find that SMEs and large enterprises show a different financing behaviour for their investment activity. The results suggest that SMEs' tangible asset investment is positively related to the use of bank finance, whereas internal finance is preferred for intangible asset investments.","[Ferrando, Annalisa; Preuss, Carsten] European Cent Bank, Sonnemanstr 20, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank,"Ferrando, A (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Sonnemanstr 20, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany.",annalisa.ferrando@ecb.int; Carsten.preuss@ecb.int,,,,,,,50,5,5,3,34,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

Using data from the Multinational Time Use Study for the UK, we find positive intergenerational correlations in housework for both parents, indicating that the more time parents devote to housework, the more time their children will devote to housework. Using data from the British Household Panel Survey, we find that a higher father-mother housework ratio is positively related to a higher child-mother housework ratio, even after allowing for individual fixed-effects. In order to address the potential exacerbation of errors-in-variables arising from the fixed-effects specification, we instrument the father-mother ratio of housework using father's and mother's lagged weekly working hours. The Instrumental-Variable estimates fully support the fixed-effects estimates, and suggest that the latter should be regarded as a lower bound. We also present evidence of the link between housework during adolescence and during adulthood, which may indicate that housework time during adulthood depends on the housework time during childhood, which may also be affected by parents' housework time. Our results contribute to the field of the intergenerational mobility of behaviors.","[Ignacio Gimenez-Nadal, J.; Alberto Molina, Jose] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Econ Anal, Gran Via 2-50005, Zaragoza, Spain; [Alberto Molina, Jose] IZA, Schaumburg Lippe Str 5-9, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Zhu, Yu] Nanjing Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Adm, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Yu] Univ Dundee, Econ Studies, 3 Perth Rd, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland",University of Zaragoza; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Nanjing University of Finance & Economics; University of Dundee,"Zhu, Y (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Adm, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Zhu, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Dundee, Econ Studies, 3 Perth Rd, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland.",yuzhu@dundee.ac.uk,"Zhu, Yu/F-2586-2010; Gimenez-Nadal, Jose Ignacio/H-4276-2015; Molina, Jose Alberto/H-1676-2015","Zhu, Yu/0000-0003-2805-4302; Gimenez-Nadal, Jose Ignacio/0000-0002-1610-5451; Molina, Jose Alberto/0000-0002-9437-4606",Spanish Ministry of Economics [ECO2012-34828],Spanish Ministry of Economics(Spanish Government),"This paper was partially written while Jose Alberto Molina was Visiting Fellow at the Department of Economics of Boston College (US), and Yu Zhu was visiting the Department of Economics of the University of Zaragoza (UZ), to which they would each like to express their thanks for the hospitality and facilities provided.

The results confirm that, in general, all the considered factors are relevant. Furthermore, market return and size factors show greater explanatory power, together with the value factor in the crisis period.

Our model highlights dynamics of wealth distribution with class-differentiated savings which are themselves distinct from the decision to invest and accumulate capital. At the steady state, investment parameters do not influence the distribution of wealth but there exists a long run paradox of thrift effect which distributes wealth to capitalists whilst simultaneously exerting downward pressure on the level of aggregate demand. Applied to annual US data from 1950-2015 we find that the share of capitalist wealth will stabilize at approximately 68%, fairly close to the Kotlikoff-Summers dynastic capital range. The demand driven nature of our model implies a key role for the capitalist saving rate in jointly reducing macroeconomic performance and increasing wealth inequality. This may be an important issue in mature, low growth capitalist economies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We use a parameterized difference-in-differences approach that captures policy changes at the federal and state level over the last two decades to analyze how the increasing generosity of the EITC has affected married women's self-employment. Results suggest that the average increase in state EITC benefits during that time period increased self-employment behavior of low-income, non-college educated married mothers by 0.9 percentage points. Our measure of self-employment reflects hours spent in selfemployment, which we interpret as a real increase in self-employment effort rather than a change in reporting. The findings provide evidence that the EITC can influence workers' type of employment in addition to their overall labor supply.","[Lim, Katherine] US Dept Treasury, 1500 Penn Ave NW, Washington, DC 20024 USA; [Michelmore, Katherine] Syracuse Univ, Dept Publ Adm & Int Affairs, Ctr Policy Res, Maxwell Sch Citizenship & Publ Affairs, 426 Eggers Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",United States Department of the Treasury; Syracuse University,"Michelmore, K (通讯作者)，Syracuse Univ, Dept Publ Adm & Int Affairs, Ctr Policy Res, Maxwell Sch Citizenship & Publ Affairs, 426 Eggers Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",Katherine.lim@treasury.gov; kmmichel@syr.edu,,,,,,,57,6,6,0,15,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5371,1879-1034,,LABOUR ECON,Labour Econ.,DEC,2018,55.0,,,,,,98,115,,10.1016/j.labeco.2018.09.004,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,HF8BD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000454465000006,0

In this model, the more varieties of specialized business services a country endows, the more welfare gains arise in the presence of positive production externalities to the manufacturing sector. Since developed countries are more prosperous in business service sector, this model helps to explain why the impact of opening trade on the dispersion of both wages and unemployment is stronger in developing economies.","[Lo, Chu-Ping] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Lo, CP (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Taipei, Taiwan.",cplo@ntu.edu.tw,,,National Science Council [NSC96-2415-H-002-019],"National Science Council(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",The financial support provided by the National Science Council (NSC96-2415-H-002-019) is gratefully acknowledged.,,14,0,0,0,7,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

Appling the methods of spatial comparison and cluster analysis, we identify the key differences and similarities in labour flexibility among selected countries. There are rather significant differences between groups of countries. The results of panel data regression largely indicate that higher flexibility on the labour market could have positive impact on the reduction of unemployment in the future, especially when taking into account the two years lag.","[Pisar, Peter; Hunady, Jan; L'apinova, Erika] Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia",Matej Bel University,"Pisar, P (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia.",peter.pisar@umb.sk; jan.hunady@umb.sk; erika.lapinova@umb.sk,"Pisar, Peter/ABE-4019-2020; Lapinova, Erika/AAY-1295-2021; Hunady, Jan/B-9678-2019","Hunady, Jan/0000-0002-7075-2289; Pisar, Peter/0000-0003-4898-2739",Slovak Research and Development Agency [APVV-15-0322],Slovak Research and Development Agency(Slovak Research and Development Agency),This work has been supported by the Slovak Research and Development Agency under the Contract No. APVV-15-0322.

Based on a literature review, four forms of participation are identified: help seeking, help giving, participating in reflective reframing, and conducting reinforcing activities. An exploratory study enables the identification of items measuring the four forms of participation. The items are statistically validated by running confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) in Lisrel 9.10. By performing structural equation modeling (SEM) in Lisrel 9.10 based on survey data, it is revealed that four antecedents influence participation: hedonic benefits, learning benefits, social integrative benefits, and personal integrative benefits. Furthermore, it is found that these antecedents influence the four forms of participation differently. Finally, the study shows how companies can facilitate social integrative benefits and personal integrative benefits and thereby indirectly stimulate participation in the community. In order not to miss out on important insights, researchers should include all four forms of participation as these are influenced by different antecedents. Scales and items for measuring participation are provided. Companies are advised to determine what form(s) of participation they want from the consumers, and try to motivate them accordingly. Recommendations on how that can be done are given.","[Sivertstol, Njal] Telenor ASA, Telenor Res, Snaroyveien 30, N-1331 Fornebu, Norway",,"Sivertstol, N (通讯作者)，Telenor ASA, Telenor Res, Snaroyveien 30, N-1331 Fornebu, Norway.",njal.sivertstol@telenor.com,,,,,,,83,4,4,1,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1868-7865,1868-7873,,J KNOWL ECON,J.

We find that better provincial governance has a positive effect on labour market wages for wage-earning workers. The finding is consistent across estimators, even after controlling for worker characteristics, geographic regions, urban context, economic sector and industry type. A better competitive environment for business attracts more firms to enter the market, which in turn creates greater demand for labour. Subsequently, higher demand for labour pushes up wages.

Precisely, by means of a structural VAR we employ labor productivity, real wage and unemployment to identify the structural shocks affecting their pattern, in the long and short-run. We will label them as technology, markup and aggregate demand shocks, respectively. The impulse responses of each variable to shocks provide the measure of their (relative) elasticity in explaining the behavior of labor market in six OECD countries, namely Italy, France, Spain, Germany, UK and USA. We find that: (1) the conditional correlations between productivity and real wage are positive for both supply and demand shocks, (2) the impulse responses show a persistent increase of both productivity and real wage to supply shocks, (3) the level of unemployment shows a persistent decrease when hit by a positive demand shock. The main result of our analysis is that Keynesian policies can have permanent effect on the labor market equilibrium.","[Travaglini, Giuseppe; Bellocchi, Alessandro] Univ Urbino Carlo Bo, DESP, Via Saffi 42, I-61029 Urbino, PU, Italy",University of Urbino,"Travaglini, G (通讯作者)，Univ Urbino Carlo Bo, DESP, Via Saffi 42, I-61029 Urbino, PU, Italy.",giuseppe.travaglini@uniurb.it; a.bellocchi2@campus.uniurb.it,"Travaglini, Giuseppe/HPC-2911-2023","Travaglini, Giuseppe/0000-0003-1943-096X",,,,,29,4,4,1,6,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

Under these two specifications, respectively, the shadow price of the patent stock (on weighted average) for the whole period is -0.106 and -0.054 million US dollars per patent in the entire sample. Similarly, the shadow value of the patent stock (by the ratio of gross domestic product) in the entire sample is -5.8% and -2.9%, respectively. As the standing position of patent stock, the patent stock is less valuable than human capital and (produced) capital but more valuable than population, energy use, and natural capital. The patent stock also is likely to be valuable in developing countries. In addition, the shadow value of the patent stock is relatively high in certain large countries and nearly flat in most of the countries. (C) 2018 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland.

The full-sample result indicates that there is no causality between defence spending and education expenditure. By adopting a time-varying rolling window approach to revisit the dynamic causal relationships, this article identifies a negative unidirectional causality running from education expenditure to defence spending. The finding suggests that it is the education expenditure crowds out defence spending in China rather than reverse. No causality is demonstrated from defence spending to education expenditure, indicating that an increase in military spending will not crowd out expenditure on education. The results could be partly explained by that the education expenditure in China is below the requirement of corresponding economic growth, urging for more financial budget. Whereas the findings support a negative trade-off between defence and education expenditures, they refute the theory of 'guns for butter'.","[Xu, Yingying] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chang, Hsu Ling] Ling Tung Univ, Dept Accounting & Informat, Taichung, Taiwan; [Su, Chi Wei] Ocean Univ China, Dept Finance, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Dumitrescu, Adelina] Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, Dept Econ & Publ Policies, Bucharest, Romania",Beihang University; Ocean University of China; National University of Political Studies & Public Administration (SNSPA) - Romania,"Su, CW (通讯作者)，Ocean Univ China, Dept Finance, Qingdao, Peoples R China.",cwsu@ouc.edu.cn,"Su, Chi Wei/ABE-4976-2021",,National Social Science Foundation [15BJY155],National Social Science Foundation,This research is supported by the National Social Science Foundation [grant number 15BJY155].,,59,3,4,1,14,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

As Gazprom had limited experience of LNG production, a logical solution was to establish partnerships with foreign companies. Despite ambitious goals, no major Gazprom-led LNG projects have emerged so far. While this can mainly be explained by market fall-out, scholars have also pointed to weaknesses in Gazprom's approach to foreign partners. This article analyses the partnership dynamics between Gazprom, Total, and Statoil in Russia's most ambitious LNG production project, the Shtokman field in the Barents Sea. The three companies established a partnership to develop the field in 2008, but only four years later the project was shelved. In addition to objective parameters, this paper finds that some of the challenges to the partnership resulted from differing norms, ideas, and world-views. These difficulties might, however, have been overcome had the field been commercially viable.","[Loe, Julia S.

This paper proposes a new policy scenario, explicitly disentangling the issue of burden sharing of financing new investments from the issue of taxation energy consumption and therefor emissions. We compare traditional allocation schemes with an optimal Ramsey pricing by applying demand elasticity values, derived from empirical estimations of household behavior for the 106 leading countries in the world, representing around 90% of total world energy consumption and carbon emissions in 2014. We calculate country-specific alternative taxation options: uniform, equitable and Ramsey pricing schemes, applied to households, assessing the related welfare effects. Our results show that the optimal pricing scheme, for a given investment need, can improve world welfare at the expenses of equitable considerations. In addition, the aggregate societal benefit outweighs the losses associated with specific group of countries, paving the way for easier political agreement, using compensation schemes to redistribute the proceeds.

More stringent (restrictive) patent policy reduces access to patented knowledge and affects both profitability and the innovation performance of a firm. This in turn changes a firm's incentives to invest in innovation. The paper studies circumstances where, comparing two firms where one has a technology weaker than the other (ranked lower in the technology comparison), the impact on the technologically weaker firm of such policy is either more or less severe than on the strong firm. In each case the consequence for investment in innovation is examined. The welfare implications of such policies are also considered. One feature of the paper is that the formulation allows for a broad and multidimensional description of technologies. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

To estimate the validity of those conditions, we adopt a novel complementarity index.

The sample used in this paper comprises a panel data of 26 banks in Pakistan, for the period from 2000 to 2014. The analysis provides evidence that increase in ownership concentration leads to an increase in bank risk-taking. Managerial ownership is associated with high risk-taking at low and high levels of managerial ownership while at intermediate level, managerial ownership has negative impact on bank risk-taking. Different types of ownership of banks in Pakistan have different impact on risk-taking. While government, family and institutional ownership have a positive impact on bank risk-taking, foreign ownership has a negative impact on bank risk-taking. Furthermore, the results show that capital regulations are important in influencing bank risk-taking with regard to higher ownership concentration. The findings of this paper suggest that the relation between bank risk-taking and capital regulations typically depends on the type of ownership.","[Ehsan, Sobia] NUST, Business Sch, H-12, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Javid, Attiya Yasmin] PIDE, Dept Econ, Islamabad, Pakistan",National University of Sciences & Technology - Pakistan,"Ehsan, S (通讯作者)，NUST, Business Sch, H-12, Islamabad, Pakistan.",sobia.ehsan@nbs.nust.edu.pk; attiyajaved@gmail.com,,,,,,,48,13,13,3,29,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1617-982X,1617-9838,,PORT ECON J,Port.

In standard models these three elasticities should be equal. We find that this is far from being the case. The export price elasticity is the highest, around 5, much larger than the exchange rate elasticity. The international elasticity puzzle is therefore worse than previously thought. We also show that exporters absorb one third of tariff changes in their export prices. Because we take into account this reaction of export prices to tariffs, our estimate of the tariff elasticity corrects from this omitted-variable bias. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, our empirical results imply that after the adoption of a free floating exchange rate regime by Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia and South Africa and the liberalisation of the Chinese exchange rate policy that took place during the last decade, currency misalignments have been gradually reduced, leading the real effective exchange rates of the respective currencies very close to their equilibrium levels.","[Giannellis, Nikolaos; Koukouritakis, Minoas] Univ Crete, Dept Econ, Univ Campus, Rethimnon 74100, Greece",University of Crete,"Koukouritakis, M (通讯作者)，Univ Crete, Dept Econ, Univ Campus, Rethimnon 74100, Greece.",m.koukouritakis@uoc.gr,"Giannellis, Nikolaos/AAE-5084-2021","Koukouritakis, Minoas/0000-0001-9289-8855",,,,,70,5,5,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

To assess whether it is excessive, the dominant firm's price is often compared with price benchmarks. We examine the competitive implications of two such benchmarks: a retrospective benchmark where the price that prevails after a rival enters the market is used to assess whether the dominant firm's pre-entry price was excessive, and a contemporaneous benchmark, where the dominant firm's price is compared with the price that the firm charges contemporaneously in another market. We show that the two benchmarks restrain the dominant firm's behavior when it acts as a monopoly, but soften competition when the dominant firm competes with a rival. Moreover, a retrospective benchmark promotes entry, but may lead to inefficient entry. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This public-private partnership pays companies a fixed fee for connecting households. Causal impacts on time use of individuals are identified using initial geospatial inequalities in public goods provisions within municipalities and this large change in the cost of electrifying households more distant from the electric grid.

However, using data from Bangladesh and India, we show that such high regard does not necessarily translate into improved autonomy for her. In fact, a daughter raises her mother's participation in household decisions and her freedom of mobility relative to a son. A daughter also prompts her mother to work more, but not necessarily to consume more. These effects are strongest among mothers of older girls. These results are consistent with a theoretical model in which mothers have greater relative preferences for spending on their daughters than fathers do, and so seek more autonomy to direct resources to their daughters.","[Heath, Rachel; Tan, Xu] Univ Washington, Dept Econ, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Tan, X (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Dept Econ, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",rmheath@uw.edu; tanxu@uw.edu,"Tan, Xu/C-2301-2017",,,,,,61,12,13,1,16,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

Daily data during the period 1 January 1990 to 31 December 2015 and during the pre-global and post-global financial crisis periods is used. To that end, we employ two econometric methodologies: the C-GARCH methodology and the SVAR framework. Results suggest that: (i) permanent and transitory components of the conditional variance exhibit peaks in volatility during episodes of growing economic and financial instability; (ii) the long-run volatility relationships are stronger than the short-run volatility linkages with a reinforcement during the post-global financial crisis period; (iii) the presence of intraspillovers and inter-spillovers increases substantially during the post-global financial crisis period and (iv) the stock markets play a dominant role in the transmission of long-run and short-run volatility in all samples, except for the period after the global financial crisis, where the foreign exchange markets are the main long-run volatility triggers.

The model shows that if a pair of banks settle bank transfers between them without the central bank, a hold-up problem occurs when they bargain over the terms of settlement. This result stems from the confidentiality of bank-transfer requests, which makes it necessary for a depositor to retain an outside option to withdraw cash to enforce a bank-transfer request in a deposit contract. In light of this result, the large value payment system operated by the central bank can be regarded as an implicit interbank settlement contract to prevent a hold-up problem. In this contract, the central bank is characterized as the custodian of collateral. Bank reserves correspond to the balances of liquid collateral that banks submit to the central bank. This result can explain the rate-of-return dominance puzzle as well as why the central bank must replace liquid assets with bank reserves. The optimal implicit contract features a type of deferred net settlement in which the value of bank reserves transferred between banks is smaller than the net value of bank transfers to be settled.

In this approach, measured consumption at the time of the peak is used to set charges for that pricing period or a subsequent period. If transmission costs are truly sunk, then such a recovery is unlikely to be efficient. However, in the context of growing peak demand, new additions must be built. We consider the incentive properties of coincident peak pricing when related investments are not considered to be sunk, finding that it can reproduce the incentive properties of an ideal time-varying price.

We find that the boom lowered college enrollment, with effects concentrated at two-year colleges. The decline in enrollment during the boom was generally reversed during the bust; however, attainment remains persistently low for particular cohorts, suggesting that reduced educational attainment is an enduring effect of the recent housing cycle.

The existence of inter-market traders implies that the two markets impact each other through their fundamentals and hence share some common set of factors, which provides foundation of market interactions, such as market co-movement.","[Chen, Zhenxi] South China Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Commerce, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Huang, Weihong] Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Econ, Singapore, Singapore; [Zheng, Huanhuan] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",South China University of Technology; Nanyang Technological University; Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Chen, ZX (通讯作者)，South China Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Commerce, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",chenzx@scut.edu.cn; awhhuang@ntu.edu.sg; zheng@cuhk.edu.hk,"Zheng, Huanhuan/ISV-0894-2023; Huang, Weihong/A-9676-2013","Huang, Weihong/0000-0002-8626-2807; chen, zhenxi/0000-0001-9743-7994",,,,,32,6,6,0,14,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

These shocks encompass a source of return variability whenever the wealth of traders subject to them is large, clue to their transmission onto market clearing prices. By analytically investigating the underlying price and wealth dynamics, we provide conditions on agents' portfolios under which such pass-through is either maximal, when the traders subject to demand shocks dominate, minimal, when the traders subject to demand shocks vanish, or endogenously determined, when all traders survive and their relative wealth dynamics is a mean reverting process. In particular, the pass -through emerges only when the average position in the risky asset of the traders subject to demand shocks is large enough to compensate from the losses they incur from buying at a high price (selling at a low price) whenever a positive (negative) demand shock occurs.

An analysis of the crown jewel of tax and expenditure limitations,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Fiscal rules; Fiscal policy; Synthetic control method,STATE-TAX; LIMITS; EMPLOYMENT; REDUCE; IMPACT; WAGES,"Fiscal rules attempt to alter budget outcomes by constraining policy makers. They have been one of the primary responses to the recent string of fiscal crises around the globe. We ask if these rules succeed in altering fiscal outcomes by examining what is arguably the most stringent set of fiscal rules in the U.S.-Colorado's Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR). As TABOR attempts to constrain both taxes and expenditures, we develop a novel approach of estimating treatment effects for multiple outcomes simultaneously using the synthetic control methodology of Abadie et al. (2010). Although there will always be a degree of uncertainty over external validity when a policy is enacted in only a single state, our results provide no evidence that TABOR affected the level of taxes or spending in Colorado and are precise enough to rule out large negative effects. Thus, no support is found for the contention that fiscal rules alter budget outcomes. Instead, TABOR appears to have been partly evaded by policy makers and voters despite its stringency and partly nothing more than a ratification of the state's preference over the size of its public sector.

Using micro-level data from Russia, Ukraine and Bulgaria, matched to Census data on immigrants from these countries in the United States, Spain and Greece in the post-Soviet period, I find evidence of positive selection of immigrants in the US, and negative selection for Greece and Spain.

Using panel data for 175 countries from 1960 to 2010, we find that there is a close link between urbanization and the size of the public sector, especially when looking at education, health care, and social issues. Various robustness checks confirm this finding. An analysis of state-level public spending in Colombia and Germany confirms our hypothesis on the subnational level. On the microeconomic level, people in urban areas acknowledge that governments should take more responsibility, and they are more in favor of redistribution. This finding can help to explain the evolution of government size, and it can also predict the present and future needs of urbanizing areas.","[Jetter, Michael] Univ Western Australia, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Parmeter, Christopher F.] Univ Miami, Miami, FL 33146 USA; [Jetter, Michael] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Jetter, Michael] CESifo, Munich, Germany",University of Western Australia; University of Miami; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Ifo Institut,"Jetter, M (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",mjetter7@gmail.com; cparmeter@bus.miami.edu,,"Jetter, Michael/0000-0001-7967-5200",,,,,42,3,3,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,1467-9442,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

Findings present that if dumping initially takes place in the home country's final good market, then antidumping protection in the final good market will result in dumping in the foreign country's input market, thus leading to further antidumping protection, which will reinforce the incentive of the home downstream firm to initially petition for antidumping protection. Moreover, we demonstrate that an antidumping duty in vertically related markets may not provide this industry with adequate protection. Finally, when taking the antidumping chain effect into account, we show that the government which initially faces the dumping may determine a higher antidumping duty if the production inefficiency of the home upstream firm relative to the foreign upstream firm is in the medium range.","[Kao, Kuo-Feng; Mai, Chao-Cheng] Tamkang Univ, Dept Ind Econ, 151 Yingzhuan Rd, New Taipei 25137, Taiwan; [Mai, Chao-Cheng] Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Humanities & Social Sci, 128,Sec 2,Acad Rd, Taipei 11529, Taiwan",Tamkang University; Academia Sinica - Taiwan,"Kao, KF (通讯作者)，Tamkang Univ, Dept Ind Econ, 151 Yingzhuan Rd, New Taipei 25137, Taiwan.",kuofeng@mail.tku.edu.tw; ccmai@gate.sinica.edu.tw,"Kao, Kuo-Feng/JXM-1330-2024","Kao, Kuo-Feng/0000-0002-2763-6565",Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan [NSC 102-2410-H-032-017],"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","We are extremely grateful to the Editor and two anonymous referees for their helpful and detailed comments, which have largely improved the quality of this article.

Both standard duopoly and mixed duopoly are considered, and both simultaneous moves and sequential moves are investigated.

It assesses the impact of President Trump's alienation of traditional US allies, which threatens to splinter the hegemonic coalition and even push China and Europe together, and his convergence toward some Chinese norms on trade and even politics. It outlines three possible systemic scenarios: a G0 in which the US is no longer willing to lead but China is not yet able or willing, and whether such a (likely) regime will be stable or unstable; a new G1, sooner or later, led by China; and a cooperative G2 in which the US and China agree to share leadership. It traces the evolution of actual leadership initiatives of the two countries in recent years. It compares US and Chinese attitudes on key systemic issues and concludes with an appraisal of an international economic order with Chinese characteristics, a world in which the state plays a greater role relative to market economics, the rule of law defers increasingly to voluntary arrangements, and politics tilt toward central government control more than democracy.","[Bergsten, C.

In the theoretical part of the study, we develop a stylized model based on Barro (1990), in which income taxation has two contradictory roles in the standard Solow (1956) setup: on the one hand, taxation appropriates resources that would otherwise be used for physical capital accumulation, and on the other, it is the source of government spending, which is used to support private production. In the empirical part of the study, the impact of consumption tax, personal income tax, corporate profit tax and property tax on income is estimated using the common correlated effects (CCE) panel cointegration approach, which allows for cross-sectional dependencies and provides both panel and country-specific results. The panel findings for 30 OECD countries for the period of 1995-2016 indicate that only consumption tax has a statistically significant negative effect on long-run income. However, because the type and sign of the tax coefficients are heterogeneous for the country-specific results, we conclude that taxation has heterogeneous effects on income.","[Durusu-Ciftci, Dilek] Pamukkale Univ, Dept Int Trade & Finance, TR-20070 Denizli, Turkey; [Gokmenoglu, Korhan K.] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Famagusta, North Cyprus, Turkey; [Yetkiner, Hakan] Izmir Univ Econ, Dept Econ, TR-35330 Izmir, Turkey",Pamukkale University; Eastern Mediterranean University; Izmir Ekonomi Universitesi,"Durusu-Ciftci, D (通讯作者)，Pamukkale Univ, Dept Int Trade & Finance, TR-20070 Denizli, Turkey.",dciftci@pau.edu.tr; korhan.gokmenoglu@emu.edu.tr; Hakan.Yetkiner@ieu.edu.tr,"Gokmenoglu, Korhan/T-3596-2019; Ciftci, Dilek Durusu/AAJ-4096-2020; Yetkiner, Hakan/D-5955-2014","Gokmenoglu, Korhan/0000-0002-2013-6867;",,,,,64,12,12,0,14,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0939-3625,1878-5433,,ECON SYST,Econ.

Responding to this question poses a challenge because of the confounding factors of charitable tax breaks, reciprocity motives, pressure from the solicitors and persuasive campaigns for giving that are more prevalent in December. In this paper, I use a unique solicitation situation where these factors are eliminated. Based on nine years of data and more than 50 million giving decisions, I provide three main results. First, the month of December is associated with a 14% increase in the probability to make a donation, thereby providing strong support to the notion of seasonal altruism. Second, exploiting a reform that changed the price of giving, I find that this December effect is equivalent to a 32% discount on charitable giving. Finally, half of the December increase in generosity persists into January before returning to the baseline in February. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This finding is in line with models consisting of internal lying costs and external reputation costs and rejects certain other models, but does not allow for a clean test of models with reference dependent loss aversion. To compare the explanatory power of reputation models and loss aversion models, we manipulate the ex-ante probability that lying is possible at all. We show that the reputation model predicts that the lying frequency decreases in the probability that lying is possible, while the loss aversion model predicts the opposite. Our experimental results strongly support the reputation model. From an applied perspective, our results suggest that reducing the probability that lying is possible may be counterproductive.

It assumes that agents have claims over the outputs that they could produce by forming coalitions. Outputs are insufficient to meet the claims and are rationed by a rule whose proposals of division induce each agent to rank the coalitions in which she can participate. As a result, a hedonic game of coalition formation emerges.

A unique aspect of our approach is to assume equally-spaced regimes. In our baseline model, we specify regimes for the trend inflation at one-percent intervals. This framework serves as a parsimonious trend inflation model, and the estimated probability of the trend inflation being in each regime provides an easily interpretable illustration in policy debate and analysis. An empirical result for the United States shows a considerably stable trend inflation at two percent since the late 1990s. A result for Japan indicates that the trend inflation stayed at zero percent for about 15 years after the late 1990s, and then shifted away from zero percent after the introduction of the price stability target and the quantitative and qualitative monetary easing in 2013.

These measures, which both use and violate trade rules, have provoked retaliation from other countries. Such friction has restricted and distorted trade and investment, undermined the rules-based trading system and perhaps permanently damaged global value chains that depend on stable rules for market access. Trump has justified some of his measures as a response to China's alleged unfair practices and indeed, China has adopted industrial and technology policies that are formally neutral between domestic and foreign firms but in practice have led foreign firms to complain about discriminatory practices that favor Chinese firms. The US friction with China is unfortunate because instead of trying to bully China into submission in a tariff war, the US could have dealt with many of its concerns more effectively by cooperating with other countries and taking actions that are consistent with maintaining the rules-based system. While the US has undermined its leadership role, the overall damage to the trading system could still be limited if other countries, especially China, take actions that sustain and strengthen it.","[Lawrence, Robert Z.] Peterson Inst Int Econ, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Lawrence, Robert Z.] Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Trade & Investment, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Peterson Institute for International Economics; Harvard University,"Lawrence, RZ (通讯作者)，Peterson Inst Int Econ, Washington, DC 20036 USA.;Lawrence, RZ (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Trade & Investment, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",robert_lawrence@hks.harvard.edu,,,,,,,17,16,18,2,161,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,SEP-OCT,2018,26.0,5,,,SI,,62,82,,10.1111/cwe.12256,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GT4FU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000444460400005,0

We focus on one of the most resilient and pervasive gender gaps in modern societies: mathematics. Using the German division as a natural experiment, we show that the under-performance of girls in math is sharply reduced in the regions of the former GDR, in contrast with those of the former FRG. We show that this East West difference is due to girls' attitudes, confidence and competitiveness in math, and not to other confounding factors, such as the difference in economic conditions or teaching styles across the former political border. We also provide illustrative evidence that the gender gap in math is smaller in European countries that used to be part of the Soviet bloc, as opposed to the rest of Europe. The lesson is twofold: (1) a large part of the pervasive gender gap in math is due to social stereotypes; (2) institutions can durably modify these stereotypes.","[Lippmann, Quentin; Senik, Claudia] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Senik, Claudia] Sorbonne Univ, Paris, France",Paris School of Economics; Sorbonne Universite,"Lippmann, Q (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France.",qlippmann@gmail.com; senik@pse.ens.fr,"Lippmann, Quentin/HHN-0269-2022","Lippmann, Quentin/0000-0003-4871-8313","CEPREMAP; French National Research Agency, through the program Investissements d'Avenir [ANR-10-LABX-93-01]","CEPREMAP; French National Research Agency, through the program Investissements d'Avenir(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR))","We are grateful to participants at the Milano MILLS workshop, the Seventh ECINEQ Meeting, the Kiev People Matter conference, and seminars at the Paris School of Economics, Berlin Frei Universitat, Magdeburg University, and bar Ilan University for useful comments.

The out-of-sample result shows statistical and economic significance of the predictability. Forecast combination over technical indicators generates more accurate density forecasts than the combination over macro variables. Technical indicators also perform better in terms of Sharpe ratio and certainty equivalent return for risk-averse investors who seek a trade-off between risk and return in the oil market.

Weaker financial development and rule of law have substantial negative effects on aggregate output, reducing output per capita by 50 percent. Weak rule-of-law institutions substantially amplify the negative impact of financial frictions. While financial markets are crucial for development, an essential precondition to reap the gains from financial liberalization is that property rights are secure.","[Ranasinghe, Ashantha] Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, 8-14 Tory Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H4, Canada; [Restuccia, Diego] Univ Toronto, Dept Econ, 150 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G7, Canada; [Restuccia, Diego] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Alberta; University of Toronto; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Ranasinghe, A (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, 8-14 Tory Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H4, Canada.",ranasinghe@ualberta.ca; diego.restuccia@utoronto.ca,,"Restuccia, Diego/0000-0002-4072-8712",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Canada Research Chairs program,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Canada Research Chairs program(Canada Research Chairs),"We thank the editor (Andrew Foster), two anonymous referees, Rui Castro, Marco Cozzi, Lutz Hendricks, Pavel Sevcik, Yongs Shin and audiences at several conferences and institutions for helpful comments and suggestions.

This paper investigates the risk transmission mechanism between the oil and natural gas markets. We apply the recently introduced test statistics based on cross-quantilogram function and the multivariate quantile regression model (VAR for VaR) to the US oil and natural gas prices, which are independently formed. Our results show two asymmetric patterns. First, the shocks in the oil market substantially increase the Value at Risk (VaR) in the natural gas market, but the reverse impact does not exist. Second, we highlight the significant asymmetric response of gains and losses transmission in energy markets, cautioning about the underlying weakness of adopting volatility to measure risk in the energy market. Moreover, an extreme market risk is more easily transmitted across markets than moderate risks. Our results are in general robust in application to other regional energy markets, such as Europe and Asia, but the heterogeneities in responses are underpinned by the different role of natural gas in regions. The findings in this paper have important implications for academic researchers, policy makers in gas-dependent economies, and business practitioners in light of projected increases in the use of natural gas worldwide as well as the development of independent gas-on-gas competitive (hub) prices in Asia and Europe.

Although reputation and image are interrelated categories, they should not be identified with each other. The differences are not only in the definition and the character, hut also in the mechanism of formation and tools to create these resources by the company. Image is a picture, perceptions and associations about the company in the minds of consumers, which may be created using the tools of PR and advertising in a relatively short period of time. Reputation is a review of the company and its activities, formulated by various stakeholder groups, on the basis of not only advertising, but also on the basis of the assessment of real activities of companies in the long term. Purpose of the article: The cognitive objective of the article is to point out the fundamental differences between reputation and image on the basis of the analysis of approaches and theoretical concepts. The practical objective is to make an attempt to identify the differences and relationships between reputation and image on the basis of empirical analysis, therefore the research was conducted in the Polish banking sector. Methods: In order to evaluate image and reputation, the survey method was used aimed at the customers of banks operating on the Polish market. Findings & Value added: Reputation and image are two separate, intangible assets that support each other and the company needs each of them to build its competitive advantage. The results of empirical study allowed formulating the thesis that the banks. whose reputation is rated better by the customers_ also have a better and more coherent image in their minds.","[Szwajca, Danuta] Silesian Tech Univ, Zabrze, Poland",Silesian University of Technology,"Szwajca, D (通讯作者)，Silesian Tech Univ, Fac Org & Management, Roosevelta 26-28, PL-44100 Zabrze, Poland.",danuta.szwajca@polsl.pl,,,,,,,53,12,13,1,27,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

We estimate an IV-GMM model on a sample of low-middle income countries, finding evidence of a strong relationship between the growth of non tradeable prices and the quality of local institutions.

Estimation results were obtained from a conditional logit, conditional logit with interaction terms, random parameter logit, random parameter logit with correlation, and individual-level coefficient models. A novelty of our analysis was the consideration of monetary and non monetary incentives as factors influencing consumer uptake in green pricing programs. The estimation results show that increased consumer participation in green pricing programs is positively linked with green energy sources that produce fewer externalities, more jobs, and monetary incentives such as tax credits or green mileage. However, there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between participation rates and the share of green electricity in total electricity supply. Mean willingness to pay for fuel cells is highest, followed by solar and wind energy. Estimation from the random parameter logit with allowing for correlations among random coefficients of attributes reveals that consumers are divided into 'green (pro-environment) consumers' and 'blue (growth oriented) consumers'. Green consumers prefer a higher green electricity share, solar or fuel cell to wind, a greater proximity of green power plants to their homes, and green mileage or green parks to tax credits. In comparison, 'blue consumers' favor a lower green electricity share, green power plants that are far from their homes, and monetary incentives rather than non-monetary incentives. The results of this study suggest guidelines for the design of successful green pricing programs. Green pricing programs that are designed with information on types of green energy sources, consider the distance of power plants to consumers' residences, focus on the share of green electricity, and incorporate monetary incentives are likely to have increased consumer participation rates.

Using detailed production and cost data from a panel of Mexican manufacturing plants between 1994 and 2003, the paper is able to differentiate between two types of imports, materials (or intermediate inputs) and machinery and equipment (or capital goods), and to separately identify self-selection and learning effects of each type of imports at the plant level. The key findings are that there is evidence of both self-selection into importing and learning-by-importing, but not all imports seem to matter for productivity. Not only more productive plants tend to become importers of machinery and equipment rather than materials, but plants that start importing machinery and equipment also experience an increase in productivity, while the same does not occur when plants start importing materials. There is also evidence of productivity gains following entry into export markets and complementarities between exporting, importing materials and importing machinery and equipment. These findings seem to suggest that capital goods from abroad are more likely to embody technological improvements than intermediate inputs.","[Caselli, Mauro] Univ Trento, Sch Int Studies, Via Tommaso Gar 14, I-38122 Trento, Italy",University of Trento,"Caselli, M (通讯作者)，Univ Trento, Sch Int Studies, Via Tommaso Gar 14, I-38122 Trento, Italy.",mauro.caselli@unitn.it,,"Caselli, Mauro/0000-0002-1132-1665",,,,,40,20,21,3,14,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

We first develop a game theoretical framework with imperfect information on the spatial location of transnational terrorism to show how the resulting security measures produce a non-monotonic effect on the distribution of trade across countries. Neighbors adjacent to terror, even when they do not source it, have trade reduced through enhanced security measures, while countries farther away benefit from those security measures. Second, to empirically assess the distortional effects of terrorism on trade, we first estimate the structural gravity equation derived from our theory. Then, armed with the estimates of the partial effect of neighbor terror on bilateral trade, we perform a counterfactual experiment and confirm the non-monotonic general equilibrium effect of neighbor terror on trade.

For this purpose, we develop a mixed-integer linear optimization model of a PV battery storage system that minimizes the electricity cost from grid purchases and employ it to study two exemplary households. In contrast to most existing studies, we consider the following issues: Our calculations are based on households' electricity demand and PV production profiles in high temporal five-minute resolution. We take regulatory and fiscal treatment of so-called prosumers explicitly into account. Furthermore, we derive cost functions characterized by size-dependent, non-constant specific PV investment cost as well as by separated cost factors for the sizing of the storage systems capacity and its power electronics. In this context, we also clarify the interaction between possible peak demand coverage, rates of self-sufficiency and profitability of different system configurations. Finally, our analysis compares different modelling approaches regarding assumptions about perfect foresight horizons. Results show that modelling assumptions for regulatory and fiscal treatment as well as for specific investment cost can have significant impact on the economic assessment, and therefore should receive more attention in future. Besides this, our calculations reveal that economic incentives for investments in residential PV storage systems can gain great momentum within the next few years. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Among other considerations, smart sentencing policy depends on how sentence severity affects recidivism. Using administrative data on two common non-violent felonies committed by adults in Michigan, we measure the effect of sentences on offenders' future criminal activity. Discontinuities in the legislative guidelines that constrain sentences chosen by Michigan judges provide exogenous variation in sentence severity. Harsher sentences generated by sentencing guidelines significantly reduce recidivism by felony shoplifters but not repeat drunk drivers. Recidivism falls most for young, male offenders from Southeast Michigan and varies non-monotonically with prior criminal record. Because of such heterogeneity, any empirical strategy measures a local average treatment effect relevant to a particular population of offenders. Contrary to our main results, we find no evidence that harsher sentences induced by judge assignments reduce recidivism in our sample. When sentencing guidelines provide the primary practical policy lever, smart justice should incorporate directly relevant empirical evidence that accounts for offense- and offender-specific tradeoffs between public safety and the public budget.

Or does causality run the opposite way - does rising economic growth boost HSR? Results document that boosts inaccessibility lead to significant and relatively large increases in city-level economic growth; further, out-of-sample methods document the importance of increases in HSR in forecasting city-level GDP growth. We also compare the benefits to the costs, and find that benefits of HSR in terms of boosting Chinese GDP substantially out-weigh HSR's large fixed costs, depreciation and subsidies.

This article provides answers to five related questions: Why was it possible for China to achieve such extraordinary performance during its transition? Why was China unable to attain similar success before its transition started? Why did most other transition economies, including those in Africa, fail to achieve a similar performance? Can African countries have a similar performance as China had in the past three decades and how to do that? What are the opportunities for African countries from China's rise? The paper concludes with a positive note: If the country in Africa adopt a pragmatic approach to develop its economy along its comparative advantages in a market economy and tap into the potential of latecomer's advantages with a facilitating state, the African country can benefit from the pending relocation of China's light manufacturing and grow dynamically like China.","[Lin, Justin Yifu] Peking Univ, Inst New Struct Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Peking University,"Lin, JY (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Inst New Struct Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",justinlin@nsd.pku.edu.cn,,,AERC,AERC,"Paper prepared for the AERC Plenary Conference in Dakar, Senegal, December 4, 2016.

In a panel regression analysis, we estimate semi-accounting-identities that allow us to identify the marginal sources of financing for various asset positions. We find that banks hedge against FX exposure via their sectoral lending composition: banks with a large share of FX deposits primarily lend to firms in traded-goods sectors. Loans to non-traded sectors are mostly financed by domestic deposits. While earlier studies have documented a positive impact of FX accounts on financial development, our analysis suggests that this does not need to imply that severely credit constrained sectors are the main beneficiaries of this process.","[Maskay, Nephil Matangi] Nepal Rastra Bank, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Steinkamp, Sven; Westermann, Frank] Osnabruck Univ, Rolandstr 8, D-49069 Osnabruck, Germany; [Westermann, Frank] CESifo, Munich, Germany",University Osnabruck; Ifo Institut,"Steinkamp, S (通讯作者)，Osnabruck Univ, Rolandstr 8, D-49069 Osnabruck, Germany.",sven.steinkamp@uni-osnabrueck.de,"Steinkamp, Sven/AAC-9875-2019","Steinkamp, Sven/0000-0002-1426-2736",,,,,25,1,1,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

Taxes may be levied on income, or on expenditure, with the median voter pivotal in the theoretical framework analysed. As in Meltzer and Richard (J Polit Econ 89:914-927, 1981), income taxes increase with inequality. Conversely, expenditure taxes first increase and then decrease with increasing inequality. The extent to which taxes are levied on income relative to expenditure unambiguously rises with inequality. In contrast to government size evidence, cross-country data exhibit a robust positive correlation between the extent to which taxes are levied on income relative to expenditure and inequality.

We show that the residuals of the heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) models of realized volatility still exhibit volatility clustering. Therefore, we extend the HAR models by characterizing such time-varying volatility of realized volatility through three GARCH-type models: the GARCH model, the long-memory FIGARCH model, and the asymmetric EGARCH model. Furthermore, we augment the above HAR-GARCH-type models to capture the inverse leverage effect and to exploit the errors in realized volatility estimators. The resulting models are referred to as the HARQ-L-GARCH-type models. They each have better in-sample fit than the corresponding HAR-GARCH-type models, whose in-sample fit are much better than the benchmark HAR models. More importantly, Diebold-Mariano tests on out-of-sample forecasts reinforce our extensions, as the forecast accuracy of the HAR-GARCH-type models significantly outperforms that of the benchmark HAR models under six conventional criteria, and the forecast accuracy of the HARQ-L-GARCH-type models is even higher. Finally, the model confidence set tests indicate that, 1) modeling the residual variance with the GARCH structure and the FIGARCH structure can more effectively improve the out-of-sample forecasting performance of the HAR models. 2) Incorporating jumps in the HAR structure improves the out-of sample forecasting performance. 3) The HARQ-L-CJ-GARCH model is superior for predicting volatility in the NSW electricity market.

We estimate that a 1000 DICK ($160) increase in a father's obligation is associated with a 273 DKK ($45) increase in his payment. A higher obligation reduces father-child co-residence, pointing to substitution between financial and non-pecuniary investments. Further, obligations increase post-separation fertility among remarried fathers, but have no impacts on maternal fertility or either parent's labor supply.

Despite these widespread concerns, empirical research on whether public fears are justified is still scarce. This article evaluates whether the abolition of border controls at the eastern German and Austrian borders accompanying the implementation of the Schengen Treaty in December 2007 increased crime rates in the border areas of these countries. Based on official crime statistics, conditional difference-in-differences estimation allows the evaluation of border controls in a causal way. Results show that in Germany and Austria, a significant positive effect can only be observed for burglaries, suggesting that public concerns proved to be justified for this type of criminal offense. In contrast, no significant effect can be observed for overall crime rates or for other common types of crime against property, indicating that there is little empirical evidence for the widespread concerns about public security.","[Sandner, Malte] Inst Employment Res IAB, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Wassmann, Pia] NRW BANK, Dusseldorf, Germany",,"Sandner, M (通讯作者)，Inst Employment Res IAB, Dusseldorf, Germany.",malte.sandner@ucl.ac.uk,,"Sandner, Malte/0000-0001-8579-4775",,,,,42,3,3,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,AUG,2018,71.0,3,,,,,482,506,,10.1111/kykl.12178,0.0,,,25,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GO4RL,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440000700006,0

The article uses a tool from numerical linear algebra to measure the central tendency of worker flows, which is closely related to the ranking of firms revealed by workers' choices. There is evidence for compensating differentials when workers systematically move to lower-paying firms in a way that cannot be accounted for by layoffs or differences in recruiting intensity. The estimates suggest that compensating differentials account for over half of the firm component of the variance of earnings.","[Sorkin, Isaac] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Sorkin, Isaac] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Sorkin, I (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Sorkin, I (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,"National Science Foundation [SES-9978093, SES-0339191, ITR-0427889]; National Institute on Aging [AG018854]; Alfred P.

One reason for this is that rankings of predictive accuracy across alternative models, which under misspecification are loss function dependent, are universally utilized to assess the usefulness of econometric models. A second reason, which corresponds to the objective of this paper, is that researchers are currently focusing considerable attention on so-called big data and on new (and old) tools that are available for the analysis of this data. One of the objectives in this field is the assessment of whether big data leads to improvement in forecast accuracy. In this survey paper, we discuss some of the latest (and most interesting) methods currently available for analyzing and utilizing big data when the objective is improved prediction. Our discussion includes a summary of various so-called dimension reduction, shrinkage and machine learning methods as well as a summary of recent tools that are useful for ranking prediction models associated with the implementation of these methods. We also provide a brief empirical illustration of big data in action, in which we show that big data are indeed useful when predicting the term structure of interest rates.

This research delves into the ineffective implementation of fertility limiting preferences. We develop a theoretical model formalising the various determinants of a woman's reproductive health behaviour during her reproductive years, focussing on choices related to effective contraception. The model incorporates the cyclicality and volatility of fecundity, paying particular attention to the stochastic nature of the reproduction process, as well as potential costs (such as lost wages and direct costs of purchase) and benefits (such as the ability to invest in her education and/or career) of being able to control or at least mitigate the volatility in the reproductive process. The model generates heterogeneity in the choice of contraceptive quality depending on both biological and economic factors. The nonparametic control function model, based on Malawian data, supports the notion that both biological and economic factors affect contraception decisions. The results suggest that fertility limiting preferences are being met, at least partially, in Malawi, and that the demographic transition is gaining traction.","[Tshiswaka-Kashalala, Gauthier; Koch, Steven F.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, Private Bag X20, ZA-0028 Hatfield, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Koch, SF (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, Private Bag X20, ZA-0028 Hatfield, South Africa.",steve.koch@up.ac.za,,,Economic Research Southern Africa; William and Flora Hewlett Foundation; Population Reference Bureau; University of Pretoria Vice Chancellor Academic Development Grant Program,Economic Research Southern Africa; William and Flora Hewlett Foundation; Population Reference Bureau; University of Pretoria Vice Chancellor Academic Development Grant Program,"The authors would like to thank Economic Research Southern Africa for their financial support, as well as the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the Population Reference Bureau, and the University of Pretoria Vice Chancellor Academic Development Grant Program, as their support for the PhD was paramount to its completion.

A separation of financial conditional volatility into short-, mid- and long-run components allows us to study the relevance of these frequency components with respect to a regulatory quality assessment for daily VaR forecasts. A simulation study and an analysis of daily market prices suggest that short- and mid- run information components cover the relevant information that is necessary for estimating adequate daily VaR. Excluding long-run information components reduces daily VaR forecasts by (up to) 4% and does not impact the quality of regulatory back-testing. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

As GDP per capita increases, average total hours worked and average household hours per working-age population decrease while average market hours increase (marketization); hours producing services increase their share in total hours (structural transformation). The decrease in household hours is mostly due to changes in housework (cleaning, cooking etc.) and marketization is mostly due to changes in women's hours.

After any history, signaling reveals information that helps players coordinate their future actions, but also makes the problem of coordinating current actions harder. In equilibrium, players may play aggressive or uncooperative actions that signal private information and partners tolerate a certain number of such actions. We discuss several applications of our results: We explain the cycles of cooperation and conflict observed in trench warfare during World War I, show that price leadership and unilateral price cuts can be part of an optimal signaling equilibrium in a repeated Bertrand game with incomplete information, and show that communication between cartel members may be socially efficient in a repeated Cournot game.

A simple theoretical framework reveals that for a broad set of cases, while inter-group competition generates incentives for violence, the presence of non-replicable, non-expropriable inter-group complementarities becomes necessary to sustain peaceful coexistence over long time horizons. In addition to complementarily, two further conditions are important for deterring violence over time. Men relatively , mobile groups (e.g. immigrants) are vulnerable, a credible threat to leave can deter violence. When less mobile (indigenous) groups are vulnerable, high-monitoring costs that allow them to withhold production can improve their gains from trade. I describe the implications for indigenous entrepreneurship and cultural assimilation, the development of local institutions supporting interethnic trust and immigration policies and policies aimed at mitigating conflict through financial innovations. I illustrate these implications using contemporary evidence and historical cases of organizations and institutions created to engender trade and support peace drawn from Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America.","[Jha, Saumitra] Stanford Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Jha, S (通讯作者)，Stanford Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,"Garg, Vivek/O-2578-2019",,,,,,60,16,18,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

Since 2017, Europe has regained confidence and optimism has returned due to sustained economic recovery and election victories of prointegration politicians, most notably in France. The European Union is embarking on co-operation in defense and security, providing a new reason to support integration. Uncertainty over Brexit and immigration remain among the causes for grave concern. But Europe and Japan have taken a joint stance against protectionism, while Asia is yet to decide whether to do so as an integrated entity.","[Kaji, Sahoko] Keio Univ, Tokyo, Japan",Keio University,"Kaji, S (通讯作者)，Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Minato Ku, 2-15-45 Mita, Tokyo 1088345, Japan.",kaji@econ.keio.ac.jp,,,,,,,7,2,2,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1832-8105,1748-3131,,ASIAN ECON POLICY R,Asian Econ.

In this paper, by considering econometric models involving simultaneous discrete systems of equations, we study how the information available to economic agents regarding other economic agents can influence whether or not these strategic information parameters can be inferred from the observed actions. We consider two extreme cases: the complete information case where the information sets of participating economic agents coincide and the incomplete information case where each agent's payoffs are privately observable. We find that in models with complete information, the strategic interaction parameters are more difficult to recover than they are in incomplete information models. We show this by exploring the Fisher information (from standard statistics literature) for the strategic interaction parameters in each of these models. Our findings are that in complete information models, the statistical (Fisher) information for the interaction parameters is zero, implying the difficulty in recovering them from data. In contrast, for incomplete information models, the Fisher information for the interaction parameters is positive, indicating that not only can these parameters be relatively easy to recover from data, but standard inference can be conducted on them. This finding is illustrated in two cases: treatment effect models (expressed as a triangular system of equations) and static game models.","[Khan, Shakeeb] Boston Coll, Dept Econ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA; [Nekipelov, Denis] Univ Virginia, Dept Econ, Charlottesville, VA USA",Boston College; University of Virginia,"Khan, S (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Dept Econ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA.",shakeeb.khan@bc.edu; denis@virginia.edu,,,NSF,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Support from the NSF is gratefully acknowledged.

Additionally, we consider two cases of agent preferences: (i) Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) preferences, which treat optimal consumption as a linear function of capital, and (ii) Hyperbolic Absolute Risk Aversion (HARA) preferences, which treat optimal consumption as an affine function of capital. By establishing a minimum (subsistence) level of consumption in the HARA model, we are able to create a framework that more accurately represents real-world circumstances than previous studies have done. Furthermore, for both the CRRA and HARA cases we show the suitable, consistent stochastic differential equation which describes the capital dynamics. Finally, we perform a numerical simulation based on the CRRA case and calibrate US data for the HARA case.","[Menoncin, Francesco; Nembrini, Stefano] Univ Brescia, Dept Econ & Management, Via S Faustino 74-B, I-25122 Brescia, Italy",University of Brescia,"Menoncin, F (通讯作者)，Univ Brescia, Dept Econ & Management, Via S Faustino 74-B, I-25122 Brescia, Italy.",francesco.menoncin@unibs.it; stefano.nembrini@unibs.com,"Menoncin, Francesco/H-3379-2019; Menoncin, Francesco/AAM-5916-2020","Menoncin, Francesco/0000-0002-1227-0871",,,,,30,5,5,0,4,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

This paper surveys the systemic risk literature with a focus on the importance of contributions made by those emphasizing a network-based approach, and how that compares with more commonly used approaches. Research on systemic risk has generally found that the risk of contagion through domino effects is minimal, and thus emphasized focusing on the resiliency of the financial system to broad macroeconomic shocks. Theoretical, methodological, and empirical work is critically examined to provide insight on how and why regulators have emphasized deregulation, diversification, size-based regulations, and portfolio-based coherent systemic risk measures. Furthermore, in the context of network analysis, this paper reviews and critically assesses newly created systemic risk measures. Network analysis and agent-based modeling approaches to understanding network formation offer promise in helping understand contagion, and also detecting fragile systems before they collapse. Theory and evidence discussed here implies that regulators and researchers need to gain an improved understanding of how topology, capital requirements, and liquidity interact.","[Neveu, Andre R.] James Madison Univ, MSC 0204, Harrisonburg, VA 22807 USA",James Madison University,"Neveu, AR (通讯作者)，James Madison Univ, MSC 0204, Harrisonburg, VA 22807 USA.",neveuax@jmu.edu,,,NYC Computational Economics & Complexity Workshop; Southern Economic Association session on Complexity in Economics and the Social Sciences,NYC Computational Economics & Complexity Workshop; Southern Economic Association session on Complexity in Economics and the Social Sciences,"The author would like to thank Ehsan Ahmed and German Creamer for helpful comments on previous drafts.

We consider two allocation systems, the I-system, in which each issue is disputed and award independently, and the A-system, in which all issues are aggregate in a single prize award. In the A-system, we propose a contest success function that aggregates the individuals' multi-issue efforts in a single outcome. Among other results, we found that the A-system tends to induce higher total effort than the I-system. The model is also able to reproduce a large set of strategic behaviors. For instance, under decreasing returns to effort, individuals maximize their payoffs by distributing effort over all issues, while under increasing returns to effort, individuals focus on a single issue. Hybrid equilibria, in which one individual focus in a single issue while the other individual diversifies effort over all issues, may also emerge when individuals hold different returns to effort. Strategic behavior is simultaneously influenced by the weight of each issue on the final outcome and by comparative advantages. Throughout the manuscript, we link our results with strategic behavior observed in electoral competition, i.e., issue ownership,issue divergence/convergenceandcommon value issues. We expect that our findings will help researchers and practitioners to better understand the process of endogenous selection of issues in competitive contexts and to provide guidance in the implementation of the optimal allocation mechanism.","[Osorio, Antonio] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, Reus, Barcelona, Spain; [Osorio, Antonio] CREIP, Reus, Barcelona, Spain",Universitat Rovira i Virgili,"Osório, A (通讯作者)，Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, Reus, Barcelona, Spain.;Osório, A (通讯作者)，CREIP, Reus, Barcelona, Spain.",superacosta@hotmail.com,"Osório, António M/L-6243-2014","Osório, António M/0000-0003-3376-0164",Barcelona Graduate School of Economics; Univ.

Concerns regarding model misspecification induce a tradeoff between incentives and ambiguity sharing, which increases the pay-performance sensitivity. When compensation contracts can be written on some additional signal, such as industry average performance, we find that an ambiguity-averse principal increases the agent's exposure to the common shock by reducing the use of relative performance evaluation. Thus, optimal contracting involves effectively paying for luck and our model provides a theoretical explanation for the well-documented lack of relative performance evaluation in CEO compensation from the perspective of model uncertainty.","[Wu, Yaoyao; Zou, Zhentao] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Yang, Jinqiang] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Shanghai Key Lab Financial Informat Technol, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Yang, JQ (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Shanghai Key Lab Financial Informat Technol, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",wuyaoyao2014@163.sufe.edu.cn; yang.jinqiang@mail.shufe.edu.cn; zhentao_zou@163.com,"zhang, xueying/JMB-7808-2023",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71202007, 71522008, 71573033, 71532009, 71532012, 71401095/G0115]; Innovative Research Team of Shanghai University of Finance and Economics [2016110241]; Fok Ying-Tong Education Foundation of China [151086]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Innovative Research Team of Shanghai University of Finance and Economics; Fok Ying-Tong Education Foundation of China,"Jinqiang Yang acknowledges the support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (#71202007, #71522008, #71573033, #71532009, and #71532012), Innovative Research Team of Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (#2016110241), and Fok Ying-Tong Education Foundation of China (#151086).

Our regression results show that intermediate input imports promote manufacturing firms' export quality through variety effects' and innovation effects', though the effects are significantly different among firms with different characteristics, and the magnitude of these effects differs across import sources and the quality of imported intermediate inputs themselves. Moreover, we find that a good institutional environment is conducive to the strengthening of the positive influence of intermediate input importson export quality. Furthermore, the dynamic decomposition demonstrates that the reallocation effect is the key force through which imported inputs boost industrial aggregate quality growth. Taken together, these results suggest that product upgrading facilitated by quality embedded in imported intermediate inputs, a good institutional environment and market share reallocation help Chinese firms to improve the quality of their export products.","[Xu, Jiayun] Nankai Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr China Econ, Asia Pacific Econ Cooperat APEC Study Ctr, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Mao, Qilin] Nankai Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr China Econ, Ctr Transnatl Study, Inst Int Econ, Tianjin, Peoples R China",Nankai University; Nankai University,"Xu, JY (通讯作者)，Nankai Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr China Econ, Asia Pacific Econ Cooperat APEC Study Ctr, Tianjin, Peoples R China.",xujiayun321@163.com; maoqilin@nankai.edu.cn,"xu, jiayun/AAQ-1492-2020",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71773055]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [63172019]; Special Program of Talents Development for Excellent Youth Scholars in Tianjin; Humanities and Social Sciences section of the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China [16YJC790114]; China Postdoctoral Science Special Foundation [2017T100056],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Special Program of Talents Development for Excellent Youth Scholars in Tianjin; Humanities and Social Sciences section of the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China; China Postdoctoral Science Special Foundation,"We would like to thank the editor Guido Friebel and anonymous referees for their very helpful comments and constructive suggestions.

We present evidence that standard inflation measures do not reflect the contemporaneous state of housing rents, which are a large part of price indexes. Using a new housing rent index (RRI) developed by Ambrose et al. (2015), we compute the RRI-based Taylor rule for the period from 2000 to 2010. The modified Taylor rule indicates that seemingly large deviations are better understood as delays due to the stale information regarding housing rents. It also provides a justification for Quantitative Easing and a better alternative to other versions of Taylor rules.","[Ambrose, Brent W.] Penn State Univ, Inst Real Estate Studies, Smeal Coll Business, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Ambrose, Brent W.; Yoshida, Jiro] Penn State Univ, Dept Risk Management, Smeal Coll Business, 368 Business Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Coulson, N.

Rather than providing full protection against floods, spatial-planning measures aim to reduce the impacts of floods by encouraging damage mitigation in local-level spatial-planning and building choices. This turn to spatial-planning measures has important implications for how costs and responsibilities are divided in flood governance. This paper examines the role of experts in shaping the distributive aspects of this shift. Using a theoretical framework on institutional change, the role of experts is analyzed in two case studies. The first focuses on the United States, where a turn to spatial-planning measures was made in the 1960s. The second case study looks at this turn Dutch flood governance, which has always been characterized by a strong safety paradigm. The paper draws conclusions about the effects of expert-influence on distributive decision-making underlying institutional changes in both cases.","[Bergsma, Emmy] KWR Watercycle Res Inst, Nieuwegein, Netherlands",KWR Watercycle Research Institute,"Bergsma, E (通讯作者)，KWR Watercycle Res Inst, Nieuwegein, Netherlands.",emmy.bergsma@kwrwater.nl,,,,,,,83,6,6,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

First, this paper shows that more educated workers have higher wage growth with work experience than less educated workers. Second, it demonstrates that more educated workers suffer greater wage losses following job displacement. I propose a model that integrates human capital accumulation and learning mechanisms that can explain these empirical findings. In the model, employers use both education and past job displacement as a signal of a worker's unobservable ability. As a result, educated workers receive more on-the-job training in the beginning of their careers. In addition, educated workers suffer greater wage losses after being laid off when potential employers learn that an educated worker is low ability.","[Braga, Breno] Urban Inst, Washington, DC 20037 USA",Urban Institute,"Braga, B (通讯作者)，Urban Inst, Washington, DC 20037 USA.",bbraga@urban.org,,,,,,,53,2,2,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5371,1879-1034,,LABOUR ECON,Labour Econ.,JUN,2018,52.0,,,,,,83,97,,10.1016/j.labeco.2018.03.004,0.0,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GL1ZV,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000436913700008,0

A Phillips Curve Perspective,ECONOMIC RECORD,,,English,Article,,,,,,,INFLATION,"Wages growth in Australia has recently been the lowest in two decades. One possible explanation is a decline in the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU). We examine this hypothesis by estimating a wage Phillips curve including a time-varying NAIRU. Our findings are: (i) the NAIRU has recently been around 5.5 per cent; (ii) our approach increases the precision of the NAIRU estimates; (iii) low inflation expectations have been an important contributing factor; and (iv) the long-run annual wages growth is nearly 3 per cent. We also find that the underutilisation rate suggests greater slack exists, but is less useful in explaining wage developments.","[Chua, Chew Lian] Univ Nottingham Ningbo China, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Robinson, Tim] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Nottingham Ningbo China; University of Melbourne,"Robinson, T (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",tim.robinson@unimelb.edu.au,"; Robinson, Tim/I-7223-2015","Chua, Chew/0000-0003-3201-9497; Robinson, Tim/0000-0002-7831-3336",ARC [DP160102654],ARC(Australian Research Council),This research was supported by ARC DP160102654.,,26,6,6,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

When analyzing data from discrete choice experiments it is typically assumed that people make rational utility maximizing decisions, i.e., that they consider all of the attribute information and compare all alternatives. However, mounting evidence shows that people use a wide range of simplifying strategies that are inconsistent with utility maximization. We use a flexible model capturing a two-stage decision process. In the first stage, respondents are allowed to eliminate from their choice set alternatives that contain an unacceptable level, in this case restrictions on the use of heating and electricity. In the second stage, respondents choose in a compensatory manner between the remaining alternatives. Our results show that about half of the respondents choose according to an elimination-by-aspects strategy, and that, on average, they are unwilling to accept any restrictions on heating in the evening or electricity use irrespective of time-of-day. Furthermore, considering elimination-by-aspects behavior leads to a downward shift in elicited willingness-to-accept. We discuss implications for policy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

To do this, we exploit a local policy change in Denmark that targeted unemployed people without unemployment insurance. Our results show that crime rates decreased among treated men relative to both untreated unemployment insured and uninsured men. Lower property crime accounted for the decrease in overall crime. Increased earnings from higher employment rates cannot explain the decrease in crime. Instead, participation in the active labor market program reduced young men's propensity to commit crime.

Our core findings are that the single most robust covariate of inflation is unit labour cost. We further decompose unit labour cost into changes in the nominal wage and real labour productivity. The principal association is a strong positive relationship between inflation and nominal wages, while improvements in real labour productivity report only a relatively weak negative association with inflation. Supply-side shocks also consistently report an association with inflation. As to demand-side shocks, the output gap does not return a robust statistical association with inflation. Instead, it is growth in the money supply and government expenditure which return robust and theoretically consistent associations with inflationary pressure.","[Fedderke, Johannes] Penn State Univ, 237 Katz, State Coll, PA 16802 USA; [Liu, Yang] Peking Univ, Ctr New Struct Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Peking University,"Fedderke, J (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, 237 Katz, State Coll, PA 16802 USA.",jwf15@psu.edu,"Fedderke, Johannes/N-1411-2019","Fedderke, Johannes/0000-0003-4482-5939",,,,,55,3,3,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

It is demonstrated that if the two firms have symmetric technologies with increasing marginal extraction costs and the same resource stocks, then neither full nationalization of any of the two firms nor full privatization will be socially desirable. It is shown that the presence of a semi-public firm improves intertemporal allocation of the fixed resource stock. Thus, partial privatization is optimal even under exogenously fixed total outputs of each firm.

From the mid 1970s through the early 2000s, a few large-scale and hierarchically organized cartels dominated the market. Since 2006, dozens of smaller and more-specialized units have emerged. We notice that the prohibition efforts of federal governments (primarily Mexico and the U.S.) imposed costs asymmetrically across differently sized drug trafficking organizations (DTOs). Under president Calderon (office held from 2006-2012), efforts were arranged as kingpin or decapitation strategies and were primarily focused on arresting key leaders of the largest and most infamous operations. This asymmetric enforcement structure evoked unique strategic responses from differently sized DTOs. Larger DTOs splintered into smaller units. Smaller outfits remained small and sought more specialized roles in the more decentralized and competitive supply chain. Furthermore, we argue that subsequent changes in operating costs amidst this less concentrated environment, tended to exaggerate the asymmetric cost structure across differently sized DTOs. Larger DTOs in a more competitive illicit market cannot exploit economies of scale to maintain internal coordination and loyalty as easily as they once could with fewer rival DTOs. In result, the seemingly persistent industrial organization of the international drug trade has remained less concentrated than in previous decades. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Enforcement policies such as wage withholding also may affect father-child contact even when the amount of support paid is not affected if they change bargaining power between parents or the salience of fathers' child support obligations. I develop a model of the salience of child support obligations which predicts that introduction of automatic withholding will reduce contact between noncustodial parents and children independent of payment amount. I then examine whether paying child support via wage withholding affects fathers' frequency of contact with their children and their provision of in-kind support using instrumental variables and bounded OLS techniques for selection on unobservables. Withholding appears to decrease father-child contact. Withholding effects do not occur when payments are made to government agencies or courts but are present when payments go directly to the mother, consistent with bargaining models. More frequent payment schedules are associated with more contact, consistent with salience effects.","[Gunter, Samara R.] Colby Coll, Dept Econ, 5230 Mayflower Hill, Waterville, ME 04901 USA",Colby College,"Gunter, SR (通讯作者)，Colby Coll, Dept Econ, 5230 Mayflower Hill, Waterville, ME 04901 USA.",srgunter@colby.edu,,,University of Michigan Rackham One-Term Dissertation Fellowship,University of Michigan Rackham One-Term Dissertation Fellowship,"I am very grateful to Charlie Brown, Brian Cadena, Adam Cole, Josh Congdon-Hohman, Sandy Danziger, Taryn Dinkelman, Naomi Feldman, Ann Ferris, Ben Keys, Joel Slemrod, Jeff Smith, two anonymous referees, and many seminar participants for helpful comments and suggestions, and Tim Marshall at the Census for data assistance.

A significant portion of this increase has come from output in the Marcellus region of Pennsylvania. This output has altered gas markets and repositioned Pennsylvania as a major gas exporter. It has also put Pennsylvania at odds with other states as it is one of a few without a formal severance tax on extractive resources. In this paper, we combine results from a structural demand model with a two-sector trade model to analyze the interstate welfare impacts of Pennsylvania's current severance tax proposal. Our results demonstrate that most of the welfare losses from this proposed policy are likely to be shifted to residents in other states. We also demonstrate how fluctuations in gas prices can substantially reduce tax revenue.

In this study, we focus on one specific non-cognitive skill, namely locus of control, which represents the extent to which an individual believes that life events are outcomes of his/her own actions. Using Australian panel data, we show that locus of control is positively related to the risk attitudes of older individuals who also differ significantly from younger individuals. The observed difference in risk attitudes between the young and the old is found among females but not males.

I use a unique data set of weekly gasoline prices across 44 Canadian cities to analyze how the existence of variation in the available modes of transportation for gasoline between cities (via pipeline, marine tanker, rail or truck) accounts for observed price differences across locations. I find that the supply network is significant - cities connected by lower cost-per-unit methods like pipelines or seaports exhibit smaller mean- and weekly-price differences than those connected only by road or rail, after controlling for distance, regional effects and market size. A pipeline connection results in a reduction in weekly price dispersion equivalent to a 53% reduction in distance between cities, while a maritime connection has the equivalent effect of a 38% reduction in distance between cities.","[Malloy, Brandon] St Francis Xavier Univ, Dept Econ, Antigonish, NS, Canada",Saint Francis Xavier University - Canada,"Malloy, B (通讯作者)，St Francis Xavier Univ, Dept Econ, Antigonish, NS, Canada.",bmalloy@stfx.ca,,"Malloy, Brandon/0000-0001-8616-5014",,,,,29,0,0,0,5,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

The economic growth, the foreign investment (FDI), and the employment in R&D are positive factors that foster the innovation. However, the labor force with tertiary education, the wages, the private funding of R&D, the financial development, and the technological infrastructure are negative factors that deter the innovation. Moreover, this study bridges a gap in the extant literature by examining the main determinants of the innovation capacity in the developing countries located in the same region.

We examine these consequences by incorporating a nonrenewable resource and an alternative energy source in a market economy model of endogenous growth through expanding varieties. During the energy transition, technological progress is nonmonotonic over time: It declines initially, starts increasing when the economy approaches the regime shift, and jumps down once the resource stock is exhausted. A moment of peak-oil does no longer necessarily occur, and simultaneous use of the resource and the alternative energy source will take place if the return to innovation becomes too low. Subsidies to research and development (R&D) and to renewables production speed up the energy transition, whereas a tax on fossil fuels postpones the switch to renewable energy.","[van der Meijden, Gerard] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van der Meijden, Gerard] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Smulders, Sjak] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Smulders, Sjak] CESifo, Munich, Germany",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute; Tilburg University; Ifo Institut,"van der Meijden, G (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",g.c.vander.meijden@vu.nl,"van der Meijden, Gerard/AAZ-1797-2020","Smulders, Sjak/0000-0003-3753-6469",FP7-IDEAS-ERC [269788],FP7-IDEAS-ERC,"We would like to thank Reyer Gerlagh, Jenny Ligthart, Rick van der Ploeg, Hiroaki Sakamoto, Ralph Winter, Cees Withagen, Aart de Zeeuw, and conference participants in Paris, Ascona, Prague, and Venice for helpful comments.

The results of this literature are highly fragile, arguably because the commonly used indicators of trade are not well defined to capture the contribution of globalization to deindustrialization. While this empirical study does not necessarily contradict the widespread belief that the internal factors are quantitatively more important in accounting for deindustrialization in the OECD taken as a whole, our empirical results - based on panel data for 15 OECD advanced countries from 1970 to 2006 - nevertheless show that global exchanges have the potential to affect significantly and substantially a country's sectoral patterns of employment.

To assess the impact of climate change on China's rice production, this paper re-organizes the main rice-producing areas by adding up the annual production of the provincial level regions between 1979 and 2011, utilizes Cobb-Douglas function using daily weather data over the whole growing season. Our analysis of the panel data shows that minimum temperatures (Tmin), maximum temperatures (Tmax), temperature difference (TD) and precipitation (RP) are the four key climate determinants of rice production in China. Among these, temperature difference is surprisingly significant and all except maximum temperatures have positive effects. However, because the actual minimum temperatures and precipitation in China's main rice-producing areas declined while the maximum temperatures and the temperature difference increased during our sample period, climate change has actually provided a negative contribution to the increase in China's rice production.","[Wang, Dan] Hubei Univ Econ, Sch Econ Environm & Resources, Wuhan 430205, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Wang, Dan] Ctr Hubei Cooperat Innovat Emiss Trading Syst, Wuhun 430205, Peoples R China; [Hao, Yu] Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Hao, Yu] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Hao, Yu] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Elect Vehicles Beijing, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jianpei] Hubei Univ Econ, Sch Business Adm, Wuhan 430205, Hubei, Peoples R China",Hubei University of Economics; Beijing Institute of Technology; Beijing Institute of Technology; Hubei University of Economics,"Wang, D (通讯作者)，Hubei Univ Econ, Sch Econ Environm & Resources, Wuhan 430205, Hubei, Peoples R China.;Wang, D (通讯作者)，Ctr Hubei Cooperat Innovat Emiss Trading Syst, Wuhun 430205, Peoples R China.",danwang_sunny@163.com; haoyuking@gmail.com; 13971238567@163.com,"lei, lei/JSL-3106-2023","Hao, Yu/0000-0001-8394-4215",,,,,31,8,8,3,40,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

Yet this is not the case in the data. Understanding the measured discrepancy between the MPL and the MRS, commonly referred as the labor wedge, is important to comprehend the limitations of economic models and thereafter improve them. The labor wedge has increased significantly during the Great Recession, but the mechanism of its variation in the credit crunch has not been well understood. This paper fills in this gap by studying the labor wedge in a DSGE model with collateral borrowing constraints. I find that a credit crunch can affect the labor wedge through a mechanism different from that of an exogenous TFP shock when there are endogenous entry and exit of production. With entry and exit, the tightening of the collateral constraints can cause the gap between the real wage and the MRS to increase, but the exogenous TFP shock does not have this mechanism. As a result, the labor wedge has higher increases in the credit crunch. When entry and exit are shut down, the labor wedge would have much smaller increases in the credit crunch.","[Zhang, Lini] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Zhang, LN (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhang.lini@cufe.edu.cn,,,,,,,47,1,4,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0164-0704,1873-152X,,J MACROECON,J.

Second, this paper proposes a generalized logarithmic mean Divisia index (GLMDI) method and combines additive and multiplicative decomposition to decompose DVA gaps between China and the other four countries into value added coefficient effect, input-output structure effect, domestic scale effect and foreign scale effect. The aggregate value added coefficient effect is then attributed to sectoral level. Results show that DVA always occupied the largest share in the gross exports of China, which ranged from 74.60-82.84% during 2000-2014. Before 2011, DVA share of China's exports was generally the second smallest among five countries; since 2011, DVA share of China's exports increased, and China had the largest DVA share in 2014 (81.39%). Sectors having a large FVA share in China's exports usually had a large DVA share, such as Mining (MIN), Computers, Electronic and Optical (CEO), and Basic Metals (BAS). Additive and multiplicative decomposition analyses indicate that value added coefficients had a negative and increased effect on DVA gaps between China and the other four countries.

We argue that stochastic stability points to the latter notion of mean growth as the theoretically relevant one. Our discussion is cast within the class of continuous-time AK-type models subject to geometric Brownian motions. First, stability concepts related to stochastic linear homogeneous differential equations are introduced and applied to the canonical AK model. It is readily shown that exponential balanced-growth paths are not robust to uncertainty. In a second application, we evaluate the quantitative implications of adopting the stochastic stability-related concept of mean growth for the comparative statics of global diversification in the seminal model due to Obstfeld (1994).

The risk-neutral version of the stochastic price model is typically used in academic work; however, risk-adjusted models of the expected spot price are often used in practice. These two approaches are connected by a risk premium which is unfortunately often difficult to estimate. In this work, we use natural gas futures prices in a Kalman filter approach with maximum likelihood estimation to parameterize the Schwartz and Smith (2000) stochastic price model, and then apply an asset pricing model to address the large uncertainty of the risk premia parameter estimates. To evaluate the impact of the risk premia and other parameters in the two-factor price model on project valuation, we apply the price model to a prototypical shale gas investment, both for a base reference case as well as for cases where there are real options to optimally time decisions to invest or to abandon the project. Using this approach, we are able to determine the implied risk-adjusted discount rate that would be used with the spot price forecast, given the two-factor model risk premia, and we also discuss the impact of the risk premia on project value relative to other model parameters.

I provide evidence that foreign direct investment (FDI) flows into a developing country are positively associated with IPRs in that country, as well as IPRs in adjacent developing countries. This finding suggests the presence of multilateral effects related to IPRs that existing analyses do not account for. I develop a general equilibrium international product cycle model to accommodate these spillovers, and find that they create an individual incentive to maintain weak IPRs. However, strengthening IPRs through a multilateral agreement improves welfare among all reforming countries. I argue that this finding suggests a novel justification of international IPRs agreements among developing countries; by preventing free-riding behavior, these agreements allow mutual benefit through collective policy action.

The price spread between WTI and Brent is also an important benchmark itself as the spread affects international trade in oil, refiner margins, and the price of refined products globally. In addition, the shapes of the WTI and Brent futures curves reflect supply and demand fundamentals in the U.S. versus the world market, respectively. On the analysis of the relationship between the two futures prices, we identify a structural break in the WTI Brent price spread in January 2011 and a break in the corresponding shapes of the futures curves around the same time. The structural break was a consequence of a dramatic rise in U.S. production due to fracking, a series of supply disruptions in Europe, binding storage constraints, and the U.S. crude oil export ban. These events are studied in the context of a simulation model of world oil prices. We reproduce the stylized facts of the oil market and conclude that the 2011 break in pricing structure was consistent with standard commodity storage theory. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

To provide new insights into the debate over the linkage among export, technology, and performance, we employ several important performance indicators of firms, such as labor productivity, total factor productivity, product and process innovation, wage, size, and capacity utilization. For this study, we utilize a sample of firms from a recent Enterprise Surveys data of the World Bank on Indian manufacturing. The results of the analysis indicate that exporters are more productive and innovative. They are also large and utilize the capacity in a better way. The results further indicate that export leads to substantial performance gain for Indian firms. Similar results are also estimated for the effects of the use of foreign technology in the production process. Our findings also suggest that exporting products to the developed world have a significant effect on performance and further indicate that single product firms are more benefited from export and technology transfer than multi-product firms. It is also found that firms with more productivity decide to export their products; however, technology transfer is not a significant factor in making decisions about export or enhancing export-intensity. Overall, our analysis supports the argument that research and development (R&D) in the developed countries is an important source of technology for developing countries, and this takes place through export as well as direct technology transfer.

However, if in the reported results, a researcher selects the bandwidth based on this analysis, the associated confidence intervals (CIs) may not have correct coverage, even if the estimator is unbiased. This article proposes a simple adjustment that gives correct coverage in such situations: replace the normal quantile with a critical value that depends only on the kernel and ratio of the maximum and minimum bandwidths the researcher has entertained. We tabulate these critical values and quantify the loss in coverage for conventional CIs. For a range of relevant cases, a conventional 95% CI has coverage between 70% and 90%, and our adjustment amounts to replacing the conventional critical value 1.96 with a number between 2.2 and 2.8.

By construction the model allows monetary policy to affect the labor share through two channels, i.e. one linking the policy rate to the real interest rate and another linking the latter to the useful life of producers' goods, whereas regarding market structure, the more competitive the economy, the higher the labor share. From its solution using U.S. data over the period 2000-2014 it emerges that the persistent reduction in the policy rate on the one hand slowed down the decline in the labor share and on the other accelerated it, because the reduction in the policy rate was accompanied by a robust upward trend in the equilibrium real rate of interest, which increased the useful life of producers' goods. In turn, to gauge the relative strength of these two opposite effects, the equation of the labor share is estimated by means of the autoregressive distributed lag method. The results show that the adverse effect of monetary policy through the useful life of producers' goods was more than 12 times as strong as the favorable effect of the policy rate and on this ground I conclude that the monetary policy contributed to the decline of the labor share significantly, at least since 2000. As for the market structure, it is found that even if firms had and attempted to exercise monopoly power, it would be exceedingly difficult to exploit it because the demand of consumers' goods is significantly price elastic.","[Bitros, George C.] Athens Univ Econ & Business, 76 Patis St, Athens 10434, Greece",Athens University of Economics & Business,"Bitros, GC (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, 76 Patis St, Athens 10434, Greece.",bitros@aueb.gr,,,,,,,34,2,2,1,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Our preferred estimates address the endogeneity of local alcohol policies by exploiting differences in counties' religious compositions between the 1930s, when most local-option votes took place, and recent years. Even controlling for current religious affiliations, religious composition following the end of national Prohibition strongly predicts current alcohol restrictions. We carefully examine the validity of our identifying assumptions, and consider identification under alternative assumptions.

If a risk-averse executive faces price risk through his incentive contract, changes in stock volatility due to dividend taxes may increase agency costs and therefore decrease overall welfare. In this paper, I use a decrease in dividend taxes as a natural experiment to identify their effect on the firm's idiosyncratic stock return volatility. Stock volatility decreased after the tax cut for firms at which executives have larger sensitivity to stock price in their incentive compensation package relative to firms at which executives have a smaller sensitivity. Therefore, with risk-averse executives and risk-neutral shareholders, dividend taxes may exacerbate agency costs. The increase in agency costs will decrease shareholder welfare, which can be partially offset by the use of options in the employment contract.","[Ferris, Erin E.

In particular, we test if a sizable share of macroeconomic fluctuations is generated by firm-specific shocks to sales and productivity. We examine monthly firm-level data and find that the idiosyncratic shocks affecting large corporations explain around a third of business cycle fluctuations. This fact holds true both when we use the cross-sectional averages of sales and the estimated common factors, to control for common shocks. Moreover, we observe that the largest four corporations are the main drivers of this result. Finally, we detect a clear break in this relationship coinciding with the Great Recession. In particular, from 2010 onward the firm-level shocks lose their explanatory power.

I develop and estimate a structural.model capable of explaining the patterns of both equity extraction and default observed among this group of homeowners. In the model, households who have taken out equity have both higher loan-to-value ratios and increased mortgage payments relative to their income, a combination that makes them more likely to default. Using this model to analyze a policy that limits the maximum size of cash-out refinances to 80% of the current house value, I find that this restriction would reduce defaults by 18%, partially by inducing households to purchase less expensive homes.

When information costs are high, the design of contracts under private information prevents some households from borrowing with a risk of default.

The first is whether government can overcome its own failures, namely knowledge constraints and rent-seeking, to correct market failures. The second is whether government should go beyond horizontal policies to adopt more activist interventions such as winner-picking The third is whether intervention should follow or defy the country's comparative advantage. Singapore's experience in developing a globally competitive petrochemicals industry, within only a few decades and through vigorous interventions, provides meaningful insights into these debates and offers valuable lessons for developing countries.

They make use of several robust techniques that allow them to identify such periods by determining when prices start to exhibit explosivity with respect to its past behaviour and when it recedes to long term stable prices. The first technique used is the Generalized supADF (GSADF) test procedure developed by Phillips et al. (Testing for multiple bubbles: Historical episodes of exuberance and collapse in the S&P 500, 2011a), which allows the recursive identification of multiple periods of price explosivity. The second approach makes use of Robinson's test statistic (Efficient tests of nonstationary hypotheses, 1994), comparing the null of a unit root process against the alternative of specified orders of fractional integration. The analysis date-stamps several periods of US house price explosivity, allowing the authors to contextualize its historic relevance.","[Balcilar, Mehmet; Gupta, Rangan] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Econ, Famagusta, Northern Cyprus, Turkey; [Balcilar, Mehmet] Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier, France; [Balcilar, Mehmet; Gupta, Rangan] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa; [Katzke, Nico] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Econ, Stellenbosch, South Africa",Eastern Mediterranean University; Montpellier Business School; University of Pretoria; Stellenbosch University,"Balcilar, M (通讯作者)，Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Econ, Famagusta, Northern Cyprus, Turkey.;Balcilar, M (通讯作者)，Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier, France.;Balcilar, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa.",mehmet@mbalcilar.net,"BALCILAR, MEHMET/K-7346-2019","BALCILAR, MEHMET/0000-0001-9694-5196; Katzke, Nico/0000-0003-1939-8939",,,,,59,1,1,1,11,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,MAR 29,2018,12.0,,,,,,,,201818.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2018-18,0.0,,,33,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GB0AK,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428704800001,0

The study further analysed the efficiency of three different time series models such as the Autoregressive model (A.R. with seasonal dummies), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model (A.R.I.M.A.), and the Vector Autoregression (V.A.R.) model. In any economy, tax analysis and forecasting of revenues is of paramount importance to ensure the economic and fiscal policies. This study is important to identify significant variables affecting tax revenue specifically in Pakistan. The data used for this paper was from July 1985 to December 2016 (monthly) and focused on forecasting for 2017. For the forecasting of total tax revenue, we used components of tax revenues such as direct tax, sales tax, federal excise duty and customs duties. The results of this study revealed that among these models the A.R.I.M.A. model gives better-forecasted values for the total tax revenues of Pakistan. The results further demonstrated that major tax revenue is generated by indirect taxes, which cause more inflation that directly hits the working class of Pakistan.","[Streimikiene, Dalia; Vveinhardt, Jolita] Inst Sport Sci & Innovat, Kaunas, Lithuania; [Ahmed, Rizwan Raheem; Ghauri, Saghir Pervaiz] Indus Univ, Fac Managment Sci, Gulshan, Pakistan; [Zahid, Sarwar] Bahria Univ, Dept Business Adm, Islamabad, Pakistan",,"Streimikiene, D (通讯作者)，Inst Sport Sci & Innovat, Kaunas, Lithuania.",dalia@mail.lei.lt,"Vveinhardt, Jolita/AAB-6754-2020; Streimikiene, Dalia/AAD-7762-2020; Ahmed, Rizwan Raheem/B-9632-2016","Vveinhardt, Jolita/0000-0001-6231-9402; Ahmed, Rizwan Raheem/0000-0001-5844-5502",,,,,51,10,11,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We characterize the set of stable solutions of a multiple partners matching game in two different ways and show how this leads to simple proofs for a number of results of Sotomayor (1992, 1999, 2007) for multiple partners assignment games and to generalizations of some of these results to multiple partners matching games.

Girls who were exposed to the reform had more education, higher age at first marriage, and low fertility than girls who were not exposed to the reform. We find that the effect of the reform on adolescent fertility and early marriage decreases with age, and that the effect becomes statistically insignificant after age 19. There is some evidence that education affects adolescent fertility and early marriage as a result of knowledge acquisition, but we could find no evidence to support the view that education induces abstinence. Finally, we demonstrate that the effect of education on fertility and marital status differs by household wealth level and urban/rural community type.","[Boahen, Emmanuel Adu; Yamauchi, Chikako] Grad Res Inst Policy Studies, Minato Ku, 7-22-1 Roppngi, Tokyo 1068677, Japan",National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies,"Boahen, EA (通讯作者)，Grad Res Inst Policy Studies, Minato Ku, 7-22-1 Roppngi, Tokyo 1068677, Japan.",adu19801@yahoo.co.uk,"Adu Boahen, Emmanuel Adu/AAX-3680-2021",,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15H02619] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,48,18,22,3,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

Using data for the USA, Japan and Europe, our results show that material off-shoring promotes high-tech specialization through input reallocation between sectors, while service off-shoring favors technologically advanced production by increasing within-industry productivity, mainly via its positive impact on R&D. Conversely, we find that the increasing fragmentation of core production tasks, captured by narrow off-shoring, has adverse effects on technological specialisation, which suggests that this type of off-shoring is mainly pursued for cost-reduction motives.","[Bournakis, Ioannis; Vecchi, Michela] Middlesex Univ, Sch Business, Dept Econ, The Burroughs London NW4 4BT, England; [Vecchi, Michela; Venturini, Francesco] Natl Inst Econ & Social Res, London, England; [Venturini, Francesco] Univ Perugia, Dept Econ, Perugia, Italy",Middlesex University; University of Perugia,"Vecchi, M (通讯作者)，Middlesex Univ, Sch Business, Dept Econ, The Burroughs London NW4 4BT, England.",m.vecchi@mdx.ac.uk,"Venturini, Francesco/AFC-0519-2022; Bournakis, Ioannis/AAG-3244-2020","Venturini, Francesco/0000-0002-7295-268X; Bournakis, Ioannis/0000-0002-7065-9316",,,,,67,3,3,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

First, we study the extent to which teacher qualifications often considered important inputs to classroom quality are valued by providers during the hiring process. We then examine the impact of state regulations on hiring decisions. To do so, a resume audit study was administered in which job-seeker characteristics were randomly assigned to resumes that were submitted in response to real child care job postings in 14 U.S. cities. Our results indicate that center-based providers may not hire the most qualified applicants. For example, we find that although providers have a strong preference for individuals with previous work experience in early childhood education (ECE), those with more ECE experience are less likely to receive an interview than those with less experience. We also find that individuals with bachelor's degrees in ECE are no more likely to receive an interview than their counterparts at the associate's level. Our analysis of state regulations shows that they strongly influence teacher hiring decisions. We find that providers' advertised job requirements are largely in compliance with the state standards for teachers' experience and education. In addition, providers are substantially more likely to interview job-seekers who meet these requirements. Given that most providers voluntarily exceed the state regulations, a tentative conclusion is that such rules have a limited effect on child care supply and prices.","[Boyd-Swan, Casey] Kent State Univ, Kent, OH 44242 USA; [Herbst, Chris M.] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Kent; Kent State University Salem; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Herbst, CM (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",cboydswa@kent.edu; chris.herbst@asu.edu,"Boyd-Swan, Casey/O-9892-2019","Boyd-Swan, Casey/0000-0003-3869-5648",College of Public Service and Community Solutions at ASU; Smith Richardson Foundation [2016-1160],College of Public Service and Community Solutions at ASU; Smith Richardson Foundation,"The authors contributed equally to this project and are considered co-lead authors.

Using this policy experiment, we address the endogeneity of pension income by applying a fixed-effect model with instrumental variable correction. The results reveal that pension enrollment and income from the NRPS both have had a significant beneficial impact on objective measures of physical health and cognitive function of the rural elderly. Pension recipients respond to the newly acquired pension income in multiple ways: improved nutrition intake, better accessibility to health care, increased informal care, increased leisure activities, and better self-perceived relative economic situation. These in turn act as channels from pension income to health outcomes of the Chinese rural elderly.

A mail survey was conducted in three regions of the western US from randomly selected wheat farmers. Data was analyzed using Heckman's two stage selection model to correct for selection bias. Under favorable contracts, the study found that 58% of sample farmers were willing to adopt oilseeds as bio-energy crops and initially contribute an average of 160 acres of land for production per farm. Concerning farmers' adoption decisions, factors such as experience growing oilseed crops, availability of a nearby crushing facility, use of no till, being a first adopter and having a college degree positively affected adoption, while risk behavior, farm experience and gender negatively affected adoption. With regard to the land allocation decision, factors such as farm income and gender positively affected land allocation decisions, whereas percentage of land rented on a crop share basis, profit ratio (wheat/canola) and livestock ownership negatively affected land allocation decisions.

Yet most models abstract from these issues and assume that agents successfully tackle selection problems. We design an experiment where a person who understands selection observes all the data required to account for it. Subjects make choices under uncertainty and their choices reveal valuable information that is biased due to the presence of unobservables. We find that almost no subjects optimally account for endogenous selection. On the other hand, behavior is far from random, but actually quite amenable to analysis: Subjects follow simple heuristics that result in a partial accounting of selection and mitigate mistakes.","[Esponda, Ignacio; Vespa, Emanuel] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Econ, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Esponda, I (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Econ, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",iesponda@ucsb.edu; vespa@ucsb.edu,,,NYU's Center for Experimental Social Science; UCSB's Center for Scientific Computing from the CNSI; MRL:NSF MRSEC [DMR-1121053]; NSF [CNS-0960316],NYU's Center for Experimental Social Science; UCSB's Center for Scientific Computing from the CNSI; MRL:NSF MRSEC; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank Roland Benabou, Erik Eyster, Kfir Eliaz, Guillaume Frechette, Drew Fudenberg, Philippe Jehiel, Muriel Niederle, Stefan Penczynski, Demian Pouzo, Andrew Schotter, Bernardo Silveira, Ran Spiegler, Charles Sprenger, Georg Weiszacker, Alistair Wilson, Leeat Yariv, and several seminar participants and anonymous referees for helpful comments.

Evidence from the euro-area,JOURNAL OF POLICY MODELING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Exports; Domestic demand pressures; External adjustment,DOMESTIC DEMAND; PANEL-DATA; PERFORMANCE; PRESSURE,"The recent crisis in some euro area countries is intensively fueling the political and economic policy debate about the effectiveness of the applied adjustment programs. This paper aims to contribute to explaining why the results of these programs could be different across countries, flagging the crucial role of exports. In view of recent economic literature about substitution between domestic and foreign sales, helping exports when domestic demand is adjusting, this paper uses panel data techniques to assess the role of the export structure in explaining this substitution effect in the euro area countries. Building a novel indicator for product concentration, the results suggest that domestic demand developments are more relevant to explaining exports in countries with a lower product concentration index (that is, more diversified exports). This contributes to explain why euro area countries under stress registered different economic performance, in particular the clearly less favorable behavior of Greece, where exports structure is concentrated more strongly in some goods and services than in other euro area countries. With different export behavior the final evaluation of the Greek adjustment would be certainly different. These results suggest that export structure should be taken into consideration when designing or evaluating this type of adjustment programs. (C) 2017 The Society for Policy Modeling.

Both shares are much higher than those observed at any point in the 2000s. In this paper, we describe how nonbank mortgage companies are vulnerable to liquidity pressures in both their loan origination and servicing activities, and we document that this sector in the aggregate appears to have minimal resources to bring to bear in an adverse scenario. We show how the same liquidity issues unfolded during the financial crisis, leading to the failure of many nonbank companies, requests for government assistance, and harm to consumers. The high share of nonbank lenders in FHA and VA lending suggests that the government has significant exposure to the vulnerabilities of nonbank lenders, but this issue has received very little attention in the housing reform debate.","[Kim, You Suk; Laufer, Steven M.; Pence, Karen] Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC 20551 USA; [Stanton, Richard; Wallace, Nancy] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Kim, YS (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",,"Stanton, Richard/AAW-2551-2021",,"Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the University of California, Berkeley","Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the University of California, Berkeley","The authors received financial support for this work from the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the University of California, Berkeley.

We introduce a health-care efficiency assessment model construed on the elements of Saint-Simon's utopistic theory. Social morality and technological optimism are analyzed to conscript arts of doctrinal ends with arts of productivity. A debate between the technocratic and market-based health care rests on a transcendent, yet anthropocentric criteria: value, valence, and expectancy. Based on a comparative effectiveness analysis of health-care value and expectancy, the German, Spanish, and Japanese health-care systems appear to be closer to the technocratic model due to the principal of social solidarity and uniform evaluation standard that define the schedule of charges for services and their relative point value to one another. Germany, Spain, and Japan spend less on per capita health needs than the USA; however, in those countries life expectancy is higher than that in the USA. The American health-care system utilizes more MRI exams and the physician's EMR response is lower. In a cross section, maternal, neonatal, and perinatal mortality rates are higher in the USA compared to those in Germany (relative risk (RR) = 4.0; 2.0; 2.6 correspondingly), Spain (RR = 7.0; 1.5; 8.0), and Japan (RR = 4.7; 4.0; 24.0).","[Matevosyan, Naira R.] Open Med Inst, Atlanta, GA USA",,"Matevosyan, NR (通讯作者)，Open Med Inst, Atlanta, GA USA.",naira_matev@alum.emory.edu,,,,,,,44,0,0,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1868-7865,1868-7873,,J KNOWL ECON,J.

Like the neoclassical approach to policy choices, our principles are based on an assumption of individual rationality but broadens the requirements for efficiency to also include societal rationality. Rational overconfidence is present when equally informed agents hold diverse, confident rational beliefs. The fact that beliefs are diverse means that all of them cannot be correct, hence seen as a collective agents do not necessarily act optimally. In the presence of rational overconfidence, Pareto efficiency is no longer the natural criterion for comparing policies and we in stead propose a strengthened version of ex post welfare optimality, according to which welfare evaluations are objective. We apply our general principles to a particular policy issue, namely whether Social Security increases social welfare. We show that an assumption of bounded rationality is not needed to explain Social Security and other mandatory pension plans when rational agents hold inconsistent expectations about their future wealth and productivity or about the returns to their investments. Based on rational overconfidence, we provide a rationale for two of the features that distinguish Social Security and many other state mandated pension plans around the world: (i) that a minimum level of savings for retirement is imposed on most citizens and (ii) that individuals cannot freely decide how to invest their contributions.","[Nielsen, Carsten Krabbe] Univ Cattolica, Dipartimento Econ & Finanza, Via Necchi 5, I-20123 Milan, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Nielsen, CK (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica, Dipartimento Econ & Finanza, Via Necchi 5, I-20123 Milan, Italy.",carsten.nielsen@unicatt.it,,,,,,,64,4,4,1,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

It argues that at the heart of the failure were the wrong microfoundations, which failed to incorporate key aspects of economic behaviour, e.g. incorporating insights from information economics and behavioural economics. Inadequate modelling of the financial sector meant they were ill-suited for predicting or responding to a financial crisis; and a reliance on representative agent models meant they were ill-suited for analysing either the role of distribution in fluctuations and crises or the consequences of fluctuations on inequality. The paper proposes alternative benchmark models that may be more useful both in understanding deep downturns and responding to them.","[Stiglitz, Joseph E.] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Stiglitz, JE (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",jes322@columbia.edu,,,Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET); Columbia Business School,Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET); Columbia Business School,"I wish to acknowledge the helpful comments of David Vines and Matthieu Teachout, and the editorial assistance of Debarati Ghosh.

Applied to Taiwan manufacturing industries, the model is implemented to identify structural changes and to evaluate the viability of sustainable development under new constraints. This study suggests industries to adopt more sustainable practices which can promote and even improve industrial competitiveness.

In particular, it aims to disentangle the extent to which the natural role of women to have and raise children affects the gender wage gap. Due to the large female inactivity in Macedonia, we employ a repeated imputation technique, which imputes the wages of those who are unemployed or inactive. Imputed samples are used to decompose the gaps by weighing and by using a re-centred influence function. The Survey of Income and Living Conditions (2010) is used in the analysis. The results suggest that the motherhood wage gap in Macedonia is fully explained by characteristics and, hence, it does not contribute to the potential reducing of the gender wage gap.

This study also explores the relationship between KM practices and SCP in the presence of a general system theory; the theory claims that every system is has sub-parts, and every sub-part is surrounded by other sub-parts. Decentralisation has a mediating role which influences the relationship between KM practices and SCP in the dairy sector of Pakistan. A self-administered questionnaire was developed, and data were collected through a random sampling of 355 supply chain members of different dairy organisations in central Punjab. The data was analysed by AMOS software and through structure equation modelling (SEM). The underlying study reveals that the hypothesis is accepted, that decentralisation mediates the relationship between KM practices and SCP at a 1% level of significance; it also reveals that KM practices (with the exceptions of knowledge creation and knowledge sharing) have a direct relationship with SCP. Meanwhile, statistical analysis also indicates that KM practices (with the exception of knowledge creation) have a significant positive relationship with decentralisation at the 1% significance level.","[Bin Dost, Muhammad Khyzer; Rehman, Ch.

To do this, we examine the directional spillover via return and volatility spillovers between Islamic stock index represented by Dow Jones Islamic Market Index (DJIMI) and three conventional stock indices viz., Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 for USA, S&P Europe and S&P Asia 50 along with major global risk factors viz., Europe and US interest rate benchmarks, volatility index (VIX) to capture stock market risk and crude oil prices between 01 March 2006 and 30 June 2015. Using spillover index and dynamic conditional correlation models, we find that there is a visible level of directional interdependence between DJIMI and conventional indices, though the magnitude is not as high as we find among conventional indices. Particularly, during the global financial crisis (2008) period, the DJIMI shows the patterns of decoupling which are in line with previous studies. To risk factors, DJIMI shows an inverse relationship with VIX, European interest benchmark, and crude oil prices. However, the DJIMI shows a positive relationship with US interest rate. The findings thus suggest that the Sharia-screening does play a constructive role in the financial performance of DJIMI.

Consistent with previous findings, relative consumption concerns typically induce a welfarist government to increase the marginal tax rates to internalize positional externalities. Remarkably, the optimal marginal tax rules are often very similar in the paternalist case, where such externalities are not taken into account. We identify several cases where the marginal tax rules are indeed identical between the governments. Numerical simulations show that marginal and average tax levels and the overall redistribution are often also similar.","[Aronsson, Thomas] Umea Univ, Umea Sch Business & Econ, Dept Econ, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Johansson-Stenman, Olof] Univ Gothenburg, Sch Business Econ & Law, Dept Econ, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",Umea University; University of Gothenburg,"Aronsson, T (通讯作者)，Umea Univ, Umea Sch Business & Econ, Dept Econ, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden.",Thomas.Aronsson@econ.umu.se; Olof.Johansson@economics.gu.se,,,Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation; Swedish Council for Working Life and Social Research; Swedish Tax Agency [RS10-1319:1]; Swedish Research Council [2016-02371]; Swedish Research Council [2016-02371] Funding Source: Swedish Research Council,Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation(Swedish Foundation for Humanities & Social Sciences); Swedish Council for Working Life and Social Research(Swedish Research Council for Health Working Life & Welfare (Forte)); Swedish Tax Agency; Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council),"Research grants from the Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation, the Swedish Council for Working Life and Social Research, and the Swedish Tax Agency (all of them through project number RS10-1319:1), and the Swedish Research Council (ref 2016-02371) are also gratefully acknowledged.",,55,23,23,0,9,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7731,1945-774X,,AM ECON J-ECON POLIC,Am.

First, we examine spillovers in value at risk using multivariate regression quantiles and reveal that oil volatility represents a common risk for oil-exporting and oil-importing BRICS countries. We also employ a quantile impulse-response function and reveal the presence of an asymmetry in the mechanisms of shock transmissions between oil exporters (Russia and Brazil) and oil importers (China and India): the former are more sensitive to positive oil shocks, whereas the latter are more sensitive to negative oil shocks. Second, we measure the directional predictability in the quantiles using the bivariate cross-quantilogram approach and show that in most cases, a low- (high-) volatility of oil market predicts low (high) sovereign risk at various quantiles and lags.

Our analysis, based on 41 advanced and emerging economies from 2008Q1 to 2012Q4, shows that among the considered channels for explaining international spillovers of sovereign bond spreads, the informational channel is of utmost importance. Our results challenge previous findings from the literature in which the empirical strategy did not accommodate altogether important features of country spillovers, such as the co-existence of multiple transmission channels in the presence of contemporaneous and time-lagged interactions. Ultimately, our stress-testing analysis reveals important insights on countries prone either to international spillovers, international exposure or both at the regional and the worldwide level.

The other is linear with respect to public goods and nonlinear with respect to private goods; we call it QL2. The system with QL1, built on the assumption of self-interested players and myopic Cournot best response dynamics, is not stable, but the system with QL2 has a dominant Nash equilibrium. This theoretical result predicts a pulsing of contributions in the VCM with QL1. Our experimental observations demonstrate that individual contributions are certainly converging to the dominant Nash equilibrium in the experiment with QL2. In the experiments with QL1, however, the dispersion of individual contributions increases progressively with repeated trials, and the contributions are still volatile in the experiments' last periods, although we do not find a clearly unstable pulsing in the group's total contribution.","[Feng, Jun] Kochi Univ Technol, Grad Sch Engn, 2-22 Eikokuji, Kochi 7808515, Japan; [Saijo, Tatsuyoshi] Res Inst Humanity & Nat, 457 4 Kamigamomotoyama, Kyoto 6038047, Japan; [Saijo, Tatsuyoshi] Kochi Univ Technol, Res Inst Future Design, 2-22 Eikokuji, Kochi 7808515, Japan; [Shen, Junyi] Kobe Univ, Res Inst Econ & Business Adm, 2-1 Rokkodai, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; [Qin, Xiangdong] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, 1954 Huashan Rd, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China",Kochi University Technology; Research Institute for Humanity & Nature (RIHN); Kochi University Technology; Kobe University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Feng, J (通讯作者)，Kochi Univ Technol, Grad Sch Engn, 2-22 Eikokuji, Kochi 7808515, Japan.",cb8226@alumni.sjtu.edu.cn,"Saijo, Tatsuyoshi/D-1788-2012; Shen, Junyi/AFS-9019-2022","Shen, Junyi/0000-0001-5859-1382; Feng, Jun/0000-0002-7626-7540","JSPS KAKENHI [24243028, 16K13354, 17H00980]; RIHN [40410000]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17H00980, 16K13354, 15K03353] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); RIHN; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We are grateful to two research assistants, Jun Wu and Luqing Yu, for helping us conduct the experiment, as well as to the participants of the 19th Experimental Social Sciences Conference at the University of Tokyo, Yoshiro Kamijo, Hizen Yoichi, Takao Kusakawa, and two anonymous referees for their helpful comments.

Composition effect appears to be slightly stronger relative to technique effect, while sub sample analyses show some regional heterogeneities.

Second, financing gap model was employed to estimate the potential growth in GDP per capita that is accruable to the economy if government use natural resource rent to finance increase in expenditure of education and health. Relying on dataset for 18 SSA countries, among the results obtained showed that both government expenditures are found to be significant for explaining growth in SSA. However, augmenting health expenditure with natural resource appears to be more significant for making growth process inclusive. Also, the results of the simulation exercise indicate that increasing government expenditure on health would increase GDP per capita growth by over 3.1 %.

The institutional structure of the California criminal justice system as well as location, skill, and industry-specific job accession data provide a unique framework for identifying a causal effect of job availability on criminal behaviour. I find that increases in construction and manufacturing opportunities at the time of release are associated with significant reductions in recidivism. Other types of opportunities, including those characterised by lower wages that are typically accessible to individuals with criminal records, do not influence recidivism.","[Schnepel, Kevin T.] Univ Sydney, Room 370 Merewether Bldg H04, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Schnepel, Kevin T.] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of Sydney; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Schnepel, KT (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Room 370 Merewether Bldg H04, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",kevin.schnepel@sydney.edu.au,,,American Statistical Association; US Bureau of Justice Statistics,American Statistical Association; US Bureau of Justice Statistics,"Funding for this research was generously provided by a research grant jointly administered by the American Statistical Association and the US Bureau of Justice Statistics.

First, we construct a theoretical model and develop a series of hypotheses to analyze how productivity and financial constraints influence firms' OFDI decisions. Then we construct a multivariate index to measure internal and external financial constraints. Using Chinese Industrial Enterprises Database as well as the Database of OFDI Firms in China, our empirical finds that both productivity and financial constraints have important impacts on firms' OFDI decisions. In addition, the marginal effect of the financial constraints increases as firms' productivity rises; an effect felt more to the private enterprises than state-owned enterprises. Empirical results also indicate that external financial constraints affect the firms' OFDI decisions more greatly than the internal financial constraints.","[Yan, Bing] Nankai Univ, Nankai Inst Int Econ, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Yan, Bing] Nankai Univ, Ctr Transnat Studies, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yu] Civil Aviat Univ China, Econ & Management Coll, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Shen, Yanzhi; Han, Jian] Nanjing Univ, Dept Int Econ & Trade, Tianjin, Peoples R China",Nankai University; Nankai University; Civil Aviation University of China; Nanjing University,"Yan, B (通讯作者)，Nankai Univ, Nankai Inst Int Econ, Tianjin, Peoples R China.",yanbing@nankai.edu.cn,,,National Social Science Foundation Major Project [15ZDA057]; Humanities and Social Science Research of the MOE in China [16YJC790087]; Major Project of Key Research Base of the Humanities and Social Science of the MOE in China [11JJD790005]; Collaborative Innovation Center for China Economy,National Social Science Foundation Major Project; Humanities and Social Science Research of the MOE in China; Major Project of Key Research Base of the Humanities and Social Science of the MOE in China; Collaborative Innovation Center for China Economy,"We are grateful for the financial support of 2015 National Social Science Foundation Major Project (Grant No. 15ZDA057), Youth Project funded by Humanities and Social Science Research of the MOE in China (Grant No. 16YJC790087), Major Project of Key Research Base of the Humanities and Social Science of the MOE in China (Grant No. 11JJD790005), Project funded by Collaborative Innovation Center for China Economy",,34,36,38,8,121,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

First, we discuss why the case of Argentina is generally regarded as exceptional: the country was among the richest in the world at the beginning of the 20th century, but it gradually lost this place of privilege. We discuss that most explanations regarding the hypothesis of Argentine Exceptionalism fall into one or several of four categories. The first explanation is to challenge the exceptionalism hypothesis, either by arguing that the country was not so rich at the beginning of the 20th century or that it is not so poor now. The second explanation states that the country failed to generate growth supporting institutions despite its wealth, thus leading to a relative decline in its income level. The next explanation is that the country faced a series of adverse external shocks which disfavored what had been a successful growth model. Finally, scholars have also stated that exceptionalism is a consequence of poor policy choices, in particular a tendency towards state intervention and isolationism. Next, we introduce the remaining papers of the special collection and how they relate to the aforementioned hypothesis. Finally, we offer some concluding remarks regarding this article.","[Glaeser, Edward L.; Di Tella, Rafael] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Glaeser, Edward L.; Di Tella, Rafael] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Llach, Lucas] Banco Cent Republ Argentina, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Di Tella, R (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Di Tella, R (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",rditella@hbs.edu,,,,,,,30,13,18,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",2198-3526,2196-436X,,LAT AM ECON REV,Latin.

We consider collaborations among more developed regions, between more and less developed regions, and among less developed regions. Building on the recent spatial interaction literature, this paper investigates the effects of physical, institutional, social and technological proximity on the intensity of inter-regional research collaboration across heterogenous European regions. We find that the impact of disparities in human capital and technological proximity on regional R&D cooperation is relevant and differs across subgroups of collaborations.

This latter might try selling his claim in a secondary transaction to an uninformed outside investor, even though the project is unsuccessful and should be abandoned. We show that the entrepreneur may trade off crucial contract parameters when seeking external financing.

The main motivation for the present study is to elucidate what type of market structure usually emerges from pricing rules. First, we obtain that finitely generated pricing rules, characterized by polytopes of probabilities, capture the class of all finite arbitrage-free financial markets that are potentially incomplete or subject to frictions affecting tradable assets. Next, we provide a novel characterization of efficient securities and introduce related notions of market completeness that underlies pricing rules. Our main result shows that the class of efficient complete markets with bid-ask spreads is the prevalent case revealed by finitely generated pricing rules. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We then introduce ambiguity aversion in the baseline model of Aubert et al. (2014) using the multiple prior preferences of Gilboa and Schmeidler (1989) and its extension proposed by Maccheroni et al. (2006). This model offers solutions that reconcile labor and financial economics and behavioral economics research findings on employee ownership. The paper focuses on the most common situation where employee ownership has a positive impact on corporate performance, but can also be used as an entrenchment mechanism. We determine the optimal company stock contribution, which corresponds to a perfect subgame Nash equilibrium in the ambiguity framework. Using the framework of Gilboa and Schmeidler (1989), we show that the optimal ownership contract is increasing with respect to the lower bound of the return expectation in the case of a high level of effort, and decreasing with respect to the upper bound of the return expectation in the case of a low level of effort. In the framework of Maccheroni et al. (2006), we prove that if aversion to ambiguity is sufficiently high, then we find the same behavior as in the case of no ambiguity.","[Aubert, Nicolas] Aix Marseille Univ, CERGAM, F-13625 Aix En Provence, France; [Aubert, Nicolas; Ben Ameur, Hachmi; Garnotel, Guillaume] INSEEC Business Sch, F-75010 Paris, France; [Prigent, Jean-Luc] Univ Cergy Pontoise, Thema & Labex MME DII, F-95011 Cergy Pontoise, France",Aix-Marseille Universite; Groupe Inseec; CY Cergy Paris Universite,"Aubert, N (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, CERGAM, F-13625 Aix En Provence, France.;Aubert, N (通讯作者)，INSEEC Business Sch, F-75010 Paris, France.",niaubert@gmail.com; hechba@yahoo.fr; ggarnotel@inseec.com; luc.prigent@u-cergy.fr,"Aubert, Nicolas/N-3239-2019; PRIGENT, Jean-Luc/AAE-4806-2020","Aubert, Nicolas/0000-0002-4687-8762; PRIGENT, Jean-Luc/0000-0002-5383-6691; Ben Ameur, Hachmi/0000-0003-4424-3488",,,,,36,3,3,1,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

We derive closed-form solutions for the unique pricing game under costly international trade. The comparative statics highlight how firms' pricing-to-market decisions are shaped by the interaction of consumer income and good quality. We derive two testable predictions. First, the relative price of high qualities compared to low qualities increases with the income of the destination market. Second, the rate of cost pass-through into consumer prices falls with quality if destination market income is sufficiently high. We present evidence in support of these two predictions based on a dataset of prices, sales, and product attributes in the European car industry. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We combine a version of the slow-moving debt crisis model proposed by Lorenzoni and Werning (2014) with a standard New Keynesian model. Monetary policy could preclude a debt crisis through raising inflation and output and lowering the real interest rate. These reduce the real value of outstanding debt and the cost of new borrowing, and increase tax revenues and seigniorage.

The model is further extended by taking separately into account the effects of extreme and mild changes in crude oil prices. This allows us to verify whether and to what extent the size and shape of any observed asymmetry in pricing is affected by the presence of outliers. Moreover, given the substantial length of the sample considered, we test for the possible presence of multiple structural breaks of unknown timing in the cointegrating vector. Our results indicate that the relationship between the prices of gasoline and crude oil has undergone a single structural break in the late 2008, and that after the break extreme observations have a non-negligible role in shaping asymmetry.

It is a model considering the possibility of a short-term interest-free loan provided to the retailer by a supplier. The model allows the retailer to analyze various strategies and to determine the optimum price of three kinds of products.

First, the paper explains the theory required for understanding how the model works, and this is followed by basic scientific methods (analysis, synthesis), analysis of multivariable functions, and dynamic modeling. The authors analyze situations in which the retailer repays the credit in due time as well as situations in which the due date is not met. As the model enables simulation of different situations and provides exact results, it is also possible to simulate the effect of changes in the values of various variables. The authors also verified the fact that theorems (vety) for continuous functions may be used for further conclusions since the variables used form a compact set on which the analysed function of more variables is continuous. Following further analysis, the new model may be generalized, supplemented and made more accurate; for example some discounts or shortage if items may be considered.","[Bobalova, Martina; Novotna, Veronika] BUT FBM, Kolejni 2906-4, Brno 61200, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,"Bobalova, M (通讯作者)，BUT FBM, Kolejni 2906-4, Brno 61200, Czech Republic.",novotna@fbm.vutbr.cz; novotna@fbm.vutbr.cz,,,Czech Science Foundation [GA16-03796S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),This paper was supported by grant Czech Science Foundation.

While directors and CEOs play an important role within certain CSR dimensions, results suggest that employees are significantly more influential overall. A one-standard-deviation shift to the political left for directors, CEOs and elite executives yields gains in CSR of 5%, 9% and 3%, respectively, while a one-standard-deviation left-shift for employees produces a 33% increase. Findings may help to explain why similar firms engaging in comparable social initiatives can experience heterogeneous returns to CSR outlays and suggest that a corporate culture approach may be warranted in future studies.","[Borghesi, Richard] Univ South Florida Sarasota, Coll Business Adm, Sarasota, FL 34243 USA",,"Borghesi, R (通讯作者)，Univ South Florida Sarasota, Coll Business Adm, Sarasota, FL 34243 USA.",borghesi@usf.edu,,,,,,,32,10,12,2,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Historical or empirical models utilize the historical-deductive method, and are generalizations from the economic regularities and tendencies that we find in the real world. Axiomatic models utilize the hypothetical-deductive method; they are syllogisms whose major premise is an axiom - a self-evident truth; they are appropriate for methodological sciences such as mathematics and econometrics. Conditional economic models are likewise syllogisms, but they are suitable for economics because they make for clearer and more precise economic reasoning. The criterion of truth of the substantive sciences is the conformity with reality, of the methodological science, its internal consistency. When a school of economic thought adopts mainly axiomatic models, as is the case with neoclassical economics, it implicitly falls into contradiction because their best representatives believe in the conformity with reality criterion.","[Bresser-Pereira, Luiz Carlos] Getulio Vargas Fdn, Rua Araripina, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Getulio Vargas Foundation,"Bresser-Pereira, LC (通讯作者)，Getulio Vargas Fdn, Rua Araripina, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",bresserpereira@gmail.com,"Bresser-Pereira, Luiz Carlos/D-4258-2017","Bresser-Pereira, Luiz Carlos/0000-0001-8679-0557",,,,,22,2,4,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-178X,1469-9427,,J ECON METHODOL,J.

Current analysis uses a default assumption of imports being prohibited by the exporting country. We contend that this assumption fails on several fronts: it is not consistent with the ceteris paribus assumption used in economic analysis; it is unrealistic in a world of fast-dropping transportation costs and free trade; and it hides the true effect of an export subsidy which is to create inefficient intra-industry trade. Correcting the analysis is important as, even with a proliferation of treaties, governments continue to enact policies to promote trade that may have similar effects to an export subsidy. Proceeding at a basic level, this article presents graphical analysis of export subsidies to replace the content in current undergraduate textbooks, in order to train the next generation of economists to think clearly about the effects of this policy.","[Brown, Laura K.; Troutt, Elizabeth] Univ Manitoba, Dept Econ, Winnipeg, MB R3T 5V5, Canada",University of Manitoba,"Brown, LK (通讯作者)，Univ Manitoba, Dept Econ, Winnipeg, MB R3T 5V5, Canada.",laura.brown@umanitoba.ca,,,,,,,4,1,1,2,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

To do this, a systematic literature review of the subjects under investigation was conducted. The study has two major contributions. First, it is one of the first researches that examine the compatibility and divergences of Green, Lean and Six Sigma concepts and implications regarding its sustainable implementation in service industry. Second, it provides a holistic Green LSS framework attempting to help practitioners to find ways of institutionalizing it in numerous kinds of services, by pointing out nine critical factors for its implementation, such as continuous customer satisfaction, ethical relations and regulatory compliance, focus on knowledge management and human behaviors, and effective Jidoka automation.

We find that an increase in economic uncertainty conveys a fall in GDP, investment, and employment, even after accounting for the small open economy nature of Chile. In contrast to previous studies for big and developed economies, we do not find evidence of an overshooting effect when uncertainty dissipates; therefore, increases in economic uncertainty have negative effects on the economy, even in the long-run. Our estimates suggest that these impacts range from 10% to 20% for aggregate investment, 2.5% to 5% for GDP, and 1.3% to 4.2% for employment. Extensions suggest that economic uncertainty affects both mining and non-mining investment, with the former showing a more pronounced decline. We also find that the bulk of effect of economic uncertainty on aggregate investment is via private investment, with some short-run impacts on public investment. Moreover, compared to the GDP response, aggregate consumption responds in almost the same way to an economic uncertainty shock.","[Cerda, Rodrigo; Silva, Alvaro; Valente, Jose Tomas] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Latin Amer Ctr Econ & Social Policies CLAPES UC, Santiago, Chile; [Cerda, Rodrigo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Econ, Santiago, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Cerda, R (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Latin Amer Ctr Econ & Social Policies CLAPES UC, Santiago, Chile.;Cerda, R (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Econ, Santiago, Chile.",rcerdan@uc.cl,"cerda, rodrigo/ABB-4527-2020","cerda, rodrigo/0000-0001-6486-4025",,,,,19,32,32,2,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Through the TF index and market exchange rate the impact of economic sanctions on inflation is analysed in the three phases of sanctions; free sanctions, heavy sanctions, and light sanctions. The results illustrate that the TF index decreases inflation when the Iran's economy experiences free sanctions or light sanctions relative to when the economy is in heavy sanctions. Heavy sanctions create instability in the market exchange rates and widening the gap between the market and the official exchange rates.

There is some empirical literature dedicated to test the double dividend hypothesis of an environmental tax reform using CGE models. This hypothesis claims that is possible to obtain an improvement of both environmental and economic conditions by imposing an environmental tax and recycling revenues obtained to reduce other pre-existing taxes. This research provides a comprehensive review of this literature including a statistical and a meta-regression analysis. 69 different simulations from 40 studies have been analyzed. 55% of simulations have achieved a double dividend, concluding that although the environmental dividend is almost always achieved, the economic dividend still remains an ambiguous question that needs further research.

The Food and Drug Administration approved DESs in April 2003 and physicians rapidly adopted the new technology. In March 2006, a presentation was made at the American Cardiology Conference which showed that patients receiving DES in real-world settings suffered higher rates of mortality and myocardial infarction than those receiving stents without drugs. We examine the utilization of DES from April 2003 to the end of 2007. Using a hospital fixed-effects model, we find that board-certified and top-trained physicians were initially quicker to adopt DES. Over time, this effect dissipated and top-trained physicians were less likely to use DES by the time new clinical trials indicated they could be problematic. After the news, board-certified and top-ranked physicians were less likely to change their behaviour. Physicians' own experience also contributes to the use of technology and the effects are stronger for non-board-certified physicians. We conclude that even within hospitals, physician training and experience play an important role in explaining differences in rates of technology use.","[Gardner, Lara] Southeastern Louisiana Univ, Dept Management & Business Adm, Hammond, LA 70402 USA; [Vishwasrao, Sharmila] Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Econ, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA",University of Louisiana System; Southeastern Louisiana University; State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University,"Gardner, L (通讯作者)，Southeastern Louisiana Univ, Dept Management & Business Adm, Hammond, LA 70402 USA.",Lara.Gardner@selu.edu,"Jani, Arpit/B-5376-2017","Vishwasrao, Sharmila/0000-0001-5712-4969",,,,,36,0,0,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In this paper, we analyzed the distribution of intermediate input shares in China. We use regional input-output tables from 2007 and find that regions with higher GDP per capita generally had higher input shares, regardless of sector. Then, using intermediate input shares as a proxy of technology, we analyzed the pattern of regional technology distributions across manufacturing sectors as well as the extent of interregional technology spillovers. Our results indicate that interregional backward spillovers have significantly positive impacts on the shape of the technology distributions in eastern (coastal) regions. By contrast, the vertical spillovers of the central and western regions are largely dominated by intra-regional forward effects. Our results suggest that the shift of Chinese manufacturing from coastal to inland regions with lower production costs cannot reduce the imbalance among regions unless the technology gap is narrowed.","[Jiang, Xuemei] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lu, Xiaolin] Ind & Commercial Bank Peoples Republ China, Postdoctoral Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xu, Jian] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Business & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China","Capital University of Economics & Business; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Jiang, XM (通讯作者)，Capital Univ Econ & Business, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jiangxuem@amss.ac.cn,"lu, xl/HDO-8340-2022","Jiang, Xuemei/0000-0002-5639-0453",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473246]; Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality [9172006],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality(Beijing Natural Science Foundation),The authors acknowledge the funding from the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant number 71473246] and Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality [Grant number 9172006].,,56,6,6,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

Through this application, the best estimates of the elasticity parameters generated relatively consistent estimates of production change compared with the observed change, both in severely affected regions and in other regions.","[Kajitani, Yoshio] Cent Res Inst Elect Power Ind, Civil Engn Lab, Chiba, Japan; [Tatano, Hirokazu] Kyoto Univ, Disaster Prevent Res Inst, Kyoto, Japan",Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry - Japan; Kyoto University,"Kajitani, Y (通讯作者)，Cent Res Inst Elect Power Ind, Civil Engn Lab, Chiba, Japan.",y-kaji@criepi.denken.or.jp,"KAJITANI, YOSHIO/W-2338-2019","KAJITANI, YOSHIO/0000-0003-3110-7436; Tatano, Hirokazu/0000-0001-7209-4358","MEXT-Japan [JSPS] [16H04427/16K12390]; MEXT-Japan [Program for Risk Information on Climate Change]; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16H04428, 16K12390, 16H04427] Funding Source: KAKEN","MEXT-Japan [JSPS]; MEXT-Japan [Program for Risk Information on Climate Change]; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported by MEXT-Japan [JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 16H04427/16K12390 and the Program for Risk Information on Climate Change]; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.",,34,29,33,0,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

This article provides an explanation for this observed relationship. Using panel data on 34 countries for the period 1996-2014, we test the hypothesis that pro-poor aid has an inequality-reducing effect. To demonstrate that the negative correlation is not spurious, we use dynamic panel techniques with alternative specifications. We show that the share of pro-poor aid has a negative effect on inequality. In addition, we show that the interaction term between the poverty rate and the change in pro-poor aid has a significant effect. These empirical results are consistent with our theoretical predictions. The results imply that aid can reduce inequality by altering the allocation of aid, rather than by increasing the amount of aid.","[Kasuga, Hidefumi] Kansai Univ, Fac Econ, 3-3-35 Yamatecho, Suita, Osaka 5648680, Japan; [Morita, Yuichi] Nagoya City Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan",Kansai University; Nagoya City University,"Kasuga, H (通讯作者)，Kansai Univ, Fac Econ, 3-3-35 Yamatecho, Suita, Osaka 5648680, Japan.",hkasuga@kansai-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,40,2,3,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

I analyze a case where the marginal production of public goods is decreasing and convex, and agents' social preferences are irrelevant to the population size. The voluntary contribution level in Nash equilibrium is higher when the number of players is random than when the number of players is fixed at the mean of the population distribution. The findings from a controlled experiment are consistent with this theoretical prediction. I also analyze a case where the production, function is linear and the agents' social preferences are modeled in the form of a warm-glow utility function which could be increasing concave in the population size. The experimental findings reject the hypothesis that warm glow is congestible: when the public-goods production function is linear, uncertainty in the population size does not lead to changes in the contribution level.

One approach is to fit a vector autoregression (VAR) for the fundamental variables and deduce their future expectations from the estimated VAR. An alternative is to directly specify the future expectations as unobserved components (UC) and use the Kalman filter to extract their estimates from the realized data. This article examines whether the predictions of the present-value model are consistent across the two approaches. Constructing the VAR and UC versions of the standard present-value model, we examine how the two versions compare in identifying the main driver of the US and UK housing markets. For the UK, the two approaches consistently attribute most variations in the price-rent ratio to the expected future risk premium for housing investment. For the US, however, the two approaches deliver considerably different results: the VAR version marks the expected risk-free rate of return, whereas the UC version singles out the expected risk premium as the main driver of the ratio. We conclude that the choice between the VAR and UC approaches is not a trivial issue related to utilizing the present-value model.","[Kim, Jan R.] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Dept Int Econ & Law, Seoul, South Korea; [Chung, Keunsuk] Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Business Adm, 50 UNIST Gil,Eonyang Eup, Ulsan 44919, South Korea",Hankuk University Foreign Studies; Ulsan National Institute of Science & Technology (UNIST),"Chung, K (通讯作者)，Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Business Adm, 50 UNIST Gil,Eonyang Eup, Ulsan 44919, South Korea.",chungk@unist.ac.kr,,,Hankuk University of Foreign Studies [HUFS Research Fund],Hankuk University of Foreign Studies [HUFS Research Fund],This work was supported by Hankuk University of Foreign Studies [HUFS Research Fund].,,16,1,1,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The findings show that the effectiveness of the fiscal devaluation policy seems to alter with respect to how ESC and VAT are measured.

The research object was the Polish food sector in the period 2002-2013. Taking into account overhead labor, CES production function and marginal wage different from average wage, six adjustments were used. Because of the corrections the average food sector markup increased from 17.7% of price in the baseline scenario to 67.9% of price when three corrections were implemented together. It appeared that the food sector markup in the analyzed period depending on the specification increased by 13.5 to 31.3%.

Traders agree to disagree about the precisions of their continuous flows of Gaussian private information. The price depends on a trader's inventory (permanent price impact) and the derivative of a trader's inventory (temporary price impact). More disagreement makes the market more liquid; without enough disagreement, there is no trade. Target inventories mean-revert at the same rate as private signals. Actual inventories smoothly adjust towards target inventories at an endogenous rate which increases with disagreement. Faster-than-equilibrium trading generates flash crashes by increasing temporary price impact.

Nonetheless, this hypothesis needs more solid empirical evidence to determine its validity. This article tests this hypothesis by examining the relationships among the index of policy dispersion, international reserves and trade openness in a threshold model in Malaysia. As a small open economy, Malaysia has accumulated a relatively large amount of international reserves since the mid-1990s. The results indicate that the positive impact of international reserves on reducing policy dispersion or achieving policy convergence is found only if the international reserves are above a threshold. Hence, this conclusion supports the need to hold a relatively high level of international reserves in Malaysia.","[Law, Chee-Hong] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Social Sci, George Town, Malaysia",Universiti Sains Malaysia,"Law, CH (通讯作者)，Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Social Sci, George Town, Malaysia.",cheehong@usm.my,"Law, Chee-Hong/M-7749-2017","Law, Chee-Hong/0000-0001-9326-7086",Universiti Sains Malaysia [304/PSOSIAL/6313308],Universiti Sains Malaysia(Universiti Sains Malaysia),This work was supported by Universiti Sains Malaysia under Grant [304/PSOSIAL/6313308].,,10,1,1,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Design/methodology/approach The paper applies a complex network model, using a big data system consisting of an automated identification system, electronic data interchange and distributive and complex data. Three perspectives, including connectivity in trading ports and regions, centralities in the realm of complex network and potential marketing and regional impacts, and sixteen criteria are considered for this analysis. A visual approach has been also applied to highlight port connectivity and ship flows for the reader's convenience. Findings The paper shows that port connectivity and maritime logistics are enablers to promote Korean international trade in Northeast China through the ESER, and 25 major ports are well connected to promote international trade in the region with visual data of ship flows by ship type and by flag. Research limitations/implications Owing to the lack of port management information systems among the countries in the ESER except Korea and Japan, this paper could not capture cargo types and amounts on board. Port connectivity analysis shows links of the ports in the ESER to major ports in southeast Asia along the Twenty-first Century Maritime Silk Road (MSR). These results contribute to drawing policy implications to promote the ESER and provide suggestions for promoting Korean international trade by enhancing maritime logistics connectivity. Originality/value Unlike the existing literature showing descriptive and policy-oriented research related to ESER, this paper applied a vigorous method with a big amount of data to analyze port connectivity and ship flows in the ESER, considering China's BRI affecting the global supply chain system, maritime transportation, and logistics. In addition, the paper shows how the seaports in the ESER are connected along the MSR.","[Lee, Paul Tae-Woo] Zhejiang Univ, Ocean Coll, Zhoushan, Peoples R China; [Lee, Sung-Woo; Choi, Na Young Hwan] Korea Maritime Inst, Busan, South Korea; [Hu, Zhi-Hua] Shanghai Maritime Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Choi, Kyoung-Suk] Shandong Normal Univ, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Shin, Sung-Ho] Pyeongtaek Univ, Dept Int Logist, Pyeongtaek, South Korea",Zhejiang University; Korea Maritime Institute; Shanghai Maritime University; Shandong Normal University; Pyeongtaek University,"Hu, ZH (通讯作者)，Shanghai Maritime Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",zhhu@shmtu.edu.cn,"Hu, Zhi-Hua/HHS-8850-2022; Lee, Paul/AAM-2919-2021; Choi, Kyoung-Suk/AAY-5143-2021","Hu, Zhi-Hua/0000-0003-4099-3310; Shin, Sung-Ho/0000-0002-9724-1112",National Nature Science of China [71471109]; Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai [16040501800]; Korea Maritime Institute (KMI),National Nature Science of China; Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai(Science & Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (STCSM)); Korea Maritime Institute (KMI),"The authors are thankful to the editors and the anonymous referees for their valuable comments and suggestions.

Three-panel data models are used for analysis, which is the pooled ordinary least squares, random effects and two-step GMM models over the period 2003 to 2016. The results indicate that capital strength, bank size, remuneration of the board of directors, the duality of the CEO-chairman and economic growth have a positive effect on bank performance, whereas management efficiency, liquidity and loan growth have a negative effect on performance. The findings suggest that the performance of banks is affected not only by bank-specific factors but also by governance and macroeconomic factors. Evidence on the relationship between governance and performance indicates that increasing the number of independent directors is simply not enough to influence performance. Our findings provide justification for regulators to consider having a set of eligibility specifications to become a bank director to ensure that governance in the banking industry is further strengthened.","[Lee, Siew-Peng] Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Kajang, Malaysia",Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR),"Lee, SP (通讯作者)，Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Kajang, Malaysia.",,,,,,,,71,2,3,3,16,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,2720-5088,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

We adopt an alternative philosophy: without any pre-selected pattern, the proposed method explores the entire graphic space to automate the identification of technical patterns. Derived from the K-nearest-neighbour (KNN) forecast, our method calculates the graphic similarity of patterns by the distance of the price vectors, and then classifies patterns according to the graphic similarity, and finally identifies patterns which contain predictive powers of the future market movement. KNN provides an excellent tool for probing the entire graphic space formed by price patterns to obtain an overall perspective of the effectiveness of technical patterns. Not only the well-known patterns but also the unnoticed and potentially informative patterns can be probed. To evaluate the performance, our method is compared with classic KNN forecast and technical trading rules. Results indicate that the stock market is relatively efficient and technical analysis is still effective to explore excess returns.","[Li, Daye; Li, Zhizhong] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Rongrong] Univ Int Business & Econ, Inst Int Business Chinese Educ & Resources Dev, Sch Informat & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of International Business & Economics; University of International Business & Economics,"Li, RR (通讯作者)，Univ Int Business & Econ, Inst Int Business Chinese Educ & Resources Dev, Sch Informat & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.",uibe_sharonli@163.com,"Li, Rongrong/B-8365-2019","Li, Rongrong/0000-0002-0485-3188",,,,,37,2,2,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Improving the production efficiency of the latter can help to reduce national emissions. Here we use a final production-based accounting framework to identify critical final producers. Results show that the major final producers leading to China's emissions are Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guangdong, which are the major manufacturing centers in China. China should encourage the production efficiency improvement of dominant firms in industries of these provinces. The final production-based accounting framework can also help to define and allocate emission responsibilities of Chinese provinces. It can complement production-based and consumption-based accounting frameworks to guide environmental policy-making in China.","[Liang, Sai; Yang, Zhifeng] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liang, Sai; Xu, Ming] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Wang, Yafei] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Stat, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Chao] Tongji Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Xu, Ming] Univ Michigan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Liu, Weidong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Hongguang] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Publ Adm, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Chiu, Anthony S.

Flexible incentive strategy is needed for governments to guide private capital participation at different development stages. This study aims to provide analysis governments can use to encourage private investment in shale gas projects according to its plans in an extended real options framework. A social benefits variable is introduced to determine the threshold of social benefits that determine whether the government will choose a deferred or instant incentives strategy. By considering the efficiency factor, we show the optimal arrangements of two kinds of incentives: tax cuts and production subsidies, to implement incentive targets. The results indicate that current market demand and social benefits are the key factors that affect the government's choice of incentive strategy. We also find that the optimal level of incentives, either tax cuts or production subsidies, are independent of current market demand and future market uncertainty under the delayed incentive strategy, but which affect the optimal level of incentives under the instant motivation strategy, and ignoring the negative influence of unpredictable random events on future market demand might lead to insufficient government incentives in this case.","[Liu, Zihan; Guo, Ju'e; Wang, Shubin] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Management, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zihan; Guo, Ju'e; Wang, Shubin] Chinese Management Res Ctr, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Liu, Hongtao] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Management, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Xi'an Jiaotong University; Northwestern Polytechnical University,"Liu, ZH (通讯作者)，Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Management, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.;Liu, ZH (通讯作者)，Chinese Management Res Ctr, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",liuzihan1987@stu.xjtu.edu.cn,"Wang, Shubin/ABB-9455-2021","WANG, Shubin/0000-0002-0244-7063","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473193, 71403207]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 71473193 and 71403207).,,33,3,3,4,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Steinbaum and Weisberger first fail to do justice to Leonard's extensive and original scholarship, and then, by reburying progressive eugenics in euphemism, they aim directly at undoing Leonard's substantive contributions to the history of economics. Steinbaum and Weisberger are motivated to offer progressive economists a redemptive escape from association with eugenics, and they attempt to deliver such escape by parsing the motivations of progressives and those of progressives' ideological opponents. But, absurdly, Steinbaum and Weisberger's parsing rests on an ascription to the progressives' opponents of a particular racist typology regarding labor markets, even though the book they were ostensibly reviewing documents that leading progressives deployed that typology. The JEL review of Illiberal Reformers thus offers little but leftist declamation-and even to that end Steinbaum and Weisberger largely traffic in avoidance and euphemism, notably so in their treatment of the progressive economist Edward Ross.","[Magness, Phillip W.] Berry Coll, Mt Berry, GA 30149 USA",,"Magness, PW (通讯作者)，Berry Coll, Mt Berry, GA 30149 USA.",pmagness@gmu.edu,,,,,,,51,3,3,0,2,INST SPONTANEOUS ORDER ECONOMICS,FAIRFAX,"9745 KINGS CROWN COURT #102, FAIRFAX, VA 22031 USA",1933-527X,,,ECON J WATCH,Econ.

The main advantage of this approach comes from using the Kalman filter to explicitly estimate the unobserved expected inflation from the observed break-even inflation rates - the yield difference between the inflation-indexed bonds and the nominal bonds. Our results show that the expected inflation estimated from the unobserved component model plays a significant role in explaining the inflation dynamics in the UK. The evidence also suggests that the estimated inflation expectations are better able to capture the evolution of actual inflation process as compared to the break-even inflation rate as a proxy for expected inflation.,"[Marfatia, Hardik A.] NE Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, BBH 344G,5500 N St Louis Ave, Chicago, IL 60625 USA",,"Marfatia, HA (通讯作者)，NE Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, BBH 344G,5500 N St Louis Ave, Chicago, IL 60625 USA.",h-marfatia@neiu.edu,,,,,,,51,6,6,0,5,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

Whilst several studies have examined social CRM use from the perspective of large enterprises, relatively few have examined its use by micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which due to unique characteristics differ from large enterprises. The main objective of this paper is to provide a practical perspective on social CRM use in SMEs. This study applies a qualitative research approach by conducting six semi-structured interviews. To determine the antecedents of the intensity of social CRM, the dimensions of the intensity of social CRM use, as well as its impact on performance outcomes, a content analysis has been utilized. The findings reveal that social CRM use is complex; therefore, we propose a two-dimensional conceptualization of the intensity of social CRM use. Furthermore, this study identifies antecedents, which appears to influence the intensity of social CRM use, including relative advantages, compatibility, top management support, organizational culture, technology readiness and external pressure. This study also implies that more intensive use of social CRM appears to improve performance outcomes.

Among religious subjects, the crowdout is 52.8%, suggesting warm-glow giving. Among non-religious subjects, the crowdout is 138%, implying altruistic giving.

I develop a model of imperfect competition where a few oligopolistic firms coexist with a monopolistically competitive fringe. The former have a direct impact on the industry average price level, which depends on the breadth of their product scope. Oligopolists produce higher output per worker, charge higher markups, but also sell at higher prices than monopolistic single-product firms. Under linear demand, trade liberalization triggers the exit of small firms and the entry of foreign large firms, leading to more product variety but also to a higher average price. For a broad class of demand functions, the entry of an oligopolist induced by trade liberalization has a negative impact on consumer surplus. Producer surplus rises, but the total effect on welfare is ambiguous. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We apply the system of Seemingly Unrelated Regression Equations (SURE) to obtain the parameters of the Mincerian equations. The differences between the parameters were tested given two alternative stochastic assumptions. In the first model, no contemporaneous correlations between error terms in the system are imposed. In the second approach, the unrestricted covariance matrix is considered, making error terms stochastically dependent. The contemporaneous correlations of error terms in the SURE system were empirically supported. The rich parameterisation of the covariance matrix of contemporaneous relations reduced statistical uncertainty about differences in parameters describing return to education. Therefore, the country heterogeneity of return on education, which seems intuitively correct, was obtained in the system of regressions with a complex stochastic structure.","[Pipien, Mateusz] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Econometr & Operat Res, Krakow, Poland; [Roszkowska, Sylwia] Univ Lodz, Dept Macroecon, Lodz, Poland",Cracow University of Economics; University of Lodz,"Pipien, M (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Econometr & Operat Res, Krakow, Poland.",,"Roszkowska, Sylwia/AAY-2656-2021; ROSZKOWSKA, SYLWIA/AAY-1882-2021; Pipień, Mateusz/ABC-8012-2020","Roszkowska, Sylwia/0000-0002-6043-8210; Pipień, Mateusz/0000-0003-1007-3871",,,,,43,1,1,0,8,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

In particular, sibship sex composition is related to hourly wages using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979. The wages of men are increasing in the proportion of siblings who are brothers, but the wages of women are insensitive to sibling gender. Nonwage outcomes are generally unaffected. Contrasts by age structure and demographic group are also presented. The analysis addresses econometric challenges like the endogeneity of fertility and selection into the workforce. In addition, mechanisms such as labour market interactions, human capital investment and role model effects are documented. A questionnaire on job search indicates a same-gender bias in the use of brothers and sisters in obtaining employment. Developmental and psychological assessments suggest that brothers may be associated with worse childhood home environments and more traditional family attitudes among women.

Due to the presence of cross-sectional dependence in the panel (countries from Asia, North America, Western Europe and Oceania), we employ the cross-sectional augmented IPS test to ascertain unit root properties. The cointegration test results indicate the presence of a long-run association between globalization, economic growth and energy consumption. Long-run heterogeneous panel elasticities are estimated through the common correlated effects mean group estimator and the augmented mean group estimator. The empirical results reveal that, for most countries, globalization increases energy consumption. In the USA and UK, globalization is negatively correlated with energy consumption. The causality analysis indicates the presence of the globalization-driven energy consumption hypothesis. This empirical analysis suggests insightful policy guidelines for policy makers using globalization as an economic tool to utilize energy efficiently for sustainable economic development in the long run.","[Shahbaz, Muhammad; Shahzad, Syed Jawad Hussain] Montpellier Business Sch, Energy & Sustainable Dev, Montpellier, France; [Shahzad, Syed Jawad Hussain] COMSATS Inst Informat Technol, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Mahalik, Mantu Kumar] Natl Inst Technol, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Sundargarh, Odisha, India; [Sadorsky, Perry] York Univ, Schulich Sch Business, Toronto, ON, Canada",Montpellier Business School; COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI); National Institute of Technology (NIT System); National Institute of Technology Rourkela; York University - Canada,"Shahzad, SJH (通讯作者)，Montpellier Business Sch, Energy & Sustainable Dev, Montpellier, France.;Shahzad, SJH (通讯作者)，COMSATS Inst Informat Technol, Islamabad, Pakistan.",j.syed@montpellier-bs.com,"Shahbaz, Muhammad/AAS-6190-2021; Sadorsky, Perry/AAF-3856-2019; Shahzad, Syed Jawad Hussain/D-1986-2019; Shahbaz, Muhammad/AAD-9038-2019","Shahbaz, Muhammad/0000-0003-2391-6997; Sadorsky, Perry/0000-0002-1718-6732; Shahzad, Syed Jawad Hussain/0000-0003-3511-6057;",,,,,68,112,112,3,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

To this end it is necessary to select more sophisticated criteria that reflect also the variability-risk features of the problem (cf. Cavazos-Cadena and Fernandez-Gaucherand (1999), Cavazos-Cadena and Hernandez-Hern andez (2005), Howard and Matheson (1972), Jaquette (1976), Kawai (1987), Mandl (1971), Sladky (2005),(2008),(2013), van Dijk and Sladky (2006), White (1988)). In the present paper we consider unichain Markov reward processes with finite state spaces and assume that the generated reward is evaluated by an exponential utility function. Using the Taylor expansion we present explicit formulae for calculating variance and higher central moments of the total reward generated by the Markov reward chain along with its asymptotic behavior and the growth rates if the considered time horizon tends to infinity.","[Sladky, Karel] AS CR, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Prague, Czech Republic; [Sladky, Karel] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Dept Econometr, Vodarenskou Vezi 4, CR-18208 Prague 8, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Theory & Automation of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Theory & Automation of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Sladky, K (通讯作者)，AS CR, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Prague, Czech Republic.;Sladky, K (通讯作者)，Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Dept Econometr, Vodarenskou Vezi 4, CR-18208 Prague 8, Czech Republic.",sladky@utia.cas.cz,,,Czech Science Foundation [18-02739S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),This work was supported by the Czech Science Foundation under Grant 18-02739S.,,15,1,1,0,0,"LETRA INTERACTIVE, SRO",BRATISLAVA,"NA REVINE 29-D, BRATISLAVA, 831 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-89962-08-2,,,,2018,,,,,,,325,331,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7OT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455265500044,0

International trade in agricultural goods can help overcome this barrier and facilitate structural transformation because it allows countries to import part of their food needs. This article quantifies the role of trade in this context through the examples of South Korea during the last 50 years and Great Britain in the 19th century. To do the analysis, I calibrate and simulate a two-sector, neoclassical growth model to match the data and perform the policy experiments. I find that agricultural imports played a crucial role in the early transformation of Great Britain, while, in South Korea, trade also had a positive impact on its structural transformation but it could have played a much larger role if the country had not introduced agricultural protection policies.","[Teignier, Marc] Univ Barcelona, Diagonal 696, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Teignier, Marc] BEAT, Diagonal 696, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Teignier, M (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Diagonal 696, Barcelona 08034, Spain.;Teignier, M (通讯作者)，BEAT, Diagonal 696, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",marc.teignier@ub.edu,,,"Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2012-36719, ECO2015-66701-R]; Generalitat of Catalonia [SGR2014-493]; La Caixa; Banco de Espafia; University of Chicago",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Generalitat of Catalonia; La Caixa(La Caixa Foundation); Banco de Espafia; University of Chicago(University of Chicago),"I am very grateful to Robert E.

Moreover, drawing inspiration from recent post Keynesian literature, the authors identify the ongoing worsening in income equality and the increase in the degree of financialization as other major explanatory factors of sluggish productivity. The article will provide a brief literature review concerning nonmainstream attempts to endogenize labor productivity, beginning from the famous Verdoorn-Kaldor law (Verdoorn, 1949) and the Kaldor technical progress function (Kaldor, 1961) and including Sylos Labini's productivity equation (Sylos Labini, 1984, 1999). The authors will then discuss how labor flexibility and shareholder value orientation, one of the main aspects of financialization, can negatively affect equality and labor productivity. Finally, they propose an extended version of the Sylos Labini's equation, where productivity growth is claimed to depend positively on GDP rate of growth and the wage share, and negatively on income inequality and financialization. They submit to empirical scrutiny their extended productivity equation; the results of their estimations provide support to their theoretical argument.","[Tridico, Pasquale; Pariboni, Riccardo] Roma Tre Univ, Dept Econ, Rome, Italy",Roma Tre University,"Tridico, P (通讯作者)，Roma Tre Univ, Dept Econ, Rome, Italy.",pasquale.tridico@uniroma3.it; riccardo.pariboni@uniroma3.it,"Pariboni, Riccardo/AAP-3182-2020; PARIBONI, RICCARDO/AAD-6401-2021","PARIBONI, RICCARDO/0000-0002-5275-9559",,,,,71,41,42,2,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

With the proposed methodology which utilizes fuzzy analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy goal programming, determination of the discount rates of each vendor under different discounting strategies is facilitated. This enables the vendors to choose the most suitable discounting strategy with the best applicable discount rate and enables the managers to predict the transactions of the vendors. The proposed method is validated with a numerical study conducted on a pilot region of an international company.","[Ucal Sari, Irem] Istanbul Tech Univ, Fac Management, Dept Ind Engn, ITU Macka Kampusu, TR-34367 Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Technical University,"Ucal Sari, I (通讯作者)，Istanbul Tech Univ, Fac Management, Dept Ind Engn, ITU Macka Kampusu, TR-34367 Istanbul, Turkey.",ucal@itu.edu.tr,"ucal sari, irem/E-6691-2014; sarı, irem/HHN-7586-2022; Ucal Sari, Irem/E-6691-2014","ucal sari, irem/0000-0002-1627-612X; Ucal Sari, Irem/0000-0001-9525-2363",,,,,34,6,6,2,11,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Therefore, we present two combined approaches based on a compromise MCDM method-VIKOR and objective weighting methods-CRITIC and MW (Mean Weight) to evaluate and rank IPOs to help shareholders with understanding on how their performance changes under the different measures. Since the compromise solution (one or a set) proposed by VIKOR depends substantially on criteria weights, VIKOR-CRITIC can show more realistic results because of the differential weights assigned to criteria by CRITIC. In this study, a case study is conducted in order to evaluate the performance of Turkish IPOs based on ABP, VBP and OP measures using the combined methods.

Spanning from December 2012 to November 2015, our sample contains 526 high-level government officials who worked in various provinces in China. We find through multivariate regression that economic opportunities represented by coal, minerals, real estate and road construction all have a positive and significant effect on official corruption in China at the levels of provincial department director or deputy director; meanwhile, capacity of political extraction, road construction and coal production are better indicators of official corruption at the level of governor or deputy governor.","[Yi, Feng; Gao, Zhijun] Claremont Grad Univ, Dept Int Studies, Claremont, CA 91711 USA; [Zhang, Honglie Helen] Yunnan Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Int Business, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China",Claremont Colleges; Claremont Graduate School; Yunnan University of Finance & Economics,"Yi, F (通讯作者)，Claremont Grad Univ, Dept Int Studies, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",yi.feng@cgu.edu,,,,,,,42,6,7,1,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2018,30.0,3,,,,,273,289,,10.1080/14631377.2018.1442055,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GF8JM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000432216800001,0

We conjecture that this practice is observed since the suspension leads to a quasi-endowment effect, which increases revenues. We conducted English auctions with and without stoppages for a real good in the laboratory. Unexpectedly, we observe similar auction prices across treatments. A deeper exploration shows that the subjects who held the highest bids during the suspension won less frequently in the suspension treatment than their counterparts in the control treatment. We infer that there must be two canceling opposite effects, a cooling-off effect for the currently highest bidder and a heating-up effect for the other, taking place during the suspension.

A principal imposes a budget limit on a bidder (an agent) in response to a principal-agent problem. In contrast to the existing literature where budget constraints are exogenous, this theory predicts that tighter constraints will be imposed in first-price auctions than in second-price auctions, tending to offset any advantages attributable to the lower bidding strategy of the first-price auction. Our experimental findings support this theory: principals are found to set significantly lower budgets in first-price auctions.

Traditional factor-driven growth can still contribute if reform increases labour force participation, most significantly through easing restrictions on rural-urban migration through reform of the household registration system and other means. The other potential contributor to growth in the new era is reform to raise productivity. This requires more fundamental institutional change, which depends on clear visions of the framework for a modern market economy, encompassing the rule of law and stronger property rights.","[Cai, Fang; Zhang, Xiaojing] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Beijing 100732, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Cai, F (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Social Sci, Beijing 100732, Peoples R China.",caifang@cass.org.cn,,,,,,,20,6,6,1,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-9018,1467-8462,,AUST ECON REV,Aust.

Many proposals to curb the government deficit and the resulting debt are being discussed. In this paper, we use the standard neoclassical growth model to examine the future path of output, budget deficits, and debt in the US economy under different tax policies. While this framework is relatively simple, it incorporates the general equilibrium effects of tax policy, which are often missing from the static scoring method used by the Congressional Budget Office. Our results show that debt-to-GNP ratios above are likely to continue into the future and that even small labor supply elasticities have a significant impact on these projections. We also find that labor income tax rates higher than are needed for the deficit-to-GNP ratio to return to its historical level in the long run. Such high tax rates, however, result in about 10 % lower per capita GNP and large welfare costs at the steady state compared to the historical tax rates.","[Chen, Kaiji] Emory Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Imrohoroglu, Ayse] Univ Southern Calif, Marshall Sch Business, Dept Finance & Business Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",Emory University; University of Southern California,"Imrohoroglu, A (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Marshall Sch Business, Dept Finance & Business Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",kaiji.chen@emory.edu; ayse@marshall.usc.edu,,,,,,,41,4,4,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

We consider both serious and minor crimes as classified by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, consider differential effects by the youth's gender and age, investigate the extent to which effects were stronger in states with more stringent work incentive policies and larger welfare caseload declines, and use a number of different model specifications to assess robustness and patterns. We find that welfare reform led to reduced arrests for minor crimes among youth ages 15-17 years by 9-11%, with similar estimates for males and females, but that it did not affect youth arrests for serious crimes. The results from this study add to a scant knowledge base about the effects of maternal employment on adolescent behavior by exploiting a large-scale social experiment that greatly increased employment of low-skilled women. The results also provide some support for the widely-embraced argument that welfare restrictions discourage undesirable social behavior, not only of mothers, but also of the next generation.

In Australian local government, New South Wales (NSW) has a longstanding rate-pegging regime, the Northern Territory (NT) caps mining and pastoral rates and Victoria has just implemented rate-capping. In addition, recent attempts have been made to introduce rate-pegging into South Australia (SA). This paper empirically assesses the likely impact of a rate-cap in SA local government by comparing the performance of SA with its NSW counterparts on three separate key measures (revenue effort, financial sustainability and efficiency) for the period 2013 to 2016. The paper demonstrates that - by comparison with NSW - SA municipalities' exhibit superior performance on these measures. The empirical evidence presented in the paper demonstrates that ratepegging should not be imposed on SA local government and instead other more promising policies considered.

In this paper, we fill this void in the literature by investigating how people allocate their time for different types of health-related activities in response to economic variables. Using the American Time Use Survey, we distinguish health-enhancing and health-deteriorating leisure activities, with the rationale that these activities may respond differently to socioeconomic environment. We find that health-enhancing and health-deteriorating time respond to economic variables in opposite directions. Specifically, a higher wage rate leads to a reduction in health-deteriorating activities but an increase in health-enhancing activities, particularly those with an investment nature. This finding holds for most subsamples we examine.

When labour markets are unionized, firms typically opt for under-capacity to dampen the unions' wage claims. This is in contrast with the conventional choice of over-capacity that applies when labour markets are competitive. Moreover, unless unions are distinctly oriented towards employment, the level of capacity is more efficient under centralized unionization than in a decentralized structure. Relative to more general welfare outcomes, profits are always higher under decentralization, but both consumer surplus and overall welfare can be higher under a centralized structure, depending on the unions' preference towards wages or employment.","[Fanti, Luciano; Meccheri, Nicola] Univ Pisa, Pisa, Italy; [Meccheri, Nicola] Rimini Ctr Econ Anal, Rimini, Italy",University of Pisa,"Fanti, L (通讯作者)，Univ Pisa, Pisa, Italy.",,"Meccheri, Nicola/AGK-0269-2022","Meccheri, Nicola/0000-0002-2251-0365",,,,,61,8,8,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

The models explore the role of discretion that such authorities enjoy, either in deciding how to pursue environmental violations (investigative and prosecutorial discretion) or in judging them (judicial discretion). The purpose is to identify both the optimal firms' behaviour in terms of compliance, and the enforcement authorities' optimal strategies in terms of enforcement actions to undertake. Consistent with the setting of the game theoretic models, the role of the enforcement agencies in deterring firms from polluting is, then, empirically tested by means of laboratory experiments. Laboratory evidence on compliance behaviour of firms when faced with enforcement conditions predicted by the theoretical models set up is discussed for the different experimental treatments performed. Overall, we suggest that making environmental enforcement less predictable for the firms, and thus creating a degree of uncertainty for the violators, can actually encourage deterrence and, thus, improve compliance. Thus, a partly unpredictable enforcement strategy may generate more compliance than an environmental policy that is known with certainty in advance.","[Germani, Anna Rita] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Law Philosophy & Econ Studies, Ple Aldo Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Scaramozzino, Pasquale] SOAS Univ London, Sch Finance & Management, Thornhaugh St,Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England; [Scaramozzino, Pasquale] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dipartimento Econ & Finanza, Via Columbia 2, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [Morone, Andrea] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dipartimento Econ Management & Diritto Impresa, Largo Abbazia Santa Scolastica 53, I-70124 Bari, Italy; [Morone, Piergiuseppe] Unitelma Sapienza Univ Rome, BiT RG, Viale Regina Elena 295, I-00161 Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); University of Rome Tor Vergata; Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro; Universita degli Studi di Roma Unitelma Sapienza,"Germani, AR (通讯作者)，Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Law Philosophy & Econ Studies, Ple Aldo Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",annarita.germani@uniroma1.it,"Germani, Anna Rita/Y-8566-2019","Germani, Anna Rita/0000-0002-6091-0220; Scaramozzino, Pasquale/0000-0003-4917-6560",,,,,91,4,4,1,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

Thus, migration has a complementary external effect on native wages: the elasticities of complementarity of migrants are about 31.7%, 20.3%, and 19.9% for native workers with a college, high school and less than high school education, respectively. After the wage is deflated by the housing price, the elasticities decline to 11%, 8.2% and -4.4% for the respective education groups, which provides the lower-bound analysis results. In addition, migration has widened wage dispersion, as well as increasing the education premium and residual inequality. The elasticity of substitution in jobs between migrants and natives is very low due to the hukou restriction, and increasing proportions of migrants in any given labor force widen the migrant/native wage gap. Job segregation is an important factor that explains particular labor market findings in China.","[Han, Jun] Renmin Univ China, Sch Labor & Human Resources, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Shi] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Beijing, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; Beijing Normal University,"Han, J (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Labor & Human Resources, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jhan@ruc.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473132, 71103097]; Project of Humanities and Social Sciences of the Ministry of Education, China [10YJC790074]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Project of Humanities and Social Sciences of the Ministry of Education, China","We would like to thank Tak-Wai Chau, Haiqiang Chen, Yuanyuan Chen, Ying Fang, Shuaizhang Feng, Shihe Fu, Xia Li, Cheryl Xiaoning Long, Lei Meng, Kailing Shen, Yufei Yuan, Zhong Zhao, and the seminar participants in Beijing Normal University, Renmin University of China, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, and Xiamen University for their helpful comments and suggestions.

The autoregressive distributed-lag (ARDL) bounds-testing results suggest that, across the study period, the Thai money stock (narrow or broad), real output, prices, interest rates and exchange rates maintained a long-run equilibrium relationship. The associated error-correction model of inflation confirms the cointegral relationship among money (narrow or broad), real output, prices, interest rates and exchange rates. It also suggests that money growth has a significant distributed-lag impact on inflation. The presence of this money growth-inflation relationship was associated with a stable narrow money-demand function, whereas the broad money-demand function remained unstable. These results for the study period are consistent with the view that the causal relationship between money growth and inflation holds in Thailand under inflation targeting when the Bank of Thailand deploys a short-term policy interest rate, rather than a monetary aggregate, as the instrument of monetary policy and that this relationship is not conditional on the stability of the money-demand function.

However, it has become increasingly recognized, both at the academic and political level, that focusing purely on income provides a limited picture of social progress. We illustrate how ex-ante policy evaluation can be performed in terms of richer concepts of individual well-being, such as subjective life satisfaction and equivalent incomes. Our analysis makes use of EUROMOD, the EU-wide tax-benefit microsimulation model, along with 2013 EU-SILC data for Sweden, which for the first time provides information on life satisfaction. Our results show that the effect of potential reforms varies widely depending on the well-being concept used in the evaluation.

The countries are grouped in three clusters depending on size of public health expenditure as a share of GDP. This gives us the possibility to test whether private and public health expenditures have different impacts on life expectancy at different levels of public expenditure as a share of GDP. Panel unit root tests show that all series in clusters are not difference stationary. Co-integration is found for countries with high public expenditure as a share of GDP. The results, augmented with panel VAR models and impulse response analysis, stress the importance of the positive relationship between public health expenditures and life expectancy. Additional results based on private health expenditure as a share of GDP show also the importance of private expenditures for life expectancy, although these are, at the same time, also driven up by public health expenditures.

Second, we find that reduced fertility is associated with higher educational outcomes for immigrant children, possibly through a quantity-quality trade-off. Third, we show that between one-third and the complete difference in family-size adjusted educational outcomes between immigrants from different source countries or immigrant generations can be explained by parental background.

To the surprise of many policy makers and economists, more than 80% of the households in urban China owned private housing by the end of 2010. In contrast to most developed countries, we find that male siblings are important borrowing resources to purchase housing. Conditional on the number of siblings, having more brothers instead of sisters increases the probability of owning housing among male individuals born during the baby boom (1949-1978) in urban China. However, there is no such brother effect for females. The brother effect is stronger for males with low income or low levels of education and is also stronger when brothers are wealthier. Our results are robust to different model specifications. Our results suggest that females are likely to be excluded from family-based informal financial market for housing purchase among baby boom generations in China.","[Wang, Shun] KDI Sch Publ Policy & Management, 263 Nansejong Ro, Sejong, South Korea; [Zhou, Weina] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Econ, 6214 Univ Ave, Halifax, NS, Canada",KDI School of Public Policy & Management; Dalhousie University,"Zhou, WN (通讯作者)，Dalhousie Univ, Dept Econ, 6214 Univ Ave, Halifax, NS, Canada.",swang@kdis.ac.kr; weina.zhou@dal.ca,,,KDI School of Public Policy and Management Grant [20150053],KDI School of Public Policy and Management Grant,Wang gratefully acknowledges the financial support from KDI School of Public Policy and Management Grant # (20150053).,,39,5,6,2,31,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

Using the 2007 Graduate Tracer Study (GTS-07) dataset, approximately 32 percent of workers were deemed mismatched and 52 percent were actively looking for another job. Using a logit model, the risk of being engaged in on-the-job search activity was higher among the mismatched workers and the magnitude of the effects was greater for the severely mismatched than for the moderately mismatched workers. This suggests that the mismatched workers are heterogeneous. This might be due to different traits of workers or there may be unobserved heterogeneity that varies from one mismatched to another mismatched worker.","[Zakariya, Zainizam] Sultan Idris Educ Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Tanjung Malim 35900, Ipoh, Malaysia",Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris,"Zakariya, Z (通讯作者)，Sultan Idris Educ Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Tanjung Malim 35900, Ipoh, Malaysia.",zainizam@fpe.upsi.edu.my,,"Zakariya, Zainizam/0000-0002-3411-1898",,,,,26,2,2,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-3958,1467-8381,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

The results show that there is high volatility regime in both the 2012 and 2017 bonds US market, which significantly affects bond prices.","[Masood, Omar] Univ East London, Business Sch, London, England; [Aktan, Bora] Univ Bahrain, Dept Econ & Finance, Coll Business Adm, Isa Town, Bahrain; [Aktan, Bora] Future Univ Egypt, Fac Commerce & Business Adm, New Cairo, Egypt; [Gavurova, Beata] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Kosice, Slovakia; [Fakhry, Bachar] Univ Bedfordshire, Business Sch, Luton, Beds, England; [Tvaronaviciene, Manuela] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Econ & Management Enterprises, Fac Business Management, Vilnius, Lithuania; [Tvaronaviciene, Manuela] Gen Jonas Zemaitis Mil Acad Lithuania, Dept Management, Vilnius, Lithuania; [Martinkute-Kauliene, Raimonda] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Financial Engn, Fac Business Management, Vilnius, Lithuania",University of East London; University of Bahrain; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Future University in Egypt; Technical University Kosice; University of Bedfordshire; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; General Jonas Zemaitis Military Academy of Lithuania; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Tvaronaviciene, M (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Econ & Management Enterprises, Fac Business Management, Vilnius, Lithuania.;Tvaronaviciene, M (通讯作者)，Gen Jonas Zemaitis Mil Acad Lithuania, Dept Management, Vilnius, Lithuania.",manuela.tvaronaviciene@vgtu.lt,"Tvaronaviciene, Manuela/GVT-4155-2022; /I-3713-2019; Gavurová, Beáta/N-9159-2018; Aktan, Bora/S-6019-2017","Tvaronaviciene, Manuela/0000-0002-9667-3730; /0000-0002-9667-3730; Gavurová, Beáta/0000-0002-0606-879X; Aktan, Bora/0000-0002-1334-3542; Masood, Omar/0000-0001-5481-4032",,,,,93,24,25,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We implement an artefactual field experiment in Malawi to test the ability of households to manage a cash windfall by varying whether 474 households receive a payment in cash or through direct deposit into pre-established accounts at a local bank. Payments are made immediately, with one day delay, or with eight days delay. Defaulting the payments into savings accounts leads to higher net deposits into bank accounts, an effect that persists for a number of weeks afterwards. However, neither savings defaults nor payment delays affect the amount or composition of spending, suggesting that households manage cash effectively without the use of formal financial products.","[Brune, Lasse] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Gine, Xavier] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Goldberg, Jessica] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Yang, Dean] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Yale University; The World Bank; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Goldberg, J (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",lasse.brune@yale.edu; xgine@worldbank.org; goldberg@econ.umd.edu; deanyang@umich.edu,,"Yang, Dean/0000-0002-5165-3816",Innovations for Poverty Action - Bill 84 Melinda Gates Foundation [11044AA],Innovations for Poverty Action - Bill 84 Melinda Gates Foundation,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the Yale Savings and Payments Research Fund at Innovations for Poverty Action, sponsored by a grant from the Bill 84 Melinda Gates Foundation (11044AA).

However, often - such as when agents are heterogeneous - there is a trade-off between efficiency and equality - a normative conflict - which is overlooked. Agents' concerns for equality in such instances can limit the ability of mechanisms to promote efficiency. We provide evidence for this from a public good experiment using a simple mechanism allowing individuals to communicate periodically with other group members and reward them for their actions. We show that, in homogeneous populations - where there is no conflict between efficiency and equality - the mechanism permits groups to obtain maximum efficiency. This is not the case in heterogeneous populations despite the fact that individuals could use rewards to resolve the normative conflict. Although almost all heterogeneous groups agree to follow specific contribution rules with positive contributions, most of them either prioritize equality over efficiency or strike a compromise between the two. These findings suggest normative conflict can be difficult to overcome, imposing limits on the ability of heterogeneous populations to reach efficient outcomes through self-governance.

Using a two-agent New Keynesian model, we show analytically that the multiplier on targeted transfers to financially constrained households is (i) larger than the purchase multiplier if the zero lower bound (ZLB) binds, and (ii) is more sensitive to the degree of monetary accommodation of inflation. Targeted transfers provide the same boost to demand as purchases, but lower aggregate supply relative to purchases, as those receiving transfers want to work less. When the aggregate demand curve inverts such as when the ZLB binds the extra inflation from lower supply boosts the multiplier.

Foreign firms choose between exporting and foreign direct investment (FDI) to serve the domestic market. If two firms compete in the domestic market, multilateral liberalization of FDI or the realization of multilateral free trade may deter or delay technology adoption, while they always promote and accelerate technology adoption if only a single firm serves the domestic market. Technology adoption can be quickest and consumer welfare greatest when the fixed cost of FDI and the trade costs are neither very high nor very low. Preferential liberalization of FDI promotes the technology adoption of the targeted firm but may not benefit consumers because it discourages technology adoption of the non-targeted firm.","[Mukunoki, Hiroshi] Gakushuin Univ, Fac Econ, Toshima Ku, Mejiro 1-5-1, Tokyo 1718588, Japan",Gakushuin University,"Mukunoki, H (通讯作者)，Gakushuin Univ, Fac Econ, Toshima Ku, Mejiro 1-5-1, Tokyo 1718588, Japan.",hiroshi.mukunoki@gakushuin.ac.jp,"Mukunoki, Hiroshi/AAA-1210-2021","Mukunoki, Hiroshi/0000-0002-1390-6341",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16H03620] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,23,0,0,0,18,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

Extending work by Kenneth L. Judd, I demonstrate that the canonical result that the optimal tax on capital income is zero in the medium to long term is a special case of a more general model. Employing a vector error correction model to estimate the relationship between government consumption and net output or the factor inputs that generate it for the United States between 1948Q1 and 2015Q4, I demonstrate that this special case is empirically implausible, and show how a cointegrating vector can be used to determine the optimal tax schedule. I simulate a version of the model using the empirical estimates to measure the welfare implications of changing the tax rate on asset income, and contrast these results with those generated in a version of the model where government consumption is purely exogenous. The shifting pattern of welfare measurements confirms the theoretical results. I calculate that the prevailing effective tax rate on net asset income in the United States between 1970 and 2014 averaged 0.449. Hence abolishing the tax completely does generate welfare improvements, though only by the equivalent of between 1.103% and 1.616% permanent increase in consumption-well under half the implied welfare benefit when the endogeneity of the government consumption is ignored. The maximum welfare improvement from shifting part of the burden of tax from capital to labor is the equivalent of a permanent increase in consumption of between only 1.491% and 1.858%, and is attained when the tax rate on asset income is lowered to between 0.148 and 0.186. Allowing the tax rate to vary over time raises the maximum welfare benefit to 1.865%. All the results are very robust to a wide range of elasticities of labor supply.","[Ben-Gad, Michael] City Univ London, Dept Econ, Northampton Sq, London EC1V 0HB, England",City University London,"Ben-Gad, M (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Dept Econ, Northampton Sq, London EC1V 0HB, England.",mbengad@city.ac.uk,,"Ben-Gad, Michael/0000-0001-8641-4199",,,,,32,3,3,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

Since untitled land cannot be traded across farmers, it creates land misallocation and distorts individuals' occupational choice between farming and working outside agriculture. I build a two-sector general equilibrium model to quantify the impact of untitled land. I find that economies with higher percentages of untitled land would have lower agricultural productivity; land titling can increase agricultural productivity by up to 82.5 percent. About 42 percent of this gain is due to eliminating land misallocation, and the remaining is due to eliminating distortions in individuals' occupational choice.","[Chen, Chaoran] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, 1 Arts Link AS2 04-38, Singapore 117568, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Chen, CR (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, 1 Arts Link AS2 04-38, Singapore 117568, Singapore.",ecscc@nus.edu.sg,,"Chen, Chaoran/0000-0001-5540-6858",,,,,41,59,67,9,75,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7707,1945-7715,,AM ECON J-MACROECON,Am.

However, the academic literature on OPEC focuses more on its production behavior than on analyzing the quota allocation process or characterizing quota violation patterns. This paper offers a theoretical model with empirical evidence to explain OPEC members' incentives for abiding or violating quotas. We first offer a cartel model with a quota allocation rule and an endogenous capacity choice. The model highlights the trade-off between building spare capacity to bargain for a higher legitimate quota versus risking quota violation punishment. Using the quarterly data from 1995 to 2007, we empirically support the main results and intuitions for the model. Our empirical evidence is consistent with a theoretical framing in which capacity constraints work as an enforcement mechanism in good times and OPEC's quota system disciplining its members in bad times.

Appraisals provide workers who believe they control their environment a tool to demonstrate their value and achieve their goals. We confirm that workers who are risk tolerant also sort into jobs with performance appraisals but explain why the influence of the locus of control and risk tolerance should not be additive. We demonstrate this by estimating a routinely large and significantly negative interaction in our sorting equations.
