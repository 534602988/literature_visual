With the aim of better understanding how to satisfy the internal and external client's needs, in order to produce value for the company, this work provides an analysis of the e-marketing most popular practices and a study on a new internal management system, Holacracy, with insight about what is the relationship between client and the company that has implemented it. Holacracy system is one of the most popular decentralized management approaches available at the moment which provides an organizational management model for making companies more adaptable, flexible and more responsive to change. In most of the companies, according to traditional management principles, each employee has an accurate definition of the job s/he has to perform through the job description. In Holacracy, employees can learn through training programs to perform new roles, giving up those that are no longer up to date through the company's evolution. Thus, the roles are being endowed with authority and not the people who perform those roles. This paper is presenting a study about Holacracy principles and the recommended constitution adopted by the companies that are implementing Holacracy by a comparative view with the classic management principles, considering the analysis on the digital e-marketing practices that are reshaping the relation between company and the internal and external clients. The benefits and the disadvantages presented by new management practice, Holacracy, will be pictured by a contextual analysis with today's business e-marketing conducted environment.","[Gheorghe, Simona; Purcarea, Anca Alexandra; Popescu, Mirona] Univ Politehn Bucuresti, 313 Splaiul Independentei,6th Dist, Bucharest, Romania",National University of Science & Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest,"Gheorghe, S (通讯作者)，Univ Politehn Bucuresti, 313 Splaiul Independentei,6th Dist, Bucharest, Romania.",simona.gheorghe10@gmail.com; apurcarea@gmail.com; mirona.popescu@soft-to-you.com,"Popescu, Mirona Ana-Maria/AAT-5857-2020",,,,,,13,0,0,0,13,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,398,407,,,,,,10,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200035,0

The basis of the research is the secondary sources of information. The use of consumption indicators in the research concerning the standard of living enables recognition of the pace and direction of income dispersion of population's available income for satisfying miscellaneous groups of needs. The expenditures, as a derivative of income, their level, structure and changes in time provide relatively accurate image of the degree of satisfaction from particular needs which in turn provide more complete image of standard of living. One of the oldest consumption measures, used to evaluate the standard of living of whole societies and particular households, is food index. Its thorough analysis enables the comparisons made in time and space. The analysis of food index (on the basis of Eurostat data) indicated that the European Union standard of living is significantly spatially diverse. Great Britain, Ireland and Luxembourg were classified as the countries with the highest standard of living in 2016 - measured according to food index, while Baltic countries along with Bulgaria and Romania were characterized by the lowest standard of living.","[Grzega, Urszula] Univ Econ Katowice, Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Grzega, U (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, Katowice, Poland.",ugrzega@ue.katowice.pl,"Grzega, Urszula/T-7312-2018","Grzega, Urszula/0000-0002-1220-7880",,,,,19,0,0,0,2,UNIV WISMAR,WISMAR,"PHILIPP-MULLER-STRASSE 14, WISMAR, 23966, GERMANY",,,978-3-942100-56-4,,,,2018,,,,,,,15,21,,,,,,7,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BN0CA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000472641400002,0

The scientific literature discusses various benefits of cultural diversity to organisations, e.g., establishing the encouraging environment of outside the box thinking. Diverse management is more likely to introduce product innovations; moreover, diversity is particularly important for reaching international markets and serving the cosmopolitan population. Diversity encompasses race, gender, age, culture, education, personality, skills and life experiences. When managed effectively, cultural diversity offers the flexibility and creativity that is needed for enhanced innovation.

The TFP growth model reveals that the catch-up effect, human capital, smaller population, weak currency, and research and development growth are significant sources of TFP growth. We do not find a systematic difference in the TFP growth models for MICs. In analyzing the role of factors influencing TFP growth at different income stages, strengthening innovative activities and building innovative capacities are important in overcoming the challenges that MICs face when transitioning to the high-income group. Governments of upper MICs need to initiate reform to motivate innovation by optimizing national R&D systems, and redesigning the educational system to target promoting innovation.","[Kim, Jungsuk] Sejong Univ, Econ & Trade Dept, Seoul, South Korea; [Park, Jungsoo] Sogang Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Sejong University; Sogang University,"Park, J (通讯作者)，Sogang Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",jspark@sogang.ac.kr,"Park, Jungsoo/O-1772-2016",,Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2016S1A3A2923769]; Sejong University,"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); Sejong University",This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2016S1A3A2923769] and Sejong University Research Fund.,,39,17,20,9,45,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The article proposes a method for assessing competition based on the behavioral interpretation of competition, which is implemented to assess the competitive factors in the Omsk regional food market. The evaluation of competition in the behavioral interpretation is determined by the evaluation of the perception of competition.

By combining insights from the literature on Varieties of Capitalism and education sociology, the study investigates how the educational system and the political economy jointly affect the social stratification of educational choices and condition income differentials between graduates of vocational and general education programmes. The empirical analysis contributes to the literature by contrasting the two conceptions of equality and applying a richer institutional approach than previous studies within the fields of education sociology and Varieties of Capitalism. The results reveal that tracking hinders equality of educational opportunity but is also related to higher incomes for vocational education graduates in certain contexts. Wage bargaining coordination reinforces the more equal opportunities of weakly tracked contexts and improves the relative income of vocational graduates in these contexts.","[Osterman, Marcus] Uppsala Univ, Dept Govt, Uppsala, Sweden",Uppsala University,"Österman, M (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, Dept Govt, Uppsala, Sweden.",marcus.osterman@statsvet.uu.se,"Österman, Marcus/JNS-3475-2023","Österman, Marcus/0000-0003-3026-3779",Department of Government at Uppsala University; Uppsala Center for Labor Studies,Department of Government at Uppsala University; Uppsala Center for Labor Studies,This work was supported by Department of Government at Uppsala University and the Uppsala Center for Labor Studies.,,49,9,9,1,39,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

By examining the trade-related policies of nine major countries for their film industries over the last forty years, several important findings are extracted which contribute towards a more pragmatic debate on 'trade and culture'. First, regulatory barriers such as import or screen quotas should be avoided at all costs since they do not protect the domestic film industry. Second, tax relief schemes are unreliable because they tend to offer excessive support to attract foreign film producers. Third, as a choice to be considered, subsidies should be kept reasonable in size and focus on consistent goals. Fourth, well-designed trade agreements can contribute greatly to enhance film policies. Finally, once combined, these results explain to a large extent the remarkable success of the Korean film industry over the last two decades, which can be a good bench marker for countries that want to enhance their film industry and to promote their culture.","[Parc, Jimmyn] Seoul Natl Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, EU Ctr, Seoul, South Korea; [Parc, Jimmyn; Messerlin, Patrick] Sci Po Paris, Paris, France",Seoul National University (SNU),"Parc, J (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, EU Ctr, Seoul, South Korea.;Parc, J (通讯作者)，Sci Po Paris, Paris, France.",jimmynparc@gmail.com; patrick.messerlin@gmail.com,"Parc, Jimmyn/AAD-4706-2020","Parc, Jimmyn/0000-0002-4836-460X",Laboratory Program for Korean Studies through the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; Korean Studies Promotion Service of the Academy of Korean Studies [AKS-2015-LAB-2250003],"Laboratory Program for Korean Studies through the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); Korean Studies Promotion Service of the Academy of Korean Studies",This work was supported by the Laboratory Program for Korean Studies through the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the Korean Studies Promotion Service of the Academy of Korean Studies (AKS-2015-LAB-2250003).

The black-box character of neural networks makes it difficult establishing appropriate priors for the weights of the neural network.

We further extend the model to dependent Dirichlet process mixtures to allow the model to account for non-stationarity in the data.

The major findings show that group-affiliated firms take advantage of internal capital markets and transactions with related parties (e.g., low transference price or loans at competitive interest rates) that reduces the demand for external debt. Majority shareholders in affiliated firms behave as controllers of managers, on the one hand, and avoid the supervisory role of debt, on the other hand. In stand-alone firms, supervision led by majority shareholders is complemented by the monitoring role of debt through higher levels of leverage. We conclude that further developments in capital structure theories adjusted to the particularities of the different institutional contexts are needed.","[Saona, Paolo] St Louis Univ, Richard A Chaifetz Sch Business, Madrid Campus,Av Del Valle 34, Madrid 28003, Spain; [Saona, Paolo; San Martin, Pablo] Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Fac Ciencias Econ & Adm, Concepcion, Chile; [Jara, Mauricio] Univ Chile, Business Dept, Sch Econ & Business, Santiago, Chile",Universidad Catolica de la Santisima Concepcion; Universidad de Chile,"Saona, P (通讯作者)，St Louis Univ, Richard A Chaifetz Sch Business, Madrid Campus,Av Del Valle 34, Madrid 28003, Spain.",paolo.saona@slu.edu,"Jara, Mauricio/HHN-5573-2022; San Martin, Pablo/AGP-8502-2022; Saona, Paolo/ABE-3912-2020; San Martín Mosqueira, Pablo/T-7977-2019","Saona, Paolo/0000-0002-3151-9855; Jara, Mauricio/0000-0001-6339-3794; San Martin Mosqueira, Pablo/0000-0002-1944-9399",,,,,101,13,14,3,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

This article contributes to filling this gap by investigating the asymmetric effects of the two types of policies on trade-credit substitution for bank credit using data from the largest emerging economy, China. China presents an ideal experimental context, as the country has implemented both types of monetary policies in the past decades. We find strong evidence that quantity-based monetary policy has stronger effects on credit substitution in China. This evidence is robust under both static and dynamic specifications, which remains intact after the disentanglement of the interdependency of the two types of policies. By subgrouping, we find that large and state-controlled firms play the central role in creating the substitution asymmetry. Furthermore, international evidence indicates that India also witnesses substitution asymmetry skewed to quantity-based policies. The findings suggest the need for further reform of China's financial system toward a market-based system to enhance the effectiveness of the proposed monetary policies.","[Shi, Xiaojun] Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Ma, Rong] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xing] Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; Tsinghua University; Renmin University of China,"Shi, XJ (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",sxjstein@gmail.com,,"Shi, Xiaojun/0000-0002-3676-7786","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71172014, 71673281]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71172014, 71673281).",,18,0,1,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

From a business innovation perspective, the history of music distribution has always followed the trend of making it accessible but also profitable. Creative breakthroughs in software technology have made it possible for intermediaries to distribute music to huge crowds all over the world. The emergence of on-demand streaming platforms such as Spotify or or Deezer has transformed the idea of purchasing music from a pay-for-song model to a payed subscription model, causing controversies on the sensitive topic of intellectual property rights and royalty payments. However, the benefits of streaming music using these platforms translate in increased usage and therefore, higher revenues on scale. This paper offers an overview of the innovative business models of the online streaming music industry, concentrating on the unique added value new platforms offer, namely transforming unpaid consumption into payed subscription. We start with a short background of the major developments of music as an art, from an elitist attribute to a large-scale available service. A short review of the innovations in music distribution in the last centuries is performed in order to make it possible to differentiate between the major services existing today. For the applied section of this paper, we look at the increased usage of interactive streaming platforms such as Sirius XM, Pandora and Spotify, and correlate the data with their global revenues. Authors also look at the data regarding music piracy in order to assess if there is a negative impact of the on-demand streaming platforms on piracy practices. Conclusions are drawn regarding the impact of on-demand streaming platforms on overall usage, with a focus on the need to further develop business models that make the music industry both profitable and sustainable in the long run while simultaneously allowing for world-wide accessibility.","[Suciu, Marta-Christina; Nasulea, Diana; Nasulea, Christian] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 6 Piata Romana,Sect 1, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Suciu, MC (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 6 Piata Romana,Sect 1, Bucharest, Romania.",christina.suciu@economie.ase.ro; diana@nasulea.ro; christian@nasulea.ro,"Nasulea, Christian/B-7060-2015",,,,,,37,0,0,0,8,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,1414,1425,,,,,,12,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200119,0

It argues that China's domestic regulatory framework for rare earths has been phenomenally reshaped by the WTO Rare Earths case. First, China removed the export restrictions on rare earths in order to implement the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) Rulings. Second, China improved environmental legislation to facilitate its defence in the WTO Rare Earths case, and incorporated environmental protection concerns in its regulatory philosophy. Third, China invested more administrative resources in mobilizing local governments to better implement rare earths policies, which cover the mining, production, circulation, and industrial consolidation of rare earths. While the first measure was mandatory in terms of China's obligation to implement WTO DSB rulings, the second and the third initiatives resulted from China's voluntary adjustment of its governance in reaction to the WTO Rare Earths case. Reading China's engagement with the WTO Rare Earths case in the broader context of China's performance in the WTO Dispute Settlement System (DSS), it is evident that China is a firm supporter of the WTO DSS: China has kept its good record of compliance with the WTO rulings, maintained its reputation as an active player in the WTO DSS, and embraced WTO's far-reaching impact on its domestic management regime.","[Wang, Chenxi] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Intellectual Property, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chenxi] UNSW, Fac Law, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Wang, Chenxi] WTO, Doctoral Support Programme, Geneva, Switzerland",Nanjing University of Science & Technology; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Wang, CX (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Intellectual Property, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Wang, CX (通讯作者)，UNSW, Fac Law, Sydney, NSW, Australia.;Wang, CX (通讯作者)，WTO, Doctoral Support Programme, Geneva, Switzerland.",pureair_wang@msn.com,"wang, chenxi/HMD-9902-2023","Wang, Chenxi/0000-0001-9263-6126",,,,,71,4,5,0,8,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

No mediation effects of information screening and cooperative mechanism are found in the relationship between RAIT and entrepreneurship. Moreover, during the venturing process, risks accompanying interpersonal trust cannot be reduced by social input; the reduction occurs only in eastern China where the economic system and the industrial development standards are more comprehensive and mature.

There are more than 50 current ISO standards on nanotechnology. Some of these relate to the working environment and occupational risk management. In Latin America, entities that are members of ISO are enunciating national versions of the international standards. In this article, this context is analysed critically, starting from the Mexican standard on occupational risk management in the working environment. Even though risk management standards may guarantee better and safer working conditions, in the field of nanotechnology, they simultaneously unlock detrimental implications for workers and society. Reliance on such private and voluntary forms of industry self-regulation is identified as a by-product of global neoliberalism.","[Foladori, Guillermo] Univ Autonoma Zacatecas, Zacatecas, Mexico",Universidad Autonoma de Zacatecas,"Foladori, G (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Zacatecas, Unidad Acad Estudios Desarrollo, Ave Preparatoria S-N, Zacatecas 98000, Mexico.",gfoladori@gmail.com,"Foladori, Guillermo/M-9602-2013","Foladori, Guillermo/0000-0002-7441-3233",,,,,57,1,2,0,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Ecosystem services approaches have been seen as one way to change this by focussing explicitly on maintaining ecosystems for human well-being of stakeholders at various scales. However, ecosystem services approaches have often ignored trade-offs between groups of people and issues of power and do not automatically lead to better outcomes in terms of human well-being. Here we report on a study on the impacts of reforestation projects with an explicit focus on human well-being in three communities in southern Ethiopia. We investigated the distribution of services and disservices from reforestation using qualitative methods. Results showed that the services and disservices from reforestation were distributed unequally across space and wealth groups resulting in widespread dissatisfaction with existing reforestation projects despite the explicit focus on human benefits. To improve outcomes of reforestation it is necessary to acknowledge and manage disservices adaptively, include issues of power and make trade-offs transparent.","[Byg, Anja; Novo, Paula] James Hutton Inst, Social Econ & Geog Sci, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland; [Dinato, Mengistu; Moges, Awdenegest; Tefera, Tewodros; Woldeamanuel, Teshale] Hawassa Univ, POB 5, Hawassa, Sidama, Ethiopia; [Balana, Bedru] Int Water Management Inst, PMB CT 112, Accra, Ghana; [Black, Helaina] James Hutton Inst, Ecol Sci, Dundee DD2 5DA, Scotland",James Hutton Institute; Hawassa University; CGIAR; International Water Management Institute (IWMI); James Hutton Institute,"Byg, A (通讯作者)，James Hutton Inst, Social Econ & Geog Sci, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland.",anja.byg@hutton.ac.uk,"Tefera, Tewodros/HTN-6403-2023; black, helaina/HHM-9892-2022; Amede, Tewodros Tefera/AAT-2689-2021; Moges, Awdenegest/JWA-5800-2024","Moges, Awdenegest/0000-0001-6084-8327; Novo, Paula/0000-0002-5635-3636; Balana, Bedru/0000-0002-7344-5743","Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation (ESPA) programme [NE/K010441/1]; Department for International Development (DFID); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC); NERC [NE/K010441/1, NE/K010298/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/K010441/1, NE/K010298/1] Funding Source: researchfish",Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation (ESPA) programme; Department for International Development (DFID); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"We wish to thank the participants in the three study communities for their time and patience and for sharing their insights and opinions with us.

The aim of this study was to determine the extent of the relationship between DC derived values (indirect method) and VAS values (direct method). Data were collected in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States. Respondents were asked to perform paired comparisons between two EQ-5D-5L health states for DC. In total, 400 different EQ-5D-5L states were included. After each DC task, respondents were prompted to score the two states one after another on a VAS. Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated between DC and VAS values and illuminating graphs were designed. Approximately 400 respondents participated from each country. High similarity [individual intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) > 0.85] of DC and moderate correspondence of VAS values were observed for the four countries. Cross-country comparison of DC values shows a nonlinear relationship to the VAS values. EQ-5D-5L derived DC and VAS values show a close but nonlinear relationship. Given the obvious biases associated with the VAS, DC methods based on ordinal responses may be a better alternative.","[Krabbe, Paul F.

In handling these problems education for sustainable development (ESD) is seen as important. Different key competences that ESD should focus on have been introduced, such as the ability to deal with future dimensions. Still, studies indicate that future dimensions are not always included in ESD and that many young people are pessimistic concerning the global future. Therefore, one could argue that a focus on anticipatory emotions, especially hope, should be included in ESD. There is a worry, however, that hope will lead to unrealistic optimism and/or less engagement. The aim of this paper is to problematize the discussion about hope in relation to ESD and the global future by grounding it in theories from different disciplines and in empirical research about young people, hope, and climate change. The review shows that hope is a complex, multifaceted, and sometimes contested concept. Hope can be related to denial, but in other cases it can help people face and do something constructive with their worries about the global future. The close relation between hope and trust is emphasized and a need for critical emotional awareness in ESD is argued for. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The current gold standard is histopathological assessment of biopsied tissue, which is subjective and dependent on expertise. Straticyte (TM), a novel prognostic tool at the pre-market stage, that more accurately identifies patients at high risk for oral cancer than histopathology alone. This study conducts an early cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of Straticyte (TM) and histopathology versus histopathology alone for oral cancer diagnosis in adult patients. Methods: A decision-analytic model was constructed after narrowing the scope of Straticyte (TM), and defining application paths. Data was gathered using the belief elicitation method, and systematic review and meta-analysis. The early CEA was conducted from private-payer and patient perspectives, capturing both direct and indirect costs over a five-year time horizon. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to investigate uncertainty. Results: Compared to histopathology alone, histopathology with Straticyte (TM) was the dominant strategy, resulting in fewer cancer cases (31 versus 36 per 100 patients) and lower total costs per cancer case avoided (3,360 versus 3,553). This remained robust when Straticyte (TM) was applied to moderate and mild cases, but became slightly more expensive but still more effective than histopathology alone when Straticyte (TM) was applied to only mild cases. The probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses demonstrated that incorporating Straticyte (TM) to the current algorithm would be cost-effective over a wide range of parameters and willingness-to-pay values. Conclusion: This study demonstrates high probability that Straticyte (TM) and histopathology will be cost-effective, which encourages continued investment in the product. The analysis is informed by limited clinical data on Straticyte (TM), however as more data becomes available, more precise estimates will be generated.","[Khoudigian-Sinani, S.; Blackhouse, G.; Levine, M.; Thabane, L.; O'Reilly, D.] McMaster Univ, Dept Hlth Res Methods Evidence & Impact, Fac Hlth Sci, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Khoudigian-Sinani, S.; Blackhouse, G.; Levine, M.; O'Reilly, D.] St Josephs Healthcare Hamilton, PATH Res Inst, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Levine, M.; Thabane, L.; O'Reilly, D.] Res Inst St Josephs, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Khoudigian-Sinani, S.] Specializing Hlth Technol Assessment HTA, HRM, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Levine, M.] St Josephs Healthcare Hamilton, Ctr Evaluat Med, Father Sean OSullivan Res Ctr, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Levine, M.] Patented Med Prices Review Board Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Thabane, L.] McMaster Univ, Dept Anesthesia Pediat, Fac Hlth Sci, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Thabane, L.] St Josephs Healthcare, Biostat Unit, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Thabane, L.] Hamilton Hlth Sci, Populat Hlth Res Inst, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [O'Reilly, D.] St Josephs Healthcare, PATH, Res Inst, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [O'Reilly, D.] Minist Res & Innovat, Early Researcher Award Recipient, Toronto, ON, Canada",McMaster University; McMaster University; McMaster University; McMaster University; McMaster University; Population Health Research Institute,"Khoudigian-Sinani, S (通讯作者)，McMaster Univ, Dept Hlth Res Methods Evidence & Impact, Fac Hlth Sci, Hamilton, ON, Canada.;Khoudigian-Sinani, S (通讯作者)，St Josephs Healthcare Hamilton, PATH Res Inst, Hamilton, ON, Canada.",khoudisv@mcmaster.ca,,,Federal Government; Proteocyte Diagnostic Inc.,Federal Government; Proteocyte Diagnostic Inc.,"The MITACS Accelerate Program (funding by the Federal Government and Proteocyte Diagnostic Inc) supported this research.

Whether the industry will be sustainable depends largely on social acceptability in general and market acceptability of the biofuels among the public in particular. We conducted contingent valuation surveys of general public in the US states of Oregon and Washington to determine people's willingness to pay (WTP) for wood-based cellulosic biofuels and the factors that influence their WTP decisions. Oregon has an existing cellulosic biorefinery, while Washington's biorefineries are only being planned, allowing us to conduct an ex-ante (Washington) versus ex-post (Oregon) WTP comparison. We sent out mail surveys to 2828 valid mailing addresses between May and July of 2015 and received 757 completed surveys. We used the distribution-free Turnbull estimator to estimate the expected WTP and logistic regression to determine the relative strength of predictors on WTP. About one fifth (18.8%) of the respondents were willing to pay some premium for wood-based cellulosic biofuels. The mean WTP amount was $0.19 +/- $0.03/gal. (95% confidence interval: $0.17 to $0.21), which equates to a 6.4% price premium on top of the market price for gasoline. Logistic regression results showed that the offered bid price, knowledge on biofuels, age and religious affiliation of respondents were statistically significant predictors of WTP decisions. No significant differences in ex-ante versus ex-post WTP were observed. We also discussed the policy implications of these results for sustainable management of the wood-based cellulosic biofuels industry.","[Baral, Nabin; Rabotyagov, Sergey] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Box 352100, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Baral, N (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Box 352100, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",nbaral@gmail.com; rabotyag@uw.edu,,"Baral, Nabin/0000-0001-6947-0412",Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive from USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2011-68005-30407],Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive from USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture,"This work was supported by Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grant # 2011-68005-30407 from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture.

Based on the RIU model, 'scientist', 'integrator', and `policy entrepreneur' were defined as three hypothesised roles of researchers, discussed in conjunction with Pielke's 'honest broker' model. It was found that researchers played important roles, both as scientists and integrators in Japan. In Sweden, researchers played only the role of scientist. However, no researchers working as policy entrepreneurs were found in either country. These results indicate that the RIU model could work as a basis for the comparison between countries and the clarification of the roles of researchers in forest policy processes.

However, its benefit with regard to clinical and economic outcomes remains to be clearly demonstrated. To analyse the effect of Europe's largest COPD telemonitoring pilot project on direct medical costs, health resource utilisation and mortality at 12 months. We evaluated a population-based cohort using administrative data. Difference-in-difference estimators were calculated to account for time-invariant unobservable heterogeneity after removing dissimilarities in observable characteristics between the telemonitoring and control group with a reweighting algorithm. The analysis comprised 651 telemonitoring participants and 7047 individuals in the standard care group. The mortality hazards ratio was lower in the intervention arm (HR 0.51, 95 % CI 0.30-0.86). Telemonitoring cut total costs by 895 a,notsign (p < 0.05) compared to COPD standard care, mainly driven by savings in COPD-related hospitalisations in (very) severe COPD patients (-1056 a,notsign, p < 0.0001). Telemonitoring enrolees used healthcare (all-cause and COPD-related) less intensely with shorter hospital stays, fewer inpatient stays and smaller proportions of people with emergency department visits and hospitalisations (all p < 0.0001). Reductions in mortality, costs and healthcare utilisation were greater for (very) severe COPD cases. This is the first German study to demonstrate that telemonitoring for COPD is a viable strategy to reduce mortality, healthcare costs and utilisation at 12 months. Contrary to widespread fear, reducing the intensity of care does not seem to impact unfavourably on health outcomes. The evidence offers strong support for introducing telemonitoring as a component of case management.","[Achelrod, Dmitrij; Schreyoegg, Jonas; Stargardt, Tom] Univ Hamburg, HCHE, Esplanade 36, D-20354 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Achelrod, D (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, HCHE, Esplanade 36, D-20354 Hamburg, Germany.",dmitrij.achelrod@uni-hamburg.de; jonas.schreyoegg@uni-hamburg.de; tom.stargardt@uni-hamburg.de,"Schreyögg, Jonas/AAY-6182-2021","Schreyögg, Jonas/0000-0001-8030-2161","AOK Bayern, a sickness fund; SHL Telemedizin","AOK Bayern, a sickness fund; SHL Telemedizin","TS and JS have received funding from AOK Bayern, a sickness fund, and SHL Telemedizin, a provider of telemonitoring services.

Our study shows that those (a) in economic positions that are more likely to be negatively affected by robotics are more likely to be fearful of robots at work, along with, to some extent, those living in countries (b) with adverse economic conditions and (c) where employees are less protected from market forces.

In modern microeconomics, behavioural economic analysis has flourished, focusing on individual responses and interactions. By contrast, in macroeconomics, humans are assumed to behave as if they are mathematical machines, making decisions in a mechanical, objective way. From this perspective, it is difficult to properly capture the instabilities that characterise modern macroeconomies and financial systems. While some progress has been made in recognising the bounds to rationality, the complexity of the macroeconomy can be captured fully only by embedding psychological and sociological forces more fully into macroeconomic models. Keynes was a pioneer in analysing the impacts of socio-psychological influences on macroeconomic phenomena. This article explores some of Keynes' fundamental ideas about socio-psychological macroeconomic influences, including insights from A Treatise on Probability (1921) onwards, and links these insights both with modern behavioural economic theory and current macroeconomic policy debates.","[Baddeley, Michelle] Univ South Australia, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of South Australia,"Baddeley, M (通讯作者)，Univ South Australia, Inst Choice, 140 Arthur St, Sydney, NSW 2060, Australia.",michelle.baddeley@unisa.edu.au,"Baddeley, Michelle/N-5821-2019","Baddeley, Michelle/0000-0001-7884-0374",,,,,87,3,4,1,30,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Students with weaker middle school grades and whose commutes are lengthened by elite admission experience a larger rise in dropout probability. On the other hand, elite admission raises end-of-high-school math test scores for the marginal admittee, even when accounting for potential bias due to admission-induced dropout.","[Dustan, Andrew] Vanderbilt Univ, Econ, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [de Janvry, Alain; Sadoulet, Elisabeth] Univ Calif Berkeley, Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Vanderbilt University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Dustan, A (通讯作者)，Vanderbilt Univ, Econ, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.",dgep@sep.gob.mx,,"Dustan, Andrew/0000-0002-1357-1406",,,,,35,15,18,3,10,UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS,MADISON,"JOURNAL DIVISION, 1930 MONROE ST, 3RD FL, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0022-166X,1548-8004,,J HUM RESOUR,J.

Prevalence-based cost-of-illness analysis of FAS in Sweden for 2014. Direct costs (societal support, special education, psychiatric disorders and alcohol/drug abuse) and indirect costs (reduced working capacity and informal caring), were included. The calculations were based on published Swedish studies, including a register-based follow-up study of adults with FAS, reports and databases, and experts. The annual total societal cost of FAS was estimated at a,notsign76,000 per child (0-17 years) and a,notsign110,000 per adult (18-74 years), corresponding to a,notsign1.6 billion per year in the Swedish population using a prevalence of FAS of 0.2 %. The annual additional cost of FAS (difference between the FAS group and a comparison group) was estimated at a,notsign1.4 billion using a prevalence of 0.2 %. The major cost driver was the cost of societal support. The cost burden of FAS on the society is extensive, but likely to be underestimated. A reduction in the societal costs of FAS, both preventive and targeted interventions to children with FAS, should be prioritized. That is, the cost of early interventions such as placement in family homes or other forms of housing, and special education, represent unavoidable costs. However, these types of interventions are highly relevant to improve the individual's quality of life and future prospects, and also, within a long-term perspective, to limit the societal costs and personal suffering.","[Ericson, Lisa; Hovstadius, Bo] Linnaeus Univ, eHlth Inst, Dept Med & Optometry, S-39182 Kalmar, Sweden; [Magnusson, Lennart] Linnaeus Univ, Swedish Family Care Competence Ctr, Dept Hlth & Caring Sci, Kalmar, Sweden",Linnaeus University; Linnaeus University,"Ericson, L (通讯作者)，Linnaeus Univ, eHlth Inst, Dept Med & Optometry, S-39182 Kalmar, Sweden.",lisa.ericson@lnu.se,"Ericson, Lisa/H-8681-2016",,Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare,Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare,"The study was initiated and financed by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare.

Distinguishing Hispanic students by immigrant generation, I find that the children of immigrants (first-and second-generation Hispanics) drive the improvement in Hispanic test scores. Later-generation Hispanics consistently perform slightly below whites, perhaps due to negative selection into ethnic identification. Thus, previous estimates vastly understate the progress of first-and second-generation Hispanic immigrants. From a negative gap in 3rd grade, these students surpass socioeconomically similar whites in math and reading by middle school and end 8th grade as much as a quarter of a standard deviation ahead. Assimilation alone cannot explain this progress; a potential explanation is that immigrant parents create a home environment that fosters achievement. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We argue that a more differentiated analysis is in order, as empirical developments point to distinct reform trajectories. We analyse in detail the two Southern European cases where pressure for austerity was intense, but governments maintained a degree of discretion as they were not subjected to direct bailout conditions: Italy and Spain. We examine the period since 2010, which includes a major labour market reform in each of the two states in 2012. Using a theoretical framework that allows distinguishing forms of liberalization, we find that reforms in the two states indeed differed markedly. In Spain, flexibilization and declining coverage of protection prevailed, whereas in Italy flexibilization was combined with improved protection of workers at the margin of the labour market. The differing influence of the centre-left helps to explain this divergence.","[Picot, Georg] Univ Bergen, Dept Comparat Polit, Bergen, Norway; [Tassinari, Arianna] Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Coventry, W Midlands, England",University of Bergen; University of Warwick,"Tassinari, A (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Coventry, W Midlands, England.",a.tassinari@warwick.ac.uk,"Tassinari, Arianna/ABA-9920-2020","Tassinari, Arianna/0000-0001-5437-935X; Picot, Georg/0000-0003-3369-8727",Economic and Social Research Council [1645392] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,69,70,72,1,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Both sectors have become notorious for depleting the stocks on which they depend, eroding the value of harvested natural resources over time and having significant negative by-catch' impacts on non-target natural resources. Problems of resource overuse and potential ecosystem collapse inherently derive from poor decisions influenced by those with undue or excessive economic, political and labour market power. Solutions to problems of unsustainability of resource management will need to engage with these economic drivers and beneficiaries, and require strategies including better and more independent assessments of the status and condition of resources. Deep-seated problems caused by resource over-commitment need more robust approaches to resource assessment that (1) better account for uncertainty (including uncertainty resulting from stock losses due to disturbance), (2) avoid ratchet effects and (3) provide appropriate ecological parameters for resource harvest. The United Nations framework for environmental and economic accounting methods can help assess the economic and other contributions of different resource-based industries and inform decisions about trade-offs between competing interests. Finally, there is value in examining successful and unsuccessful industry restructuring, in which decisions to transition away from demonstrably unsustainable resource industries have been made.

Previous studies examining the cost of treating DLBCL have generally focused on a specific first-line therapy alone; meaning that their findings can neither be extrapolated to the general patient population nor to other points along the treatment pathway. Based on empirical data from a representative population-based patient cohort, the objective of this study was to develop a simulation model that could predict costs and life expectancy of treating DLBCL. All patients newly diagnosed with DLBCL in the UK's population-based Haematological Malignancy Research Networkin 2007 were followed until 2013 (n = 271). Mapped treatment pathways, alongside cost information derived from the National Tariff 2013/14, were incorporated into a patient-level simulation model in order to reflect the heterogeneities of patient characteristics and treatment options. The NHS and social services perspective was adopted, and all outcomes were discounted at 3.5 % per annum. Overall, the expected total medical costs were A 22,122 pound for those treated with curative intent, and A 2930 pound for those managed palliatively. For curative chemotherapy, the predicted medical costs were A 14,966 pound, A 23,449 pound and A 7376 pound for first-, second- and third-line treatments, respectively. The estimated annual cost for treating DLBCL across the UK was around A 88-92 pound million. This is the first cost modelling study using empirical data to provide 'real world' evidence throughout the DLBCL treatment pathway. Future application of the model could include evaluation of new technologies/treatments to support healthcare decision makers, especially in the era of personalised medicine.","[Wang, Han-I.; Smith, Alexandra; Roman, Eve; Crouch, Simon] Univ York, Dept Hlth Sci, ECSG, Seebohm Rowntree Bldg, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Aas, Eline] Univ Oslo, Dept Hlth Management & Hlth Econ, Oslo, Norway; [Burton, Cathy] St James Univ Hosp, Haematol Malignancy Diagnost Serv, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Patmore, Russell] Castle Hill Hosp, Queens Ctr Oncol & Haematol, Kingston Upon Hull, N Humberside, England",University of York - UK; University of Oslo; Saint James's University Hospital; University of Hull,"Wang, HI (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Hlth Sci, ECSG, Seebohm Rowntree Bldg, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",han-i.wang@york.ac.uk,,"Roman, Eve/0000-0001-7603-3704",Bloodwise,Bloodwise,The Haematological Malignancy Research Network is funded by Bloodwise.

However, as of yet, there are few developed and tested mechanisms to help authorities and stakeholders with diverse interests to effectively work together to reach a common goal. Integrated Forest Land-Use Planning (IFLUP) is an approach that has the potential to accommodate multi-stakeholders' demands in the field of SFM planning. In this paper an IFLUP framework process that facilitates stakeholder participation in future oriented SFM planning is explored. This framework combines scenario, analysis and stakeholder collaborative learning. Its application in a case study area in the West of Ireland is outlined and its effectiveness in accommodating conflicting stakeholder demands on forest ecosystem services as well as its potential opportunities and challenges are evaluated. Based on the results and participants evaluation feedback of the IFLUP workshop outcomes, there was a shared view that the IFLUP approach has potential to address conflicting societal demands on forest ecosystem services within local forest landscapes. Likewise, collaborative learning process helps build trust and respect among stakeholder groups as well as improving the legitimacy and acceptance of SFM planning outcomes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Our empirical results for the period 2010-2014 show that US bond prices had a negative impact and causality effects on sukuk prices, whereas European Monetary Union bond prices only co-moved with sukuk prices. We also show that financial uncertainty had a negative effect that was limited to intermediate sukuk quantiles; moreover, sukuk prices were not affected by economic policy uncertainty or stock market returns. Therefore, although Islamic bonds are distinctive assets, their price dynamics are dependent on other bond-related asset prices and so incorporate financial market uncertainty.","[Carlos Reboredo, Juan] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ, Avda Xoan 23 S-N, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain; [Naifar, Nader] Al Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic Univ IMSIU, Dept Finance & Investment, Coll Econ & Adm Sci, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Naifar, Nader] Univ Sfax, Higher Inst Business Adm Sfax ISAAS, Sfax, Tunisia",Universidade de Santiago de Compostela; Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University (IMSIU); Universite de Sfax,"Reboredo, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ, Avda Xoan 23 S-N, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain.",juancarlos.reboredo@usc.es,"Naifar, Nader/AAJ-2859-2020; Reboredo, Juan Carlos/I-3224-2015","Naifar, Nader/0000-0001-9554-8236; Reboredo, Juan Carlos/0000-0003-3912-9410",,,,,29,24,25,2,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

While data on migration for Romania are limited, the media channels have given more visibility to a certain typology of the Romanian migrant: with low level of formal education and lack of qualifications, accepting low skilled jobs, often working without legal forms in domains such as agriculture, constructions or care, leaving the native country to escape poverty. Yet, very recent survey data on recipients of guaranteed minimum income (the poorest of the poor) show that, while they perceive migration as the only functional individual strategy for escaping poverty, they do not, in fact, engage in migration. There are a multitude of theories explaining this apparent contradiction between perception and action and we explore here both the neoclassical approach that refers to the migration decision in terms of costs and benefits analysis, but also the behavioural economics approach that provides insights on decision making under scarcity conditions, adding comprehensive information on exercising migratory agency under poverty imposed limitations.","[Cojanu, Silvia-Florina; Stroe, Cristina] Natl Sci Res Inst Labour & Social Protect, Bucharest, Romania",,"Cojanu, SF (通讯作者)，Natl Sci Res Inst Labour & Social Protect, Bucharest, Romania.",silvia.cojanu@yahoo.com; cristinaradu@incsmps.ro,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,139,148,,,,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6MR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426857700014,0

This paper examines the effectiveness of policy incentives to increase residential solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity. We use county-level panel data and control for demographic characteristics, solar resources, and pro-environmental preferences. Results show that among financial incentives, rebates have the most impact with an additional $1 per watt rebate increasing annual PV capacity additions by close to 50%. Factors that affect financial returns to solar PV such as electricity price and solar insolation are also found to be significant. Results also point to a significant positive relationship between hybrid vehicle sales and residential PV capacity growth, indicating the importance of pro-environmental preferences as a predictor of solar PV demand. Back of the envelope calculations suggest that the cost of carbon mitigation through rebates is around $184 per ton of CO2. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

These include smart-phone apps which allow users to track their mood in 'real-time', plus touchpads in organisations and public spaces which seek rapid feedback on whether an experience is positive or negative. In contrast to the use of surveys as tools of valuation, these technologies seek to capture experience in 'real-time', which can then be viewed and evaluated critically at a later time. Based on study of a number of mood-monitoring technologies, this paper highlights some of the ways in which they challenge conventional accounts of (e) valuation. In particular, rather than inviting individuals to represent their feelings towards the past numerically, they invite them to make uncritical expressions of positive or negative mood in the present. The central question of value is no longer how much is something valued, but whether or not it is valued. Quantitative and calculated analysis of positive and negative emotions occurs subsequently.","[Davies, William] Goldsmiths Univ London, Polit Econ, London, England",University of London; Goldsmiths University London,"Davies, W (通讯作者)，Goldsmiths Univ London, Polit Econ, London, England.",w.davies@gold.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council; ESRC [ES/M00077X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M00077X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work was supported by Economic and Social Research Council.,,73,24,26,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

Here comes the fourth revolution which equals to digitization. The digitization of customer service means for many companies the necessity of integration with the current exponential changes. Digitization impose changes in business models. Contemporary technologies like Internet of things, artificial intelligence, cloud computing and big data open new opportunities for enterprises but are very challenging at the same time. But especially for companies operating in a virtual environment customer service based on modern technologies became obligatory. These new technologies allowing full customization of the offer and highest level of customer service with acceptable costs and inputs. Using of these new technologies determine the position of the companies in the market. Instant share of knowledge, files, and customer related data across enterprise become crucial for gaining competitive advantage these days in turbulent and unpredictable business environment. Connect all employees with experts from whole organization regardless of their role or location is the best and most effective way to react quickly and proactively for customer's needs and expectations. Collaborate on sales opportunities, customer service cases and requests, marketing campaigns and innovative projects with embedded applications and custom workflows within one common integrated system open new markets. Agile (agility) become very popular term worldwide as proper usage of agile methodologies in business (especially in customer service) may lead to market success. This paper is devoted to the role of new technologies in the processes of customer service and enterprise social networks and collaboration. But also key issues in the introduction and use of these technologies are described. Authors presents how properly implemented instant communication tools can accelerate productivity and overall performance of the business including but not limited to sales and customer service processes.

The evidence presented in this article, however, does not support this widely held view. Using direct measures for computers and pay-setting institutions at the industry level, this article provides the first rigorous analysis of the independent effect of technological and institutional factors on rising wage inequality. Analysing data on 43 US industries between 1968 and 2012, we find that declining unions and the fall in the real value of the minimum wage explain about half of rising inequality, while computerization explains about one-quarter. This suggests that much of rising inequality in the USA is driven by worker disempowerment rather than by market forces-a finding that can resolve the puzzle on the diverging inequality trends in USA and Europe.","[Kristal, Tali] Univ Haifa, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Haifa, Israel; [Cohen, Yinon] Columbia Univ, Dept Sociol, New York, NY 10027 USA",University of Haifa; Columbia University,"Kristal, T (通讯作者)，Univ Haifa, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Haifa, Israel.",kristal@soc.haifa.ac.il,,,Israel Science Foundation (ISF) [1175/11],Israel Science Foundation (ISF)(Israel Science Foundation),This research was supported by The Israel Science Foundation (ISF) grant number 1175/11.,,86,70,73,1,67,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Hence International Relations theory always represented the interest of powerful states that translate all the problems by only one mean and one end, i. e. Power. Power politics remained a prerogative of state and all the more, the powerful states. The prime argument of this study is that mainstream state-centric approach to International Relations is biased and reflects only on one facet of reality. The hegemonic International relations discourses with the Eurocentric biases have marginalized the voices emerging from subalterns of the system living in peripheral states comprising World-System. It is the reason that despite claims of problem solving, the state centric paradigm has left many issues and concerns of peripheral states and subaltern subjects living in these states un-heard. The non-responsive behavior of mainstream International Relations towards problems of South is contested by two powerful voices in IR theory. Taking inspiration from ECLA-Prebisch School (Dependcia) of Latin America and Subaltern History paradigm of South Asia, Carlos Escude and Mohammed Ayoob has casted reflection on poverty of Realism (State Centrism) as explanatory problem solving theory. Peripheral Realism by Carlos Escude and Subaltern Realism by Mohammed Ayoob are two critical perspectives rooted in realities of global South. Whereas the Ayoob emphasizes the internal dynamics of state, Escude focusing on global hierarchy of states discuss the issues of Rouge/ Pariah states, who refuse to accept hierarchy and compromise the living standards of their population for prestige and glory.","[Kumar, Ravi] Mahatma Gandhi Int Hindi Univ, Wardha, Maharashtra, India; [Nawaz, Rafida] Bahauddin Zakariya Univ Multan, Multan, Pakistan",Bahauddin Zakariya University,"Kumar, R (通讯作者)，Mahatma Gandhi Int Hindi Univ, Wardha, Maharashtra, India.",,"Nawaz, Rafida/ABB-5771-2020","Nawaz, Rafida/0000-0002-6715-5440",,,,,16,0,0,0,4,"MASTERS INT CONSULTANCY RES PUBL, MIRDEC",KUCUKCEKMECE,"CINARLICESME SK, NO 21-13, KUCUKCEKMECE, ISTANBUL PK-34303, TURKEY",,,978-605-82290-3-7,,,,2017,,,,,,,141,145,,,,,,5,Area Studies; Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BJ5TI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426276100012,0

For this purpose, we investigate the long-term equilibrating relationships and short-term deviations from the equilibrium, and explore the determinants, directions, and strengths of causality relationships between CLCC and the selected macroeconomic variables, and analyze the dynamic interactions among the variables in the post-sample period by analyzing how CLCC responds to the shocks given to other macroeconomic variables and the contribution of each variable on the forecast variability of CLCC. We use monthly data for the period of January 2004-December 2013 of seven macroeconomic variables of money supply, interest rate, income, consumer confidence, inflation, stock market, and consumer goods imports.

Furthermore, using a discrete mixtures modelling approach we explain the heterogeneous nature of preferences for the module attributes and the students' lexicographic preference orderings. We show how failing to address this leads to erroneous results and limits the ability to derive reliable prediction.

This is anticipated to have a multitude of immediate and long-term impacts on sub-Saharan Africa's natural resources of the present study attempts to establish the potential benefit of integrating local stakeholders' knowledge into climate scenarios. Specifically, the study sought to tap into the expertise and perspectives of locally important stakeholders in the potentially sensitive Wami/Ruvu River catchment of Tanzania. Participatory scenario planning was used to explore sectors sensitive to climate variability and change. This included 84 selected smallholder farmers and their leaders spread across six villages within the catchment. Quantitative household surveys were conducted across 199 households and Supplementary information sourced from regional statistics. The survey indicates that farmers project that land and agricultural productivity and water resources will be affected by climate change. From the participatory approach adopted for the study, thematic scenario categories featuring land and water resource-use and management and farm productivity were developed. The research found scenario analysis as a useful tool in development planning, as it incorporates interacting risks and uncertainties. If adopted by local farmers, leaders, regional institutional frameworks and policy makers, the tool has the potential to improve responsiveness to changes and risks through its collaborative management approach. This study demonstrates the need for sustainable water use and management systems and land use and farming practices that will increase crop productivity and resilience to climate variability and change.

Indeed, Callon's performativity has been criticized for 'presuming efficacity' and overemphasizing 'stabilizing processes'. In this paper, I propose a distinction between 'science studies' performativity (which privileges economic theory) and 'performative agency' (which attends to the constitution of economic agency). Previous attempts to discuss Callon and Butler together have tended to oppose her performativity to the former approach, but I suggest that the latter allows for a more productive engagement. I illustrate how this alternative offers a way to address persistent critiques of market performativity by incorporating Butler's understanding of performative failure. The usefulness of this argument is demonstrated through a case study of the recent transformation of the street food market in San Francisco. The details of the case are drawn from ethnographic study conducted in 2009, and describe how a market that had been 'known' to lack dynamism became remade almost overnight.","[Pahk, Sang-hyoun] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Sociol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Pahk, SH (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Sociol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",pahks@hawaii.edu,,,,,,,34,3,4,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

At the same time, the Northern indigenous minorities establish and secure legislatively the territories of traditional land use with limited economic activity to protect their interests and rights, as well as to preserve their indigenous environment. In view of the fact that many mineral deposits and energy resource fields to some extent affect such territories, it is necessary to develop a mechanism to coordinate the interests of all stakeholders, including investors, producer companies, municipalities, the Northern indigenous minorities and their communities. The aim of the paper is to analyse an application of ethnological expertise in assessment of positive and negative impacts of capital projects and to find out possible forms of compensation, which may offset these potential negative impacts on the indigenous environments and indigenous peoples. Sociological research approaches were used as one of the tools to identify the interests and needs of indigenous inhabitants at the zero-stage of the project. The paper presents the results of sociological research as the means for development of an interaction model among the stakeholders in commercial exploitation of the territories of traditional land use. The presented scientific methodology for ethnological expertise of capital projects in the Russian Arctic can be also used in other Arctic regions and countries, which might face conflict situations during development of natural resources in native habitats of the Northern indigenous minorities.","[Potravnyy, Ivan] Plekhanov Russian Univ Econ, Moscow, Russia; [Tambovceva, Tatjana] Riga Tech Univ, Riga, Latvia; [Gassiy, Violetta] Kuban State Univ, Krasnodar, Russia",Plekhanov Russian University of Economics; Riga Technical University; Kuban State University,"Tambovceva, T (通讯作者)，Riga Tech Univ, Riga, Latvia.",Tatjana.Tambovceva@rtu.lv,"Gassiy, Violetta/N-4182-2019; Tambovceva, Tatjana/G-2828-2010; Gassiy, Violetta/R-2822-2016","Gassiy, Violetta/0000-0002-9453-5692; Tambovceva, Tatjana/0000-0002-9516-1530;",Russian Humanitarian Foundation [17-02-00214],Russian Humanitarian Foundation,"The present research has been supported by the Russian Humanitarian Foundation, project No. 17-02-00214.",,15,1,1,0,5,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-261-3,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2017,,45,,,,,196,203,,,,,,8,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BI1NY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406530100023,0

This article explores the implications of the creation of the Latin American Integrated Market (MILA)(1) over the dependence structure of its members using correlation and cointegration analysis as well as linear and nonlinear Granger causality tests. The creation of MILA aimed to enhance the integration process that Latin American financial markets naturally present while still providing diversification opportunities to investors. The results of our empirical analysis suggest that such objective is being achieved. Evidence of a rise in cross-country linear correlations and their linear causal relationship supports the idea of an increasing financial integration process in the region, while the absence of cointegration and the weakening of the nonlinear causal relationship favors the creation of diversified regional portfolios. These findings provide valuable insights for investment portfolio designers, regulators, and supervisors.","[Santillan-Salgado, Roberto J.] EGADE Business Sch, Monterrey Campus, Monterrey, Mexico; [Massa Roldan, Ricardo] CIDE, CONACYT, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Massa Roldan, Ricardo] EGADE Business Sch, Guadalajara Campus, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico; [Reyna Miranda, Montserrat] EGADE Business Sch, Mexico City Santa Fe Campus,Av Carlos Lazo 100, Mexico City 01389, DF, Mexico; [Reyna Miranda, Montserrat] Fudan Dev Inst FDDI, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Tecnologico de Monterrey; Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C.

It explores the ways in which private equity people make arguments persuading one another and the larger public that an investment is worth making. Important to these arguments are not only substantive content, the evidence that investors marshal to support a thesis, but also reflective evaluation of what counts as good evidence, meta-commentary. It is in these split levels of analysis that we can appreciate the cultural diversity within finance, Wall Street, and investment banking.

The paper analyses the RDP project measures that are targeted at the development of rural farms, and the author uses the available statistical data. The research indicates that the small farms in Latvia are supported disproportionally little, and as a result, they do not utilize their development potential. There are few support measures suiTable for the small farms. In addition, the public funding in them is very limited. In Lithuania the funding for different groups of farms is spread more proportionally, which is reflected in the contribution of these farms to the country's economy.

Recently there is a growing literature that studies the microeconomic foundations or mechanisms for incomplete exchange rate pass-through. However, the estimations of the exchange rate pass-through vary widely in the existing literature. Our article proposes the use of a policy-based instrumental variable for exchange rate, exploiting the exchange rate reform in China, and finds that 67% of the exchange rate pass-through into the f.o.b. export price of Chinese exports. This is in contrast with the almost full exchange rate pass-through using ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation. We further find that the export price of homogeneous goods, low-technology goods and goods supplied by domestic non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs) is more sensitive to exchange rate changes.","[Zhang, Teng] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Econ & Management, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Li, Yunong] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Int Business, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Li, YN (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Chengdu 610074, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",myunongli@gmail.com,,"LI, YUNONG/0000-0001-8225-7018",,,,,31,2,2,0,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Based on an exploratory case study design, the forest enterprises, contractors, and heating plans from each country were purposively selected. Using qualitative content analysis and MAXQDA software, the study analyzes nine in-person interviews with actors representing the chosen companies. The results reveal that national and EU policies, logistic, or technical factors, primarily determine the marketing decisions of the actors. Although there are differences in marketing decision making framework among all companies, they are significant for forest chips producers. Their decisions varied mainly in the choice and implementation phase of the framework, associated with promotion, people, process, and physical evidence. In contrast, heating plants' decisions differ only slightly within the marketing decision making framework. Some variances in characteristics of forest chips, price range, and contract length exist in the implementation phase. Consequently, the marketing decisions of heating plants significantly influence the marketing decision making framework of forest enterprises and contractors, confirming the interaction between the 7C and 7P concepts, and derived demand of forest chips.","[Halaj, Daniel; Brodrechtova, Yvonne] Tech Univ Zvolen, Fac Forestry, Dept Econ & Management Forestry, TG Masaryka 24, Zvolen 96053, Slovakia",Technical University Zvolen,"Brodrechtova, Y (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Zvolen, Fac Forestry, Dept Econ & Management Forestry, TG Masaryka 24, Zvolen 96053, Slovakia.",daniel.halaj@tuzvo.sk; yvonne.brodrechtova@tuzvo.sk,"Halaj, Daniel/ABD-5281-2020","Halaj, Daniel/0000-0002-6264-7745","Slovak Research and Development Agency [APVV-0057-11, 1/0010/17]",Slovak Research and Development Agency(Slovak Research and Development Agency),"This research was financially supported by the two projects of the Slovak Research and Development Agency (APVV-0057-11) and (1/0010/17).

A priori, this finding is not straightforward: an increase in the coefficient of cooperation causes industry output to first decrease and then increase over time, thus making consumers worse off in the short run and better off in the long run. This study establishes the conditions under which the long-run effects outweigh the short-run effects of cooperation, leading to an increase in the discounted sum of consumer surplus.

Eight studies met the inclusion criteria, and six of these gave sufficient data for inclusion in a meta-analysis.

The experiments were conducted both in the field with TURF users and in the lab with university students. Our study has two objectives. First, we designed our experiments to study the effects of poaching on the ability of common pool resource users to coordinate their harvests when encroachment by outsiders is unrestricted and when the government provides weak enforcement. Second, we examine the ability of common pool resource users to simultaneously coordinate their harvests and investments in monitoring to deter poaching with and without government assistance in monitoring. Weak external monitoring that was predicted to have no effect actually led to significantly lower poaching relative to unrestricted poaching. However, neither giving sole responsibility for monitoring to resource users nor combining user and government monitoring affected poaching levels much. Our results suggest that users of a common pool resource may have difficulties coordinating their efforts to deter poachers, even with help from government authorities. We find no important qualitative differences in the behavior of TURF users and university students. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Students perceived a higher degree of achievement of the learning goals in both flipped courses compared to the non-flipped active learning course. Moreover, participating in the partial or full flipped classroom decreased the odds of a D or F grade or of withdraw. However, only the partial flip was associated with overall better learning outcomes in the final exam, while there was no statistically significant difference between the non-flipped active learning course and the full flip. Age was negatively associated with learning outcomes and increased the odds of a D or F grade or of withdraw. Gender had no statistically significant impact on learning outcomes. Students were least satisfied with the full flip and equally satisfied with the non-flipped active learning course and the partial flip. Lower satisfaction appears to be due to increased workload, which students evaluated to be highest in the full flip, aswell as to elements of groupwork design. In the flipped classroom design, the pre-class multiple choice tests on Moodle emerged as a clear favorite in students' teaching evaluations.","[Lombardini, Chiara] Univ Helsinki, Dept Econ & Management, Fac Agr & Forestry, POB 27 Latokartanonkaari 5, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Lakkala, Minna] Univ Helsinki, Fac Educ Sci, POB 9 Siltavuorenpenger 1A, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Muukkonen, Hanni] Univ Oulu, Fac Educ, POB 2000, Oulu 90014, Finland",University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki; University of Oulu,"Lombardini, C (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Dept Econ & Management, Fac Agr & Forestry, POB 27 Latokartanonkaari 5, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",chiara.lombardini@helsinki.fi; minna.lakkala@helsinki.fi; hanni.muukkonen@oulu.fi,"Muukkonen, Hanni/L-1453-2014; Lakkala, Minna/B-6758-2014","Muukkonen, Hanni/0000-0002-1086-1352; Lombardini, Chiara/0000-0002-6283-2158; Lakkala, Minna/0000-0002-8289-4292",Teachers' Academy at the University of Helsinki; European Commission [KNORK 402765 543154-LLP-1-2013-1-FI-KA3-KA],Teachers' Academy at the University of Helsinki; European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),This work was partially supported by the Teachers' Academy at the University of Helsinki and by the European Commission (KNORK 402765 543154-LLP-1-2013-1-FI-KA3-KA).,,29,25,26,2,65,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1477-3880,2352-4421,,INT REV ECON EDUC,Int.

This study generalizes the threshold approach using regret theory. Regret theory is one of the established alternatives to expected utility theory (EUT), and partly overcomes the descriptive limitations of EUT. Under regret theory, agents suffer disutility from regret or enjoy utility from rejoicing by comparing the chosen alternative with the forgone one. We examine the effect of regret and rejoicing on the threshold approach by setting the EU case as a benchmark, and show conditions under which regret and rejoicing monotonically change the threshold probability. The threshold probability is lowered by regret and rejoicing under the reasonable condition in the sense that the condition can explain observed choices that EU fails to describe. This suggests that agents opt to undergo medical treatment by the feeling of regret and rejoicing. This result might explain the social problems that occur in relation to the public provision of medical services in many OECD countries such as medical expenditure rising faster than government forecasts. The results also imply that regret sensitivity might cause inequality of benefits from public medical services. Finally, we offer a solution to this problem.","[Fujii, Yoichiro] Osaka Sangyo Univ, Fac Econ, Nakagaito 3-1-1, Daito, Osaka 5748530, Japan; [Osaki, Yusuke] Waseda Univ, Fac Commerce, Shinjuku Ku, Nishi Waseda 1-6-1, Tokyo 1698050, Japan",Waseda University,"Fujii, Y (通讯作者)，Osaka Sangyo Univ, Fac Econ, Nakagaito 3-1-1, Daito, Osaka 5748530, Japan.",fujii@eco.osaka-sandai.ac.jp,,,"JSPS Kakenhi [17KO3637, 26705004]; Focused Research of Osaka Sangyo University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26705004] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS Kakenhi(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Focused Research of Osaka Sangyo University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This work was partly supported by JSPS Kakenhi Grant Number 17KO3637 (Fujii) 26705004 (Osaki) and The Focused Research of Osaka Sangyo University (Fujii and Osaki).,,15,2,2,0,7,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

Drawing on a REDD+ pilot undertaken in Nepal, this paper seeks to investigate how REDD + has been downscaled into the community forestry context and with what implications for CF governance. The analysis is guided by three research questions: how are the objectives and discourses underpinning REDD + translated into actions at the local level; how do the proponents of REDD + make the problems and solutions technical in order to design the interventions; and what are the implications of REDD + design for CF governance and what changes in rules and practices on forest management might result from these? The study comprised a review of the pilot project documentation and field study. In-depth interviews, focused group discussions and observations were conducted with forest user groups both within and outside the REDD + pilot area. Findings indicate that the pilot design and implementation was essentially to show that REDD + could be implemented in CF and focused on developing a carbon monitoring mechanism which local people could be engaged in. The community forest user groups (CFUG) in the pilot sites have increased forest surveillance and tightened the rules regarding certain uses of forests. We argue that the technical and financial logic of REDD + have had implications for CF governance, risks of co-opting local voices and has contributed to an ongoing commercialisation of community forests, at the cost of the livelihoods of the poorest people.","[Khatri, Dil B.; Marquardt, Kristina; Pain, Adam] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Urban & Rural Dev, Ulls Vag 27,Box 7012, Uppsala, Sweden; [Khatri, Dil B.] ForestAct Nepal, Patan, Nepal; [Ojha, Hemant] Studies & Dev Worldwide IFSD, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Khatri, DB (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Urban & Rural Dev, Ulls Vag 27,Box 7012, Uppsala, Sweden.",khatridb@gmail.com,"Khatri, Dil/AAM-8716-2020; Ojha, Hemant/C-7490-2011","Ojha, Hemant/0000-0003-2654-4092",Vetenskapsradet [421-2011-2114],Vetenskapsradet(Swedish Research Council),"We thank Andrea Nightingale, Dinesh Paudel and Hari Sharan Luintel for their valuable comments on the manuscript and to Bikash Adhikar and Sabina Lamichhane for their support on data collection.

I highlight four factors that were crucial to the ITA expansion's successful completion: a narrower scope without a single undertaking approach, a negotiating group that contained many but not all WTO members, a focus on tariffs rather than non-tariff barriers, and avoiding a nationalistic opposition. I conclude by discussing what lessons these factors and the ITA expansion suggest for other ongoing trade negotiations such as the Environmental Goods Agreements (EGA).","[Winslett, Gary] European Univ Inst, Robert Schuman Ctr Adv Studies, Florence, Italy",European University Institute,"Winslett, G (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Robert Schuman Ctr Adv Studies, Florence, Italy.",Gary.Winslett@gmail.com,,,Robert Schuman Centre; European University Institute,Robert Schuman Centre; European University Institute,I would like to thank the Robert Schuman Centre and the European University Institute for their hospitality and support of my research.

As in other jurisdictions, early futures studies in New Zealand were predominantly problem-oriented using trend analysis and scenarios. More recently it is heading towards developing more long-term perspectives including crowd-sourcing possibilities through social media. This is supported by the strong sense of stewardship embedded in its indigenous culture and an increasing use of participatory processes in environmental decision-making around highly complex issues. The potential to address complexity through technologies for wicked problems and futures literacy is discussed in detail. While the potential for wider relevance appears to move in disconnected phases of activity, there is a movement towards forms of long-term stewardship, albeit tempered by presentism. One highlight is the 2017 Act providing the Whanganui River with legal status equal to that of a person. Another is the use of collaborative environmental governance such as the Land and Water Forum and the Canterbury Water Management Strategy. Observations are made on how futures studies might develop in New Zealand and may be of significance more broadly. In particular the most significant elements of change may well be inspired through indigenous Maori culture which links, to developments in philosophy such as Dark Ecology which propose a shift in the current anthropogenic perspective.","[Frame, Bob] Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, POB 69040, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand",Landcare Research - New Zealand,"Frame, B (通讯作者)，Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, POB 69040, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand.",research@frameworks.nz,"Frame, Bob I/A-2876-2008","Frame, Bob/0000-0003-2447-4174","Foundation for Research, Science and Technology [C09 x 0310]; Crown Research Institute's Capability Fund","Foundation for Research, Science and Technology(New Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and Technology); Crown Research Institute's Capability Fund","The research was supported by the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology Building capacity for sustainable development: The enabling research project (C09 x 0310); by the Crown Research Institute's Capability Fund administered by the Ministry of Science and Innovation; and by many agencies through short-term contracts.

In order for collaboration to be initiated, however, the majority of key stakeholders must be willing to participate. This paper investigates which factors at the local level are crucial for initiating collaboration over forest waters among individual private forest owners. For that purpose, a survey was sent out to all individual forest owners within a catchment area in northern Sweden. The survey was complemented by a qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews. The existence of several key preconditions for the initiation of collaboration was investigated, namely: low belief and cultural heterogeneity, information diffusion, perception of the problem, existing stores of social capital, interdependence, and leadership. The results show that although the context was one of low belief and cultural heterogeneity, individual private forest owners are not interested in collaborating for improved forest water unless they perceive the issue of water quality important enough to invest resources in collaboration. It also became clear that the diffusion of information about the problem is not reaching those stakeholders who are crucial for the commencement of collaboration. Moreover, those stakeholders do not recognise their interdependence on each other for resolving the issue and therefore the need for collaboration. Finally, initiating leadership was also found to be lacking, leading to the conclusion that to successfully implement policies requiring collaborative management of natural resources among highly empowered individual forest owners, those missing factors need to be addressed by the state.","[Mancheva, Irina] Umea Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Umea, Sweden",Umea University,"Mancheva, I (通讯作者)，Umea Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Umea, Sweden.",irina.mancheva@umu.se,,"Mancheva, Irina/0000-0001-5582-9877",Swedish Research Council Formas [2013-1650],Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas),"I would like to express my gratitude to Katarina Eckerberg and Anna Zachrisson for the many readings of the manuscript as well as for the invaluable comments and suggestions for improvement.

This is achieved by applying time series analysis, change point detection, and vector autoregression with exogenous variables. No previous research has quantitatively analyzed the long-term impact of VPAs on traded wood. Two major conclusions are drawn. First, the VPA, and accompanying improved forest governance, negatively impacted on the wood volume exported from Cameroon when it came into force (December 2011). However, wood extraction in Cameroon's neighboring countries increased as operators can still economically benefit from less stringent environmental standards in these countries. Second, this paper observes anticipative behavior before the VPA came into effect. During the negotiations, exports decreased due to redirection of the trade flows, and uncertainty concerning the outcome of the negotiations. However, during the months before the VPA came into force, wood exports sharply increased. This is explained by rent-seeking behavior by operators who wished to benefit from the less stringent trade conditions, whilst they lasted.","[Brusselaers, Jan] VITO, Unit Mat, Boeretang 200, B-2400 Mol, Belgium; [Brusselaers, Jan; Buysse, Jeroen] Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",VITO; Ghent University,"Brusselaers, J (通讯作者)，VITO, Unit Mat, Boeretang 200, B-2400 Mol, Belgium.;Brusselaers, J (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",jan.brusselaers@vito.be; J.Buysse@ugent.be,"Brusselaers, Jan/W-9091-2019","Brusselaers, Jan/0000-0003-2142-6695",,,,,46,7,8,0,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,MAY,2018,90.0,,,,,,167,179,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.02.008,0.0,,,13,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GD8MK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430766300019,0

Thus, health workforce planning is likely to benefit from improved problem identification, response formulation and data and methods that provide deeper understandings of socially influenced systems. Actor analysis is able to facilitate this through its examination of actor goals, interactions, and influences. We explore the use of this infrequently reported method in the context of health workforce planning. Through an embedded mixed methods design, we draw on data from inductive document analysis, deductively coded semi-structured interview responses from two separate but interconnected health sub sectors and numerically transform these to comply with the selected actor analysis software's input requirements. Our findings underline the importance of actor analysis as an investigative resource for delineating actor positions on a range of strategic issues pertinent to health workforce futures to reveal a different perspective of the system's evolution than that derived from conventional health workforce forecasting methods. A hierarchy of critical issues and the influential actors that hold sway over the workforce discourse are found, providing some insight into why conventional workforce plans can provide less than expected results.","[Rees, Gareth H.] Univ Otago, Dept Prevent & Social Med, POB 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand; [Crampton, Peter] Univ Otago, Otago Med Sch, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Gauld, Robin] Univ Otago, Otago Business Sch, Dunedin, New Zealand; [MacDonell, Stephen] Univ Otago, Otago Business Sch, Dept Informat Sci, Dunedin, New Zealand",University of Otago; University of Otago; University of Otago; University of Otago,"Rees, GH (通讯作者)，Univ ESAN, Lima, Peru.",grees@esan.edu.pe; peter.crampton@otago.ac.nz; robin.gauld@otago.ac.nz; stephen.macdonell@otago.ac.nz,"Rees, Gareth Huw/HOH-9809-2023; MacDonell, Stephen G./AAI-1579-2019; Gauld, Robin/JXW-8425-2024","Rees, Gareth Huw/0000-0002-8648-3626; MacDonell, Stephen G./0000-0002-2231-6941;",Health Workforce New Zealand's Advanced Trainee Fellowship scheme; University of Otago; Freemasons New Zealand,Health Workforce New Zealand's Advanced Trainee Fellowship scheme; University of Otago; Freemasons New Zealand,This work was enabled by a PhD Scholarship and research assistance jointly funded by Health Workforce New Zealand's Advanced Trainee Fellowship scheme and the University of Otago.

The dispute centers on the appropriate use of trade measures to target trade-related money laundering, the WTO consistency of such measures, and an ancillary question of appropriate time for remedies to be applied. The economics of the measures employed do not directly target the ostensible justification for the measures, while Colombia failed to convince the Panel and Appellate Body of key points related to the necessity of the measures taken. There has been success targeting trade-related money laundering following from cooperation of customs authorities and financial regulators to more directly target the agents involved. There may be a role for the WTO, in the form of steps taken to encourage such cooperation (as in Argentina - Measures Relating to Trade in Goods and Services). The basic lesson is that second best, blunt, and likely misdirected policies are not easily justified at the WTO, though more direct measures may be.","[Francois, Joseph] Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, Bern, Switzerland; [Whittaker, Janet] Clifford Chance US LLP, Washington, DC USA",University of Bern,"Francois, J (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, Bern, Switzerland.",joseph.francois@gmail.com; Janet.Whittaker@cliffordchance.com,"Francois, Joseph/B-6108-2017","Francois, Joseph/0000-0002-4686-7780",,,,,8,0,0,0,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,APR,2018,17.0,2,,,,,335,352,,10.1017/S1474745617000623,0.0,,,18,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,GD7PN,,"Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430704500008,0

Three interpretations of governance are distinguished to translate the idea of an orchestra to European (forest) policy making processes, referring to Frank Fischer's differentiation between a centralised state guided by administrative and policy experts on the one hand and deliberative governance driven by citizen participation on the other and a form of governance by participation professionals. The review included in total 81 research articles published between 1998 and 2015 addressing participation and expert involvement in forest policy. The results show that governance by participatory professionals is clearly visible in forest policy making processes in Europe mainly involving traditional groups as forest owners. Whether these participation professionals are engaged in a deliberative process with citizens remains unanswered. The results furthermore show a strong involvement of experts though the literature is rather silent as to how this steering of experts evolves in participatory forest processes. Finally the analysis shows that governance by citizen participation is rather neglected in forest policy processes in Europe. It is perceived as difficult to pursue, even at the local level. Therefore this article found nearly no empirical evidence for a so-called citizen's orchestra with the competence to self-align by deliberation. Instead citizens seem to be no part of the orchestra itself, but remain outside as part of the audience.","[Kleinschmit, Daniela] Univ Freiburg, Chair Forest & Environm Policy, Tennenbacherstr 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Puelzl, Helga] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Forest Environm & Nat Resource Policy, European Forest Inst, Cent Eastern European Reg Off EFICEEC EFISEE,Vien, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria; [Secco, Laura] Univ Padua, Dept Land Environm Agr & Forestry, Viale Univ 14, I-35020 Legnaro, PD, Italy; [Sergent, Arnaud] Natl Res Inst Sci & Technol Environm & Agr, UR ETBX 50, Ave Verdun, F-33612 Gazinet, Cestas, France; [Wallin, Ida] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Southern Swedish Forest Res Ctr, Sundsvagen 3,POB 49, S-23053 Alnarp, Sweden","University of Freiburg; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; University of Padua; INRAE; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences","Kleinschmit, D (通讯作者)，Univ Freiburg, Chair Forest & Environm Policy, Tennenbacherstr 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.",Daniela.kleinschmit@ifp.uni-freiburg.de,"Puelzl, Helga/AAH-3500-2019; Secco, Laura/B-6304-2012; Wallin, Ida/U-5745-2019","Puelzl, Helga/0000-0001-7920-5903; Wallin, Ida/0000-0003-2735-0409; Sergent, Arnaud/0000-0002-3671-0712",,,,,120,20,23,1,27,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,APR,2018,89.0,,,,SI,,4,15,,10.1016/j.forpol.2017.12.011,0.0,,,12,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GD8IN,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430756200002,0

After the general election in the UK on 8 June 2017, uncertainty regarding the direction, process and timing of the Brexit negotiations and the risk of a disorderly separation have risen further. The government position of a 'hard Brexit' seems no longer to be carved in stone. Yet, given the expected - total or partial - withdrawal of a major EU member state, like any area of EU politics, also European development policy faces a number of challenges: short-term problems regarding existing legal obligations, looming budget shortfalls and the securing of business continuity as well as the longer-term realignment of EU development policy following the departure of the United Kingdom. There is also the problem of the UK's succession in international treaties and mixed agreements in which both the EU and the member states are partners, such as trade agreements and memberships of international organisations, global development financing and representation in multilateral forums or negotiations. By qualitative interpretative analysis, and tracing the leave-process, this article discusses possible scenarios and their consequences of Brexit for UK and EU cooperation with developing countries and their implications within the wider context of EU external action. The analysis builds on new-institutionalism and connects to theories of differentiated integration, framing Brextt as a phenomenon of regional dis-integration and contributing to the development of instruments for studying such phenomena. While, at this point of time, conclusions are speculative in nature, a strategic foresight would advise to protect development policy as far as possible from the trade-offs of the negotiation gamble and place common goals and values beyond dispute.","[Henoekl, Thomas] Univ Agder, Dept Polit Sci & Management, Kristiansand, Norway; [Henoekl, Thomas] German Dev Inst, Bonn, Germany",University of Agder; Deutsches Institut Entwicklungspolitik (DIE),"Henökl, T (通讯作者)，Univ Agder, Dept Polit Sci & Management, Kristiansand, Norway.;Henökl, T (通讯作者)，German Dev Inst, Bonn, Germany.",thomas.henokl@uia.no,,,,,,,50,15,16,0,47,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,MAR,2018,97.0,,,,SI,,63,72,,10.1016/j.futures.2017.07.002,0.0,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,GA7AD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428485900008,0

The econometric analysis (an unbalanced panel of 31 countries in the 1928-1932 and 128 countries in 2008-2012) does not find an impact from the level of development on deglobalisation. The manufacturing import share is significantly associated with stronger deglobalisation (this effect is stronger in the 1930s than in the 2000s). The political system is highly significant in both 1930s and 2000s, but the sign of its impact is opposite. In the 1930s, autocratic rule and dictatorship are associated with stronger deglobalisation; in the 2000s, democracy is associated with stronger deglobalisation.","[van Bergeijk, Peter A.

Namely, we have analyzed the Eurostoxx 50 in 2017 in order to know the disclosure of information related to the above directive about the fight against corruption and bribery. We find that the level of corruption and bribery disclosure in our firm sample is around sixty percent. In particular, the corruption and bribery aspects more disclosed are related to the anti-corruption policies, procedures and standards; internal and external control processes and resources allocated to preventing corruption and bribery; and criteria used in corruption related to risk assessments. Together, these results have public policy implications because they suggest that firm are responding to the disclosure of corruption and bribery information. However, we should highlight that there is still a long way to get disclosure about corruption and bribery from all companies.","[Alonso Carrillo, Inmaculada; Montserrat Chicharro, Nunez; Priego De La Cruz, Alba Maria] UCLM, Ronda Toledo SN, Ciudad Real 13071, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,"Carrillo, IA (通讯作者)，UCLM, Ronda Toledo SN, Ciudad Real 13071, Spain.",inmaculada.alonso@uclm.es; montserrat.nunez@uclm.es; albamaria.priego@uclm.es,,,,,,,21,0,0,1,7,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,1080,1093,,,,,,14,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200092,0

Organizations of similar size (in terms of number of employees and sales), as well as having similar (sequential or parallel) organizational structures, according to the authors, can form groups that constitute the entire set of commercial organizations within the same industry, as well as the national economy as a whole. Data of retail trade organizations and private educational organizations of the Czech Republic and their comparison was used for the analysis. IBM SPSS Statistics software was used to identify clusters. The results of the cluster analysis of both retail trade and private educational organizations of the Czech Republic in general confirmed the hypothesis and showed coincidence with the corresponding theoretical models of organizational structure evolution.

This is logical as high turnover not only increases costs, but also means that employees represent a threat to the original company if they go to competitors. The most frequent reason for high turnover is perhaps dissatisfaction with work, but the influence of other factors has also been studied. In spite of the breadth of research, the results are very often ambiguous. This article is focused on turnover tendencies in two plants operated by a ceramic company in the Czech Republic. Among the sample of workers, the study examined the impact of expectations of work, training pursued and age. Dependence was confirmed only between work expectations and turnover tendencies in one of the two plants. Statistically, it is only possible to confirm/reject those aspects that are currently relevant. However, it is possible that turnover tendencies are influenced by more factors with a cumulative impact.

But modern realities prove the need to review the theoretical insights in the aftermath of the radical transformation of Russian economy, which occurred in recent years and caused an increase in shadow economic activity of small enterprises. At the same time, the domestic economy ceased to be closed one and gradually became an integral part of the global economy. The fact predetermines the further development of Russian economy based on digital technologies, being an important factor for regional economy. It is also necessary to emphasize that, despite the variety of the theoretical problems raised within the study of SB theory, there is a lack of attention paid to its essence transformation in the context of shadow activity of small enterprises. Also, speaking about applied researches, inadequate share of attention is paid to the methods of state influence on shadow activity of small businesses that is connected directly with delegation of authorities and responsibilities to regional and municipal levels during state support implementation.","[Burov, Vitaliy Yurievich; Tumunbayarova, Zhargal Bairovna] Transbaikal State Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Chita, Russia; [Bagiev, Georgiy Leonidovich] St Petersburg State Univ, St Petersburg, Russia",Transbaikal State University; Saint Petersburg State University,"Burov, VY (通讯作者)，Transbaikal State Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Chita, Russia.",burovschool1956@yandex.ru,"Tumunbayarova, Zhargal/AAU-7154-2021",,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-514-6,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,39.0,,,,,,109,112,,,,,,4,Business; Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BO4YG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000515721900024,0

The policy implication is that the government should beware sudden increases in the capital market relative to the banking sector.

This research aims to identify the factors that lead to the behavior of searching for information on online social networks when considering to buy a product or a service online, specifically to identify the the roles of trust, community commitment, and perception of member affiliation (we-ness) in the decision-making process. As most research papers in the e-commerce field analyzing the factors that influence purchase behavior, this paper uses a quantitative research method, the questionnaire, which was applied in May 2017. The research sample consisted of 166 Facebook users. Facebook is representative considering the large number of users and the amount of time spent on this social network. All of the participants are students at the College of Communication and Public Relations, at the National University of Political Studies and Public Administration, from Bucharest, aged between 18 and 24 years old. The research results revealed that there is a relationship between propensity to trust community members and seeking information on online social networks, even though users are not highly trusting online social networks. According to the results, the Facebook community represents an important source of information where the users have the possibility to consult details, opinions, reviews related to online shopping experiences, but the attachment to the community is to a low degree. The participants from our study mostly use Facebook as a space for obtaining the relevant information for their intention to buy specific products or services, passively consuming the content from this channel. These findings suggest the importance of online shopping websites to communicate on online social networks, where individuals gather information in their intention and selection process of online buying.","[Ciochina, Raluca Silvia; Cismaru, Diana Maria; Vilcu, Alexandra] Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, 30A Expozitiei Blvd,Sect 1, Bucharest 012104, Romania",National University of Political Studies & Public Administration (SNSPA) - Romania,"Ciochina, RS (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, 30A Expozitiei Blvd,Sect 1, Bucharest 012104, Romania.",raluca.ciochina@comunicare.ro; diana.cismaru@comunicare.ro; alexa_ave@yahoo.com,"Ciochina, Raluca Silvia/GMX-2522-2022",,,,,,26,1,1,0,7,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,894,903,,,,,,10,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200076,0

There is a growing body of literature that recognizes the importance of resilience in today's societies. Most of these studies focus on economic, social or urban resilience, little attention being paid to relationship resilience. Globalization involves not only the spread of the capitalist and neoliberal ideologies, but also the individualization and reflexivization of the private life. In a public space in which competitive, transactional and instrumental relationships are becoming the norm, in the private sphere, the opposite phenomenon emerges, by growing cooperation, happiness, and emotional bonding. By studying relationships from the private sphere, one could gain a more nuanced understanding of how resilience works, so that it could be better mobilized as a resource for the reproduction of human capital. As main analysis materials, we used the results of a longitudinal psychological explicative research on the human development theme, conducted in the American context. The results show that the strongest predictors of a subjective evaluation of life as a fulfilled one are the variables measuring the management dimensions of intimacy (specific for family, friendship and community life). We discuss implications for conceptualizing happiness as a resilience resource to be taken into account by policy making for the reproduction of human capital in modern welfare economies.","[Coman, Claudiu] Transilvania Univ Brasov, Brasov, Romania",Transylvania University of Brasov,"Coman, C (通讯作者)，Transilvania Univ Brasov, Brasov, Romania.",claudiu.coman@unitbv.ro,"Coman, Claudiu/AAL-3539-2021","Coman, Claudiu/0000-0001-6272-7414",,,,,25,0,0,1,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,241,247,,,,,,7,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO8KK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000527683300026,0

Specifically, we are going to answer the following research questions: RQ1, Which approach is the most appropriate for the management of highly complex events and inter-institutional projects?; RQ2, Which is the connection between 2030 Agenda and great events? Large-scale events, which are characterized by a dynamic complexity involving different national public administrations and institutional levels, require a special attention in selecting an adequate event management system. For this reason, after a detailed literature review on event management, this paper explores the concept of sustainable development and focuses on the traditional elements of social, environmental and economic pillars within the context of planned events. Given the objective of this work, the analysis of a best practice event will be useful to identify the main variables, in terms of sustainable strategic planning, execution and control, required to achieve the greatest level of efficiency in terms of cost optimization and quality of service delivery, also exhorting the Italian public sector to look for a structural renewal, to better use its available resources, as well as to foster a global sustainable growth. From this point of view, a relevant experience is the case of the Extraordinary jubilee of Mercy, coordinated by the Prefect of Rome. Indeed, the latter, decided to adopt actions consistent with sustainability standards, thanks to the design of an inter-institutional network and the engagement of institutions at different levels. The Prefect of Rome achieved, in a very short term, three main results: coordination of the activities of the working groups (SDG 17); integration of internal and external surveillance and communication systems (SDG 9); collaboration with higher education institutions to acquire and disseminate knowledge (SDG 4). To systemize and combine the outcomes of these processes, as well as to analyze their consistency with sustainable development, the System Thinking technique was used.","[Di Gerio, Chiara; Fiorani, Gloria] Tor Vergata Univ Rome, Via Columbia 2, I-00133 Rome, Italy",University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Di Gerio, C (通讯作者)，Tor Vergata Univ Rome, Via Columbia 2, I-00133 Rome, Italy.",di.gerio@economia.uniroma2.it; fiorani@economia.uniroma2.it,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,6,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,1295,1306,,,,,,12,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200110,0

Using a unique dataset on a sample of banks domiciled in the Middle East and North Africa region, we find that the ownership structure is an important driver of banks' regulatory capital and liquidity risk. Private and foreign investors exhibit a stronger preference for higher levels of capital, whereas the impact of government ownership on banks' risk remains inconclusive. Moreover, privately-owned banks evidenced lower levels of liquidity risk compared to the other groups during the last financial crisis because of tighter budget constraints and more compelling liquidity needs.","[Duqi, Andi; Al-Tamimi, Hussein] Univ Sharjah, Coll Business Adm, Dept Finance & Econ, POB 27272, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates",University of Sharjah,"Duqi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sharjah, Coll Business Adm, Dept Finance & Econ, POB 27272, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates.",Aduqi@sharjah.ac.ae,,"Duqi, Andi/0000-0002-0869-2377",University of Sharjah [140322],University of Sharjah,The authors want to thank the University of Sharjah that funded the project through a research grant (No. 140322).,,70,8,8,3,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

While these discourses suggest globalization is bringing humanity together into a globally connected, cosmopolitan world order, such corporate advertisements also seek to convey the desirability and inevitability of a borderless economy in which they may roam unfettered. To illustrate how these ideas are communicated, I investigate three emblematic cases: Emirates Airlines, HSBC, and Itau. By interrogating their public discourses, this article elucidates how powerful actors seek to construct global (or regional-global) imaginaries for consumers by deploying esthetically pleasing (and, at times, seemingly 'subversive') advertisements. Their ultimate effect is to demonstrate the would-be futility of attempts to regulate the spread of global capitalism or their own profit-seeking behavior. Through showing how pop-culture artifacts attempt to 'sell' teleological global capitalism to audiences, this article contributes to the burgeoning literature on the cultural political economy of globalization. To conclude, I briefly explore how this analysis relates to important political debates concerning agency in globalization, the feasibility of state regulation of global capitalism, and the construction of alternative global imaginaries/orders.","[Funk, Kevin] Spring Hill Coll, Dept Polit Sci & Law, Mobile, AL USA; [Funk, Kevin] Spring Hill Coll, Int Studies, Mobile, AL USA",,"Funk, K (通讯作者)，Spring Hill Coll, Social Sci Div, 4000 Dauphin St, Mobile, AL 36608 USA.",kevin.funk@gmail.com,,,,,,,88,0,1,1,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

To examine these dependencies, the authors used the Gini coefficient and regression and correlation analysis. We observed the greater differentiation and variation in the labour factor productivity rather than in its remuneration. The distributions of those variables in spatial terms did not match each other in terms of their equality.

The reason was the group so-called discouraged young people who are not captured in the unemployment indicator according to the standard definition of unemployment. So, it is not about young people who want to work while actively looking for job - in other words, discouraged young people.

A particular role is attributed to agrienvironmental programs including organic production. Organic farms play an important role in local development by providing high quality products and environmental protection. The common agricultural policy is oriented towards supporting the development of sustainable production regardless of the farming method. This is in line with the principles of sustainable development. This is particularly significant in the case of new EU member states, in which there is high underdevelopment. The aim of the work is to assess the activities supporting the sustainable development of agricultural production in Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia and Poland in 2013-2015. Selected elements of financial analysis were applied. Research indicates that the idea of sustainable development is implemented at the level of farms.

The Panel also found, however, that the program was unnecessarily discriminatory and, hence, not justified under that Article. Some alarm has been raised that an exceptionally low threshold has been applied by the Panel for identifying a 'public morals' measure. Those alarms are unfounded, given the circumstances of the particular dispute. Instead, the Panel's report indicates a way for trade law to adapt to fundamental demographic changes occurring since 1995. Two-thirds of the world's more than one billion poor now live in middle-income countries (MICs) and are predominantly ethnic minorities. Forces of social and economic exclusion have obstructed their benefiting from the economic growth which has raised standards of living around them. Action by the MICs involved to lift these communities out of poverty will include assisting them to build enduring economic bases. This is likely to require affirmative action measures favouring local minority producers and suppliers in those MICs. At present, there is little appetite among the industrialized countries for tolerating trade-affecting, affirmative action measures in prospering MICs like India and China. Yet the global community has pledged, in Goal 1 of the Sustainable Development Goals, to halve global poverty, and eradicate extreme poverty, by 2030 - a Goal which has been described as the moral issue of our time. Achieving that Goal depends on internal action taken by the MICs involved to reduce social and economic exclusion. The public morals exception in WTO law (and in most trade agreements) offers a way for trade law to support legitimate domestic measures which are necessary for social inclusion and poverty reduction.","[Moon, Gillian] UNSW, Fac Law, Trade Human Rights & Dev Project, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Moon, G (通讯作者)，UNSW, Fac Law, Trade Human Rights & Dev Project, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",g.moon@unsw.edu.au,,,,,,,39,3,3,0,4,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Managerial strategies and the impact of the decision on business achievements are actively debated in nowadays literature. The necessity of law amendments is of constructive interest for several perspectives, such as improving the global regulatory framework and, at the national level, for state control bodies recommendations. The Performance Measurement Mechanism presents a dual approach and a two-way challenge. On the one hand, quantifying performance implies establishing measurable managerial obligations in order to achieve business profitability and strengthen the process of economic and efficient use of resources. From a managerial perspective, fulfilling the imposed criteria may present a motivational challenge, because the level of accomplishments directly determines the level of remuneration. The 'final beneficiary who may actually acknowledge the fulfillment of goals and the quality of the services provided by SOEs are in fact the ordinary people who experience and appreciate, ultimately, the effect of the managerial strategies and the outcome of the managerial act. In this context, the method of setting key performance indicators is of paramount importance. Our paper proposes a performance quantification model in the Romanian SOE field, which allows a fast and intuitive identification of a minimum set of performance criteria, adaptable to the specifics of the enterprises' activities. Through a methodological approach to regulations, considering a representative pool of Romanian SOEs.

The study is significantly important from the perspective of the calculated results, which sets the premises of developing future analyzes.

Our findings show that, during the reform period, China's exports to the eurozone are affected only by the EUR-RMB exchange rate per se and not by its volatility. However, neither the exchange rate nor its volatility significantly influences the eurozone's exports to China during the reform period.

The analysis comprised the three areas of ICT services: telecommunications services, services related to software and consultancy in the IT area, and information-related services. The results indicate a wide scope of the use of ICT services telecommunication services are used by all the entities surveyed, those related to software and consultancy by three quarters, while information-related services by almost 60%. In case of all entities there are noted growing outlays on their application, justified, on the one side, by the demand, and, on the other side, by high appraisals of their quality and up-to-datedness (more than 70% of indications) as well as their impact on competitiveness of the entities using them (percentages at the level of more than 60%). It must be said that there occur quite big differences in the indices obtained, due to the features of the enterprises in question. Most often statistically significant dependencies appear in case of information-related services they are determined by the size of enterprises and the origin of their capital. In case of the services related to software and IT consultancy, the said dependencies also concern the enterprises' size and, additionally, the range of their activities.

This issue is important from the point of view of demographic changes, and the pace of economic development, as well as the current and future state of public finances. These factors are crucial to the security of the pension system and the quality of life of future pensioners. On 19th June 2015, the Ecofin Council decided to retract applying the Excessive Deficit Procedure to Poland. As a result of the Excessive Deficit Procedure being imposed upon it, Poland took steps to reduce its deficit through structural reforms-extending the retirement age to 67 years of age and making the retirement age the same for men and women, and reforming the open pension funds (OFE). However, when assessing the effects of the recent pension reform of 2014, it is worth mentioning the previous reforms. The first pension reform, in place since 1999 has proven to be a serious burden to the state budget due to the high costs of the funded pension scheme (OFE), contributing to an increase in public debt. Therefore, in 2011, the government proposed further changes in the pension system, which turned out to be insufficient to improve the state of public finances. Analyzing the next OFE reform of 2014 it is worth noting that OFE transferred to the Social Insurance Institution (ZUS) assets with a market value of PLN 153.2 billion. This operation transformed Poland's visible public debt into the state's future liabilities towards its pensioners (so called hidden debt).","[Owsiak, Katarzyna] Cracow Univ Econ, Local Finance Dept, Fac Finance, Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Owsiak, K (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Local Finance Dept, Fac Finance, Krakow, Poland.",owsiakk@uek.krakow.pl,,,,,,,60,0,0,0,2,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-67916-7; 978-3-319-67915-0,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,133,151,,10.1007/978-3-319-67916-7_9,0.0,,,19,Area Studies; Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL4TI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450786500009,0

Various estimators considered here include some popular methods of robust statistics. The methodology used for constructing the classification rule can be described as metalearning. Nevertheless, standard approaches of metalearning should be robustified if working with data sets contaminated by outlying measurements (outliers). Therefore, our contribution can be also described as robustification of the metalearning process by using a robust prediction error. In addition to performing the metalearning study by means of both standard and robust approaches, we search for a detailed interpretation in two particular situations. The results of detailed investigation show that the knowledge obtained by a metalearning approach standing on standard principles is prone to great variability and instability, which makes it hard to believe that the results are not just a consequence of a mere chance.

Both of the standard support vector machine(SVM) for regression and modified SV Regression (mu-epsilon-SVR) techniques are effective for outlier detection in case of non-linear functions with multi-dimensional inputs; nevertheless, these methods still suffer from a few issues, such as the setting of free parameters and the cost of time.

The trend towards buying organic food is increasing worldwide including Pakistani consumers. It is a dire need of time to understand what factors persuade consumers to turn towards organic food. This empirical study is aimed at explaining the factors that influence willingness to pay (WTP) for organic food of urban consumers in Pakistan. This study used survey data collected from 600 consumers in the Central Punjab Pakistan during September to November 2017. Structured questionnaires were randomly distributed among the academic staffs, students of different universities and customers in different fruit and vegetable markets. Structural equation modeling was used to evaluate the data. Results indicate that consumers who were interested in buying the organic food products were likely to buy a more significant quantity of those products. The willingness to buy (WTB) organic food depends upon the attitudes, subjective norms, organic food knowledge, availability and labeling & certification. However, the health concern is ranked 1st among all these. Moreover, perceived expensiveness, culture, and environmental concerns have less effect or negative impact on WTP. A contribution of this paper lies in providing marketing strategies for organic food vendors to cut down the barriers which consumers face while purchasing organic food in the country. Further research may explore the role of more motivating factors to have a better understanding about consumer's more WTP for safe food.","[Sana, Ullah; Latif, Waqas Umar; Ahmad, Wasim; Xu, Xue-Rong] Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Econ, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Jafar, Muhammad Sohail] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Management, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China; [Pervez, Muhammad] PMAS Arid Agr Univ, Coll Econ, Rawalpindi, Pakistan; [Ahmed, Nafees] Univ Punjab, Coll Art & Design, Lahore, Pakistan",Fujian Agriculture & Forestry University; Shenzhen University; Arid Agriculture University; University of Punjab,"Xu, XR (通讯作者)，Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Econ, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, Peoples R China.",sanaullah_sahil@yahoo.com; wasimtouseef@hotmail.com; ranawaqas_100@yahoo.com; rana.sohail.jafar@gmail.com; muhammadpervezbhatti@gmail.com; nafees.awaan@gmail.com; fzxxr@163.com,"Jafar, Rana Muhammad Sohail/AAE-1874-2021; Ahemad, Nafees/AAS-8111-2020; Ahmad, Wasim/GQG-9225-2022","Jafar, Rana Muhammad Sohail/0000-0001-9260-5581; Ahemad, Nafees/0000-0002-5164-1970;",Fujian provincial department of science and technology [2016R1006],Fujian provincial department of science and technology,"I would like to express the sincere sense of gratefulness to my supervisor, Professor Dr. Xu Xuerong who sincerely shows a spirit of adventure in regards to my part of research work.

Property insurance is more effective than life insurance in stimulating economic growth. Some temporary negative impacts from the development of the insurance sector show that China is in the midst of a transition from a closed economy to a more open economy and policy interventions by the government to liberalize the insurance sector. These findings offer several useful insights for policy makers in transition economies and developing countries.","[Si, Deng-Kui] Qingdao Univ, Sch Econ, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Li, Xiao-Lin] Ocean Univ China, Dept Finance, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Shi-jie] Hunan Univ, Dept Insurance, 109,Shijiachong, Changsha 410006, Hunan, Peoples R China",Qingdao University; Ocean University of China; Hunan University,"Jiang, SJ (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ, Dept Insurance, 109,Shijiachong, Changsha 410006, Hunan, Peoples R China.",actjiang@msn.com,,,,,,,45,5,5,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The changes in the macroeconomic and political conditions lead to considerable transformations of the consumer market of the suggested groups of Russian regions according to the level of its development and its structure. The regions-leaders keep their dominating position at any changes of the economic and political competitive position. The regions-outsiders under favourable conditions move closer to the leading group. In contrast during the worsening of the economic conditions the group of the outsiders is widened due to the regions of an average development level.

This person is very important for the development of the country, takes many risks and is always a leader. Not all leaders must necessarily be entrepreneurs, but in my opinion, all entrepreneurs are definitely leaders. Entrepreneurship is not something known from the beginning of life, as these abilities are not innate, but you can train them and develop them over time. The first step is to start acting. When you have an idea, you do not have to be afraid to express it in a business. Entrepreneurs are doers, not dreamers. Most people develop many ideas during their life, but very few of them put these ideas into practice. Why did that happen? The eternal problem, financing? Bureaucracy? Taxation? Internationalization? Education? Legislation? I will touch and talk about all these subjects in this work. According to a study by The Economist Intelligence Unit for DHL Express, five out of six companies believe that cultural barriers are the most important factor in making the decision to enter a new market. In Romania, this is still not the only one. There will be analyzed a series of main reasons why the number of small and medium enterprises is still small compared to the other member states of the European Union. Primarily, the article starts with the role of small and medium businesses worldwide. After that, a few statements on the situation of SMEs in Romania. Further, we introduce a comparative analysis on the strategy of supporting the SMEs of Romania in comparison with other countries and the effects of the economic crisis on entrepreneurial leaders.

For instance, using computers and the Internet was creative in the scientific community (here) some 25 years ago (then), but it is a routine activity in 2018 (now). Scientists who do not use computers and the internet are exceptions that prove the previous sentence here (scientific community) and now (2018). A work of blue collars on the assembly line, brought by Henry Ford in motor industry a hundred years ago, is a commonly used example of a routine labour. We introduce a concept of the Virtual Production Line (VPL) as an extension of the Ford's invention, study its structure, and show how it can be used in an analysis and modelling of creative labour. We also demonstrate that the VPL should be considered as a new example for the ICT support to business activities. By an example of the Linux (system), we demonstrate that each bug fixing or a codebase extension can be considered as an example of a successful or not creative activity, done by at least two developers on a corresponding VPL. The line is virtual, since it does not exist physically and developers may be located in different parts of the world. They join efforts in a given project and exchange information via internet. Thus, there exists the one to one correspondence between a Linux project and its VPL. Then, the motivation and governance in a Linux project can be studied as formal and informal relations among developers working on the corresponding VPL. We generalize these findings to the case of any creative activity and discuss a possible impact of them on labour market in the nearest future.","[Walukiewicz, Stanislaw] Bialystok Tech Univ, Fac Engn Management, Bialystok, Poland",Bialystok University of Technology,"Walukiewicz, S (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Fac Engn Management, Bialystok, Poland.",s.walukiewicz@pb.edu.pl,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,496,507,,,,,,12,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO8KK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000527683300055,0

They have the advantage of being focused on extremal income groups that are especially interesting from the point of view of economic inequality and polarization. In the paper a confidence interval for such measures, assuming the Dagum distribution, is constructed. The ends of the confidence interval depend on an unknown shape parameter of the underlying income distribution model. In applications this parameter must be estimated from the data. The constructed confidence interval, applied to decile and quintile ratios, was implemented to the analysis of income inequaity in Poland.

In order to help fill the research gap in this area, this study explores the heterogeneity of that relationship across 20 OECD countries.","[Ji, Eun Jeong] Korea Labor Force Dev Inst Aged, Seoul, South Korea",,"Ji, EJ (通讯作者)，Korea Labor Force Dev Inst Aged, Seoul, South Korea.",jieun29@gmail.com,,,,,,,33,0,0,4,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-7780,1564-913X,,INT LABOUR REV,Int.

Apart from negative health outcomes, preterm birth also produces significant health care expenditures. This study evaluates the costs associated with preterm birth in different health sectors during the first 3 years of infants' lives. In a retrospective observational study based on claims data from a German statutory health insurance company, average costs for medication, hospital treatment, ambulatory treatment, and non-medical remedies during the first 3 years after birth were analyzed for early preterm, late preterm, and full-term births. Costs associated with preterm births were generally higher than for full-term births, with the highest costs for the hospital treatment of early preterm births. Cost differences tended to decrease in the second and third year after birth except for ambulatory treatment costs, which decreased for late preterm and full-term births but not for early preterm births. The study shows that preterm birth is associated with increased health care costs, particularly during the first year after birth, indicating that the implementation of adequate programs and policies for preventing preterm birth is not only desirable from a medical but also from a health economic perspective.","[Jacob, Josephine; Walker, Jochen] Inst Angew Gesundheitsforsch Berlin InGef, Spittelmarkt 12, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Lehne, Moritz] Elsevier Hlth Analyt, Berlin, Germany; [Mischker, Andrea; Klinger, Normen; Zickermann, Claudia] BIG Direkt Gesund, Berlin, Germany",Reed Elsevier; Elsevier,"Jacob, J (通讯作者)，Inst Angew Gesundheitsforsch Berlin InGef, Spittelmarkt 12, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",josephine.jacob@hrisk.de,"Lehne, Moritz/AAE-8752-2020","Jacob, Josephine/0000-0001-8769-9747",,,,,38,33,37,0,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

They are about national security. A trade deal may be ambitious in liberalizing or managing cross-border flows in goods, services, intellectual property (IP), and people, but to argue for or against an FTA solely along the axis of free versus managed trade is to miss another vital purpose - the deal can, and indeed should, advance national security. This article makes two points. First, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) exemplifies the possibility of enhancing the national security the United States, through containment of China and its ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Second, the debate over the definition of state owned enterprise (SOE) is one among many illustrations in the TPP of the link between national security, trade, and containment. The 12 nations negotiating the TPP were aware of this link, and deliberated the definition of 'SOE'. The TPP excluded the Middle Kingdom from the founding members, while the founders wrote the TPP rules to bind China if it subsequently joined the deal. Chinese SOEs were of concern to them, for bona fide national security reasons, and so also were legitimate sovereign interests in providing goods and services through their own SOEs. The evaluation by America and its 11 TPP partners, as to which entities should be included in the scope of SOE disciplines led to a set of clear rules.","[Bhala, Raj] Univ Kansas, Sch Law, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA",University of Kansas,"Bhala, R (通讯作者)，Univ Kansas, Sch Law, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",bhala@ku.edu,,"Bhala, Raj/0000-0003-0142-4334",,,,,37,10,10,1,25,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,OCT,2017,16.0,4,,,,,655,671,,10.1017/S1474745617000258,0.0,,,17,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,FK0ML,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413173800006,0

Our preferred estimates imply an internal rate of return of around 11%, suggesting that it was highly profitable to acquire additional schooling.

It employs a content analysis of German and British politicians' motives in parliamentary debates on whether and why to increase VAT rates. A qualitative comparison reveals that there are remarkable differences between the two countries. In Germany, there is a clear and consistent shift in the efficiency frame from macroeconomic condemnation to microeconomic appraisal even among left politicians. This is not visible in British debates, where traditional partisan contestation prevails. The difference in efficiency frames is closely related to unemployment becoming a much more salient issue in Germany than in the UK. The quantitative analysis shows that speakers are indeed more likely to mention the efficiency frame when they are concerned about the labour market.","[Kemmerling, Achim] Cent European Univ Budapest, Dept Publ Policy, Nador Utca 11, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary",Central European University,"Kemmerling, A (通讯作者)，Cent European Univ Budapest, Dept Publ Policy, Nador Utca 11, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary.",kemmerlinga@ceu.hu,"Kemmerling, Achim/AAE-8837-2021","Kemmerling, Achim/0000-0002-1001-4102",Collaborative Research Centre Transformations of the State Bremen [SfB 597],Collaborative Research Centre Transformations of the State Bremen,Collaborative Research Centre (SfB 597) Transformations of the State Bremen.,,77,6,6,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

This Regulation prohibits placing illegally harvested timber on the EU market and obliges economic operators who put timber products for the first time on the EU market to exercise due diligence. So far, little research has been done to understand the politics of the EUTR. Based on 25 interviews with key informants and the analysis of 32 policy documents, this paper explains the emergence of the Regulation as a result of coalitional politics driven by both conflict and cooperation among state and non-state actors. We show that the politics of the EUTR is marked by heated policy debates and mistrust, in particular in regards to the prohibition clause and the relation between legality and sustainability. Domestic timber producers (public and private forest owners), forest industry (sawmilling, furniture, pulp and paper) and forest-rich EU member states (e.g. Austria, Germany, Finland and Sweden) represented in the Council built a CONTRA-coalition that were (initially) opposed to the regulatory changes suggested by the PRO-coalition of environmental groups and the European Parliament. The Regulation emerged through a strategic alliance between environmental groups, timber import-dependent forest industries and retailers. This Baptists-and Bootleggers alliance was facilitated by an overlap of environmentalists' beliefs and moral arguments (emphasizing the negative societal and ecological impacts of illegal logging) and timber industries' economic interests (protectionism and market expansion as well as reputational improvement). The EUTR was finally adopted through the political support of national authorities of EU member states who are timber import dependent (the UK, the Netherlands and Denmark), and the European Parliament. The paper concludes with a reflection on the importance of coalitional politics for policy change at the nexus between environmental, trade and market policies.","[Sotirov, Metodi; Stelter, Maike] Univ Freiburg, Inst Environm Social Sci & Geog, Chair Forest & Environm Policy, Freiburg, Germany; [Winkel, Georg] European Forest Inst, Bonn Off, Pl Vereinten Nationen 7, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Sotirov, M (通讯作者)，Tennenbacherstr 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.",metodi.sotirov@ifp.uni-freiburg.de,"Winkel, Georg/GVU-4080-2022; Sotirov, Metodi/T-8199-2019","Winkel, Georg/0000-0002-9254-0447; Sotirov, Metodi/0000-0002-3548-707X; Stelter, Maike/0000-0002-2154-5902","European Union Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration [282887]; Eva-Mayr-Stihl-Stiftung [595009]","European Union Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration(European Union (EU)); Eva-Mayr-Stihl-Stiftung","We are deeply grateful to all interviewees for their support.

Considering the different wage estimation approaches observed in the published literature, we sought to assess variation in productivity loss estimates when using average wages compared with age-specific wages. Published estimates for average and age-specific wages for combined male/female wages were obtained from the UK Office of National Statistics. A polynomial interpolation was used to convert 5-year age-banded wage data into annual age-specific wages estimates. To compare indirect cost estimates, average wages and age-specific wages were used to project productivity losses at various stages of life based on the human capital approach. Discount rates of 0, 3, and 6 % were applied to projected age-specific and average wage losses. Using average wages was found to overestimate lifetime wages in conditions afflicting those aged 1-27 and 57-67, while underestimating lifetime wages in those aged 27-57. The difference was most significant for children where average wage overestimated wages by 15 % and for 40-year-olds where it underestimated wages by 14 %. Large differences in projecting productivity losses exist when using the average wage applied over a lifetime. Specifically, use of average wages overestimates productivity losses between 8 and 15 % for childhood illnesses. Furthermore, during prime working years, use of average wages will underestimate productivity losses by 14 %. We suggest that to achieve more precise estimates of productivity losses, age-specific wages should become the standard analytic approach.","[Connolly, Mark P.; Postma, Maarten J.] Univ Groningen, Dept Pharm, Unit PharmacoEpidemiol & PharmacoEcon, Antonius Deusinglaan 1, NL-9713 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Connolly, Mark P.; Tashjian, Cole; Kotsopoulos, Nikolaos] Global Market Access Solut GMAS, St Prex, Switzerland; [Bhatt, Aomesh] John Radcliffe Hosp, Oxford OX3 9DU, England; [Postma, Maarten J.] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Inst Sci Hlth Aging & Healthcare SHARE, Groningen, Netherlands; [Postma, Maarten J.] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Epidemiol, Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen; University of Oxford; University of Groningen; University of Groningen,"Connolly, MP (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Dept Pharm, Unit PharmacoEpidemiol & PharmacoEcon, Antonius Deusinglaan 1, NL-9713 AV Groningen, Netherlands.;Connolly, MP (通讯作者)，Global Market Access Solut GMAS, St Prex, Switzerland.",m.connolly@rug.nl,,"Postma, Maarten/0000-0002-6306-3653; KOTSOPOULOS, NIKOLAOS/0000-0002-8248-7697; Bhatt, Aomesh/0000-0001-6206-0576",,,,,19,6,6,1,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

I analyze this question in the Chinese context, in which the household registration system imposes selective rural-urban migration restrictions. The identification derives from a policy change that grants urban residency to a group of rural individuals based on their dates of birth. Using a regression discontinuity approach, I find that educational attainments for barely eligible rural residents decreased sharply after the reform. These effects are larger for males and for those able to permanently migrate to relatively rich areas.","[Pan, Yao] Aalto Univ, Dept Econ, Espoo, Finland",Aalto University,"Pan, Y (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Dept Econ, Espoo, Finland.",yao.pan@aalto.fi,,,,,,,49,11,12,1,25,UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS,MADISON,"JOURNAL DIVISION, 1930 MONROE ST, 3RD FL, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0022-166X,1548-8004,,J HUM RESOUR,J.

However, there have been few detailed examinations of the differences between the new generation of owners and the previous one. To better understand these differences, an analysis was carried out of data obtained from a telephone survey of a representative sample (n = 1723) of the 134,000 private forest owners in Quebec, Canada. The results reveal differences between the new (< 10 years of ownership) and longstanding forest owners (> 20 years of ownership) responding to the survey. In terms of owners' profiles, a number of variables differed significantly between the two categories of owners: education level, family income, way the first forest was acquired and the distance between the closest woodlot and the owner's place of residence. Differences in the two groups' objectives for owning a forest and for carrying out management work were also identified. Certain behaviours such as harvesting levels and sources of information consulted on forestry also differed significantly between the new and longstanding owners participating in the survey. In short a shift is occurring towards owners who are from the professional class, are more highly educated and live farther away from their forests. The forest is integrated into these new owners' lifestyles in a different way since it is a leisure-time activity rather than part of their main occupation. The increasing diversity among owners will require a new approach by the agencies and associations offering them services and the government, which wants to encourage owners to harvest wood from their forests.

This paper provides an extensive analysis of the demand for alcohol as measured by total quantity, frequency, and intensity. A unique large sample of cross-sectional data from Sweden 2004-2011 allows reduced-form alcohol demand equations to be estimated for beer, wine, and spirits, split by alcohol drinking pattern (average vs. binge drinkers) and gender. Results find a negative beer excise rate effect for participation and frequency, and positive effect for intensity. The effect was stronger for binge drinkers. Generally, the results also show a positive socioeconomic (income and education) gradient in frequency demand and a negative gradient in the intensity demand. Female wine drinkers show a positive socioeconomic gradient in both frequency and intensity. The findings highlight the complexity of this policy space. Tax increases appear to reduce frequency but raise intensity consumed. The more educated and higher earners drink more in total, but less intensely when they do and this is likely to explain in part why poor health is concentrated amongst lower socioeconomic status individuals.","[Heckley, Gawain; Jarl, Johan; Gerdtham, Ulf-G] Lund Univ, Inst Econ Res, Hlth Econ & Management, Box 117, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Heckley, Gawain; Jarl, Johan; Gerdtham, Ulf-G] Lund Univ, Dept Clin Sci, Hlth Econ Unit, S-22381 Lund, Sweden; [Gerdtham, Ulf-G] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, Lund, Sweden",Lund University; Lund University; Lund University,"Heckley, G (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Inst Econ Res, Hlth Econ & Management, Box 117, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.;Heckley, G (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Clin Sci, Hlth Econ Unit, S-22381 Lund, Sweden.",gawain.heckley@med.lu.se,"; Gerdtham, Ulf-Goran/I-6766-2018","Jarl, Johan/0000-0002-9274-2479; Heckley, Gawain/0000-0001-6737-3969; Gerdtham, Ulf-Goran/0000-0002-0647-7817",Swedish Council for Working Life and Social Research (FAS) [2012-0419]; Systembolaget's fund for alcohol research (SRA); FAS [2006-1660]; Government Grant for Clinical Research (ALF''); Region Skane (Gerdtham),Swedish Council for Working Life and Social Research (FAS)(Swedish Research Council for Health Working Life & Welfare (Forte)); Systembolaget's fund for alcohol research (SRA); FAS; Government Grant for Clinical Research (ALF''); Region Skane (Gerdtham),"Financial support from the Swedish Council for Working Life and Social Research (FAS) (dnr 2012-0419), and Systembolaget's fund for alcohol research (SRA) is gratefully acknowledged.

We conducted a survey of a broad set of suppliers in the Japanese automotive industry and another survey of suppliers registered with Toyota's two supplier associations. The data were used to analyse the influence of particular relationships and practices on information gathering about new technologies, preparations for R&D and production of new components, and predictions about new technologies. The study shows that suppliers' R&D intensity and the usage degree of the drawing-supplied parts system lead to predictions favouring the uptake of new technologies. Moreover, communication between automakers and suppliers and arm's-length relationships simultaneously lead to favourable views on the future of new technologies, especially with regard to EVs. Moreover, we find that Japanese-style cooperative relationships, arm's-length relationships, communication between automakers and suppliers, and communication among suppliers all lead to less favourable views on new technology uptake (in this case, EVs). We discuss the implications of these findings for research and practice, specifically for EVs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

These preconceptions and biases can interfere with the attempt to teach economics from a positive approach. This paper seeks to answer the questions 1) Do students come into economics training with preconceptions that could cloud their learning? 2) Is there a way to anticipate at what level specific preconceptions might occur in an identified group of students? Building on the work of Caplan this study uses survey techniques with two diverse student bodies; we find that students enter their study of economics with a significant set of preconceptions and biases, which are correlated with their initial understanding of factual information, and with their socioeconomic background. While the data in this study is limited to two specific set of students there are many students and situations where similar biases are likely to be important to the learning environment.","[Parsons, Richard] Texas A&M Univ Texarkana, 7101 Univ Ave, Texarkana, TX 75503 USA; [Mamo, Michael] Westminster Coll, 1840 South 1300 East, Salt Lake City, UT 84105 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University Texarkana,"Parsons, R (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ Texarkana, 7101 Univ Ave, Texarkana, TX 75503 USA.",Richard.parsons@tamut.edu; Mmamo@westminstercollege.edu,,,,,,,19,4,4,1,3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1477-3880,2352-4421,,INT REV ECON EDUC,Int.

Our longitudinal dataset integrates land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) information, derived by interpreting satellite imagery, with social-economic statistics across eight counties in Heilongjiang over a period of 37 years. Employing both instrument variable and system of equations methods, our models capture the inherent endogeneity embedded in the land-use changes and the effects of such factors as demographic change, economic development, and management transition on the forest condition. To validate the robustness of our models, a series of identification, endogeneity, and other tests are conducted. Our results demonstrate the dominant role of agricultural expansion in forestland loss as well as the importance of considering the substitution between forestland and wetland in analyzing the drivers of LULCC in general and deforestation in particular. The significant coefficient of the Natural Forest Protection Program implies that it has played a positive role in protecting local forests. The positive coefficient of built-up area in the farmland equation suggests a strong link between farming and residential/commercial construction; likewise, the negative coefficient of irrigation indicates that wetland loss is adversely affected by the change in local cropping pattern. It is hoped that these and other findings will improve our knowledge of the forest dynamics and their socioecological drivers, leading to more effective policy making and implementation and, ultimately, better resource conditions.

Using panel causality tests and dynamic panel data modelling, we show that laws strengthening creditors' control over debtor firms in these four countries had a long-term positive effect on the expansion of private credit, while reforms increasing secured creditors' rights had a negative effect.

This ROK case followed the state policy pathway to forest transition. This study interpreted the reforestation policy of the multiple sectors in ROK with the theory of environmental policy integration. ROK has attempted an integrated policy program for reforestation, land management and social development as an innovative approach to solving the problem of flood and erosion due to deforestation while pursuing economic growth. This integrated approach to reforestation of ROK was implemented in three pillars of action: 1) coordinated national plans, 2) collaboration among the governmental branches, and 3) organizational reformation. The integrative approach helped the reforestation policy to be implemented successfully. The case of policy integration for reforestation in ROK is a good example demonstrating that policy integration should be a principle of forest policy design and implementation. The Korean experience could be informative to developing countries experiencing deforestation for design and implementation of forest policy to avoid deforestation and achieve forest transition.

Using hedonic regressions and multiple matching procedures, we find that Energy Star certification is associated with higher sales prices in two of the markets: the Research Triangle region of North Carolina and Portland, Oregon. We find that local green certifications in Portland and in Austin, Texas, are also associated with higher prices and that the estimated price impacts are larger than those from Energy Star. Matching on observables proves to be important in some cases, reducing the estimated impacts compared with models without matching. We calculate the implied energy savings from the estimated premiums and find that, in the Research Triangle market, the Energy Star premiums approximately equal the savings that program is designed to achieve, but in Portland, the premiums are slightly greater than the program's savings due to low energy costs in the region.

The legislation made planted forests the first sector to participate in the NZ ETS, starting in 2008. At the same time, other schemes to encourage carbon sequestration through forestry were also implemented. The implementation of the NZ ETS has focussed on meeting New Zealand's international obligations between 2008 and 2012 at Minimum cost, and there is little evidence it has led to any reduction in greenhouse gas emissions or investment in new planted forests in New Zealand. The NZ ETS has been most effective at facilitating the transfer of international (Kyoto compliant) carbon credits from emitters to the New Zealand government. These credits have been used to partially meet New Zealand's obligations for the first Kyoto commitment period, allowing other units to be carried over to meet obligations from 2013 to 2020. The paper shows that participation in the NZ ETS is unlikely to contribute a long-term positive impact on profitability of commercial forestry, and that the liabilities created through participation in the NZ ETS do not assist the development of the forestry sector in New Zealand. The paper suggests that the NZ ETS is not the correct policy instrument to encourage carbon sequestration by planted forests. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The emission scenarios used by the IPCC and by mainstream climate scientists are largely derived from the predicted demand for fossil fuels, and in our view take insufficient consideration of the constrained emissions that are likely due to the depletion of these fuels. This paper, by contrast, takes a supplyside view of CO2 emission, and generates two supply-driven emission scenarios based on a comprehensive investigation of likely long-term pathways of fossil fuel production drawn from peer-reviewed literature published since 2000. The potential rapid increases in the supply of the non-conventional fossil fuels are also investigated. Climate projections calculated in this paper indicate that the future atmospheric CO2 concentration will not exceed 610 ppm in this century; and that the increase in global surface temperature will be lower than 2.6 degrees C compared to pre-industrial level even if there is a significant increase in the production of non-conventional fossil fuels. Our results indicate therefore that the IPCC's climate projections overestimate the upper-bound of climate change. Furthermore, this paper shows that different production pathways of fossil fuels use, and different climate models, are the two main reasons for the significant differences in current literature on the topic.

Moreover, in addition to aggregated market prices used in most studies, access to prices by retailer type allows investigation of different adjustment patterns by value chain. Using monthly average prices, the Johansen and consistent threshold cointegration models are estimated. The results indicate the presence of price transmission relationship and equilibrium adjustment asymmetries, such that agents only react to shocks when the deviation from equilibrium is above or below a certain nonzero threshold value. In most cases, retail outlets exercise market leadership in the Alaska pollock and cod chains while some bidirectional adjustments are observed in the salmon value chains. Overall, import prices adjust to deviations above the threshold value following a shock to the retail prices for Alaska pollock and cod. For salmon, deviations above the threshold value are generally not transmitted.","[Ankamah-Yeboah, Isaac] Univ Copenhagen, Nat & Biovidenskabelige Fak, Food & Resource Econ, Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Bronnmann, Julia] Univ Kiel, Dept Agr Econ, Wilhelm Seelig Pl 6-7, D-24118 Kiel, Germany",University of Copenhagen; University of Kiel,"Bronnmann, J (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Agr Econ, Wilhelm Seelig Pl 6-7, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.",julia.bronnmann@ae.uni-kiel.de,"Bronnmann, Julia/GPW-6997-2022; Ankamah-Yeboah, Isaac/O-3944-2019","Ankamah-Yeboah, Isaac/0000-0003-4587-8311; Bronnmann, Julia/0000-0003-4149-7589",,,,,51,11,11,0,21,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

The study of poverty and inequality is difficult when focusing only on the level of income, but this is complicated further when taking into consideration different measures of poverty. Another layer of complexity is added by the fact that the different regions of a country develop at various speeds and, as dissimilarities start to form between them, so does society reshape itself in different ways with various types of poverty becoming more important than others. As such, it becomes vital to understand which type of poverty is present in each region, in order to be able to decide and design an appropriate public policy. To this purpose, we have conducted a cluster analysis, meant to group Romanian counties by level of development, in order to account for the different types of poverty present in each region.

Rethinking requires facts so that a distinction may be made between the culture of Euro-pessimists, who see the European Union falling apart, and Euro-realists, optimists who base their positive assessments on facts. The facts are clear. The sure foundations for economic growth are in place, the product of investment is in place and the prospects for economic growth are assured. First contribution to future economic growth is European leadership in the Energy efficiency field. Remarkable foundations for cheaper energy, a rapidly expanding set of renewable energy resources and the prospects for European energy independence are described. A second contribution comes from the changing nature of politics in the European Union. Solidarity or the populism movement are shown morphing into a centrist movement of main stream parties as elections in the Netherlands and France have demonstrated. The need for socio-economic adjustment is recognized and underway. A third contribution is the hard earned case being made for the Euro. There is the recognition that that the Euro, an idea once ahead of its time, has caught up with the growth and gradual changes which have been taking place in Europe and which are impacting the quality of life for everyone in the European Union. Based on the facts considered, the prospects for the European Union are positive and prosperous. These are three of the Fair winds in European Sails.","[Cripps, Jeremy] Price Waterhouse Coopers, London, England; [Cripps, Jeremy] PriceWaterhouseCoopers, Cleveland, OH USA; [Cripps, Jeremy] Amer Univ, ACBSP Accredited Undergrad Business Program, Kuwait, Kuwait; [Cripps, Jeremy] Univ Findlay, Findlay, OH 45840 USA",American University of Kuwait; University System of Ohio; University of Findlay,"Cripps, J (通讯作者)，Price Waterhouse Coopers, London, England.;Cripps, J (通讯作者)，Univ Findlay, Findlay, OH 45840 USA.",,,,,,,,67,0,0,0,0,Univ Amer College Skopje,Skopje,"Treta Makedonska Brigada nr. 60,, Skopje, MACEDONIA",,,978-608-4607-39-7,,,,2017,,,,,,,67,80,,,,,,14,Demography; Economics; International Relations,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics; International Relations,BO5LL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000518175100005,0

We find that the intermediate-horizon momentum effect is stronger in industries with higher competition. This effect is consistent with the hypothesis that information contained in firms from highly competitive industries is vague and hence leaves more space for behavioral biases, which leads to the momentum effect. Alternatively, the measure of the Herfindahl-Hirschman index potentially captures the size effect in explaining this phenomenon. Moreover, concentrated industries experience a pronounced lead-lag effect of big firms on small firms, which is a potential explanation for the contrarian strategy. We do find that the short-horizon contrarian effect is pronounced in highly concentrated industries.","[Gong, Yujing] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Wenlan Sch Business, Nanhu Ave 182, Wuhan 430073, Peoples R China",Zhongnan University of Economics & Law,"Gong, YJ (通讯作者)，Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Wenlan Sch Business, Nanhu Ave 182, Wuhan 430073, Peoples R China.",gongyujingjing@163.com,,,,,,,43,6,6,2,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Due to small number of theoretical research on the influence of controlling in increase of insurance companies` efficacy in Croatia, this paper will address insurance market in Croatia, establish the link between a company's efficacy and liquidity, indebtedness and activity indicators over the period of seven years. The methods used are inductive and deductive, analysis and synthesis, compilation and comparative methods.","[Grubisic, Anita; Blace, Matija] Polytech Sibenik, Shibenik, Croatia",,"Grubisic, A (通讯作者)，Polytech Sibenik, Shibenik, Croatia.",anita@vus.hr; matijablace@gmail.com,,,,,,,7,1,1,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,322,330,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ2BZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418819000033,0

The data is generated from one cohort of students who were studying for an economics degree at a UK university. The selfevaluation exercise was introduced on two out-of-class essay assessments - one in the first year and one in the second year. Statistical analysis revealed that, on average, the students were significantly more accurate at self-evaluating the quality of their work in the second year than they had been in the first year. However there was considerable variation in this improvement. Those students who demonstrated the greatest improvement were firstly those who were awarded higher marks by the tutor for their second year essay and secondly, those who had been the least accurate at judging the quality of their first year essay. Other student characteristics such as different measures of student ability and gender had no significant impact on the changes in accuracy. However, there is no clear picture about what exactly is driving the improvement. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The recreational cod and haddock regulations implemented in 2014 have high costs in terms of foregone angler welfare and minimal positive impacts on stock conditions after three years.

In this context, trade facilitation, along with other policy measures, assumes critical importance, and even more so as India's exports have been experiencing negative growth for more than a year now. The success of the 'Make in India' to boost manufacturing sector depends on how successfully Indian firms are integrated with global value chains and on how successful they are in increasing their competitiveness by easing the measures of doing business and by attracting investment across sectors. At the core of all these is trade facilitation, along with other improvements in structural and policy measures.

There are not a lot of scientific references which deal with production overhead costs especially in the construction industry in the Czech Republic. The aim of the article is to optimize overhead costs for different types of productions. The paper focuses especially on the construction production with types of construction works such as roads, bridges, sewerage and others that are further analyzed. In the frame of the used methodology, it is necessary to divide constructions according to the nature of the works with description as accurate as possible. Constructions are divided according to the type of works and especially by the volume of work, as the construction of small-scale works have a problem with overhead production costs more often than companies of larger sizes. All this is presented on the basis of examples from the construction area of bridge, roads, sewerage constructions, etc. The result of the article is to allocate the value of individual overhead costs and provide more precise specification for individual construction contracts for which it is necessary to take account of the character (nature) of construction contracts.

This is an important question to consider when evaluating the efficacy of the WTO DSB. Although it may seem obvious that a successful dispute resolution through the DSB would remove trade barriers and increase trade, the ruling effects are not so straightforward, with recent empirical studies suggesting an unclear causality between the dispute resolutions and subsequent changes in trade. Using product and firm-level data, this article examines three WTO disputes over countervailing duties on Korean Dynamic Random Access Memory chips, which have raised similar legal issues but yielded different outcomes. By investigating the dynamics of firm behaviour over the course of disputes, our analysis sheds light on the difficulties of detecting changes in trade flows following rulings by the DSB. We conclude that cross-border trade flows are substantially affected by firm-and-market specific adjustments interacting with the current world trade environment, such as flexible reallocation of resources and promotion of a production network.","[Shin, Wonkyu] Korea Dev Inst, Ctr Int Dev, Seoul, South Korea; [Ahn, Dukgeun] Seoul Natl Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Seoul, South Korea",Korea Development Institute (KDI); Seoul National University (SNU),"Shin, W (通讯作者)，Korea Dev Inst, Ctr Int Dev, Seoul, South Korea.",wkshin@kdi.re.kr; dahn@snu.ac.kr,,,"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2015S1A3A2046224, NRF-2014S1A3A2043505]; Seoul National University Asia Center [SNUAC-2015-008]","Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); Seoul National University Asia Center","We are very grateful to Sungjoon Cho, Patrick Messerlin, Jee-Hyeong Park, Jung Hur, Jeffrey Bergstrand, Walter G.

Our results suggest that a combination of structural, financial, and institutional factors seem to exert a significant effect on Sukuk markets. Indeed, larger economic size, higher proportion of Muslims in the population, better investment profile (IP), and lower corruption are associated with larger Sukuk markets, while higher interest rate spread is negatively related to Sukuk market development.","[Smaoui, Houcem] Qatar Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, Doha, Qatar; [Khawaja, Mohsin] King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Coll Ind Management, Ctr Res Excellence Islamic Banking & Finance, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia",Qatar University; King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals,"Smaoui, H (通讯作者)，Qatar Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, Doha, Qatar.",hsmaoui@qu.edu.qa,,"Smaoui, Houcem/0000-0002-1603-5537",,,,,36,30,30,3,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The calculation of N2O emissions was performed according to the Tier 1 method of the IPCC using the BioGrace calculator based on the farm data of 2015 year. The total N2O emissions expressed in kg N2O per hectare were as follows: maize - 4, rape - 4.17, sugar beet - 4.3 and potato - 5.89. Direct N2O fluxes amounted to 3.09, 3.33, 3.23 and 4.3 kg N2O ha(-1), respectively for maize, sugar beet, rape and potato. It was found that growth of maize and rape cultivation area increased N2O emissions by 98 and 72 %, respectively. Whereas decline of sugar beet and potato area decreased N2O emissions by 37 and 49 %.

The purpose of this article is to attempt to transpose the concept of corporate social responsibility to the small to medium-sized enterprise sector, and to determine the main benefits of and barriers to the development of that idea in the strategies applied by business people with a particular focus on businesses in the voivodeship of Malopolska in Poland.","[Zuzek, Dagmara K.] Agr Univ Krakow, Fac Econ, Krakow, Poland",Agricultural University Krakow,"Zuzek, DK (通讯作者)，Agr Univ Krakow, Fac Econ, Krakow, Poland.",d.zuzek@ur.krakow.pl,,"Zuzek, Dagmara Katarzyna/0000-0002-7620-1621",,,,,15,0,0,0,5,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-260-6,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2017,,44,,,,,83,89,,,,,,7,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BI1NX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406529200010,0

This article studies the gap in length of transition to a first job between internal migrant and non-migrant youth in Uganda. According to the specific context of this developing country, three transition starting points are considered: date of birth, minimum legal working age and school exit. Extended Cox proportional hazard models suggest that migrants experience shorter transitions. However, when excluding child labourers or measuring school-to-work transitions, significant gaps disappear. Decomposition of transition length gaps reveals the importance of observable and unobservable factors related in particular to area of origin, gender and access to education.","[Boutin, Delphine] Univ Bordeaux, LAREFI, Bordeaux, France",Universite de Bordeaux,"Boutin, D (通讯作者)，Univ Bordeaux, LAREFI, Bordeaux, France.",delphine.boutin@u-bordeaux.fr,,,"French National Research Agency (ANR), through the programme Investissements d'avenir [ANR-10-LABX-14-01]; Foundation for Studies and Research on International Development (FERDI)","French National Research Agency (ANR), through the programme Investissements d'avenir; Foundation for Studies and Research on International Development (FERDI)","The author also acknowledges the support of the French National Research Agency (ANR), through the programme Investissements d'avenir ANR-10-LABX-14-01, and the Foundation for Studies and Research on International Development (FERDI).",,28,1,1,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-7780,1564-913X,,INT LABOUR REV,Int.

Covariate-adjusted parametric curves for time to progression, pre-progression survival, and post-progression survival were fitted based on patient-level data from two trials and long-term ipilimumab survival data. Indirect treatment comparisons between nivolumab, ipilimumab, and dacarbazine were informed by these covariate-adjusted parametric curves, controlling for differences in patient characteristics. Kaplan-Meier data from the literature were digitised and used to fit progression-free and overall survival curves for dabrafenib and vemurafenib. Patient utilities and resource use data were based on trial data or the literature. Patients are assumed to receive nivolumab until there is no further clinical benefit, assumed to be the first of progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, or 2years of treatment.ResultsNivolumab is the most cost-effective treatment option in BRAF mutation-negative and mutation-positive patients, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of 24,483 and 17,362 pound per quality-adjusted life year, respectively. The model results are most sensitive to assumptions regarding treatment duration for nivolumab and the parameters of the fitted parametric survival curves.Conclusions Nivolumab is a cost-effective treatment for advanced melanoma patients in England.","[Meng, Yang; Philips, Zoe; Roskell, Neil; Lee, Dawn] BresMed Hlth Solut, North Church House,84 Queen St, Sheffield S1 2DW, S Yorkshire, England; [Hertel, Nadine; Ellis, John; Morais, Edith] Bristol Myers Squibb Pharmaceut, Uxbridge, Middx, England; [Johnson, Helen] Helen Johnson Consulting Ltd, Welwyn Garden City, Herts, England; [Walker, Andrew] Univ Glasgow, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",Bristol-Myers Squibb; University of Glasgow,"Meng, Y (通讯作者)，BresMed Hlth Solut, North Church House,84 Queen St, Sheffield S1 2DW, S Yorkshire, England.",ymeng@bresmed.com,"lee, dawn/GRJ-7459-2022","Meng, Yang/0000-0003-1866-537X",Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals,Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals(Bristol-Myers Squibb),"Financial support for this study was provided entirely by a contract with Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals.

We show that the PH holds for high-capability firms, but not for low capability firms. Heterogeneous responses exist in innovation investment, but the average industry productivity increases. We obtain an interesting finding that adds a new feature to the PH.

Single-disease cost-of-illness studies cover only a few of the diseases affecting a population and in some cases lead to untenably large estimates. The objective of this study was to decompose healthcare spending in 2011, according to Swiss National Health Accounts, into 21 collectively exhaustive and mutually exclusive major disease categories. Diseases were classified following the Global Burden of Disease Study. We first assigned the expenditures directly mapping from National Health Accounts to the 21 diseases. The remaining expenditures were assigned based on diagnostic codes and clues contained in a variety of microdata sources. Expenditures were dominated by non-communicable diseases with a share of 79.4%. Cardiovascular diseases stood out with 15.6% of total spending, followed by musculoskeletal disorders (13.4%), and mental and substance use disorders (10.6%). Neoplasms (6.0% of the total) ranked only sixth, although they are the leading cause of premature death in Switzerland. These results may be useful for the design of health policies, as they illustrate how healthcare spending is influenced by the epidemiological transition and increasing life expectancy. They also provide a plausibility check for single cost-of-illness studies. Our study may serve as a starting point for further research on the drivers of the constant growth of healthcare spending.","[Wieser, Simon; Riguzzi, Marco; Pletscher, Mark] Zurich Univ Appl Sci, Winterthur Inst Hlth Econ, Gertrudstr 15, CH-8401 Winterthur, Switzerland; [Huber, Carola A.] Helsana Insurance Grp, Dept Hlth Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Telser, Harry] Polynomics, Olten, Switzerland; [Schwenkglenks, Matthias] Univ Zurich, Epidemiol Biostat & Prevent Inst, Zurich, Switzerland",Zurich University of Applied Sciences; University of Zurich,"Wieser, S (通讯作者)，Zurich Univ Appl Sci, Winterthur Inst Hlth Econ, Gertrudstr 15, CH-8401 Winterthur, Switzerland.",simon.wieser@zhaw.ch; marco.riguzzi@zhaw.ch; mark.pletscher@roche.com; carola.huber@helsana.ch; harry.telser@polynomics.ch; matthias.schwenkglenks@uzh.ch,"Wieser, Simon/AAC-1589-2022; Wieser, Simon/AAH-6581-2020","Pletscher, Mark/0000-0003-2134-4542; Schwenkglenks, Matthias/0000-0001-7217-1173; Wieser, Simon/0000-0003-1821-2944; Riguzzi, Marco/0000-0003-3056-351X",Swiss Federal Office of Public Health,Swiss Federal Office of Public Health,We thank the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health for funding a first version of this study and the Swiss Federal Office of Statistics for providing us with a large part of the data used.

However, elderly individuals and those sensitive to environmental issues respond positively toward such seafood. The latent class analysis revealed a consumer group that enthusiastically supports the disaster-affected region and has a higher willingness to buy products from the region.

The field of AI, and more broadly the development of artificial cognitive machines, is making breathtaking advances. A significant increase in computing power is enabling the rapid adoption of a new paradigm of AI, whereby cognitive machines are no longer programmed line by line, instruction by instruction, but instead are now capable of learning autonomously, thereby continuously developing themselves. The new paradigm is unleashing extraordinary progress in a wide range of applications, from healthcare to transportation and even the justice system; at the same time, these new forms of intelligence are making decisions in complex ways that escape the limits of human comprehension. The technological transformation driven by artificial cognitive machines is already beginning to have far reaching consequences, some unintended, at a scale and pace which exceeds even that of the first and second industrial revolutions. This paper aims to discuss these implications, both with an ontological and epistemological perspective, to assess the potential challenges for the systemic viability of democratic societies: a fundamental change in the nature of economic wealth creation, which could raise significant social tensions, combined with the paradoxical reduction in the effectiveness of human communication. It then explores the potential role of artificial cognitive machines to address its own challenges, introducing the idea of a future brain for public governance, understanding brain as an emergent property resulting from the interaction of human agents and AI systems created to address the priorities of social organizations.","[Casares, Alexandre Perez] Altius Soc Oxford, Oxford, England",,"Casares, AP (通讯作者)，Altius Soc Oxford, Oxford, England.",alex_perez@hks12.harvard.edu,,,,,,,59,17,19,2,78,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,OCT,2018,103.0,,,,SI,,5,16,,10.1016/j.futures.2018.05.002,0.0,,,12,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,GX1MR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447481900002,0

Novel evidence from Burkina Faso,HEALTH ECONOMICS REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Community-based targeting; Targeting; Ultra-poor; Pro-poor targeting; Activity-based costing; Burkina Faso; Costs; Economic evaluation,EQUITY; CARE,"Background: Targeting efforts aimed at increasing access to care for the poorest by reducing to a minimum or completely eliminating payments at point of use are increasingly being adopted across low and middle income countries, within the framework of Universal Health Coverage policies. No evidence, however, is available on the real cost of designing and implementing these efforts. Our study aimed to fill this gap in knowledge through the systematic assessment of both the financial and economic costs associated with designing and implementing a pro-poor community-based targeting intervention across eight districts in rural Burkina Faso. Methods: We conducted a partial retrospective economic evaluation (i.e. estimating costs, but not benefits) associated with the abovementioned targeting intervention. We adopted a health system perspective, including all costs incurred by the government and its development partners as well as costs incurred by the community when working as volunteers on behalf of government structures. To trace both financial and economic costs, we combined Activity-Based Costing with Resource Consumption Accounting. To this purpose, we consulted and extracted information from all relevant design/implementation documents and conducted additional key informant structured interviews to assess the resource consumption that was not valued in the documents. Results: For the entire community-based targeting intervention, we estimated a financial cost of USD 587,510 and an economic cost of USD 1,213,447. The difference was driven primarily by the value of the time contributed by the community. Communities carried the main economic burden. With a total of 102,609 ultra-poor identified, the financial cost and the economic cost per ultra-poor person were respectively USD 5,73 and USD 11,83. Conclusion: The study is first of its kind to accurately trace the financial and economic costs of a community-based targeting intervention aiming to identify the ultra-poor. The financial costs amounted to USD 5,73 and the economic costs to USD 11,83 per ultra-poor person identified. The financial costs of almost USD 6 represents 21% of the per capita government expenditure on health.","[Beauge, Yvonne; Koulidiati, Jean-Louis; De Allegri, Manuela] Heidelberg Univ, Fac Med, Inst Publ Hlth, Heidelberg, Germany; [Ridde, Valery] Univ Paris Sorbonne Cites, Univ Paris Descartes, IRD,SAGESUD, IRD French Inst Res Sustainable Dev,CEPED,ERL,INS, Paris, France; [Ridde, Valery] Univ Montreal, Publ Hlth Res Inst IRSPUM, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Robyn, Paul Jacob] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paris Cite; Universite de Montreal; The World Bank,"Beaugé, Y (通讯作者)，Heidelberg Univ, Fac Med, Inst Publ Hlth, Heidelberg, Germany.",yvonne.beauge@uni-heidelberg.de,"Ridde, Valery/AAD-2736-2019; ridde, valery/AAV-1016-2020","Ridde, Valery/0000-0001-9299-8266; ridde, valery/0000-0001-9299-8266; De Allegri, Manuela/0000-0002-8677-1337; Beauge, Yvonne/0000-0002-9658-2417","Research Group in Health Economics and Health Financing of the Institute of Public Health, Heidelberg University","Research Group in Health Economics and Health Financing of the Institute of Public Health, Heidelberg University","Data collection and YB's position for the duration of the study were funded directly by the Research Group in Health Economics and Health Financing of the Institute of Public Health, Heidelberg University.",,41,6,6,0,5,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

Estimates of intergenerational schooling persistence from two data sets show that the intergenerational regression coefficient, the most widely used measure, is severely biased downward in coresident samples. But the bias in intergenerational correlation is much smaller and is less sensitive to the coresidency rate. The paper provides explanations for these results.

Reanalyses from six states,ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Accountability; Heterogeneity; Teacher training,OUTCOMES; HETEROGENEITY,"At least sixteen US states have taken steps toward holding teacher preparation programs (TPPs) accountable for teacher value-added to student test scores. Yet it is unclear whether teacher quality differences between TPPs are large enough to make an accountability system worthwhile. Several statistical practices can make differences between TPPs appear larger and more significant than they are. We reanalyze TPP evaluations from 6 states-New York, Louisiana, Missouri, Washington, Texas, and Florida-using appropriate methods implemented by our new caterpillar command for Stata. Our results show that teacher quality differences between most TPPs are negligible-.01-0.03 standard deviations in student test scores-even in states where larger differences were reported previously. While ranking all a state's TPPs is not useful, in some states and subjects we can find a single TPP whose teachers are significantly above or below average. Such exceptional TPPs may reward further study.","[von Hippel, Paul T.] Univ Texas Austin, LBJ Sch Publ Affairs, 2315 Red River,Box Y, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Bellows, Laura] Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Box 90239, Durham, NC 27708 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Duke University,"von Hippel, PT (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, LBJ Sch Publ Affairs, 2315 Red River,Box Y, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",paulvonhippel.utaustin@gmail.com,"Bellows, Laura/AAS-6882-2021","Bellows, Laura/0000-0003-4388-0696; von Hippel, Paul/0000-0003-4498-4374","Policy Research Institute at the University of Texas, Austin","Policy Research Institute at the University of Texas, Austin","This research was supported by a grant from the Policy Research Institute at the University of Texas, Austin.",,33,11,28,0,16,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0272-7757,1873-7382,,ECON EDUC REV,Econ.

Based on this, the study estimates carbon sequestration supply function for African countries. The study shows that majority of the selected countries have their cost of carbon sequestration estimated at $14 per ton per ha. Botswana and Congo DRC represent African countries with high cost of carbon sequestration with $16.75 and $16.77 respectively. Nigeria however, has her average cost of carbon sequestration as low as $6.82. The regression result shows that carbon sequestration supply (p < 0.01), deforestation (p < 0.01) and forest area (p < 0.01) are the factors influencing cost of carbon sequestration among the sub-Saharan African countries. The overall marginal cost which is the cost per unit land area required to drive land use change towards carbon sequestration was estimated at $13.30 per ton/ha in Africa. Nigeria, Mali and Chad however, show a relatively low marginal cost of $7.0, $8.0 and $9.0 respectively. The study however suggests that positive land use characteristics should be encourage among countries in Africa, particularly in Nigeria with the least marginal cost of carbon sequestration. This will help in reducing cost of carbon sequestration and thereby lowering the global effect of climate change.","[Adetoye, Ayoade Matthew; Okojie, Luke O.; Akerele, Dare] Fed Univ Agr Abeokuta, Dept Agr Econ & Farm Management, PMB 2240, Abeokuta, Ogun State, Nigeria","University of Agriculture, Abeokuta","Adetoye, AM (通讯作者)，Fed Univ Agr Abeokuta, Dept Agr Econ & Farm Management, PMB 2240, Abeokuta, Ogun State, Nigeria.",adetoyeam@funaab.edu.ng,,"Adetoye, Ayoade/0000-0001-6633-6402; Akerele, Dare/0000-0003-4725-035X; Okojie, Luke Ojesebhebho/0000-0001-8981-7700",,,,,40,9,9,3,62,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,MAY,2018,90.0,,,,,,59,66,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.01.007,0.0,,,8,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GD8MK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430766300008,0

Billing data were used to document hospital costs. Resource use during the follow-up period was collected through phone interviews at month 1, 3 and 6. Descriptive statistics and multivariate analyses were performed. We used generalized linear models with log-link functions to estimate parameters associated with hospital and follow-up costs of patients. Five hundred twenty-four patients were enrolled in 40 public centers from October 2011 to April 2014. Average age was 63 (SD 17); 55.0% of them were male. Average length of stay was 15 days (SD 23). Average cost of stay for the French Sickness Fund was a,notsign7293 (SD a,notsign7363). Average cost of follow-up was a,notsign1242 (SD a,notsign3000) and decreased steadily through time. When controlling for patient's socioeconomic characteristics, severity of disease and hospital stay, results showed a concave relationship between hospital costs and age. Obesity, the severity of the disease and comorbidities were associated with constantly increasing inpatient costs. Concerning follow-up costs, we found the same concave relationship with age, while gender, a history of pneumonia and severity of the disease were the most important predictors of high costs after discharge. Pneumocost is the first French study providing a robust estimation of the cost of managing invasive pneumococcal pneumonia in the French context.","[Saba, Grece; Andrade, Luiz Flavio; de Pouvourville, Gerard] ESSEC Business Sch, Ave Bernard Hirsch, F-95021 Cergy Pontoise, France; [Gaillat, Jacques; Bonnin, Pierre] CH Annecy Genevois, Annecy, France; [Chidiac, Christian] Hosp Civils Lyon, Hop Croix Rousse, Lyon, France; [Illes, Hajnal-Gabriela; Laurichesse, Henri] CHU Clermont Ferrand, Hop Gabriel Montpied, Clermont Ferrand, France; [Messika, Jonathan; Ricard, Jean-Damien] Hop Louis Mourier, AP HP, Serv Reanimat Med Chirurg, 178 Rue Renouillers, F-92700 Colombes, France; [Detournay, Bruno] CEMKA EVAL, Bourg La Reine, France; [Petitpretz, Patrick] Hop Andre Mignot, Versailles, France; [Messika, Jonathan; Ricard, Jean-Damien] INSERM, IAME, UMR 1137, F-75018 Paris, France; [Messika, Jonathan; Ricard, Jean-Damien] Univ Paris Diderot, IAME, UMR 1137, Sorbonne Paris Cite, F-75018 Paris, France",ESSEC Business School; Centre Hospitalier Annecy Genevois; CHU Lyon; CHU Clermont Ferrand; Universite Paris Cite; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Louis-Mourier - APHP; Centre Hospitalier de Versailles; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Cite,"Andrade, LF; de Pouvourville, G (通讯作者)，ESSEC Business Sch, Ave Bernard Hirsch, F-95021 Cergy Pontoise, France.",andrade@essec.edu; pouvourville@essec.edu,"Andrade, Luiz Felipe/N-1506-2018","Andrade, Luiz Felipe/0000-0002-4868-737X",Pfizer France,Pfizer France(Pfizer),This study received an unrestricted research grant from Pfizer France.,,25,8,8,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Under the global threat of terrorism and in the climate of 'postfactual' politics and large political changes, the trust in western political systems has severely been shaken. It is within this climate that deliberating the future of one of the most important international relationships, namely that between the European Union and the People's Republic of China, is urgently required. Using the methodology of several scenario workshops working from the identification of key drivers by international experts to developing several scenarios based on combinations of these drivers, this research ties into current future studies. Three scenarios were chosen and their 'histories of the future' reflect the outlook of an economically and politically strengthened China vis-a-vis the European Union, while differences remain on the benefits and losses implied for European countries depending on their ability to stay united within the European Union. The role of the US and the trilateral relationship emerges as an important determinant of the bilateral relationship as well. The driver of technological leadership, however, is the area in which European policy is most able to influence and adapt to the changes implied by the three scenarios.","[Gabriel, Johannes] Foresight Intelligence, Donaustr 6, D-12043 Berlin, Germany; [Schmelcher, Susanne] Independent Energy Expert Focus China, Berlin, Germany",,"Gabriel, J (通讯作者)，Foresight Intelligence, Donaustr 6, D-12043 Berlin, Germany.",susanne.schmelcher@gmail.com,,,,,,,7,8,10,0,25,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,MAR,2018,97.0,,,,SI,,26,34,,10.1016/j.futures.2017.07.001,0.0,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,GA7AD,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428485900004,0

Salience stimulates extra donations for the NGO, and thus firms have incentives to hide the damage they do in order to avoid public attention. We show that when public attention is scarce, a greater campaign orientation induces industry to invest in greater obfuscation, starving the NGO of funds. The NGO in turn strategically biases its mission away from campaigns and in favor of sector-wide versus firm-specific campaigns but not by as much as a welfare-motivated planner would want. When public attention is avoided by a mixture of substantive and symbolic action, we show that a greater weight on the former induces the NGO to become more campaign-oriented, with social damage lower. Highly competitive industries have greater incentives to commit to substantive actions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

To enhance the co-benefits of forest conservation, it is important to promote synergies among the three measures mitigation, adaptation, and biodiversity/ecosystem conservation in the forest sector and eliminate the overlaps among the three measures. However, limited research exists on the analysis of their synergies. This study explores the potential for synergy among the three forest sector measures, utilizing: 1) indicators that assess enabling conditions for synergies among the three measures at the different institutional levels of policies and strategies, institutional arrangements, and financing and programs/projects; and 2) case studies of five countries in Southeast Asia: Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, Lao PDR, and Cambodia. This analysis shows that the five countries all require various changes at different institutional levels in order to enhance their synergy potentials. The findings indicate the importance of national actors, financial mechanisms, programs, and projects in addressing the three measures. In terms of national actors, Thailand has the highest synergy potential due to its national-level committees and a single ministry that addresses all three measures. To enhance their synergy potentials, the other countries need to create national-level committees that address the three measures, and/or they need to enhance collaboration between the various ministries that represent the environment and forestry issues. At the financing and program/project aspects, Vietnam has the highest synergy potential. The other four countries need to develop common national funds that finance the three measures and/or develop joint programs and projects that address the three measures simultaneously.","[Morita, Kanako] Forestay & Forest Prod Res Inst, 1 Matsunosato, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058687, Japan; [Matsumoto, Ken'ichi] Nagasaki Univ, 1-14 Bunkyo Machi, Nagasaki 8528521, Japan",Nagasaki University,"Morita, K (通讯作者)，Forestay & Forest Prod Res Inst, 1 Matsunosato, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058687, Japan.",kanakomorita@ffpri.affrc.go.jp; kenichimatsu@nagasaki-u.ac.jp,"Matsumoto, Ken'ichi/AFZ-9881-2022","Matsumoto, Ken'ichi/0000-0002-9349-9765",Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment in Japan [S-14]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K16161] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment in Japan; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This research was supported by grants from S-14 of the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment in Japan.,,35,12,15,1,34,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,FEB,2018,87.0,,,,,,59,69,,10.1016/j.forpol.2017.10.013,0.0,,,11,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,FU1WK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000423640000006,0

In response to these shortcomings, a new wave of approaches has emerged based on the idea that societal systems are irreducibly complex. The new categories that are thereby introduced - like complex or wicked - suffer, however, by a lack of shared understanding. We here aim to reduce this confusion by developing a meta-ontological map of types of systems that have the potential to overwhelm us: characteristic types of problems, attributions of function, manners of design and governance, and generating and maintaining processes and phenomena. This permits us, in a new way, to outline an inner anatomy of the motley collection of system types that we tend to call complex. Wicked problems here emerge as the product of an ontologically distinct and describable type of system that blends dynamical and organizational complexity. The framework is intended to provide systematic meta theoretical support for approaching complexity and wickedness in policy and design. We also points to a potential causal connection between innovation and wickedness as a basis for further theoretical improvement.","[Andersson, Claes; Tornberg, Petter] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Space Earth & Environm, Div Phys Resource Theory, Complex Syst Grp, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Tornberg, Petter] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Sociol, POb 15508, NL-1001 NA Amsterdam, Netherlands",Chalmers University of Technology; University of Amsterdam,"Andersson, C (通讯作者)，Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Space Earth & Environm, Div Phys Resource Theory, Complex Syst Grp, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden.",claeand@chalmers.se,,"Andersson, Claes/0000-0003-1457-3240; Tornberg, Petter/0000-0001-8722-8646",Technology Governance in Energy Transitions Profile of the Energy Areas of Advance at Chalmers University of Technology; European Commission H FETPROACT- Action ODYCCEUS [732942]; Swedish Research Council Formas [942-2015-124],Technology Governance in Energy Transitions Profile of the Energy Areas of Advance at Chalmers University of Technology; European Commission H FETPROACT- Action ODYCCEUS; Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas),"Funding was provided by the Technology Governance in Energy Transitions Profile of the Energy Areas of Advance at Chalmers University of Technology, by European Commission H2020 FETPROACT-2016 Action ODYCCEUS (grant no. 732942), and by the Swedish Research Council Formas, grant #942-2015-124.

We describe these factors as resources for fertility and parenting. The paper presents the results of content analysis of Russia's Demographic Policy Concept and analysis of official regional statistics for 2015-2016. We carried out a correlational analysis between the total fertility rate and variables that describe fertility and parenting resources. Our results are the next: 1) Russia recognises economic, infrastructural, reproductive, temporal, informational resources for fertility and parenting; 2) Russian regions are noticeably differentiated as regards the presence and use of these resources; 3) there is no correlation between regional birth rates and indicators that show the presence and use of these resources. Our results show that the differentiation of Russian regions by the availability and use of fertility and parenting resources is not linked to regional fertility differentiation. This raises questions about the effectiveness of increasing and further using such resources as demographic policy measures.","[Bagirova, Anna; Shubat, Oksana] Ural Fed Univ, Mira St 19, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia",Ural Federal University,"Bagirova, A (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, Mira St 19, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia.",a.p.bagirova@urfu.ru; o.m.shubat@urfu.ru,"Bagirova, Anna/M-7440-2013; Shubat, Oksana/M-7443-2013","Bagirova, Anna/0000-0001-5653-4093; Shubat, Oksana/0000-0002-0929-8144",President of Russian Federation [NSh-3429.2018.6],President of Russian Federation,"The article is processed as one of the outputs of the research project Fertility and parenting in Russian regions: models, invigoration strategies, forecasts, supported by the President of Russian Federation, project no.

The general aim is to disentangle the role of the macro-contexts by analysing the influence of a series of institutional factors on the speed of the school-to-work transition and the prestige of the first relevant job. The influence of the vocational orientation of the educational systems, the employment protection legislation and the product market regulation are theoretically considered and empirically evaluated. Relying on micro-data from the 2009 Ad Hoc Module of the European Labour Survey, we disentangle the role of long-term institutional settings and the influence of short-term institutional changes. Moreover, we test for a possible institutional macro-level trade-off between speed and quality of the school-to-work transition. Finally, we find evidence of significant interactions between the employment protection and vocational orientation of the educational system and between product-and labour market regulation.","[Barbieri, Paolo; Cutuli, Giorgio; Passaretta, Giampiero] Univ Trento, Dept Sociol & Social Res, Via Verdi 26, I-38122 Trento, Italy",University of Trento,"Passaretta, G (通讯作者)，Univ Trento, Dept Sociol & Social Res, Via Verdi 26, I-38122 Trento, Italy.",giampiero.passaretta@unitn.it,"BARBIERI, PAOLO/X-2531-2019; Passaretta, Giampiero/J-7270-2019","BARBIERI, PAOLO/0000-0002-5493-6029; Passaretta, Giampiero/0000-0003-1706-1216",European Research Council under the European ERC Grant [StG-263183],European Research Council under the European ERC Grant(European Research Council (ERC)),Financial support from the European Research Council under the European ERC Grant Agreement No. StG-263183 (Families of Inequalities-FamIne) is gratefully acknowledged.

This study considers hedging the spot price uncertainty with salmon futures contracts. It uses a new framework of hedging under square loss, consisting of a new objective function, an optimal hedge ratio and a measure of hedging effectiveness. The new framework aims at minimizing the expected squared forecast error. It generalizes the classical minimum variance hedging as it relaxes the assumption of known expected prices. The salmon futures contracts deliver satisfactory hedging performance, albeit constrained by low liquidity. Therefore, I suggest holding the contract through maturity rather than closing the futures and the spot positions simultaneously. This strategy alleviates the liquidity issue and saves transaction costs. All things considered, hedging with salmon futures is a moderately effective way of handling the salmon price uncertainty.","[Bloznelis, Daumantas] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Res Ctr Operat Res & Business Stat, Leuven, Belgium; [Bloznelis, Daumantas] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Sch Business & Econ, As, Norway",KU Leuven; Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Bloznelis, D (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Res Ctr Operat Res & Business Stat ORSTAT, Naamsestr 69 Box 3555, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",dbloznelis@gmail.com,,,,,,,47,10,10,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

The empirical analysis is based upon discrete choice experiments with 485 participants from northern Germany. A mixed logit estimation reveals a strong positive effect of ecolabeled seafood and the results indicate that respondents are willing to pay more for wild-caught fish than farmed fish. The analysis provides more interesting results: Consumers' attitude toward frozen fish is quite negative despite the fact that this is the best-selling processed form on the German fish market. Furthermore, socioeconomic characteristics have limited influence on the purchase decision of respondents.

The firm decides whether to locate irreversibly in a cluster or in isolation. In the cluster the firm benefits from inward spillovers from its competitors, but also generates outward spillovers. If the firm chooses to locate in isolation no knowledge flows occur. All firms' production costs are determined by their knowledge stocks, which evolve over time due to own R&D investments and potentially inward spillovers. It is shown that, if absorptive capacity is constant, the incentive to locate in the cluster decreases with respect to the firm's knowledge stock. Conversely, if absorptive capacity depends positively on knowledge stock, the firm's incentive to join the cluster is larger the more knowledge it has. It is also shown that qualitative properties of the equilibrium paths of R&D investments and knowledge stocks differ substantially depending on whether absorptive capacities are constant or knowledge dependent.","[Colombo, Luca] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Econ & Finance, Largo Gemelli 1, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Dawid, Herbert] Bielefeld Univ, Dept Business Adm & Econ, POB 100131, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany; [Dawid, Herbert] Bielefeld Univ, Ctr Math Econ, POB 100131, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; University of Bielefeld; University of Bielefeld,"Dawid, H (通讯作者)，Bielefeld Univ, Dept Business Adm & Econ, POB 100131, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany.;Dawid, H (通讯作者)，Bielefeld Univ, Ctr Math Econ, POB 100131, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany.",lucava.colombo@unicatt.it; hdawid@wiwi.uni-bielefeld.de,,"Dawid, Herbert/0000-0002-8536-9960","COST Action The EU in the new economic complex geography: models, tools and policy evaluation [IS1104]","COST Action The EU in the new economic complex geography: models, tools and policy evaluation","Financial support under COST Action IS1104 The EU in the new economic complex geography: models, tools and policy evaluation is gratefully acknowledged.",,24,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,978-3-319-65627-4; 978-3-319-65626-7,SPRINGER PR COMPLEX,,,2018,,,,,,,159,177,,10.1007/978-3-319-65627-4_9,0.0,,,19,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL4WU,,"Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450927000009,0

The main objectives of the research are the following: to evaluate the need for the green bonds as instruments, fostering the sustainability of economy; to identify the determinants of both green bonds related and green investment; to analyze the green bond yields and prices in comparison to non-green bonds; to estimate the perspective volatility of the green bonds price. Green bonds characteristics were compared against characteristics of the non-green bonds. Covariation and regression based analysis was used for the identification of green investment determinants. Variance was estimated in the assessment of bond price volatility. The results showed that price of both green bonds and non-green bonds has tendency to fluctuate in the similar trend; green bond appeal determinants are in coherence with the determinants of green investment; green bonds tend to be less volatile than non-green bonds. It is concluded that the use of green bonds has significant potential to add to the sustainability of the economy.","[Draksaite, Aura; Kazlauskiene, Vilma] Kaunas Univ Technol, Dept Finance, Kaunas, Lithuania; [Melnyk, Leonid] Sumy State Univ, Econ & Business Adm Dept, Sumy, Ukraine",Kaunas University of Technology; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Sumy State University,"Draksaite, A (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Dept Finance, Kaunas, Lithuania.",aura.draksaite@ktu.lt; vilma.kazlauskiene@ktu.lt,"Melnyk, Leonid/AAP-7380-2021; Kazlauskienė, Vilma/JZT-6390-2024","Kazlauskienė, Vilma/0000-0003-0295-6543",Research Council of Lithuania,Research Council of Lithuania(Research Council of Lithuania (LMTLT)),This research was funded by a grant (No. TAP LU-4-2016) from the Research Council of Lithuania.,,22,4,4,29,132,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-76288-3; 978-3-319-76287-6,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2018,9.0,,,,,,221,230,,10.1007/978-3-319-76288-3_16,0.0,,,10,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO7XE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000525862100016,0

In the GATT/WTO system, science has been elevated as the ultimate arbiter of international trade disputes. This article intends to critically evaluate, and re-conceptualize, the role of science in distinguishing disguised trade protectionism and legitimate government regulation. Drawing insights from psychology and behavioural science, the article first sets forth two normative principles that should be followed where science is to be used as an arbiter in trade disputes. It then proceeds to examine to what extent the current WTO case law has deviated from these normative principles. The article concludes that WTO Members enjoy wide discretion to address pervasive scientific uncertainty. Nevertheless, it remains possible that a rigorous use of science will bring WTO rules into direct conflict with national democracy in some highly value-laden and politically sensitive disputes.","[Du, Ming] Univ Surrey, Sch Law, Chinese & Comparat Law, Guildford, Surrey, England",University of Surrey,"Du, M (通讯作者)，Univ Surrey, Sch Law, Chinese & Comparat Law, Guildford, Surrey, England.",m.du@surrey.ac.uk,"Du, ming/JAD-2238-2023",,,,,,69,1,1,0,0,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Empirical results suggest that the availability of a bikeshare reduces traffic congestion upwards of 4% within a neighborhood.

This paper contributes to the creation of the first version of documents of work standardisation. The adoption of these standards reduces process variability. The new team member work balance chart offers a balanced result, which removes the detected bottlenecks. The paper presents the development of a specific process improvement project.

A comparative analysis is performed on the types of excise tax rates on alcoholic beverages in Russia and the EU member states. The author finds that in Russia, low-alcohol beer (over 0.5%) and strong beer (under 8.6%) are taxed at the same rate (expressed a rubles per liter). The author substantiates her argument that beer tax rates in Russia should vary depending on alcohol content, as is the case with other alcohol-containing products.

Two particular methods include a robust correlation coefficient based on the least weighted squares regression and the minimum weighted covariance determinant estimator, where the latter allows to estimate the mean and covariance matrix of multivariate data. New tools are proposed allowing to test hypotheses about these robust estimators or to estimate their variance. The techniques considered in the paper include resampling approaches with or without replacement, i.e. permutation tests, bootstrap variance estimation, and bootstrap confidence intervals. The performance of the newly described tools is illustrated on numerical examples. They reveal the suitability of the robust procedures also for non-contaminated data, as their confidence intervals are not much wider compared to those for standard maximum likelihood estimators. While resampling without replacement turns out to be more suitable for hypothesis testing, bootstrapping with replacement yields reliable confidence intervals but not corresponding hypothesis tests.","[Kalina, Jan] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Comp Sci, Vodarenskou Vezi 4, Prague 18208 8, Czech Republic; [Kalina, Jan] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Vodarenskou Vezi 2, Prague 18207 8, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Computer Science of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Theory & Automation of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Kalina, J (通讯作者)，Czech Acad Sci, Inst Comp Sci, Vodarenskou Vezi 4, Prague 18208 8, Czech Republic.;Kalina, J (通讯作者)，Czech Acad Sci, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Vodarenskou Vezi 2, Prague 18207 8, Czech Republic.",kalina@cs.cas.cz,"Kalina, Jan/E-4287-2012","Kalina, Jan/0000-0002-8491-0364",Czech Science Foundation [17-07384S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),The work was supported by the project 17-07384S of the Czech Science Foundation.,,15,0,0,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,770,779,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400077,0

Gone are the days of contracts with fixed targets. Problems are named and outlined. Changes in the approach to PM and the transfer of self-responsibility to teams through agile processes such as Scrum, eXtreme Programming, Crystal or Kanban have already been introduced 12 years ago. This already had serious effects in communication. Furthermore, the approach of the anti-fragility claims in addition to the ability to communicate co-operation, readiness and assumption of responsibility. In this paper, we focus our discussion on changes in PM on the antifragility approach and address the tasks to be tackled in the change process from the transition from agile to anti fragile approaches. First of all, the question is which requirements are to be placed on these supporting instruments for PM and which boundary conditions must be taken into account. Are new success factors to be considered in the new PM? How do we deal with internationalization? How about virtual worlds? How about the demand for mobility? And what is the impact of increasing multicultural diversity? Are disadvantages of the previous PM minimized or are they completely eliminated? Do disadvantages have to be accepted? Which? Who are the winners in the use of our newly developed anti fragile PM? Is it financeable? In order to answer these questions, we deal intensively with the evaluation of existing methods and techniques. Because of projects that are rated as critical - this so far concerned quality, legality, financing, time and benefits - require the special attention of top management our new recognized factors have to be included in the evaluation of a crisis to obtain a better benefit of a project.","[Kuhn, Elvira] Univ Appl Sci, D-54294 Trier, Germany",,"Kuhn, E (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci, D-54294 Trier, Germany.",e.kuhn@hochschule-trier.de,,,,,,,17,0,0,1,5,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,1119,1130,,,,,,12,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200095,0

When the threshold value is lower than the first threshold, it shows a negative effect; the higher the employment proportion of the tertiary industry, the more significant positive effect of the spillover; human capital and research and development stock are two other important factors to promote regional technology level. Both eastern and western regions have FDI spillover threshold effect based on the proportion of employment in the tertiary industry.

In this method, through adding some weaker coalition monotonicity-like conditions, it is proven that egalitarian Shapley value is monotonic and non-decreasing. Hence, the IV egalitarian Shapley value of IV cooperative games can be directly obtained by determining its lower and upper bounds, respectively. The method proposed in this paper does not use the Moore's interval subtraction and hereby can effectively avoid the issues resulted from it. Furthermore, some important properties of the IV egalitarian Shapley values of IV cooperative games are discussed.

It gradually evolves from activities such as ancient Chinese study tour to modern study. The ancient saying of reading thousands of books and traveling thousands of miles is often lingering around the ear. The ancients have already summed up the true meaning of learning. Learning should not only learn the knowledge in books, but also combine practice with what they have learned. Confucius can be regarded as the first person to study and recruit lecturers. The disciples traveled around the country and preached the disciples. The disciples followed him to visit Dutong, and realized life from the dilemma, broaden their horizons, and understand the folk customs. In 2013, the State Council first proposed the term study travel in the document (National Leisure Travel Program). In December 2016, the Ministry of Education and other 11 departments jointly issued the Opinions on Promoting the Study of Primary and Secondary School Students, including the admission of research and teaching activities. Since then, Study Travel has officially entered national vision and has been talked about by many educators. Confucianism is one of the 100 masterpieces of the pre-Qin philosophers. His thoughts are inclusive and have a profound influence on China, Southeast Asia and the world. This thesis combines the Confucian core thought the doctrine of the mean to understand the guiding significance of Confucianism for the study tour under the condition of Confucianism and justice.","[Liu Guorui] China Jiliang Univ, 258 Xueyuan St,Higher Educ Pk, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",China Jiliang University,"Liu, GR (通讯作者)，China Jiliang Univ, 258 Xueyuan St,Higher Educ Pk, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,5,1,1,0,3,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-642-6,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2018,290.0,,,,,,31,33,,,,,,3,Economics; Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BM5QX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000465421000009,0

The calculations and tabular depiction of the number, structure and pace of liquidation have been confronted with the strategies pursued by the owners of enterprises as regards financial management and economic activity opportunities.

Elbasan ranked third by the availability of agricultural land in the country after Fier and Korca (72,872 ha or 10.4% of the agricultural land area at country level). Despite the size of the agricultural land area, it should be considered that a good part of it lies in hilly and mountainous part especially in Librazhd and Gramsh districts. Besides construction and development services, there is observed a growing trend of agricultural activity especially in terms of olive and vegetables cultivation in open field and greenhouses. In this region operate about 32,439 farms. The average farm family size is 4.9 persons, while the national average farm size is 4.5 persons (MAFCP, 2012). The farm typology was determined using nine indicators. Based on these indicators are identified the following type of cluster/typology for Elbasani district: poly-culture for market; livestock; leisure farms; fruit trees; arable crop farm; self-sufficiency. The farm performance was determined using factors productivity which reveals that farms that belong to the poly-culture for market, livestock and self-sufficient clusters are performing better than other clusters.","[Meco, Maksim; Kapaj, Ilir; Tomorri, Ilir] Agr Univ Tirana, Fac Econ & Agribusiness, Tirana, Albania",,"Meço, M; Kapaj, I; Tomorri, I (通讯作者)，Agr Univ Tirana, Fac Econ & Agribusiness, Tirana, Albania.",mmeco@ubt.edu.al; ikapaj@ubtedu.al; itomorri@ubt.edu.al,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,4,Warsaw Univ Life Sciences Pr,Warsaw,"Nowoursynowska 166, Warsaw, POLAND",,,978-83-7583-803-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,59,67,,10.22630/ESARE.2018.2.6,0.0,,,9,Development Studies; Economics; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Geography,BO1TO,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000502418600006,0

And the common finding of positive effects of a good health on labour market participation, productivity and wages has been supported by strong evidence. On the other hand, the inverse relationship - the effect of labour market participation on health status -has been less studied. Moreover, the issue has benefited of little attention in Romania. Our paper explores the bidirectional relationship between self-perceived health and labour market outcomes in Romania using a simultaneous equations model. We use EU-SILC data for Romania, the sample being representative for the whole population and consisting of approximately 17 thousand of individuals aged 16 and more. We find that health has a positive influence on labour market participation and incomes, but labour market participation has an adverse effect on health. The results show that individuals do not underreport their health status to justify non-participation. In conclusion, health is endogenous to labour market participation and should be treated as so, otherwise the effects of health on labour market status could be underestimated.","[Militaru, Eva] Natl Sci Res Inst Labour & Social Protect, Bucharest, Romania; [Vasilescu, Maria Denisa; Cristescu, Amalia] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Popescu, Madalina Ecaterina] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Natl Sci Res Inst Labour & Social Protect, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Militaru, E (通讯作者)，Natl Sci Res Inst Labour & Social Protect, Bucharest, Romania.",militaru@incsmps.ro; mariadenisa.vasilescu@gmail.com; cristescuamalia@gmail.com; madalina.andreica@gmail.com,"Popescu, Madalina Ecaterina/F-8696-2011; Popescu, Madalina Ecaterina/AAK-8233-2020","Popescu, Madalina Ecaterina/0000-0002-0589-4010",,,,,32,2,2,0,7,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

We discuss an evolving ecology of 'external' research taking place 'between' the academy and commercial consultancy. We then contextualise this as waves of research methodologies and consultancy for the cultural sector. The new model of 'external between' consultancy research for policy is not only placed between the University and the market, but also facilitates discourse between policy sectors, government, the media and the academy. Specifically, it enables seductive but selective arguments for advocacy that claim authority through academic affiliation, yet are not evaluated for robustness. To critically engage with an emergent form of what Stone calls 'causal stories', we replicate a publicly funded externally commissioned SROI model that argues for the value of cultural activities to well-being. We find that the author's operationalisation of participation and well-being are crucial, yet their representation of the relationship problematic, and their estimates questionable. This case study 're-performs' econometric modelling national-level survey data for the cultural sector to reveal practices that create norms of expertise for policy-making that are not rigorous. We conclude that fluid claims to authority allow experimental econometric models and measures to perform across the cultural economy as if ratified. This new model of advocacy research requires closer academic consideration given the changing research funding structures and recent attention to expertise and the contracting out of public services.","[Oman, Susan] Univ Manchester, Dept Sociol, Arthur Lewis Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Taylor, Mark] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield Methods Inst, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Manchester; University of Sheffield,"Oman, S (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Dept Sociol, Arthur Lewis Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",susan.oman@manchester.ac.uk,,"Oman, Susan/0000-0002-5723-0830; Taylor, Mark/0000-0001-5943-9796",Arts and Humanities Research Council's Connected Communities Large Project [AH/J005401/1]; AHRC [AH/J005401/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Arts and Humanities Research Council's Connected Communities Large Project; AHRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),"This work was supported by the Arts and Humanities Research Council's Connected Communities Large Project funding for Understanding Everyday Participation: Articulating Cultural Values, 2012-2017 [grant number AH/J005401/1].",,71,19,19,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

In this regard, it focuses on the specific problem: difficulties in collecting evidence when it comes to corruption. To overcome this problem, special investigation techniques are used. Two of them are of a significant value: the use of undercover investigators and the simulations of giving and receiving a bribe. However, there is a potential risk of entering in punishable stage - incitement to commission of an offence. In order to avoid this risk as well as to enable the conviction of perpetrators, it is necessary to analyse the separation line between incitement and legitimate actions under investigator's authority.

The metrics that should be used to evaluate the success of a chatbot are not systematized nor unified One way to solve this problem is to align the metrics to the different perspectives of the chatbot evaluation: user experience perspective, information retrieval perspective, linguistic perspective, technology perspective and business perspective. In order to build the evaluation framework, the following categories of chatbot should be analyzed: usability, performance, affect, satisfaction, accuracy, accessibility, efficiency, quality, quantity, relation, manner, grammatical accuracy, humanity and business value.

Smoking is a feminist issue: there are unique consequences for women's health, well-being, and agency. Recently passed anti-smoking legislation in Nepal, which has the highest rate of women smokers in South Asia, omits gender-conscious recommendations, potentially diminishing the impact of the legislation on women's lives. Relying on the 2001, 2006, and 2011 waves of the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey, this paper expands the dialogue around women's smoking and places it at the forefront of research on women's health issues. The results indicate that for women in Nepal, formal education and visiting a health facility mitigate smoking behaviors, whereas being employed and living in certain regions promotes smoking behaviors. The aim is for this and the ensuing inquiries to change government anti-smoking legislation in order to improve women's health.","[Piorkowski, Kristina N.; Bohara, Alok K.] Univ New Mexico, Econ, MSC 05 3060,1 Univ New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA",University of New Mexico,"Piorkowski, KN (通讯作者)，Univ New Mexico, Econ, MSC 05 3060,1 Univ New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",kpiorkow@unm.edu; bohara@unm.edu,,,,,,,50,2,2,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

The results suggest that having a loose monetary policy encourages a preference for risk. In addition, internet finance alters the sensitivity of bank risk behavior to monetary policy. Internet finance has a heterogeneous influence, depending on a bank's ownership (i.e., state or private) and size. At privately owned banks, internet finance has only a moderate impact on the bank risk-taking transmission channel of monetary policy, unlike the subsample of large banks.","[Qiao, Haishu; Chen, Meilin; Xia, Yue] Hunan Univ, Coll Finance & Stat, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Qiao, Haishu] Yango Univ, Coll Business, Fuzhou, Fujian, Peoples R China",Hunan University,"Chen, ML (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ, Coll Finance & Stat, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.",cjmeilin@163.com,,,National Social Science Foundation of China [14AGL016],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),This work was supported by National Social Science Foundation of China [14AGL016].,,29,21,22,2,138,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

This paper uses nationally representative district-level data from the 2007-8 District Level Household and Facility Survey (DLHS-3), Indicus Analytics, and the 2011-12 Indian Human Development Survey-II (IHDS-II) to examine the role of socioeconomic and cultural factors in influencing gender differentials in schooling. The results provide quantitative evidence of the role of different economic and sociocultural factors on gender disparities in education. The empirical results show that economic development is an important factor in narrowing gender gaps in education, with wealthier districts more likely to educate girls than poorer districts. However, the norm of patrilocal exogamy, where wives migrate to co-reside with their husband's kin, is associated with worse outcomes for women's schooling relative to men's schooling; and, in keeping with anthropological research, gender-differentiated inequities in education are more pronounced in Northern India.","[Rammohan, Anu] Univ Western Australia, Econ, M251,35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Vu, Patrick] Reserve Bank Australia, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Western Australia; Reserve Bank of Australia,"Rammohan, A (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Econ, M251,35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",anu.rammohan@uwa.edu.au; patrick_vu@live.com.au,,"Rammohan, Anu/0000-0002-9062-4508",,,,,47,35,39,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

A questionnaire was administered among the students to obtain a qualitative assessment of their learning experiences using this alternative pedagogy. In both the classes, students ranked 'learning how to use economics to solve real problems' as the most important aspect of the case-method among the given choices. Furthermore, each of these classes was compared with two other sections taught by the same instructor without cases to perform quantitative assessments. In addition to a pooled OLS regression for each course studying the impact of the 'case' on final exam score, a difference in difference analysis was performed to test the difference in test grades before and after the introduction of the case method and between the two classes for each course. Both the methods gave statistically significant results, implying the adoption of the case-method to be effective in making the students active learners.","[Ray, Mona] Morehouse Coll, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30314 USA",Morehouse College,"Ray, M (通讯作者)，Morehouse Coll, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30314 USA.",mona.ray@morehouse.edu,,,,,,,16,17,19,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1477-3880,2352-4421,,INT REV ECON EDUC,Int.

At the same time, youth labor markets play a specific role in balancing the development of regional labor markets. The article considers the condition of youth in the regional labor markets and suggests approaches to assessing the deficit of decent work for young people. Interregional differences in major indicators characterizing the sustainability of youth employment, including pre-crisis and post-crisis stages, are identified. The most notable inter-group transitions are recognized. Identifying the parameters of youth employment stability and its profiles sensu trends in innovative development of the regions will facilitate better understanding of functioning patterns of youth segment in regional labor markets as well as development of comprehensive regulation measures.","[Sankova, Larisa Viktorovna; Bogachenko, Ekaterina Dmitrievna; Otstavnova, Liliya Alekseevna] Yuri Gagarin State Tech Univ Saratov, Dept Labor Econ & Prod Complexes, Saratov, Russia",Yuri Gagarin State Technical University of Saratov,"Sankova, LV (通讯作者)，Yuri Gagarin State Tech Univ Saratov, Dept Labor Econ & Prod Complexes, Saratov, Russia.",sankovalv@sstu.ru; ekaterinab0208@gmail.com; liliotstav69@yandex.ru,"Отставнова, Лилия/AAB-8959-2021; Bogachenko, Ekaterina/AAC-4812-2021; Sankova, Larisa V./L-3148-2018",,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-514-6,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,39.0,,,,,,527,532,,,,,,6,Business; Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BO4YG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000515721900109,0

I demonstrate that defendants are more likely to comply without delay when the targeted measures involve firms that are integrated into regional and global value chains. When a dispute touches upon the interests of these firms and targets import-restricting measures, they are triggered to mobilize and press for compliance because they rely on foreign imports. In effect, the mobilization of these firms changes the domestic political conditions in favor of timely implementation. I show the plausibility of my argument in a comparative design with four case studies in which the US and Canada acted as defendants in WTO disputes.

The authors consider the term human capital and its structural components in the historical perspective. It is stated that this concept has undergone considerable changes over the time. Currently, it contains many elements from physical-biological to socio-cultural. The Department of Applied Sociology (Ural State University of Economics) in cooperation with colleagues from Czech Republic and China conducted a sociological survey in 2017. This survey identified the key features of human capital in the region that include welfare (income), educational level (qualifications), values (attitude to work, to authorities, to job responsibilities, the value of proactive attitude), people commitment in the field of labour. The authors make a conclusion about a contradictory nature of modern human capital development. In some indicators, the population of the Ural region shows quite advanced performance (e.g. quite high educational level), whereas in the parameter of proactive attitude the population has paternalistic models of behaviour that were typical of the Soviet period.","[Zaborova, Elena; Markova, Tatiana] Ural State Univ Econ, 62-45,8 Marta Narodnoy Voli St, Ekaterinburg 620144, Russia",Ural State University of Economics,"Zaborova, E (通讯作者)，Ural State Univ Econ, 62-45,8 Marta Narodnoy Voli St, Ekaterinburg 620144, Russia.",ezaborova@yandex.ru; tmark@mail.ru,"Elena, Zaborova/Q-1895-2015; Markova, Tatiana/ABC-7152-2021",,,,,,14,3,3,0,3,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,1981,1990,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400197,0

Because western economics is a comprehensive, theoretical, and practical discipline, knowledge itself is more boring and abstract, and many students lack a certain understanding of real economic activities. Therefore, this paper will discuss the application of Dewey's educational ideas in classroom teaching of western economics based on the related theories of Dewey's educational thoughts, persisting in the principles of doing high school, student-centeredness and reflective thinking. This paper first discusses the basic theory of Dewey's educational thoughts, and then analyzes the application of western economics curriculum teaching in this ideological theory by discussing the core theories and principles of Dewey's educational thoughts. Based on Dewey's theory of teaching process, it explores the suitability of western economies. The teaching model of course teaching is to ask questions, analyze problems, solve problems and expand problems. Finally, based on Dewey's educational thought, combined with the content of the competition market in the book Western Economics, the specific teaching design and classroom practice were carried out, and their teaching effects were evaluated and introspected. Practice shows that the application of Dewey's educational ideas in the teaching of Western economics is conducive to the improvement of students' abilities, the development of students' learning subjectivity, and the cultivation of students' creative thinking, and it is also conducive to the professional development of teachers.","[Zhang, Jie] Xijing Univ, Business Sch, Xian 710123, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Xijing University,"Zhang, J (通讯作者)，Xijing Univ, Business Sch, Xian 710123, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,1,FRANCIS ACAD PRESS,LONDON,"35 IVOR PL, LOWER GROUND, LONDON, NW1 6EA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-912407-98-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,61,64,,,,,,4,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BL4ID,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450418800012,0

Using sale price data for residential properties in Los Angeles County from 2008 to 2011 we estimate the neighborhood level impact of charter schools on housing prices. Using an identification strategy that relies on census-block fixed effects and variation in charter penetration over time, we find little evidence that the availability of a charter school affects housing prices on average.

Given the current context of financial constraints in public accounts, and particularly in the Social Security system, we feel that the issue merits inquiry in the case of Spain. The present research posits a methodological proposal using the econometric technique of stochastic frontiers, which allows us to break down the duration of work-related leave into what we term economic days and medical days. Our calculations indicate that during the 9-year period spanning 2005-2013, the cost of sick leave amongst full-time salaried workers amounted to 6920 million Euros (in constant 2011 Euros). Of this total, and bearing in mind that economic days are those attributable to duration moral hazard, over 3000 million Euros might be linked to workplace absenteeism. It is on this figure where economic policy measures might prove more effective.","[Martin-Roman, Angel; Moral, Alfonso] Univ Valladolid, Fac Ciencias Sociales Jurid & Comunicac, Dept Econ Anal, Plaza Alto Leones 1, Segovia 40001, Spain",Universidad de Valladolid,"Martín-Román, A (通讯作者)，Univ Valladolid, Fac Ciencias Sociales Jurid & Comunicac, Dept Econ Anal, Plaza Alto Leones 1, Segovia 40001, Spain.",angellm@eco.uva.es,"Moral, Alfonso/K-6776-2014; Martin-Roman, Angel/J-8089-2014","Moral, Alfonso/0000-0001-5462-8133; Martin-Roman, Angel/0000-0002-4777-4324",Spanish Ministry of Education (MEC) [ECO2014-52343-P]; FEDER funds; MEC [CSO2015-69439-R],Spanish Ministry of Education (MEC)(Spanish Government); FEDER funds(European Union (EU)); MEC,"The first author was partially supported by the Spanish Ministry of Education (MEC) under project ECO2014-52343-P, co-financed by FEDER funds.

In 2009 German federal regulation required insurers to express premium differences between standardized health plans in absolute euro values relative to a federal reference price, rather than in percentage point payroll tax differences. Representative individual-level panel data and aggregated health plan level panel data on the universe of health plans show that the reform strongly increased enrollees' willingness to switch plans, with demand elasticities increasing fourfold. The salience of premium differences and the default premium are obviously key driving forces in the decision to switch insurers.","[Schmitz, Hendrik] Univ Paderborn, Stat & Empir Econ, Paderborn, Germany; [Schmitz, Hendrik] CINCH, Paderborn, Germany; [Schmitz, Hendrik] RWI, Paderborn, Germany; [Ziebarth, Nicolas R.] Cornell Univ, Dept Policy Anal & Management PAM, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Ziebarth, Nicolas R.] IZA, Ithaca, NY USA; [Ziebarth, Nicolas R.] DIW, Ithaca, NY USA",University of Paderborn; Cornell University,"Schmitz, H (通讯作者)，Univ Paderborn, Stat & Empir Econ, Paderborn, Germany.;Schmitz, H (通讯作者)，CINCH, Paderborn, Germany.;Schmitz, H (通讯作者)，RWI, Paderborn, Germany.",hendrik.schmitz@uni-paderborn.de,"Ziebarth, Nicolas Robert/A-2812-2012","Ziebarth, Nicolas Robert/0000-0003-3562-2371; Schmitz, Hendrik/0000-0002-0253-102X",,,,,68,25,28,0,58,UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS,MADISON,"JOURNAL DIVISION, 1930 MONROE ST, 3RD FL, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0022-166X,1548-8004,,J HUM RESOUR,J.

National implementation of such regimes go through different stages of development, from changes 'on paper' in regulations and guidelines (labelled output), to behavioural changes among target groups (labelled outcome) before responses are seen on the natural environment (labelled impacts). The main purpose of this paper is to apply a quantitative bio-economic model for analysing the potential impacts on Norwegian forestry of two international regimes (the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD) and an extended version of the Kyoto Protocol), and to discuss the weak and strong points in using this kind of method in policy analysis. Our findings imply that: (i) The CBD regime has rather limited impacts on the forest structure and harvest as long as it is practised with an intensity corresponding to the forest certification schemes used at present in Norway, or with lower intensity. (ii) Practiced with maximum consideration to biodiversity the potential impact of the CBD regime on the forest structure and harvest is strong, and it can reduce the income from timber production by 30% or more compared to present forestry practices. This reduction is highest when forest climate mitigation is given low consideration. (iii) There is a significant mutual relationship between the two regimes analysed, in the meaning that the weaker one of them is implemented, the stronger marginal impact has the other. (iv) Using quantitative bio-economic modelling in policy impact analyses like this contributes to the methodological literature on regime effectiveness, and has several advantages. But due considerations should be given to underlying basic assumptions related to agent behaviour and the ecosystem detail level required.","[Solberg, Birger; Bergseng, Even; Lindstad, Berit H.] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway",Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Solberg, B (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway.",birger.solberg@nmbu.no,,,,,,,68,5,5,1,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,DEC,2017,85.0,,1.0,,,,147,160,,10.1016/j.forpol.2017.09.003,0.0,,,14,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,FR3SG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418986200015,0

We estimate the impacts of PM and PES on forest conservation, poverty reduction, and population change at the locality level in Mexico in the 2000s. Both policies conserved forest, generating an approximately 20-25% reduction in expected forest cover loss. PES created statistically significant but small poverty alleviation while PAs had overall neutral impacts on livelihoods. Estimates by individual policy type for the same level of deforestation risk indicate that biosphere reserves and PES balanced conservation and livelihood goals better than strict protected areas or mixed-use areas. This suggests that both direct and incentive-based instruments can be effective, and that policies combining sustainable financing, flexible zoning, and recognition of local economic goals are more likely to achieve conservation without harming livelihoods.

The Mexico 2050 Calculator was used to run a number of low carbon future scenarios by 2050. The calculator consists of a whole-systems model, which combines the main sectors of the Mexican economy into a single visual tool. By integrating energy and carbon dynamics across all sectors and carrying out a sensitivity analysis of the entire model, we compare four low carbon energy scenarios to assess current energy policy strategies in the country. The methodology proposed in this paper can also be applied to any other nation, particularly to those with similar models already available. Our findings show the relative impact of each sector and their various interactions for achieving Mexico's ratified climate commitments. The paper also includes policy recommendations and highlights the need for scaling-up energy efficiency policy efforts in industry and transport, for having a higher focus on agricultural and land use policies, and for promoting integrated renewable energy policies.","[Elizondo, Alejandro] CONACYT, CIDE, Carretera Mexico Toluca 3655, Mexico City 01210, DF, Mexico; [Perez-Cirera, Vanessa] Univ Iberoamer IBERO, EQUIDE, Prolongac Paseo Reforma 880, Mexico City 01219, DF, Mexico; [Strapasson, Alexandre] Harvard Univ, Belfer Ctr Sci & Int Affairs, 79 JFK St,Mailbox 117, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Strapasson, Alexandre] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Environm Policy, 14 Princes Gardens, London SW7 1NA, England; [Cruz-Cano, Diego] Univ Texas El Paso, Coll Engn, El Paso, TX 79968 USA",Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C.

During the development of the predictive model it became evident that only the tip of the iceberg, so to speak, has been uncovered. The rhino poaching problem is even more complex than was initially thought and this paper serves as a reflective piece on how the research methodology for the complex and poorly understood rhino poaching problem was shifted towards developing a common understanding of major drivers and interactions, to allow for pre-emptive action on a variety of fronts. The global drivers dictating the rhino horn supply chain such as human trafficking and other socio-economic factors cannot easily be captured in a model of causal certainties. This is in spite of the fact that the motivation of the individual poachers may reduce to greed or the need to provide for their families. Although the authors initially thought that it would be possible to model these causalities it became clear that the system is highly reflexive and adaptive. The system has feedback and recursive causal internals that self-regulate by changing in response to the environment. As interventions are introduced, the system will try to respond to mitigate the effects or impact of the change which makes predictive causal modelling very challenging. The paper reflects on this understanding derived from the development of a methodology that combines different versions of a causal Bayesian Network model with a systems framework drawn from an integral ecology perspective.","[Koen, Hildegarde; de Villiers, J.

This paper assesses whether the distant communities are deriving benefits from CFM in the form of timber, fuelwood and fodder. A total of 350 households was surveyed using a structured questionnaire. The result indicated that distant users were getting more timber compared to the users who lived close to collaborative forest and it was opposite in case of fuelwood and fodder. About 75% and 85% of fuelwood and fodder needs was fulfilled from the private source- trees grown on private farmland. Although CFM approach is able to supply timber to distantly located households, rich and male-headed households are disproportionately receiving high benefits. Provisioning small timber to the poor for house construction in place of sawn timber which is very expensive, may enhance welfare of the poor.","[Rai, Rajesh Kumar] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Dept Management Sci & Technol Dev, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Rai, Rajesh Kumar] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Environm & Labour Safety, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Dhakal, Arun] Nepal Agro Forestry Fdn, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Khadayat, Madan S.] South Asian Network Dev & Environm Econ, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Ranabhat, Sunita] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev, Kathmandu, Nepal",Ton Duc Thang University; Ton Duc Thang University,"Rai, RK (通讯作者)，Ton Duc Thang Univ, Dept Management Sci & Technol Dev, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",rajesh.kumar.rai@tdt.edu.vn,"Kumar, Rajesh/ABA-6489-2020; Rai, Rajesh Kumar Kumar/E-3572-2019","Rai, Rajesh Kumar Kumar/0000-0002-2275-815X",,,,,38,14,15,0,6,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,OCT,2017,83.0,,,,,,156,161,,10.1016/j.forpol.2017.08.004,0.0,,,6,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,FK6JW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413611000017,0

We overcome many of the limitations of previous literature that has dealt with this issue, namely, the influence of the assumptions used in statistical models on the final results. Given our large sample size (n = 6024) we can use models that are very demanding on data. We use parametric (linear, quadratic, dummies), semi-nonparametric, and non-parametric models. We also compare the marginal and the total approach and show that they provide similar results. We also overcome one of the limitations of the total approach, that is, we include the effects of socioeconomic characteristics that are correlated with age (education and income). Our main result is that all these different approaches produce very similar results, namely, they show an inverted-U relation between the value of a statistical life (VSL) and age. Those results can hardly be attributed to problems of collinearity, omitted variables or statistical assumptions. We find a clear senior discount effect. This effect seems concentrated on those who have lower education and income levels. We also find that the value of a statistical life year (VSLY) increases with age.","[Brey, Raul] Pablo de Olavide Univ, Dept Econ, Ctra Utrera Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain; [Luis Pinto-Prades, Jose] Univ Navarra, Dept Econ, Pamplona, Spain; [Luis Pinto-Prades, Jose] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Yunus Ctr Social Business & Hlth, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",Universidad Pablo de Olavide; University of Navarra; Glasgow Caledonian University,"Brey, R (通讯作者)，Pablo de Olavide Univ, Dept Econ, Ctra Utrera Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain.",rbresan@upo.es; jlpinto@unav.es,"prades, jose luis pinto/AGJ-9700-2022; prades, jose luis pinto/B-7069-2008","prades, jose luis pinto/0000-0002-9684-3410; prades, jose luis pinto/0000-0002-9684-3410; Brey Sanchez, Raul/0000-0003-1376-1266",,,,,27,2,2,1,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The choice between the two typically hinges on the trade-off between the posted price's simplicity and the potential revenue gains of the auction. In this paper we introduce a novel mechanism that attempts to bridge the gap between the performance of posted price offers and auctions. A two-price and lottery schedule combines the simplicity of the former with some of the flexibility of the latter. Using a model that incorporates agents' cognitive and information costs of bidding, we analyze how the ranking of allocative efficiency and cost-effectiveness between the mechanisms varies as the wedge of participation costs increases. When the number of bidders is endogenously determined by participation costs, bid shading associated with a lack of competition in the auction compromises its cost-effectiveness vis-a-vis the posted price and the lottery schedule. We use data from three recent buybacks for fishing licenses conducted in Maryland to calibrate our model and identify conditions under which the two-price schedule outperforms the other mechanisms.

It further aims to test whether preferences differ by age and health status. Evidence is provided by a discrete choice experiment conducted in 2014 using the six most important attributes in sickness fund competition and ten random generated choice sets per participant. Price is found to be the most important attribute followed by additional benefits, managed care programmes, and distance to nearest branch. Other positive attributes of sickness funds are found to balance out a higher price, which would allow a sickness fund to position itself as high quality. However, significant differences in preferences were found between age and health status group. In particular, compromised health is associated with higher preference for illness-related additional benefits and less distance to the lowest branch, but lower preference for a lower price. Based on these differences, a distinct sickness fund offer could be constructed that would allow passive risk selection.","[Pendzialek, Jonas B.; Simic, Dusan; Stock, Stephanie] Univ Cologne, Inst Hlth Econ & Clin Epidemiol, Gleueler Str 176-178, D-50935 Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Pendzialek, JB (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Inst Hlth Econ & Clin Epidemiol, Gleueler Str 176-178, D-50935 Cologne, Germany.",jonas.pendzialek@gmail.com,,,,,,,51,4,5,4,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The first is represented by Danish paleoclimatology and their project of deep-ice core drilling in Greenland, which seeks to profile a specific climatic period called the Eemian. Dating approximately from 125,000 to 115;000 years BP, the Eemian was the last warm interglacial period before the advent of the Holocene some 12000 years BP, and thus serves as an analogue to contemporary global warming. I contrast this mode of prognostication with the temperature curve by Michael Mann et al. (1998), which demonstrate that global mean temperatures have risen in conjunction with the consumption.of fossil fuels visualized in a graph that became known as the Hockey Stick. I argue that in the first case we have a form of analogue reasoning, which predicts the past in order to envision the future. In the second case we have a thoroughly modern technology of anticipation, predicated on Enlightenment ideas about the visual economy of chronological timelines. From the vantage point of this contrast, I discuss the political nature of proxies, where I argue that the STS-field could be more attentive to the imaginations and aspirations of the paleoclimatologists themselves.

The island of Sumatra in particular is severely affected by the rapid expansion of monoculture cash crops. Since Dutch colonial times, land tenure regulations here have generally favored such resource exploitation. The current National Development Plan continues to see Sumatra as a center of resource production in order to eradicate poverty and accelerate national development. This developmental focus, however, is accompanied by contested land use scenarios. Taking a historical perspective, this research discloses different layers of past and present land tenure regulations to understand present contestations of land use, resource exploitation, and their social consequences. Based on a village case study, the research demonstrates how different political eras and their accompanying land tenure approaches are inscribed in today's local landscape. We found that de jure regulations which were added to customary laws created a situation of legal pluralism.

This study aims to evaluate, in monetary terms, end-user preferences for the non-monetary attributes of different modes of drug administration using a discrete-choice experiment. It provides empirical support to the notion that there are significant benefits from developing patient-friendly approaches to drug delivery. The gross benefits per patient per unit administration is in the same order of magnitude as the savings in resource costs of administering drugs.

We estimate that truly separate but equal schools would have reduced wage inequality by 29%-48%.","[Carruthers, Celeste K.; Wanamaker, Marianne H.] Univ Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Wanamaker, Marianne H.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Carruthers, CK (通讯作者)，Univ Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",carruthers@utk.edu,,"Carruthers, Celeste/0000-0002-5112-3364","University of Tennessee Office of Research; Spencer Foundation [201200064]; University of Kentucky Center for Poverty Research via the US Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation [5 U01 PE000002-06]","University of Tennessee Office of Research; Spencer Foundation; University of Kentucky Center for Poverty Research via the US Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation","We thank William Collins, Robert Margo, Don Bruce, John Parman, Michael Kofoed, Price Fishback, and seminar participants at the University of Tennessee, the University of Pittsburgh, the College of William and Mary, Harvard University, York University, the University of California, Davis, the University of Florida, the University of California, Irvine, the 2013 Southern Economic Association annual meetings, and the 2014 NBER Summer Institute for helpful comments and suggestions.

The estimators studied include parametric cross-section and difference-in-differences regression estimators and nonparametric cross-section and difference-in-differences matching estimators. The estimators are used to generate program impacts on cognitive achievement test scores, child health measures, parenting behaviors, and parent labor market outcomes. Some of the estimators closely reproduce the experimental results, but a priori it would be difficult to know whether the estimator works well for any particular outcome. Pre-program exogeneity tests eliminate some outcomes and estimators with the worst biases, but estimators/outcomes with substantial biases pass the tests. The difference-in-differences matching estimator exhibits the best performance in terms of low bias values and capturing the pattern of statistically significant treatment effects. However, the variation in bias is greater across outcomes examined than across methods.","[Griffen, Andrew S.] Univ Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; [Todd, Petra E.] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Tokyo; University of Pennsylvania,"Griffen, AS (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.",,,,[B-26285067]; [15K20966]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K20966] Funding Source: KAKEN,"; ; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We thank David Card, Laura Hawkinson, Hidehiko Ichimura, Becka Maynard, Jeff Smith, seminar participants at the conference in honor of Robert LaLonde, the University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Education, and the Tokyo Labor Economics Workshop for comments that greatly improved the paper.

Data from the 11th National Forest Inventory of Finland were used to develop five even-flow harvesting scenarios for non-protected forests with the annual harvest ranging from 40 to 100 million m(3). The results show that the highest annual even-flow harvest level, which did not decrease the growing stock volume over the 90-year simulation period, was 73 million m3. The total 90-year timber production, consisting of harvested volume and change in growing stock volume, was maximized when the annual harvest was 60 million m(3). Volume increment increased for several decades when harvested volume was less than the current volume increment. The total carbon balance of forestry was the highest with low volume of harvested wood. Low harvested volume increased the values of biodiversity indicators, namely volume of deciduous trees, amount of deadwood and area of old forest. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Using six-year-round panel data for the period between 2007/08 and 2012/13, this study examines the technical efficiency, total factor productivity, and determinants of the technical inefficiency of hospitals. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) and DEA-based Malmquist productivity index used to estimate relative technical efficiency, scale efficiency, and total factor productivity index of hospitals. Tobit model used to examine the determinants of the technical inefficiency of hospitals. The DEA Variable Returns to Scale (VRS) estimate indicated that 6 (50%), 5 (42%), 3 (25%), 3 (25%), 4 (33%), and 3 (25%) of the hospitals were technically inefficient while 9 (75%), 9 (75%), 7 (58%), 7 (58%), 7 (58%) and 8 (67%) of hospitals were scale inefficient between 2007/08 and 2012/13, respectively. On average, Malmquist Total Factor Productivity (MTFP) of the hospitals decreased by 3.6% over the panel period. The Tobit model shows that teaching hospital is less efficiency than other hospitals. The Tobit regression model further shows that medical doctor to total staff ratio, the proportion of outpatient visit to inpatient days, and the proportion of inpatients treated per medical doctor were negatively related with technical inefficiency of hospitals. Hence, policy interventions that help utilize excess capacity of hospitals, increase doctor to other staff ratio, and standardize number of inpatients treated per doctor would contribute to the improvement of the technical efficiency of hospitals.","[Ali, Murad; Debela, Megersa] Haramaya Univ, Dept Econ, Coll Business & Econ, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia; [Bamud, Tewfik] Hawasa Univ, Dept Econ, Coll Business & Econ, Awasa, Ethiopia",Haramaya University,"Debela, M (通讯作者)，Haramaya Univ, Dept Econ, Coll Business & Econ, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia.",mdebela4@gmail.com,"Daksa, Megersa Debela/M-9908-2017; DEBELA, MEGERSA/O-2419-2019","Daksa, Megersa Debela/0000-0003-0526-7292; DEBELA, MEGERSA/0000-0003-0526-7292; Mohamed, Tewfik/0000-0003-1288-9751",Haramaya University,Haramaya University,"Haramaya University fund the study.

We use data from an Italian national level learning assessment, involving children in selected grades from second to tenth, and analyse the gender gap in mathematics test scores using OLS, school fixed effects, quantile regression, metric free and dynamic pseudo-panel models. Our results show that girls systematically underperform boys, even after controlling for an array of individual and family background characteristics.

Advising governments through think tanks and regulatory commissions, they advocated labour market policies that combined a racialized approach to immigration, eugenics, Taylorist labour market efficiency and a living wage. Their interest in women's employment conditions was based on a Darwinian concern to protect mothers of the white' race. Parallels are drawn with Australia, where, from the turn of the 20th century, industrial tribunals established a male minimum wage designed to support the maternal role, based on similar racial preoccupations and a view that women's inefficiency' as workers would protect men from low-wage competitors. United States Progressives, in rejecting laissez-faire economics, espoused instead a role for the state based on a holistic Darwinian sociology of racial contest: an economics of hate. It was not till the 1930s that Keynesianism emerged as an alternative macroeconomic project.","[Dabscheck, Braham] Univ Melbourne, Parkville, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Dabscheck, B (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Law Sch, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",bdabsche@bigpond.net.au,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

The impact of teacher attrition on overall teacher quality will depend on the effectiveness of teachers who leave the profession. Likewise, teacher turnover may alleviate or worsen inequities in the distribution of teachers, depending on which teachers change schools or leave teaching and who replaces them. Using matched student-teacher panel data from the state of Florida, we examine teacher mobility across the distribution of effectiveness (as measured by teacher value added). We find that top-quartile and bottom-quartile teachers exit at a higher rate than do average-quality teachers. Additionally, as the share of peer teachers with more experience, advanced degrees, or professional certification increases, the likelihood of moving within-district decreases. We also find some evidence of assortative matching among teachersmore productive reading/language arts teachers are more likely to stay in teaching if they have more productive peer teachers.","[Feng, Li] Texas State Univ, McCoy Coll Business Adm, Dept Finance & Econ, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA; [Sass, Tim R.] Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA",Texas State University System; Texas State University San Marcos; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Feng, L (通讯作者)，Texas State Univ, McCoy Coll Business Adm, Dept Finance & Econ, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA.",Li.Feng@txstate.edu; tsass@gsu.edu,"Feng, Li/D-7155-2014","Feng, Li/0000-0002-0536-1791","National Center for the Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research (CALDER) from Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education [R305A060018]","National Center for the Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research (CALDER) from Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education","We wish to thank the staff of the Florida Department of Education's K-20 Education Data Warehouse for their assistance in obtaining and interpreting the data used in this study.

At the same time, interventions designed to actually manage any pest and disease outbreaks that occur can reshape forest landscapes in a variety of ways. In this review-based paper we argue that disease-driven interactions between biology, public policy and human agency along pathways of introduction and at outbreak sites will become increasingly common in the Anthropocene, where the latter is understood as an era in which human influence over non-human nature is ever more pervasive. We discuss the nature of these interactions in terms of the increased risk of disease introduction via various trade pathways and through the subsequent policy and behavioural responses to two disease outbreaks made by policymakers and stakeholders in the UK (Phytophthora ramorum and ash dieback (Hymenoscyphus fraxineus)). Human influence is evident both in terms of the underlying risk drivers and in the subsequent course and management of these and other outbreaks. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This paper proposes an alternative scheme in which the regulator offers each firm a menu of linear price-quantity contracts; faced with this menu, each firm's dominant strategy is to truthfully report its private information and self-select the contract that is ex post efficient. The proposed menu schedule that is more elastic than the firm's residual marginal damage function engenders a positive quantity effect, thereby counterbalancing the firm's incentive to misreport prompted by the linearity of price. Due to its built-in price quantity structure, the scheme performs as designed regardless of the elasticities of marginal damage and demand functions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The results of a multinomial probit model reveal that non-harvesting households are statistically likely to be poor, to receive nonfarm income, to have smaller areas in primary forest and to reside nearer population centers. Illegal logging is more likely to be carried out by poor households that do not have nonfarm income, have larger areas in forest and reside farther away from urban areas. Legal loggers, in contrast, are likely to come from wealthier households that have legal property rights to the land they possess or control but do not take part in nonfarm employment. Ethnicity has no effect on the likelihood of harvesting timber (either legally or illegally) and has only a marginally significant effect on non-harvesting households. The implications of these findings for policy are explored in the conclusions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Although the regulatory frameworks imposed by the EU, Belgian and Flemish government to address these problems are based on clear time paths for reaching the objectives, the level of thematic integration is low. Long-term prospective studies such as the Environment Outlook 2030 and the Nature Outlook 2030 have been carried out to evaluate the existing status of the environment and nature and associated policies, anticipating on the long-term developments. Sectoral and static models cannot adequately describe the interactions between the themes and consequences of system feedback. A four-step approach using a skeleton model framework is proposed here to describe the functioning of Flanders as an integrated social, economic and environmental system at a high level of abstraction. A feasibility study was carried out to examine and compare the potential applicability of a broad range of models in the framework of the four-step approach. The analysis includes a graphical representation of the causalities linking the key state variables of the system, criteria to assess the extent to which thematic models could be applied in the four-step approach, and a ranking for a selection of models.

According to the Pharmaceutical Market Restructuring Act (AMNOG), pharmaceutical companies are obliged to demonstrate added benefit of new drugs over comparative treatment. Benefit is usually evaluated by the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG). The final appraisal is made by the Federal Joint Committee, Germany's highest-ranking decision body in the health sector, triggering drug prize negotiations between companies and statutory health insurance funds. One of four evaluation criteria is quality of life (QoL). QoL outcomes have, however, only rarely been pivotal in EBAs. This study determined methodological requirements for QoL measurement and data presentation in the EBA. In a qualitative content analysis, documents of all EBAs completed by 2014 were searched for the term QoL. Relevant passages of all EBAs of 2011-2013 were independently extracted and reduced to key content by two researchers. Recurring patterns were identified and verified through comparison with EBAs of 2014. We identified a range of requirements regarding QoL assessment, analysis, presentation, and interpretation, which go beyond official regulations. Disease-specific questionnaires are preferred and have to be validated according to certain standards and in the respective patient group. Effects must exceed the minimal important difference, which in turn must be validated in compliance with specific requirements. Often, instruments were not accepted as QoL measures, sometimes inconsistently across EBAs. Another frequent reason for non-acceptance of QoL data was that more than 30 % of randomized patients could not be analyzed due to missing data. Non-compliance with methodological requirements for QoL evidence impairs chances for positive benefit evaluation.","[Blome, Christine; Augustin, Matthias; Lohrberg, David] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Inst Hlth Serv Res Dermatol & Nursing IVDP, German Ctr Hlth Serv Res Dermatol CVderm, Martinistr 52, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; [Metin, Hidayet] Janssen Cilag GmbH, Neuss, Germany",University of Hamburg; University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf; Johnson & Johnson,"Blome, C (通讯作者)，Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Inst Hlth Serv Res Dermatol & Nursing IVDP, German Ctr Hlth Serv Res Dermatol CVderm, Martinistr 52, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany.",c.blome@uke.de,"Blome, Christine/G-8378-2016","Blome, Christine/0000-0002-1163-1639","Janssen-Cilag GmbH, Neuss, Germany","Janssen-Cilag GmbH, Neuss, Germany","This study was financially supported by Janssen-Cilag GmbH, Neuss, Germany.",,21,3,3,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

A number of cities in developing countries have used license plate-based driving restrictions as a policy for reducing urban air pollution and traffic congestion. This paper develops a theoretical model of the effects of license plate-based driving restrictions on air quality that combines an economic model with information about the sources and atmospheric chemistry of different air pollutants. We then draw upon suggestive empirical evidence from license plate-based driving restrictions implemented in Bogota, Colombia. Consistent with our theory model, we find suggestive empirical evidence that under certain circumstances, due to substitution, the purchase of a second car, the use of alternative modes of transportation, and/or atmospheric chemistry, it is possible for license plate-based driving restrictions to increase air pollution. Also consistent with our theory, we find that license plate-based driving restrictions may have different effects on different air pollutants, reflecting heterogeneity in the sources and atmospheric chemistry of the pollutants. In particular, owing to atmospheric chemistry, it is possible for a license plate-based driving restriction to cause a significant decrease in NO and a significant increase in NO2, NO, and O-3.

In this paper, I examine to what extent this association is causal. I merge political ideology data from 25 waves of Eurobarometer surveys with information on 18 educational reforms in 11 European countries. I then instrument for educational attainment with a regression discontinuity design that estimates the increase in education due to compulsory educational reforms. Notably, it appears that omitted variables bias is important here. I find a significant causal effect of education moving individuals to the right when properly addressing the endogeneity whereas there is a significant association between education and left-wing political ideology when treating education as exogenous. I find that on average, among the individuals compelled into additional education from these specific reforms, an additional year of education moves individuals to the right of the political continuum by about 5-6%. However, I also find no evidence of a causal effect on political ideology for a subgroup of countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

It has been acclaimed that this agreement lays the foundation for the next phase of Australia's economic relationship with China and predicted that it will unlock significant opportunities for Australia as China is Australia's largest export market for both goods and services, accounting for nearly a third of total exports, and a growing source offoreign investment. However, concerns have been expressed that the Australia-China Free Trade Agreement is likely to have a number of retrogressive effects on the protection and promotion of human rights, including labour standards. This article explores differences between the free trade agreement negotiating precepts and cultures of China and Australia and the status of human rights in those negotiations, with an emphasis on understanding representative Australian attitudes. Although those negotiations are now a faint accompli, they are nevertheless of great interest. The article's focus on the fate of human rights in the negotiation phase of the Australia-China Free Trade Agreement from the Australian perspective, together with the dynamics and nuances of the negotiation process giving rise to the Agreement, provides timely and significant insight on the implementation process, as well as a lesson-learned for future free-trade negotiations. The article argues that human rights should not be overlooked in the negotiations that lead to a free trade agreement. The article comprises seven parts. Section 1 introduces the subject-matter. Section 2 provides a historical overview of trade relations between Australia and China. Section 3 considers the complexity of negotiations between the two States and their different expectations and approaches. Section 4 outlines Australia's major international human rights obligations including labour standards. Section 5 highlights specific human rights concerns raised in Australia during the Australia-China Free Trade Agreement negotiations. Section 6 observes other States' approaches to human rights issues when negotiating their FTAs with China. Section 7 concludes that robust safeguards must be embedded and that a close consideration should be given to the implementation process, including the ex post human rights impact assessment of the Australia China Free Trade Agreement.","[Petrovic, Jadranka] Monash Univ, Publ Int Law & Int Trade Law, Clayton, Vic, Australia",Monash University,"Petrovic, J (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Publ Int Law & Int Trade Law, Clayton, Vic, Australia.",jadranka.a.petrovic@gmail.com; bengrunberg1@gmail.com,,,,,,,64,1,1,0,26,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Second, using a regression analysis with cross-sectional data, it shows that social capital accumulation along the life cycle is different for men and women, with men accumulating more social capital at all ages, with a different peak and overall profile. The study also shows that, over fifteen years, the gap in social capital by sex narrowed. Finally, it introduces a model of social capital structure compatible with the empirical evidence and with notions of gender as defined in feminist literature.","[Addis, Elisabetta] Univ Sassari, Dept Law, Piazza Univ 1, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Joxhe, Majlinda] Univ Luxembourg, Ctr Res Econ & Management, 162a Ave Faiencerie, L-1511 Luxembourg, Luxembourg",University of Sassari; University of Luxembourg,"Addis, E (通讯作者)，Univ Sassari, Dept Law, Piazza Univ 1, I-07100 Sassari, Italy.",eaddis@tiscali.it; majlinda.joxhe@uni.lu,"Joxhe, Majlinda/AAC-1496-2021","Joxhe, Majlinda/0000-0001-6911-5461",Sardinian Regional Authority within the project Capitale sociale e divari economici regionali (Social capital and regional disparities),Sardinian Regional Authority within the project Capitale sociale e divari economici regionali (Social capital and regional disparities),"The research for this paper was financed by the Sardinian Regional Authority within the project Capitale sociale e divari economici regionali (Social capital and regional disparities) in 2012.

At the same time, these enterprises have lower capacity, more constrained resources and higher perceived risk to innovate. By understanding innovation in a broader way and looking beyond research and development investments into organizational structures, behaviors and processes, these enterprises can enhance their competitiveness. Organizational innovation is often studied in large, industrial contexts, this study aims to provide more insights for economies that largely depend in small businesses. This study assesses the role of organizational culture - shared assumptions, values, behaviors and practices on organizational innovation - new organizational methods in business practices, workplace organization and external relations via an empirical study. It further explores, whether organizational innovation increases business competitiveness and whether it encourages implementation of other forms of innovation - such as product, process or marketing innovation. Surveying over 500 small enterprises in Latvia, this study assesses the impact of organizational culture on organizational innovation. It finds that organizational culture and organizational innovation are related, and that stronger organizational culture leads to better organizational innovation performance. It further explores, whether cultural dimensions and innovation performance differs, depending on the size of enterprise. This study also confirms that organizational innovation increases competitiveness and can become a step towards fostering other forms of innovation.

Russian energy policy, with its long tradition of strong state control, conflicts with the EU, which represents a far more liberal economic ideology, both in terms of for whom policy should work and how it should be performed. Legally, natural resources are not widely regulated. In this void, while both sides pressure legal cases to make or prevent, respectively, Russia moving towards a Western-styled policy, the private sector provides solutions for specific cases in which state action is insufficient or non-existent. The article asks to which extent Russia, pressured by international law, eventually will adopt an energy policy aligned to the West. It concludes that Russia's steps towards greater economic integration with the outside world leads to greater similarities with the West in legal forms and processes. However, path-dependencies dominating society and politics, and the particularities of the energy industry, indicate that domestic Russian energy policy and external gas export policy may not necessarily lead to the same degree of similarity in actual political content, and, hence, real political convergence with the West.","[Austvik, Ole Gunnar] Lillehammer Univ Coll, Polit Econ, Lillehammer, Norway; [Austvik, Ole Gunnar] Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Lembo, Carolina] Interamer Dev Bank, Washington, DC USA; [Lembo, Carolina] Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Harvard Elect Policy Grp, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences; Harvard University; Inter-American Development Bank; Harvard University,"Austvik, OG (通讯作者)，Lillehammer Univ Coll, Polit Econ, Lillehammer, Norway.;Austvik, OG (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",gunnar.austvik@kaldor.no; clembo@iadb.org,,,,,,,64,8,9,0,4,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Moreover, our results demonstrate that investors react more quickly to bad news than to good news when their fear increases, supporting the hypothesis of the presence of an asymmetric reaction to news. However, investors react more quickly to good news when their fear decreases, indicating an inverse asymmetric reaction. In addition, our empirical results reveal that herding behavior tends to exist on days with a large trading volume.","[Huang, Teng-Ching; Wang, Kuei-Yuan] Asia Univ, Dept Finance, 500 Lioufeng Rd, Taichung 41354, Taiwan; [Wang, Kuei-Yuan] China Med Univ, Taichung, Taiwan",Asia University Taiwan; China Medical University Taiwan,"Wang, KY (通讯作者)，Asia Univ, Dept Finance, 500 Lioufeng Rd, Taichung 41354, Taiwan.",gueei5217@gmail.com,,,Asia University [103-asia-02],Asia University,This study was supported by Asia University under Grant No. 103-asia-02.,,26,19,19,3,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The results show the economic scale effect was the biggest driver. Its promoting effect was 12.69 Bt and the corresponding contribution was 163% during 2000-2014. The energy intensity's effect was the second largest but negative driver, with the mitigating effect of 4.6 Bt and inhibiting contribution of 59%, respectively. However, the effects of industrial structure and energy mix were very small, although all negative (mitigating). The energy mix was the last one, with the mitigating effect (contribution) of only 0.09 Bt (1%). From three different periods (2000-2005, 2005-2010 and 2010-2014), the industrial structure effects (contributions) were 0.13 Bt (5%), -0.06 Bt (-2%) and -0.59 Bt (-22%), respectively. This indicated the related policies of industries' structural adjustment have started to put up an obvious (despite of not big) impact on reducing the EC and corresponding CE in China, especially in 2010-2014. The similar results can also be gotten from the point view of the three different industries, especially in the secondary industry. So, based on these, some scientific policy suggestions for the low carbon and sustainable development in China were recommended.","[Jia, Junsong; Jian, Huiyong; Ju, Min] Jiangxi Normal Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Poyang Lake Wetland & Watershed Res, Nanchang 330022, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Jia, Junsong; Jian, Huiyong; Ju, Min] Jiangxi Normal Univ, Sch Geog & Environm, Nanchang 330022, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Jian, Huiyong] Jiangxi Normal Univ, Sch Grad, Nanchang 330022, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Xie, Dongming] Jiangxi Sci & Technol Normal Univ, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",Jiangxi Normal University; Jiangxi Normal University; Jiangxi Normal University; Jiangxi Science & Technology Normal University,"Jia, JS (通讯作者)，Jiangxi Normal Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Poyang Lake Wetland & Watershed Res, Nanchang 330022, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.;Jia, JS (通讯作者)，Jiangxi Normal Univ, Sch Geog & Environm, Nanchang 330022, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",jiaaniu@126.com; googjobjian2008@163.com; gjxsddljm@126.com; jxstnu_xdm@jxstnu.edu.cn,"贾, 俊松/C-6994-2014","贾, 俊松/0000-0002-7106-5448","Fund of National Natural Science [71473113, 31360120, 51408584]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi [20151BAB203040]",Fund of National Natural Science(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province),"The aids of the Fund of National Natural Science (71473113, 31360120, 51408584) and Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi (20151BAB203040) are gratefully acknowledged.

This article empirically examines the association between the enforcement of those tax compliance systems and firms' tax avoidance from 1999 to 2014. Firms with foreign operations in tax havens have greater opportunities to decrease their overall tax burdens. Thus, the analysis in this study attempts to determine the differential impact of tax compliance systems between firms with subsidiaries in tax haven countries and firms without operations in such places. It is found that tax compliance systems effectively reduce the tax avoidance of firms without operations in tax havens, but not the tax avoidance of firms with operations in tax havens, as predicted. The results also show that financially distressed firms are likely to engage in aggressive tax planning. Moreover, financially distressed firms with operations in tax havens seem to engage in tax avoidance activities even after the enforcement of tax compliance systems. This article may have some implications with respect to considering mechanisms designed to broaden the tax base and more effectively detect offshore tax evasion.","[Lee, Namryoung] Korea Aerosp Univ, Dept Business Adm, 76 Hanggongdaehang Ro, Goyang City 10540, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",Korea Aerospace University,"Lee, N (通讯作者)，Korea Aerosp Univ, Dept Business Adm, 76 Hanggongdaehang Ro, Goyang City 10540, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",nrlee@kau.ac.kr,,,,,,,40,3,4,4,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Across disparate domains, bodies that challenge normalized constructions of responsible neoliberal citizenship are categorized, monitored, policed, and excluded in dehumanizing and often violent ways. This paper explores the role of surveillance in such processes. The registers covered include everyday abjection (welfare systems, battered women's shelters, and homelessness), criminalized poverty (police targeting of the poor and emerging 'poverty capitalism' arrangements), and the radically adrift (the identification, tracking, and containment of refugees). In each of these cases, surveillance is yoked to structural inequalities and systems of oppression, but it also possesses a cultural dimension that thrusts marginalized and dehumanized subjectivities upon the abject Other. Therefore, I argue that in order to critique the gendered, racialized, and classed dimensions of contemporary surveillance, it is necessary to take seriously the mythologies that give meaning to surveillance practices and the subjectivities that are engendered by them.","[Monahan, Torin] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Commun, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Monahan, T (通讯作者)，Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Commun, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",torin.monahan@unc.edu,,,,,,,110,48,54,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

Regional economies are complex, dynamic systems arising from the interactions of housing, labour, business and other market systems with characteristics of a place, all enabled and shaped by the government and civic-sector activity. Agriculture continues to have an important influence on the economy of most rural regions, and agriculture continues to be the main land use in rural regions. For these reasons, support payments play a large role in the development of rural territories in Latvia, particularly after the accession to the European Union (EU) in 2004. The research aim is to identify the role of support payments in the development of municipalities in Latvia. To achieve the aim, the following specific research tasks were set: 1) to analyse the amounts of support payments received by municipalities of Latvia; 2) to assess associations between the amounts of support payments and other socio-economic indicators for municipalities of Latvia. The present research found that support payments played an essential role in the development of territories in Latvia, as Latvia received EUR 4.610 billion through various support payment schemes in the period 2002-2015, and its municipalities attracted 90 % of the total or EUR 4.126 billion. The EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) area-based payments represented the most significant amount of support payments for municipalities, and most of the payments were received by the municipalities having a large agricultural area and a small population. In the period 2009-2013, the funding of European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and European Fisheries Fund (EFF) projects received by municipalities of Latvia amounted to, on average, EUR 2501 per capita, and there were strong associations between the amounts of support funding per capita and the size of subsidies from the Local Government Equalisation Fund, the managed utilised agricultural area (UAA) and the turnover of enterprises engaged in primary production.","[Nipers, Aleksejs; Pilvere, Irina; Bulderberga, Zane] Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Social Dev, Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,"Pilvere, I (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Social Dev, Jelgava, Latvia.",Irina.Pilvere@llu.lv,"Pilvere, Irina/GNM-7700-2022; Vitolina, Zane/AAF-4767-2019","Pilvere, Irina/0000-0002-8467-1949;",JSC Latvian State Forests [5.5.-5.1._001q_101_14_42],JSC Latvian State Forests,"The research was promoted with the support of the JSC Latvian State Forests, Contract No. 5.5.-5.1._001q_101_14_42.",,27,1,1,0,4,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-261-3,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2017,,45,,,,,176,185,,,,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BI1NY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406530100021,0

To achieve the aim, the following specific tasks were set: 1 to give insight into the situation in the field of sport and mega sports events, placing a particular focus on its impact on region's economics; 2) to analyse the papers of sports impact on economics, biggest sports markets and mega sports events; 3) to assess the EuroBasket 2015 impact on the economy of Latvia. Results showed that Sport and mega sports events can be beneficial to the region's economy, but it is necessary to make in-depth research and estimates to calculate it. The conclusions of the paper are: North America is ahead of the other countries and it makes it as the world's largest sports market and it suggests that the role of sport will continue to grow and that sport not only contributes to better health, people's socializing and belonging to the particular team, but it will also make a significant contribution to the regional or national economics; The EuroBasket 2015 case showed that it is in many ways Beneficial event, especially the impact on the economy of Riga and the country's image building, this suggest that the country needs to encourage large, international tournaments organizing.","[Opolska, Ieva; Proskina, Liga] Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Social Dev, Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,"Opolska, I (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Social Dev, Jelgava, Latvia.",ieva.opolska@gmail.com,"Proskina, Liga/I-5119-2018","Proskina, Liga/0000-0002-3337-7838",,,,,17,0,0,1,14,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-261-3,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2017,,45,,,,,322,329,,,,,,8,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BI1NY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406530100039,0

By using 2SLS estimation techniques, we analyzed the relationship among quality, competition and regulated price. According to the results, competition has a statistically significant (yet weak) negative effect (p = 0.019) on quality. The outcome for quality is likely caused by imperfect information.

General empirical evidence suggests that high export growth is positively associated with the duration of trade relationships. For exporters of highly perishable goods such as fresh salmon, efficient trade relations are important to prevent loss of product quality as time from harvest to final consumption increases. This research analyzes the duration of trade relationships for Norwegian salmon exports. Using highly disaggregated data for the 1999-2009 period, the trade relations for exports of fresh-farmed salmon from Norway are remarkably short. At the firm-to-country level the mean duration is 4 years, Furthermore, the degree of dynamics increases as the data becomes more disaggregated. Market uncertainty in the form of transportation costs and export to countries in the EU are associated with a larger probability for failure. Factors that are associated with a reduced risk of exiting the market are the size of the initial shipment between the trading partners, continuing large shipments and the size of the exporting firm.","[Straume, Hans-Martin] BI Norwegian Business Sch, Dept Econ, POB 6233, N-5893 Bergen, Norway",BI Norwegian Business School,"Straume, HM (通讯作者)，BI Norwegian Business Sch, Dept Econ, POB 6233, N-5893 Bergen, Norway.",hans-martin.straume@bi.no,,"Straume, Hans-Martin/0000-0002-6431-4418",Research Council of Norway [233836],Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),Financial support from the Research Council of Norway (CT#233836) is acknowledged.,,48,31,32,1,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

The results show that spatial spillovers exist not only among the economic growth of neighbors, but also among the initial economic levels of neighbors. Furthermore, the same analysis is conducted for a new specified sample by controlling spatial heterogeneity, and the results show that spatial spillover effects are enhanced and the velocity of convergence is greater.

As a result, there has been an increase in competitiveness and productivity in the agricultural sector in many countries of the European Union, which is inhabited by almost 7 % of the total population of the world, and comprises 2.1 % of the world's land surface. It is not a homogeneous region as regards the level of the agricultural market development, especially the milk market. Since 2004, when Latvia and Poland joined the European Union, the production of cow's milk has risen in spite of the decrease in the population of dairy cattle which has been accompanied by increased efficiency. The decline in consumption of cow's milk and its products, on the other hand, is an unfavourable phenomenon. The aim of the research was to identify the key determinants that influence the milk market in Latvia and Poland. In order to achieve the research objective, the authors have conducted an analysis of the Common Agricultural Policy documents associated particularly with the dairy market. The authors defined the set of agricultural market's determinants in order to achieve the set goal. The research was based on Eurostat data generated for years 2005-2013. Twenty eight variables were used for analysis. A number of determinants were eliminated on the basis of coefficient of variation. The remaining variables were used for conducting examinations involving Hellwig's method to determine the value of the integral capacity of information carriers. According to the analysis, the dairy market in Latvia is considerably influenced by the number of cattle, the age of farmers and agricultural holdings by economic size. The Polish dairy market is affected by the agricultural holdings with agricultural area of less than 5ha and agricultural holdings with the economic size of the farm less than 4000 euro.","[Wasniewska, Anetta] Gdynia Maritime Univ, Gdynia, Poland; [Olszewska, Katarzyna] Univ Appl Sci Elblag, Elblag, Poland",Gdynia Maritime University,"Wasniewska, A (通讯作者)，Gdynia Maritime Univ, Gdynia, Poland.",a.wasniewska@wpit.am.gdynia.pl; k.olszewska@pwsz.elblag.pl,,"Wasniewska, Anetta/0000-0003-1824-7039",,,,,16,0,0,0,0,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-261-3,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2017,,45,,,,,242,249,,,,,,8,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BI1NY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406530100029,0

The objective of this contribution is to test this hypothesis by first developing two theoretical models of behavior, building on the pioneering works of Ellis and McGuire [4] and Pauly and Redisch [11]. Medical ethics is reflected by a parameter alpha, which indicates how much importance the physician attributes to patient well-being relative to his or her own income. Accordingly, a weakening of ethical orientation amounts to a fall in the value of alpha. While traditional economic theory takes preferences as predetermined, more recent contributions view them as endogenous (see, e.g., Frey and Oberholzer-Gee [5]). The model variant based on Ellis and McGuire [4] depicts the behavior of a physician in private practice, while the one based on Pauly and Redisch [11] applies to providers who share resources such as in hospital or group practice. Two changes in the mode of payment are analyzed, one from FFS to prospective payment (PP), the other to pay-for-performance (P4P). One set of predictions relates physician effort to a change in the mode of payment; another, physician effort to a change in alpha, the parameter reflecting ethics. Using these two relationships, a change in ethics can observationally be related to a change in the mode of payment. The predictions derived from the models are pitted against several case studies from diverse countries. A shift from FFS to PP is predicted to give rise to a negative observed relationship between the medical ethics of physicians in private practice under a wide variety of circumstances, more so than a shift to P4P, which can even be seen as enhancing medical ethics, provided physician effort has a sufficiently high marginal effectiveness in terms of patient well-being. This prediction is confirmed to a considerable degree by circumstantial evidence coming from the case studies. As to physicians working in hospital or group practice, the prediction is again that a transition in hospital payment from FFS to PP weakens their ethical orientation. However, this prediction could not be tested because the one hospital study found relates to a transition to P4P, suggesting that this mode of payment may actually enhance medical ethics of healthcare providers working in a hospital or group practice. The claim that moving away from FFS undermines medical ethics is far too sweeping. It can only in part be justified by observed relationships, which even may suggest that a transition to P4P strengthens medical ethics.","[Zweifel, Peter] Univ Zurich, Kreuth 371, A-9531 Bad Bleiberg, Austria; [Janus, Katharina] Univ Ulm, Ulm, Germany; [Janus, Katharina] Columbia Univ, Helmholtzstr 18, D-89081 Ulm, Germany",Ulm University,,peter.zweifel@econ.uzh.ch,,,"Brocher Foundation (Hermance near Geneva, Switzerland)","Brocher Foundation (Hermance near Geneva, Switzerland)","The authors benefited greatly from a thorough checking of their math by Simon Spika, PhD (University Hospital, Zurich) and insightful criticisms by three anonymous referees.

Second, we evaluate the relevance of time-inconsistent behavior for the effectiveness of education policies. For this purpose, we simulate policies where time preferences may play an important role: (1) an increase in the state grant for students as a way to affect short-term costs while at school and (2) an increase in the state grant as a loan that must be paid back after education is completed. We find substantial differences in the educational outcomes when comparing them to the outcomes based on a model specification with exponential discounting. Hence, the common assumption of exponential discounting in educational decisions may be too restrictive.","[Kemptner, Daniel; Tolan, Songuel] DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Tolan, Songuel] Free Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Free University of Berlin,"Kemptner, D (通讯作者)，DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany.",dkemptner@diw.de,,"Tolan, Songul/0000-0002-2323-1878",Fritz Thyssen Foundation [10141098],Fritz Thyssen Foundation,"Valuable comments by Peter Haan, Jaap Abbring, Ulrich Schneider, and two anonymous reviewers as well as by participants at the EEA-ESEM Congress 2016, the Applied Microeconomics Seminars at Tilburg University, and the DIW Berlin are gratefully acknowledged.

This study analyzes results from a household survey across eight coastal villages to investigate how local rural communities utilize these resources. The predominant direct use by households is the extraction of combustible fuel. Econometric results suggest that determinants of the household decision to collect fuelwood include respondent occupation and village. Farmers are less likely to extract mangrove fuels due to the availability of substitutes such as agricultural residues, and are also less likely obtain non-mangrove fuelwood via market purchase. Collection quantities are positively correlated with degree of impoverishment, with poorer households significantly less likely to access non-mangrove fuelwood markets. These results are robust to selection bias, spatial lag dependence, and spatial error dependence, and have important policy implications for beneficiary selection for future mangrove plantations.","[Chow, Jeffrey] Yale Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Chow, Jeffrey] 8 Princess Margaret Rd 6-F, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Yale University,"Chow, J (通讯作者)，Yale Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.;Chow, J (通讯作者)，8 Princess Margaret Rd 6-F, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",jchow.conservation@gmail.com,,"Chow, Jeffrey/0000-0002-3351-7730",United States Environmental Protection Agency Science to Achieve Results Graduate Fellowship [FP917398]; Yale Tropical Resources Institute; Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies,United States Environmental Protection Agency Science to Achieve Results Graduate Fellowship; Yale Tropical Resources Institute; Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies,"This research was funded by the United States Environmental Protection Agency Science to Achieve Results Graduate Fellowship (Grant Number: FP917398), the Yale Tropical Resources Institute, and the Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies.

This result does not depend on any assumption that marginal harvesting cost per unit increases with decreasing stock size.

(2018) attempts to assess economic impacts that could result from the implementation of the Forest Reference Level (FRL) approach included in the recently approved EU LULUCF Regulation. FRLs are country-projected baselines of net emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) from forests, against which the future net emissions will be compared for accounting purposes (i.e. to assess credits or debits towards complying with a climate target). Kallio et al. argue that the harvest limits that they assume to be a consequence of the FRLs would decrease the employment opportunities and jeopardize climate mitigation benefits of EU policies. In our comment, we respond that while the paper of Kallio et al. may be of general interest in analysing the impact of setting binding limits on harvest, it should not be considered as an assessment of the economic impacts of implementing FRLs. Their conclusions are largely invalidated by some misunderstandings on the FRL approach. We first clarify that FRLs are not binding limits on harvest volumes, but rather accounting baselines that ensures that the GHG consequences of changes in forest management (relative to a historical period) are accounted for in a framework comparable to that of other sectors. Second, we explain that FRLs are not based on frozen historical harvest rates, as assumed in the main analysis of Kallio et al., but rather are determined by the interaction between the projected continuation of historical forest management practices, the age-related forest dynamics and the available growing stock volume. The approach actually allows for increasing harvest in the FRL as forests age, without incurring an accounting debit. We hope that these clarifications contribute to a correct understanding of the FRL approach and encourage a constructive dialogue between research communities reflecting different perspectives.","[Grassi, G.; Camia, A.; Fiorese, G.; Jonsson, R.; Pilli, R.; Robert, N.; Vizzarri, M.] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy; [House, J.] Univ Bristol, Cabot Inst, Dept Geog Sci, Bristol BS8 1SS, Avon, England; [Kurz, W.

For robust results, we apply two different incentivised online experiments including a Holt and Laury task (HL) and an Eckel and Grossman (EG) task as well as a self-assessment question (SA). The multi-method comparison additionally allows for testing on the consistency of these established risk measurement tasks. Furthermore, we compare foresters' risk attitudes with the well-analysed risk attitudes of farmers. Our results show that foresters are predominantly risk-averse. Self-employed foresters are more risk averse than self-employed farmers, which should be accounted for when designing adequate policy measures. The analysis of risk attitude measurement methods reveal that the EG values correlate with the HL values across both groups, although risk-aversion coefficients differ in their magnitude. Thus, the two experimental methods are consistent in relative terms, and across occupational groups.","[Sauter, Philipp A.; Hermann, Daniel; Musshoff, Oliver] Georg August Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Sauter, PA (通讯作者)，Georg August Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany.",psauter@gwdg.de,"Hermann, Daniel/HNI-8466-2023; Mußhoff, Oliver/AAZ-1868-2021","Hermann, Daniel/0000-0003-0023-3675; Mußhoff, Oliver/0000-0002-3746-623X",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG),Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),The authors would like to thank two anonymous referees and the editor for helpful comments and suggestions.

Using data from the National Agricultural Workers Surveys for the years 2000-2012, this article employs propensity score matching and probit estimation techniques to examine the health care utilization of hired farmworkers. This study's results indicate that undocumented hired farmworkers are 10.7 and 3% less likely to use U.S. and foreign health care, respectively, compared to documented farmworkers. Health insurance is found to significantly increase hired farmworkers' use of U.S. health care by 22.3%. Notably, compared to their documented working peers, undocumented workers are much less likely to patronize private clinics. They are even less likely to rely on migrant health centers even when these providers are their most viable sources of health care service.","[Luo, Tianyuan; Escalante, Cesar L.] Univ Georgia, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, 305 Conner Hall,147 Cedar St, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Escalante, CL (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, 305 Conner Hall,147 Cedar St, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",cescalan@uga.edu,"Escalante, Cesar/GLV-6777-2022","Escalante, Cesar/0000-0002-0789-8330",,,,,30,9,17,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

However, academic performance of children in the experimental group was higher for children with poorly educated fathers, but lower for children with poorly educated mothers. Hence, the effects of high-quality preschool education worked in opposing directions-equalizing by compensating for the effect of father's level of education, and disequalizing by reinforcing the effect of mother's level of education.","[Morabito, Christian; Vandenbroeck, Michel] Univ Ghent, Dept Social Work & Social Pedag, Ghent, Belgium; [Van de Gaer, Dirk] Univ Ghent, Dept Social Econ, Ghent, Belgium; [Van de Gaer, Dirk] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Figueroa, Jose Luis] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Ghent University; Ghent University; Universite Catholique Louvain; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Van de Gaer, D (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Social Econ, Ghent, Belgium.;Van de Gaer, D (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.",dirk.vandegaer@ugent.be,"Vandenbroeck, Michel/AHI-2292-2022","Vandenbroeck, Michel/0000-0003-1448-1047",FWO-Flanders [G.0791.12],FWO-Flanders(FWO),"The authors are grateful to Professor Peter Venables, former and Principal Investigator of the JCHP, for permission to access the data.

In contrast, I find a pumping fee implemented by a group of irrigators in Southern Colorado effectively crowds-in pro-conservation norms, enhancing the financial incentive's impact. Using a unique, spatially oriented panel-data set of groundwater wells, I separate the direct role of increased pumping costs from the indirect effect transmitted through altered conservation norms. To quantify conservation behavior, I estimate how pumping at one well responds to pumping at nearby wells using instrumental variables to address simultaneity bias and interact that behavior with a difference-in-difference framework to assess the influence of the intervention. In the preferred specification, the fee directly accounts for approximately 74% of the reduced pumping and the remaining 26% comes from crowding in conservation norms. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The assumption is that technological/cultural evolution will soon entirely substitute for the biological processes which underlie human existence and, by analogy, the existence of other independently evolved intelligent beings, if any. Various modes of postbiological evolution of humans have been envisioned in both fictional and discursive contexts (uploading, cyborgization, technological singularity, etc.). Little thought has been devoted so far to the question whether these postbiological modes are truly final in both logical and conceptual terms. What lies beyond the postbiological realm? Clearly, only a few radical speculations on the topic can be offered. In this paper, it is argued that in a sufficiently broad subset of scenarios for postbiological evolution there will be a kind of reverse trend: the one of reintegration with the (astro)biological universe, by that point understood in a much wider and more inclusive sense. The argument for such reintegration could be understood through the metaphor of expanding Klein bottle as a symbolic image of the post-postbiological evolutionary trajectories. This kind of trajectory will lead to the state in which products of culture are indistinguishable from the natural environment, suggesting practical consequences for our SETI efforts.","[Cirkovic, Milan M.] Astron Observ Belgrade, Volgina 7, Belgrade 11000, Serbia; [Cirkovic, Milan M.] Univ Oxford, Fac Philosophy, Future Human Inst, Suite 8,Littlegate House,16-17 St Ebbes St, Oxford OX1 1PT, England",University of Oxford,"Cirkovic, MM (通讯作者)，Astron Observ Belgrade, Volgina 7, Belgrade 11000, Serbia.",mcirkovic@aob.rs,"Ćirković, Milan M./GWU-9737-2022","Ćirković, Milan M./0000-0002-6634-1321","Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia [ON176021, ON179048]","Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia","Useful comments of an anonymous referee are hereby acknowledged.

However, there exist significant inequalities in achieving universal coverage of child vaccination among and within countries. In this paper, we examine rural-urban inequalities in child immunizations in Ghana. Using data from the recent two waves of the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey, we examine the probability that a child between 12 and 59 months receives the required vaccinations and proceed to decompose the sources of inequalities in the probability of full immunization between rural and urban areas. We find significant child-specific, maternal and household characteristics on a child's immunization status. The results show that children in rural areas are more likely to complete the required vaccinations. The direction and sources of inequalities in child immunizations have changed between the two survey waves. We find a pro-urban advantage in 2008 arising from differences in observed characteristics whilst a pro-rural advantage emerges in 2014 dominated by the differences in coefficients. Health system development and campaign efforts have focused on rural areas. There is a need to also specifically target vulnerable children in urban areas, to maintain focus on women empowerment and pay attention to children from high socio-economic households in less favourable economic times.","[Asuman, Derek; Ackah, Charles Godfred] Univ Ghana, Inst Stat Social & Econ Res, EN Omaboe Bldg,POB LG 74, Legon, Ghana; [Enemark, Ulrika] Aarhus Univ, Sect Hlth Promot & Hlth Serv Res, Dept Publ Hlth, Bartholins Alle 2, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",University of Ghana; Aarhus University,"Ackah, CG (通讯作者)，Univ Ghana, Inst Stat Social & Econ Res, EN Omaboe Bldg,POB LG 74, Legon, Ghana.",cakach@ug.edu.gh,"Ackah, Charles/AAN-3184-2020","Asuman, Derek/0000-0002-3759-7651; Ackah, Charles/0000-0001-9060-7807",,,,,46,31,32,0,3,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

J,"Hajizadeh, M",,,,"Hajizadeh, Mohammad",,,Does socioeconomic status affect lengthy wait time in Canada? Evidence from Canadian Community Health Surveys,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Socioeconomic status; Wait time; Absolute and relative inequalities; Decomposition; Canada,INEQUALITIES; CARE; EQUITY; SURGERY,"Reasonable access to health services without financial or other barriers is a primary objective of the Canadian health system. Notwithstanding such concern about accessibility of services, long waiting times for health services have been a prominent health policy issue in recent years. Using pooled data from four nationally representative Canadian Community Health Surveys (CCHSs, 2000/01, 2003, 2005 and 2010; n = 266,962) we examine socioeconomic inequality in lengthy wait time (LWT) to health care among adults (aged 18-65) in Canada. The relative and absolute concentration indices (RC and AC, respectively) are used to quantify income-related inequality in LWT in Canada and for its provinces. Additionally, we decompose the RC and AC indices to identify factors affecting income-related inequality in LWT. Our descriptive results show that, on average, 5% of Canadian adults experienced LWT to access health services in the past 12 months. While 3% of the residents of British Columbia and Saskatchewan reported LWT to access health care services, this figure was 7% in Quebec. Our findings also demonstrated that LWT was mainly concentrated among the poor in Canada [RC = -0.039; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.049 to -0.028 and AC = -0.067; CI -0.086 to -0.049]. The RC and AC suggested statistically significant pro-rich inequality of LWT in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and British Columbia. Decomposition analyses indicate that, besides income itself, health status (measured by a set of 15 chronic condition indicators), immigration status and geographical factors were the most important factors contributing to the concentration of LWT among the poor in Canada. These results provide some evidence that low-income individuals tend to have lengthier wait times for publicly-funded health care in Canada in comparison to their high-income counterparts. The observed negative gradient between income and long waiting time may be interpreted as evidence of socioeconomic inequity within Canadian health care system. Thus, further work is required to understand the mechanisms explaining the concentration of long wait time among the poor in Canada.","[Hajizadeh, Mohammad] Dalhousie Univ, Sch Hlth Adm, Fac Hlth Profess, Sir Charles Tupper Med Bldg,5850 Coll St, Halifax, NS, Canada",Dalhousie University,"Hajizadeh, M (通讯作者)，Dalhousie Univ, Sch Hlth Adm, Fac Hlth Profess, Sir Charles Tupper Med Bldg,5850 Coll St, Halifax, NS, Canada.",m.hajizadeh@dal.ca,,"Hajizadeh, Mohammad/0000-0002-4591-8531","Faculty of Health Professions Research Development Grant, Dalhousie University","Faculty of Health Professions Research Development Grant, Dalhousie University","The author acknowledges funding for this research provided by the Faculty of Health Professions Research Development Grant, Dalhousie University.",,55,10,11,1,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Using a panel data set that combines municipal-level deforestation and election data from 2002 to 2012, I estimate the effect of an incumbent mayor running for re-election on deforestation rates in election periods. I find that deforestation rates increase 8-10% in election years when an incumbent mayor runs for re-election, an amount equivalent to four percent of the total forest lost since the 2004 elections. Electoral deforestation cycles do not appear to be driven by changes in agricultural policy implementation and activity, but are linked to corruption and campaign finance, suggesting that weak institutional constraints facilitate electoral manipulation of forest resources. This phenomenon is not likely limited to Amazonian forests; re-election incentives could very well lead to misallocation of other natural resources in alternate geographies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The following paper puts forward four scenarios based on these drivers. The first describes an authoritarian national Libyan government cooperating in the context of European foreign policies predominantly focused on terrorism and migration. The second foresees the same multiplicity and limited scope of European foreign policies, while anarchy reigns in Libya. The third juxtaposes a more cohesive and broad EU foreign policy with anarchy in Libya, while the fourth presupposes inclusive national Libyan governance and the move towards a coherent EU foreign policy of a broader thematic scope.","[Sutpen, Benjamin Thomas] Hertie Sch Governance, Berlin, Germany",Hertie School,"Sutpen, BT (通讯作者)，Hertie Sch Governance, Berlin, Germany.",lkwesij@gmx.net,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,2,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,MAR,2018,97.0,,,,SI,,47,52,,10.1016/j.futures.2017.05.003,0.0,,,6,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,GA7AD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428485900006,0

We show that choices in high school and in higher education are partly driven by expected earnings for boys but less for girls. Boys choose more often courses with a component in Sciences and competitive pathways. In high school, gender differences are higher for pupils at the same level in Mathematics and Humanities and are largely due to differences in marginal impact of test scores, Which are lower for girls.

To address these challenges, Chhattisgarh state in India has established a MDR-TB financial protection policy by creating MDR-TB benefit packages as part of the universal health insurance scheme that the state has rolled out in their effort towards attaining Universal Health Coverage for all its residents. In these schemes the state purchases health insurance against set packages of services from third party health insurance agencies on behalf of all its residents. Provider payment reform by strategic purchasing through output based payments (lump sum fee is reimbursed as per the MDR-TB benefit package rates) to the providers - both public and private health facilities empanelled under the insurance scheme was the key intervention. Aim: To understand the implementation gap between policy and practice of the benefit packages with respect to equity in utilization of package claims by the poor patients in public and private sector. Methods: Data from primary health insurance claims from January 2013 to December 2015, were analysed using an extension of 'Kingdon's multiple streams for policy implementation framework' to explain the implementation gap between policy and practice of the MDR-TB benefit packages. Results: The total number of claims for MDR-TB benefit packages increased over the study period mainly from poor patients treated in public facilities, particularly for the pre-treatment evaluation and hospital stay packages. Variations and inequities in utilizing the packages were observed between poor and non-poor beneficiaries in public and private sector. Private providers participation in the new MDR-TB financial protection mechanism through the universal health insurance scheme was observed to be much lower than might be expected given their share of healthcare provision overall in India. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that there may be an implementation gap due to weak coupling between the problem and the policy streams, reflecting weak coordination between state nodal agency and the state TB department. There is a pressing need to build strong institutional capacity of the public and private sector for improving service delivery to MDR-TB patients through this new health insurance mechanism.","[Kundu, Debashish; Chadha, Sarabjit] South East Asia Off, Qutub Inst Area, Int Union TB & Lung Dis Union, C-6, New Delhi 110016, India; [Sharma, Nandini] Maulana Azad Med Coll, Dept Community Med, New Delhi, India; [Laokri, Samia] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium; [Awungafac, George] Minist Hlth, African Soc Lab Med, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Jiang, Lai] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, Ctr Instruct Psychol & Technol, Leuven, Belgium; [Asaria, Miqdad] Imperial Coll London, Global Hlth & Dev, London, England; [Asaria, Miqdad] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England",Maulana Azad Medical College; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; KU Leuven; Imperial College London; University of York - UK,"Kundu, D (通讯作者)，South East Asia Off, Qutub Inst Area, Int Union TB & Lung Dis Union, C-6, New Delhi 110016, India.",debashishkundu@yahoo.com,"Asaria, Miqdad/T-9980-2019; Awungafac, George/Y-4075-2019; Awungafac, George/AAV-8385-2020; Kundu, Debashish/J-3018-2014","Asaria, Miqdad/0000-0002-3538-4417; Awungafac, George/0000-0002-5859-0336; Awungafac, George/0000-0002-5859-0336; Jiang, Lai/0000-0003-3721-7249; Kundu, Debashish/0000-0002-3756-8623",,,,,49,10,11,1,8,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

Although regulators are assumed to work for the best interest of the people, they can have their own rational agendas; such as career advancement, self-aggrandizement and loyalty for a particular political ideology. We show that when officials are non-benevolent and agencies have unequal relative decision-making power, it is likely that a more powerful agency dictates policies in favor of its own agenda, even when such policies may not necessarily lead to optimal social welfare. In the case of aquaculture, higher relative power of a pro-environment agency leads to underdevelopment of the sector, as is the case in developed countries, whereas larger relative power of a pro-industry agency leads to higher growth, as is the case in developing countries.","[Abate, Tenaw Gedefaw] Northern Res Inst Norut, Sykehusvn 21, N-9294 Tromso, Norway; [Nielsen, Rasmus; Nielsen, Max] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Abate, TG (通讯作者)，Northern Res Inst Norut, Sykehusvn 21, N-9294 Tromso, Norway.",tenaw@norut.no,"Nielsen, max/F-4544-2015; Nielsen, Rasmus/P-4322-2014","Nielsen, Rasmus/0000-0001-7357-6965",,,,,47,34,35,1,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

J,"Adlung, R",,,,"Adlung, Rudolf",,,Brexit from a WTO/GATS Perspective: Towards an Easy Divorce?,JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,TRADE,"Virtually all studies dealing with the WTO-related aspects of Brexit, the United Kingdom's (UK's) envisaged separation from the European Union, tend to focus on the ramifications for merchandise trade. Services trade rarely enters the picture, reflecting an apparently prevailing view that the reallocation of the existing pre-Brexit obligations requires little more than some drafting changes. This article begs to disagree, arguing that there are a variety of complex legal issues involved. These are related, inter alia, to the conceptual broadening of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) beyond conventional cross-border trade to three more types of transaction and its extension, in addition to the treatment of products (services), to that of producers (service suppliers). The competitive conditions of foreign producers that are established within a Member's territory are thus covered by the Agreement. With this in view, the article points out scenarios under which these producers are adversely affected by the termination of the UK's single-market status and the ensuing (re-) introduction of restrictions on market access and national treatment under GATS Articles XVI and XVII and/ or the (re-) appearance of regulatory impediments in bilateral trade. In turn, this might provide a basis for the home countries to seek compensation. The article also identifies GATS-scheduled limitations that, because of the Most-favoured-Nation principle, cannot be maintained in trade among independent WTO Members. Depending on their nature, the resulting adjustments might lead to compensation claims as well.",,,,rudolf.adlung@gmail.com,,,,,,,22,1,1,1,3,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Studies confirm the rising importance of intellectual capital disclosure and its key categories by the publicly listed entities in promoting corporate governance and better flow of information for the stakeholders what subsequently improves general stock market transparency. Although there is a plethora of studies of intellectual capital disclosure in terms of practices, techniques, methods and international comparisons there is a gap among prior studies in respect of longitudinal research. This gap derives partially from the fact that there are not that many publicly listed companies that report extensively over a longer period of time. As a consequence, main motivations of undertaking the research in the proposed paper are: the importance of the topic and the above-mentioned gap in the literature. The aim of the paper is to examine the extent and quality of intellectual capital reporting of one company (Microsoft) over a period of 20 years from 1998 to 2017. In order to enable comparability with previous studies, proposed research was based on the framework initially developed by Guthrie and Petty (2000). Achieved results suggest that IC disclosure during 20 years is rising in terms of extent and quality, what is observed within all of IC categories, however the trend is relatively weak, due to large fluctuations (mostly in the case of relational capital). The most significant growth (despite variations) was observed in terms of relational capital, which appeared also to be the most frequent IC item reported, mostly due to: brands identification and depiction, corporate reputation and proactive customer approach, including their perception by the firm in the context of shaping the future strategy. Structural capital was named as second most often disclosed IC category, mostly due to intellectual properties descriptions. Human capital information contained mostly data on total employment, remuneration and employee stock option plan. In addition, IC reporting was mostly found in factual (verified) form rather than narrative (unverified). The research methods adopted for this study are: content analysis and tools of descriptive statistics. As a source of data annual reports were utilized.","[Bryl, Lukasz] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Al Niepodleglosci 10, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Bryl, L (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Al Niepodleglosci 10, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland.",lukasz.bryl@ue.poznan.pl,,,,,,,52,1,1,0,3,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,683,695,,,,,,13,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200060,0

In other words, a firm hires a manager with preferences for environmental concerns and to whom the firms' owners delegate both sales and the decision with regard to the optimal level of green technology adoption. When the duopoly is the given market structure of the industry, if the environmental sensitivity of the green managers is extremely low, then the engagement in ECSR is the firms' dominant strategy, regardless the efficiency level of the available abatement technology. Nonetheless, firms are cast into a prisoner's dilemma situation. On the other hand, if the green manager has low - intermediate/intermediate environmental sensitivity levels, then it occurs that either no ECSR, multiple symmetric equilibria, or ECSR engagement emerge in equilibrium, depending on the efficiency levels of the available abatement technology. Finally, if the environmental sensitivity of the managers is adequately high, then firms do not engage in ECSR, regardless of the efficiency level of the abatement technology. When it is considered a market entry game in which the entrant has to follow the established common practice in the industry, it is shown that an incumbent firm can strategically adopt ECSR for entry deterrence reasons. These results provide additional reasons for the recently observed widespread diffusion of ECSR activities related to carbon emissions reductions and their reporting.","[Buccella, Domenico; Wojna, Michal] Kozminski Univ Warsaw, Dept Econ, Warsaw, Poland",Kozminski University,"Buccella, D (通讯作者)，Kozminski Univ Warsaw, Dept Econ, Warsaw, Poland.",buccella@kozminski.edu.pl; michwoj@kozminski.edu.pl,"Buccella, Domenico/F-8981-2019",,Kozminski University,Kozminski University,This article has received financial support from the statutory funds for research activities of the Kozminski University.,,14,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,98,108,,,,,,11,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO8KK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000527683300010,0

We evaluate in-sample forecasts and one-step-ahead out-of-sample forecasts from recursive ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates. We also test permanent income and precautionary savings hypotheses with our results. We use overall indices of CNBC-e and Turkstat-CBRT Surveys, and Consumer Expectations Index (CEI) and Propensity to Consume Index (PCI) from the CNBC-e Survey as sentiment measures. We show that the lagged values of consumer sentiment have explanatory power on consumption growth. However, when used in conjunction with other economic variables such as real labor income, real stock price, real interest rate, and exchange rate, only CNBC-e for total consumption, and CBRT and PCI for nondurable consumption provide independent information about future consumption growth. Similarly, the gains in out-of-sample forecasts are observed under the absence of other variables and disappear in almost all cases following their inclusion to the estimations. Finally, we find no clear evidence for either precautionary savings motive or permanent income hypothesis on the link between consumer sentiment and future total consumption changes.","[Can, Hatice Gokce Karasoy; Yunculer, Caglar] Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, Anafartalar Mahallesi Istiklal Cad 10, TR-06050 Ulus Ankara, Turkey; [Can, Hatice Gokce Karasoy] Bilkent Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey",Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University,"Can, HGK (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, Anafartalar Mahallesi Istiklal Cad 10, TR-06050 Ulus Ankara, Turkey.",gokce.karasoy@tcmb.gov.tr,,,,,,,32,9,12,2,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Further analysis reveals a sharp gender division in patterns of family care in China. While men are more likely to receive care from their wives, women are primarily cared for by their children. Marital status and spouse health also affect provision of care, with infirm women who have healthy husbands less likely to receive care than infirm men with healthy wives.

By analyzing the daily closing total return of CSI 300 index and its individual returns of stocks, we find that relatively high or low sentiment induces active positive feedback trading. With a specific indicator of sentiment, we explain the microstructure setting of the relationship between positive feedback trading and sentiment. We adopt the classical feedback model from Sentana and Wadhwani (1992) to measure positive feedback trading behavior. By adding sentiment factor to the model, we successfully explain how sentiment influences the behavior of both feedback traders and rational investors. The empirical findings suggest that positive feedback traders are more likely to trade when the prices of most securities move forward together. When the sentiment of feedback traders is at an intermediate level, the feedback trading behavior is insignificant.","[Dai, Zhi-Min; Yang, De-Cheng] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Econ, Room 419,38 Zheda Rd, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University,"Yang, DC (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Coll Econ, Room 419,38 Zheda Rd, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",yangdecheng2014@hotmail.com,,,,,,,20,8,8,7,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Innovativeness is considered one of the most important requirements for both companies and employees. Even such traditional entities like banks should develop their propensity and ability to incorporate changes in business practices through the creation and adoption of new ideas, solutions, and technology. The purpose of the paper is to investigate to what extent bank's innovativeness impacts a bank's market performance. It presents banks' innovativeness and other competitive advantage factors, their assessment from the perspective of their potential in the process of building bank's competitive advantage and a correlation between the level of bank's innovativeness and market efficiency. The majority of the innovativeness research concentrate on developed countries and very little is known about developing, transition countries. Moreover, few of them explore banks as a specific entity. On the banking market, they focus rather on distribution channels or product innovations. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first attempt to empirically examine the relationship between a bank's innovativeness and market efficiency in a transition banking market in Europe. The paper uses data retrieved from the research survey. The survey's target group consisted of all retail banks operating in Poland defined as banks that offer a broad range of financial services to different segments of individual customers. The research was conducted under the auspices of the Polish Banks Association. The data was collected by two methods - PAPI (personal and pencil interviews) and CAWI (computer assisted web interviews). The questionnaire was applied to executive managers of retail banks operating on Polish banking market and banks' customers. The data used for assessing banks' market performance were derived from banks' annual reports. The results provide direction for banks' decision makers concerning innovativeness' factors that should be taken into account in the process of building competitive advantage and market performance.","[Klimontowicz, Monika] Univ Econ Katowice, 1 Maja 50 St, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Klimontowicz, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, 1 Maja 50 St, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland.",mklimontowicz@ue.katowice.pl,"Klimontowicz, Monika/G-3281-2014","Klimontowicz, Monika/0000-0001-9215-1938",,,,,50,2,2,0,3,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,251,264,,,,,,14,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200023,0

This paper quantifies the magnitude of these behavioral effects using data from an experiment on real product choices together with a structural model of consumer behavior. First, we show that information about external effects (products' embodied carbon emissions) triggers voluntary substitution towards cleaner alternatives, and we estimate that this effect is equivalent to a change in relative prices of GBP30.69-165.15/tCO(2). Second, comparing a Pigovian intervention (GBP19/tCO(2)) with a neutrally-framed price change of the same magnitude, we find a negative behavioral effect associated with regulation. Compensating this bias would require increasing the Pigovian price signal by up to 48.06/tCO(2). Finally, based on a cross-product comparison, we show that the magnitude of behavioral effects declines with substitutability between clean and dirty product alternatives, a measure of effort to reduce emissions.

Third, we find that existing FTA relationship with other countries positively affect cross-border M&As between a FTA country-pair. But these third-country FTA effects differ for acquiring country and target country when we look at the ratio of a country-pair's FTA relative to the acquiring country's total foreign M&As.

And given the special background in China, it is significant to dialectically analyze the implementation of stock option incentive. This paper starts with the basic theory of equity incentive, analyzes the existing problems of equity incentive in China, and gives the corresponding solutions. Finally, by means of literature review and field research, this paper finds that listed companies in China are faced by the following problems: hitchhiking, fewer objects of equity incentive and incomplete assessment system.

We are particularly interested in obtaining a multivariate construct that allows for considerable degree of heterogeneity in marginal properties of its components (like tail thickness and asymmetry). Moreover, we consider non-standard dependence patterns that go beyond a linear correlation-type relationship while maintaining simplicity, obtained by introducing rotations. We make use of marginal distributions that belong to generalized asymmetric t class analysed by Harvey and Lange (2017), allowing not only for skewness but also for asymmetric tail thickness. We illustrate flexibility of the resulting bivariate distribution and investigate its empirical performance examining unconditional properties of bivariate daily financial series representing dynamics of stock price indices and the related FUTURES contracts.","[Mazur, Blazej; Pipien, Mateusz] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Econometr & Operat Res, Rakowicka 27, Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Mazur, B (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Econometr & Operat Res, Rakowicka 27, Krakow, Poland.",eomazur@cyf-kr.edu.pl; eepipien@cyf-kr.edu.pl,"Mazur, Błażej/V-3905-2018","Mazur, Błażej/0000-0001-5096-5175","National Science Centre, Poland [2017/25/B/HS4/02529]","National Science Centre, Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)","This research was supported by the research grant 2017/25/B/HS4/02529 financed by the National Science Centre, Poland.",,11,0,0,0,0,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",2545-1227,,978-83-65907-20-2,SOC ECON MODEL FOREC,,,2018,1.0,,,,,,296,305,,10.14659/SEMF.2018.01.30,0.0,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BQ1LQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000576774700030,0

A range of scientific methods for developing scenarios is available, but we argue that they have limited capacity to investigate complex social-ecological futures because: 1) non-linear change is rarely incorporated and: 2) they rarely involve co-evolutionary dynamics of integrated social-ecological systems. This manuscript intends to address these two concerns by applying the method of science fiction prototyping to developing scenarios for the future of global fisheries in a changing global ocean. We used an empirically informed background on existing and emerging trends in marine natural resource use and dynamics to develop four 'radical ocean futures,' incorporating and extrapolating from existing environmental, technological, social and economic trends. We argue that the distinctive method as applied here can complement existing scenario methodologies and assist scientists in developing a holistic understanding of complex systems dynamics. The approach holds promise for making scenarios more accessible and interesting to non-academics and can be useful for developing proactive governance mechanisms.","[Merrie, Andrew; Metian, Marc; Osterblom, Henrik] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Keys, Patrick] Colorado State Univ, Sch Global Environm Sustainabil, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Metian, Marc] IAEA, Environm Labs, 4a Quai Antoine Ier, MC-98000 Principality Monaco, Monaco",Stockholm University; Colorado State University,"Merrie, A (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",andrew.merrie@su.se,"Metian, Marc/F-8010-2018; Keys, Patrick/AAK-1359-2021; Osterblom, Henrik G/D-4249-2012","Metian, Marc/0000-0003-1485-5029; Keys, Patrick/0000-0002-7250-1563; Osterblom, Henrik/0000-0002-1913-5197",Mistra (the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research); Baltic Ecosystem Adaptive Management (BEAM) Program,Mistra (the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research); Baltic Ecosystem Adaptive Management (BEAM) Program,"The Nippon Foundation-University of British Columbia Nereus program is a collaborative initiative by the Nippon Foundation, The University of British Columbia, the Stockholm Resilience Centre, and four additional partners.

When a stimulant (destimulant) is normalized, for each object the share of its distances from the maximum (minimum) in the total distance from the maximum (minimum) of all objects is determined. Such transformation meets the requirements of normalisation - deprives variables their units and unifies their ranges. Normalisation with respect to the pattern has properties suggested in the literature - preserves skewness, kurtosis and the Pearson correlation coefficients. Moreover, although the current data are the sole data used to convert variables, normalized diagnostic variables are comparable across time. This feature gives an advantage of pattern normalisation over other methods in dynamic analysis of complex phenomena. The article uses normalisation with respect to the pattern in construction of Hellwig's measure of development, in which Euclidean distances from an abstract ideal point are calculated. Since normalized diagnostic variables become destimulants with the minimum value equals 0, the ideal point used to construct a synthetic measure is constant over time. So, the values of modified measures are comparable both across objects and time. One can compare the positions of objects in the rankings as well as the values of the measures themselves (calculate the increments of values, descriptive characteristics, etc.).","[Mueller-Fraczek, Iwona] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Fac Econ Sci & Management, Gagarina 13A, PL-87100 Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Müller-Fraczek, I (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Fac Econ Sci & Management, Gagarina 13A, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.",muller@econ.umk.pl,"Müller-Frączek, Iwona/E-6592-2019","Müller-Frączek, Iwona/0000-0002-1996-3275",,,,,18,3,3,0,1,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",2545-1227,,978-83-65907-20-2,SOC ECON MODEL FOREC,,,2018,1.0,,,,,,326,334,,10.14659/SEMF.2018.01.33,0.0,,,9,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BQ1LQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000576774700033,0

Top managers and owners in SMEs have eminent decision-making influence. Any pursuit of increasing MO in SMEs is hence heavily dependent on their emphasis on MO. Should they support such an effort and investment, they should be able to see clear evidence of return on their investment. The purpose of this study was to conduct a unique investigation into the link between emphasis of top managers on MO, level of MO and business performance in the context of SMEs. Actual level of MO as well as top managers emphasis on MO were examined using the same Narver and Slater's (1990) 15-items scale. This indirect and thorough approach to investigation of top management emphasis was unprecedented to date. Business performance was evaluated by both subjective and objective measures. The results obtained from a sample of 150 Czech SMEs in the manufacturing industry showed strong positive relationship for emphasis of top managers on MO and MO, positive relationship of MO and subjective performance, while no relationship at all was found for MO and ROA as an objective measure of performance.","[Novinsky, Marek; Marik, Jiri; Karlicek, Miroslav] Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Mkt, 4 W Churchill Sq, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Novinsky, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Mkt, 4 W Churchill Sq, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",marek.novinsky@vse.cz; jiri.marik@vse.cz; miroslav.karlicek@vse.cz,"Karlicek, Miroslav/AAK-2659-2020",,,,,,13,0,0,1,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,1253,1262,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400124,0

This study examines this process in the 'middle tier' of business education: that is, in the social space in which students and instructors understand themselves to occupy a 'mid-range' position within an order of excellence and success. Largely articulated through business school rankings, this order strongly relies on the centrality of the financial curriculum, proficiency in which is understood as both a proxy for smartness and a sign of moneymaking capacity. In the 'middle tier', this order manifests in the form of an anxiety: an order that, though legitimate, is thought not to be attained, or hardly attainable. The study draws from ethnographic investigation in a 'middle tier' business school with attention to how finance is made sense of in relation to an alternative curriculum, and in connection with the aim of 'making it to the top'. A comparison with a 'top tier' business school allows furthering understanding of how the order of business schools relies on the anxiety of finance in order to reproduce an acquiescence to dominant financial imagination.","[Ortiz, Horacio] East China Normal Univ, Res Inst Anthropol, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Ortiz, Horacio] PSL Res Univ, Univ Paris Dauphine, CNRS, UMR 7170,IRISSO, Paris, France; [Muniesa, Fabian] PSL Res Univ, Mines ParisTech, CNRS, UMR 9217,Ctr Sociol Innovat, Paris, France",East China Normal University; Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite PSL; MINES ParisTech,"Muniesa, F (通讯作者)，Mines ParisTech, Ctr Sociol Innovat, 60 Blvd St Michel, F-75272 Paris 06, France.",fabian.muniesa@mines-paristech.fr,"Muniesa, Fabian/C-4650-2008",,European Research Council [263529]; European Research Council (ERC) [263529] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),This work was supported by the European Research Council [grant no. 263529].,,58,2,3,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

The purpose of the present paper is to examine the role that international technology transfer plays in the development of EU countries. Owing to the fact that neither of the two categories is measurable, the study uses a soft-modelling method which allows for measuring and analysis of the relationships among the latent variables.","[Skrodzka, Iwona] Univ Bialystok, Dept Econometr & Stat, Warszawska 63, PL-15062 Bialystok, Poland",University of Bialystok,"Skrodzka, I (通讯作者)，Univ Bialystok, Dept Econometr & Stat, Warszawska 63, PL-15062 Bialystok, Poland.",i.skrodzka@uwb.edu.pl,,"Skrodzka, Iwona/0000-0002-3261-8687",,,,,15,0,0,0,2,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",2545-1227,,978-83-65907-20-2,SOC ECON MODEL FOREC,,,2018,1.0,,,,,,463,472,,10.14659/SEMF.2018.01.47,0.0,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BQ1LQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000576774700047,0

The use of CSR strategy may represent a crucial component of competitiveness of a business. CSR application in business means that the company also takes into consideration environmental and social aspects and impacts of its activities, products and services. Today's customers look for not only high-quality products and services, but they also observe the behaviour and the strategy of companies from the point of view of their environmental and social impacts. This concept is important not only for customers, but also for other stakeholders (investors, employees, suppliers, the public, media, the state and other similar stakeholders). CSR issues are increasingly important for the automotive industry. The aim of this paper is to present and to compare approaches to CSR communicated by selected companies producing passenger cars in the Czech Republic on their websites. The attention is primarily focused on those economic, environmental and social aspects of CSR that are considered important by these companies with regard to their business sector; selected companies communicate these aspects by means of websites to their stakeholders.

Economic and social impact of migration is significant and Romania has faced and continues to face the negative consequences of migration of young educated people, and social problems due to families where one or both parents are working abroad and children remain in the care of relatives. The authors analyze the economic impact of migration at European Union level, by using statistical regression models to allow decision-makers to take the most appropriate measures in the context of globalization. The main indicators that were used are the net remittances of workers and the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita. The main conclusion of the research is that the net remittances of workers and the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita are moving proportionally, therefore a positive net remission is a prerequisite to improve the economic performance, and the negative net remittances of labor, have negative effects on the economic performance.

By combining different perspectives from the field of economic sociology, we demonstrate how competition on Chaturbate is shaped by various market devices whose strategic negotiation informs and is informed by - the moral economy articulated on web forums where models gather to discuss their work experiences and market strategies. We first introduce Chaturbate and the ways in which it organizes market competition, surveying the environment models have to negotiate. We then zoom in on two controversial strategies for beating the competition, each of which upset the moral economy of Chaturbate's model community. Subsequently, we turn to what models term 'the hustle,' which encompasses a number of competitive strategies and criteria judged to be fair and thus legitimate. The final part of our analysis considers the limitations of the hustle, as well as the meritocratic and entrepreneurial discourse that surround it, in light of what we identify as Chaturbate's 'manufactured uncertainty.'","[van Doorn, Niels] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Media Studies, Turfdraagsterpad 9, NL-1012 XT Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Velthuis, Olav] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Sociol, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam; University of Amsterdam,"Van Doorn, N (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Dept Media Studies, Turfdraagsterpad 9, NL-1012 XT Amsterdam, Netherlands.",nielsvandoorn@uva.nl,,,Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study in the Humanities and Social Sciences (NIAS),Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study in the Humanities and Social Sciences (NIAS),"This work was supported by the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study in the Humanities and Social Sciences (NIAS), which awarded both authors a NIAS Individual Fellowship during the 2016-2017 year.",,39,38,42,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

The present paper explores this hypothesis, using data from Sub-Saharan Africa. We rely on monthly data at the cell level (0.5 x 0.5 degrees), an approach that is tailored to the short-lived and local nature of the phenomenon. Using a drought index to proxy for weather shocks, we find that a one-standard-deviation fall in the index (signaling drier conditions) raises the likelihood of riots in a given cell and month by 8.3%. We further observe that the effect of unusually dry weather conditions is substantially larger in cells with a lower availability of water resources (such as rivers and lakes), a finding that supports the significance of the competition-for-water mechanism.

It is widely acknowledged that these contributions can be paramount to local livelihoods, yet country- and region-wide data on their linkages remains sparse and limited attention has been devoted to understanding synergies and trade-offs between, for example, subsistence and cash exchange-based contributions. And because many forest landscapes are now transitioning towards patchworks of land uses owing to agricultural expansion, conservation interventions, urbanization, and other drivers, the ways in which forests support livelihoods are in flux leaving questions about potential shifts in their importance relatively unexplored. This editorial as well as the papers collected in this special issue on Forests, food, and livelihoods, discuss the ways in which forests contribute to livelihoods, including interactions between them, and how they change as landscapes transition. By doing so, we point to the need to move beyond single-year data collection to comparable temporal points and panel data as well as the importance of accounting for a) subsistence use values, b) commercial use values, and c) ecological forest contributions in poverty alleviation policies.","[Rasmussen, Laura Vang; Watkins, Cristy; Agrawal, Arun] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Forests & Livelihoods Assessment Res & Engagement, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Rasmussen, LV (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Forests & Livelihoods Assessment Res & Engagement, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",lrasmuss@tumich.edu,"Sunderland, Terence/AAS-5080-2021; Agrawal, Arun/A-4257-2009","Sunderland, Terence/0000-0002-1985-9849; Agrawal, Arun/0000-0001-6796-2958; Rasmussen, Laura Vang/0000-0001-7786-6783","Department for International Development (DFID), UK [40099095]","Department for International Development (DFID), UK","This research was supported by the Department for International Development (DFID) (Accountable Grant Agreement PO #40099095), UK.

Where available, existing estimates suggest the non-cash benefits of forests are substantial, in many cases three to ten times higher than those for which systematic national and global data are collected. Part of this under-valuation stems from a general focus by governments on forest resources that are commercially valued as well as from government failure to include estimates of NTFP contributions in their national accounts. Beyond these reasons, however, lay methodological challenges in measurement techniques and comparability across studies, countries, and regions, both of which result in limited data on NTFPs. This article reviews NTFP studies at the global and national levels to provide estimates of the non-cash contributions of NTFPs and to shed light on challenges related to the absence of systematic, reliable data on the economic contributions of forests. The article then considers the implications for forest governance, management, and policy, arguing that the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) offer an opportunity to increase attention on the non-cash contributions of forests and turn this invisible contribution into a visible one.",,,,catherinebenson@gmail.com,,,UN Forum on Forests (UNFF),UN Forum on Forests (UNFF),Initial background research for this paper was supported through a consultancy with the UN Forum on Forests (UNFF) as part of background research for Agrawal et al.

This demonstrates, in part, the limitations in using the WTO as a vehicle to promote economic reform.","[Levy, Philip I.] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Levy, Philip I.] Northwestern Univ, Chicago Council Global Affairs, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University; Northwestern University,"Levy, PI (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.;Levy, PI (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Chicago Council Global Affairs, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",plevy@thechicagocouncil.org,,,,,,,19,11,12,0,18,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,OCT,2017,16.0,4,,,,,635,653,,10.1017/S1474745617000246,0.0,,,19,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,FK0ML,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413173800005,0

Many challenges regarding rights, multilayered governance and land tenure remain open in this country where Indigenous Peoples (IPs) occupy 68% of the Ecuadorian Amazon. We focused on the Yasuni Biosphere Reserve to exemplify obstacles and answers found in the last years. In a REDD + pilot project, six communities of the most widespread ethnicities (Shuar, Kichwa and Colonists) living in the buffer zone of the Yasuni National Park (YNP), were chosen. We used literature research, analysis of international and national agendas, as well as primary data on REDD + perception obtained through semi-structured household interviews and personal observations. First, we reconstruct the historical development of territorial configuration and present the actual land tenure arrangements. And then, we analyze persistent management conflicts within institutional, planning and normative instruments. Finally we explore legal frameworks with a focus on participation and consultation. Our results show that insecure and overlapping land rights, as well as unclear and contradictory institutional responsibilities are major problems for REDD + implementation. Despite great advancements that have been made, establishing equitable mechanisms to engage IPs and forest owners and stakeholders across many sectors in REDD + is required. Especially in Ecuador where oil extraction is a priority and the central government has an exclusive competence over ecosystem services including carbon rights. Implementing fair methods for participation, benefit sharing and transfer of knowledge remains a challenge.","[Loaiza, T.; Gerold, G.] Univ Appl Sci, TH Koln, Inst Technol & Resources Management Trop & Subtro, Betzdorfer Str 2, D-50679 Cologne, Germany; [Loaiza, T.; Nehren, U.] Univ Gottingen, Inst Geog, Dept Landscape Ecol, Goldschmidtstr 5, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Borja, M.

German implementation of the European Timber Regulation between persuasion and coercion,FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Holzhandels-Sicherungs-Gesetz; Implementation deficit; Performance; Illegal logging; Legality verification,MULTILEVEL GOVERNANCE; UNITED-STATES; POLICY; TRANSPARENCY; MANAGEMENT; LEGALITY; PRODUCTS; POLITICS,"Mitigating international trade in illegally harvested wood (products) is an international priority. To support this priority, the European Timber Regulation prohibits placing illegally harvested or traded timber on the EU market, requiring companies to undertake due diligence in sourcing wood (products). To take effect, this regulation needs to be implemented in all European member states. Although Germany is one of the first member states to transpose and enact the regulation's provisions, its implementation has recently been portrayed as weakand ineffective. This article aims to answer why this perception emerged. It scrutinizes implementation performance of the EUTR in Germany. Based on rich empirical data from stakeholder interviews, documents, and participant observation, this study argues that EUTR performance in Germany is not generally perceived as ineffective. Instead, stakeholder perceptions vary. As stakeholders face major uncertainties connected to market structure and company behaviour, they tend to base their assumptions about the implementation process on two major heuristics. Both focus on the question how to change company behaviour. One stresses the need to pursuade companies to comply, the other stresses the need to coerce them. These heuristics are based on the two larger objectives pursued by different stakeholder groups during policy making of the EUTR: (1) global sustainable forest management and (2) image improvement of the EU wood importing industry. Based on these different policy objectives, the EUTR does not provide clear guidance on which policy instruments should be given priority. As a consequence, national implementation is turned into a policy-making process. The outcome of this struggle will likely affect the future trajectory of EUTR implementation in other EU member states and in countries exporting wood into the EU. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Its aim is to construct autonomous habitats in deep space, supplying astronauts with fresh air, water and food through continuous microbial recycling of human wastes. This article considers how anticipated futures of space travel and environmental survival are materialized in the project to engineer the minimal biosphere capable of reliably sustaining human life: a human/microbe association with the fewest possible species. We locate MELiSSA within a history of bio-infrastructures associated with colonisation projects: refugia in which organisms dislocated from their originary habitats are preserved. Analysis of MELiSSA's sewage-composting technology suggests that the disordering complexity of human waste presents a formidable bottle-neck for the construction of the minimal biosphere, in turn suggesting our dependence on microbial communities (soil, the human gut) of potentially irreducible biocomplexity. MELiSSA researchers think of themselves as pragmatic enablers of space exploration, yet a wider family of space colonisation projects are now imagined in terms of the prospect that the Earth might cease to function as the minimal biosphere capable of supporting civilisation. MELiSSA's politics of anticipation are paradoxical, promising technologies with which to escape from the Earth and through which it may be sustained. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

But what happens if a country is already a forest sink, absorbing more carbon than it is emitting? This phenomenon has been observed for a number of tropical countries already. We first demonstrate, from data derived from two rounds of the national forest inventory, that this is also the case for Mexico. Despite the fact that quite high rates of deforestation are occurring, on balance this is more than compensated for by the overall process of sequestration by forests that remain forests. We then analyze key documents from 25 countries which indicate that very little attention has been paid to the implications of this forest enhancement process in REDD+ planning. We consider what it means for national REDD+ approaches, focusing on three key elements: (1) what kind of baseline would be required under these conditions, to take into accountnatural forest growth levels; (2) what kinds of REDD+ activities at local level would be most suitable, given that there may be considerable scope for enhancing natural recovery rates of forests in degraded areas and (3) what kind of monitoring system could be developed to check whether these activities do indeed result in additional carbon savings.

REDD+ is an emerging inter-governmental policy instrument aimed at both reducing deforestation and forest degradation and combatting climate change, whereby developed countries pay developing countries to reduce their forest-based emissions. The paper details a five-year research project to evaluate REDD+ quality of governance and develop governance standards for the mechanism. Quality of governance was evaluated in five key international institutional elements: the REDD+ related negotiations in the global climate talks; the support and funding agencies UN-REDD, Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF), Forest Investment Programme (FIP) and the REDD+ Partnership. This research was complemented by national level governance assessments and related standards setting initiatives in Nepal and Papua New Guinea. The researchers conclude that REDD+ confronts a number of challenges, notably around resources for capacity building, and benefit sharing. In addition, the lack of provisions for changing behaviour and solving the problem of forest-based emissions in the current safeguards render them inadequate to the task of delivering quality of governance. In the absence of consistent governance standards, REDD+ will only partially be successful in combatting climate change in the Anthropocene. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Using international data from multiple waves of the PISA international assessment test, I find that grade retention in primary school harms student achievement across the distribution, while delayed school entry can produce positive results for those at the lower end.

The source of identification is a heteroscedastic covariance restriction of the error terms that is a feature of many models of endogeneity. We also perform two-stage quantile regressions. We find a positive effect on wages of temporary interruption for men who held a full-time job during their out-of-school spell(s). Both men and women witness a wage decrease if their interruption depends on health issues.

This paper critically evaluates this chronology and finds (a) that there is insufficient evidence for an imminent irreversible tipping point, and (b) that the international community established a new planetary stewardship in 1992 when it agreed on new conventions on climate change and bio-diversity in response to three decades of warnings about global environmental problems. The paper proposes an alternative framework for conceptualizing the transition between Stages 2 and 3 of the Anthropocene. This generates the hypothesis that after the actual carbon dioxide concentration of the atmosphere has exceeded a critical threshold level, some biophysical processes will change at rates proportional to the difference between the carbon dioxide concentration of the atmosphere and the threshold level, and to the rate of climate change. Evidence is presented which suggests that this new reversible tipping point could have been passed before 1980, when enhanced forest growth was first observed in mature forests in Amazonia. Modelling simulations suggest that this temporal relativity effect could soon be joined by a spatio-temporal relativity effect, as species become committed to extinction and/or form new species assemblages in the 21st Century when climate zones shift. Since this new tipping point is reversible there is still time for planetary stewardship to become more effective and minimize the harmful effects of climate change.

Will the forthcoming AI revolution produce similar, far-reaching effects? By examining analogous inventions of the industrial, digital and Al revolutions, this article claims that the latter is on target and that it would bring extensive changes that will also affect all aspects of our society and life. In addition, its impact on firms and employment will be considerable, resulting in richly interconnected organizations with decision making based on the analysis and exploitation of big data and intensified, global competition among firms. People will be capable of buying goods and obtaining services from anywhere in the world using the Internet, and exploiting the unlimited, additional benefits that will open through the widespread usage of AI inventions. The paper concludes that significant competitive advantages will continue to accrue to those utilizing the Internet widely and willing to take entrepreneurial risks in order to turn innovative products/services into worldwide commercial success stories. The greatest challenge facing societies and firms would be utilizing the benefits of availing AI technologies, providing vast opportunities for both new products/services and immense productivity improvements while avoiding the dangers and disadvantages in terms of increased unemployment and greater wealth inequalities.

In the Netherlands this transition was envisioned by the Transition Programme Long-term Care (2007-2010) as a fundamental change towards a more human centred, affordable and socially embedded healthcare system. One of the experiments in this programme was Neighbourhood Care (in Dutch Buurtzorg): small-scale, self managed teams of nurses who provide high-quality homecare in neighbourhoods. This article looks at Buurtzorg from the perspective of transition studies, building on the framework of 'deepening, broadening and scaling-up' transition experiments. We analyse how Buurtzorg could rapidly develop from a local experiment to a network of more than 800 teams and also spread to different care domains and abroad. The rapid development of Buurtzorg is explained by identifying their strategic activities, the alignment of contextual factors and their strategic position as outsider towards the regime. We conclude that Buurtzorg has become a 'symbol' in a transformative movement that can contribute to a future transition in healthcare. This case study contributes to theoretical and practice-oriented knowledge on how a transition experiment in a social domain can surpass the experimental phase, identifying key strategic activities for niche mainstreaming.","[Johansen, Francoise] Erasmus Univ, Dutch Res Inst Transit DRIFT, Postbus 1738,Mandeville Bldg,T16-36,POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [van den Bosch, Suzanne] SUSi Independent Transit Researcher & Facilitator, Noordwijk, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Johansen, F (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Dutch Res Inst Transit DRIFT, Postbus 1738,Mandeville Bldg,T16-36,POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",johansen@drift.eur.nl; suzanne@sus-i.nl,,,,,,,81,27,28,0,37,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,MAY,2017,89.0,,,,,,60,73,,10.1016/j.futures.2017.04.004,0.0,,,14,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,EX0XE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402943300005,0

Objective: To examine the relationship between National Health Insurance and maternal healthcare utilisation across three main wealth quintiles (Poor, Middle and Rich). Methods: The study employed data from the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey. Both descriptive analysis and binary logistic regression were conducted. Results: Descriptively, rich women had high antenatal attendance and health facility deliveries represented by 96. 5% and 95.6% respectively. However, the binary logistic regression results revealed that poor women owning NHIS are 7% (CI = 1.76-2.87) more likely to make at least four antenatal care visits compared to women in the middle wealth quintile (5%, CI = 2.12-4.76) and rich women (2%, CI = 1.14-4.14). Similarly, poor women who owned the NHIS are 14% (CI = 1.42-2.13) likely to deliver in health facility than women in the middle and rich wealth quintile. Conclusion: The study has vindicated the claim that NHIS Scheme is pro-poor in Ghana. The Ministry of Health should target women in the rural area to be enrolled on the NHIS to improve maternal healthcare utilisation since poverty is principally a rural phenomenon in Ghana.","[Ameyaw, Edward Kwabena; Appiah, Francis] Univ Cape Coast, Fac Social Sci, Dept Populat & Hlth, Cape Coast, Ghana; [Kofinti, Raymond Elikplim] Univ Cape Coast, Fac Social Sci, Dept Econ, Cape Coast, Ghana",University of Cape Coast; University of Cape Coast,"Ameyaw, EK (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Coast, Fac Social Sci, Dept Populat & Hlth, Cape Coast, Ghana.",edmeyaw19@gmail.com,"Ameyaw, Edward/AAF-2526-2020; Kofinti, Raymond Elikplim/GYD-7285-2022; Appiah, Francis/HKE-3326-2023","Ameyaw, Edward/0000-0002-6617-237X;",,,,,34,28,31,0,23,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

The number of minority students completing STEM degrees at highly selective colleges falls by 19% five years after affirmative action bans, while there is no change in the total number of students completing STEM degrees. This indicates that a nontrivial number of minority students only admitted to highly selective colleges because of affirmative action graduate in STEM during periods of race preferences in college admissions. There is no convincing evidence of effects at moderately selective colleges. These findings speak to the recent debate about the extent to which minority students admitted to top ranked colleges due to affirmative action may have higher probabilities of graduating in the sciences if they had attended lower ranked colleges. Results are presented with the caveats that changes in race reporting caused by affirmative action bans may upwardly bias estimated effects, and that estimated aggregate effects may not fully capture all student-level responses.

In this sense, the main contributions of the paper stem from the development of a theoretical and empirical model that distinguishes between the effect of the initial stock and that of investment in health determinants. To do this, we estimated the health production function using a stochastic frontier model. We present an empirical example using data for the years 2002 and 2008. The results support our decision to analyse the effects of the initial values attributable to health determinants separately from those arising following investment in the period. Concretely, we find significant differences for the determinants EMPLOY, SOCIALCLASS and NON-DRINKER. The results seem to indicate that, for variables labelled with the behavioural aspects of health such as NON-DRINKER, the effect over time of a change in investment in health is significantly greater than that resulting from a variation in initial values. In contrast, for socioeconomic variables such as SOCIAL CLASS or EMPLOY, for which effects on health tend to be more long-term in nature, the opposite occurs, with the effect of the investment during the time period proving significantly lower than the effect of the initial provision.","[Lafuente Robledo, Esther] Fdn Invest Biosanitaria Principado Asturias FINBA, Oviedo, Spain; [Rodriguez-Alvarez, Ana] Univ Oviedo, Oviedo Efficiency Grp, Edificio Dept Ciencias Jurid Sociales, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain; [Shmarev Shmarev, Andrey] Univ Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain",University of Oviedo; University of Oviedo,"Rodriguez-Alvarez, A (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Oviedo Efficiency Grp, Edificio Dept Ciencias Jurid Sociales, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain.",ana@uniovi.es,"Rodriguez-Alvarez, Ana/G-6344-2010","Rodriguez-Alvarez, Ana/0000-0002-2492-5070",Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2013-43925-R]; project Oviedo Efficiency Group'' [FC-15-GRUPIN14-048],Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; project Oviedo Efficiency Group'',"Ana Rodriguez-Alvarez acknowledges financial support from the project ECO2013-43925-R (Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness) and the project Oviedo Efficiency Group'' FC-15-GRUPIN14-048.

My results suggest that, in a developing country school system with state-employed teachers, tracking can reduce short-run test scores of initially low-ability students with high learning potential. The highest scoring students subjected only to the tracking intervention scored well below comparable students in untracked classrooms at the end of the intervention. In contrast, students assigned to tracking under the experimental alternative teacher intervention experienced gains from tracking that increased across the outcome distribution. These alternative teachers were drawn from local areas, exhibited significantly higher effort levels and faced different incentives to produce learning. I conclude that although Pareto-improvements in test scores from tracking are possible, they are not guaranteed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Evidence from administrative data,ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CURRICULUM MANDATES; LOANS; AID; PERSISTENCE; ECONOMICS; CHOICES; ACCESS,"More students than ever borrow to finance post-secondary education. However, students receive little information during the course of their college career that encourages them to recalibrate loan amounts and to consider academic and borrowing decisions jointly. This paper exploits a natural experiment to understand how targeted information can change student behavior. We study a large public university where students above a given debt threshold received letters with bundled information on student loan debt and effectively completing college, while students below the threshold did not. Using a difference in-difference strategy and administrative data on individual-level academic records and borrowing, the intervention did not change borrowing in the subsequent semester but improved academic outcomes: credits completed and GPAs increased in the subsequent semester and retention rates increased.

According to the Resolution (which replaces Assembly Resolution A38-18 and which had some reservations of States attached to it), a GMBM scheme would be implemented in the form of a Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) to address any annual increase in total CO2 emissions from international civil aviation (i.e. civil aviation flights that depart in one country and arrive in a different country) above 2020 levels, taking into account Special Circumstances and Respective Capabilities (SCRC) of States. CORSIA would be implemented in three phases while accommodating SCRC, in particular of developing States, while at the same time minimizing market distortion. The Resolution was in response to a specification in Resolution A38-18 adopted at the Assembly three years earlier which required the Assembly in 2016 to develop a GMBM scheme. It took six years, from the 37th Assembly in 2010 (which required the Council to explore the feasibility and modalities of a GMBM scheme) to the 39th Session in 2016 for ICAO to come up with a scheme, which, until 2024 would be a voluntary pilot scheme that would not be an active GMBM. Thereafter, through 2027 the scheme would still be semi experimental. In the meanwhile, pollution caused by engine emissions would exponentially grow over the next ten years. This article examines the latest ICAO effort against its historical background and evolution, together with a discussion on its effectiveness from a legal perspective.","[Abeyratne, Ruwantissa] Int Civil Aviat Org, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Abeyratne, Ruwantissa] Global Aviat Consultancies Inc, Carlsbad, CA 92011 USA; [Abeyratne, Ruwantissa] Aviat Strategies Int, Air Law & Policy, Montreal, PQ, Canada",,"Abeyratne, R (通讯作者)，Int Civil Aviat Org, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;Abeyratne, R (通讯作者)，Global Aviat Consultancies Inc, Carlsbad, CA 92011 USA.;Abeyratne, R (通讯作者)，Aviat Strategies Int, Air Law & Policy, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",rabeyratne@aviationstrategies.aero,"Abeyratne, Ruwantissa/AAH-9621-2020",,,,,,15,3,3,3,11,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

This enables checking of internal consistency and allows valid statistical inferences to be drawn based on empirical estimation. The underlying vector random coefficient autoregressive process, which has well established regularity conditions and associated asymptotic properties, is discussed, and a simple explanation is given as to why only the diagonal BEKK model, and not the Hadamard, triangular or full BEKK models, has regularity conditions and asymptotic properties. Various special cases, including the diagonal BEKK model of Baba et al. (1985) and Engle and Kroner (1995), VARMA-GARCH model of Ling and McAleer (2003), and VARMA-AGARCH model of McAleer et al.

Complexity involves chances and risks, and also nonlinearity. Modern economy is a very complex system, and its interactions with the greater social and natural environment, requires us to move beyond the familiar economic relationships studied by mainstream economics. Complex adaptive system (CAS) is a set of many different components, interacting in nonlinear way, in the absence of any external regulatory or supervisory influence. The behavior of CAS cannot be explained by a behavior of specific components, instead, CAS shows emergent beheviors. And the modern economy has all properties of the CAS. The CASs, as large dynamic systems, have the natural tendency to evolve to critical state between order and disorder, often also called the edge of chaos, where either a large or small event, perhaps even unmeasurable change, can trigger a chain reaction of unpredictable magnitude, and change in the CAS behavior at some later point in the future. A model is a simplified picture of the real world. But, modeling of economic, political and social phenomena is very complex, because humans are more complicated and unpredictable than nature phenomena. This paper is the attempt to examine the significance of complexity and chaos for analyzing modern economy, and on that basis, the real possibilities for economic modeling and forecasting, especially in the field of economic development.","[Kapor, Predrag] John Naisbitt Univ, Fac Business Studies, Belgrade, Serbia",,"Kapor, P (通讯作者)，John Naisbitt Univ, Fac Business Studies, Belgrade, Serbia.",pkapor@naisbitt.edu.rs,,,,,,,31,1,1,1,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,273,282,,,,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ2BZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418819000028,0

This is the effect of the unification of those factors resulting from the effort of countries to occupy possibly the most advantageous position on the investment attractiveness map in view of the growing global competition. However, the author believes that, given the circumstances, in Poland, legal conditions may in fact be of major importance. This is because the legal determinants of the operation of foreign capital did not use to be stable, especially during a certain period. The reason was the creation of the market system, which required adjustments in legal regulations. Later changes in legal regulations were augmented by the effort to align with the European structures associated with the EU accession, which required legal convergence. Apart from the major legal regulations governing direct investments in Poland, there are also supplementary regulations, although supplementary does not mean to say of little importance. They supplement the core legislation and form part of the entire legal framework relevant to investing in Poland. The main goal of this paper is to describe changes in supplementary legal regulations relevant to direct investments in Poland from the beginning of the socioeconomic system transformation, i.e. from the transformational breakthrough until now. First of all, the paper will discuss changes in legal regulations governing the acquisition of real property by foreign nationals, which is strongly linked with international capital flows through DFI. Next, changes in the tax system for business entities with foreign capital will be presented, tax system being one of the most important elements of the business environment, taken into consideration investment decisions. Other supplementary legal regulations that the author thinks important in the existing reality will also be discussed. These are legal regulations concerning protection of competition, intellectual property protection, employment of foreign nationals or environmental impact assessment. The author uses the following methods: analysis, synthesis and comparative analysis.","[Kozlowska, Magdalena] Univ Econ Katowice, Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Kozlowska, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, Katowice, Poland.",magdalena.kozlowska@ue.katowice.pl,"Mężyńska, Magdalena/T-2182-2018",,,,,,2,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,79,87,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6MR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426857700008,0

The analysis centres on the long-forgotten 1969 bombing of the trading floor of la Bourse de Montreal (the Montreal Stock Exchange), a moment in an intense phase of the Quebecois movement for independence from Canada. Because of the way in which the bombers framed the attack, and its political-economic and discursive contexts, the bombing presents an opportunity to think about key features of the relation between finance and cultural domination or imperialism. These features relate to finance's specific articulation to the future, uncertainty, and, in the words of the separatistes of the time, cultural 'destiny'. The paper has three parts. The first describes the bombing of la Bourse and the public, media, and state responses, linking it to Quebecois cultural-political geographies at several scales. Part two places the bombing in the longer-run cultural-politicization of finance in the francophone independence movement, to outline a specifically Quebecois critique of finance capital. The third part considers finance's perceived and real connection to, and thus capacity to shape or constrain, the cultural-political construction of collective possibility.","[Mann, Geoff] Simon Fraser Univ, Ctr Global Polit Econ, Burnaby, BC, Canada; [Mann, Geoff] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Geog, Burnaby, BC, Canada",Simon Fraser University; Simon Fraser University,"Mann, G (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Ctr Global Polit Econ, Burnaby, BC, Canada.;Mann, G (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Geog, Burnaby, BC, Canada.",geoffm@sfu.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [4352013-0638],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),This work was supported by Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada under [grant number 4352013-0638].,,64,2,2,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

By consolidating of land, there was activity for better creation of rural space in order to achieve comprehensive improvement of conditions for farming. According to the Act (1982) there were taken activities to shape the structure of the area, the rational design of land distribution, adjust the boundaries of the property to the system of water management facilities, construction of roads and terrain. After the Polish accession to the EU, there was created a possibility of co-financing of agricultural land consolidation under the three successive EU programmes. The volume of these actions was defined by the level of support, thus in 2004-2006 there were 31 projects realized for the amount of 15.1 million EUR, and in 2007-2013 another 109 consolidation projects were completed - for a total amount of 93.9 million EUR. In the current financial perspective, the indicative budget of the RDP foresees 139.0 million EUR for land consolidation, including 88.4 million EUR from EAFRD means. The analysis of changes of the number of agricultural parcels, which were recorded between agricultural censuses of 2002 and 2010, shows that consolidation of farms was noticed during that time. In 2010, the total number of agricultural parcels dropped from 2,916.3 thousand in 2002 to 2264.6 thousand (22.3 %). The biggest decrease of farms was noticed in the group of holdings with one parcel (44.5 %) and holdings with 2-3 parcels (28.1 %).

We provide evidence that this management strategy can also successfully achieve non-commercial marine conservation goals, such as limiting unintended catch (bycatch) of protected species. We examine fishers' responses to the introduction of tradable harvest rights for protected species, 'bycatch rights,' in the US West Coast groundfish fishery, finding evidence of adjustment along several margins and estimating the marginal cost of conservation. Fishers adapted to bycatch rights by changing fishing location, gear, time of day fished, and duration of fishing activity. As a result, catches of protected species fell dramatically. The nuanced nature of fishers' responses indicates that the least-cost way of achieving conservation goals can involve fine-tuned behavioral adaptations that would be difficult or impossible to achieve with command-and-control regulation.","[Miller, Steve J.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, 231 Ruttan Hall,1994 Buford Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Deacon, Robert T.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Econ, 2127 North Hall, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Miller, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, 231 Ruttan Hall,1994 Buford Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",s-miller@umn.edu; deacon@econ.ucsb.edu,,,,,,,43,18,21,0,36,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

The purpose of the study is to indicate differences in the attitude towards sustainable consumption on the basis of the declared consumer's attitude of a head of a household in relation to the natural environment. The declared attitude was presented through a subjective opinion of respondents in the scope of approach to purchase decisions in the context of the natural environment. To achieve such a goal, the following research questions were asked: whether households headed by respondents with the pro-ecological attitude more often took actions indicating for the implementation of sustainable consumption and whether there was a significant percentage of entities not implementing sustainable consumption among respondents who had declared the neutral attitude in all the examined behaviours. For the purpose of the study, survey research was conducted on the group of 100 heads of households chosen with the use of targeted choice method.","[Siedlecka, Agnieszka] Pope John Paul II State Sch Higher Educ, Podlaska, Poland",Pope John Paul II State School of Higher Education in Biala Podlaska,"Siedlecka, A (通讯作者)，Pope John Paul II State Sch Higher Educ, Podlaska, Poland.",a.siedlecka@wp.pl,,,,,,,17,0,0,1,3,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-261-3,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2017,,45,,,,,351,359,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BI1NY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406530100043,0

Having a job has often been associated with a secure protection against poverty and social exclusion, but this aspect does not automatically exclude the risk of poverty for people who work, and statistical data argue this affirmation. Nowadays, both on national and international level, the number of working people facing poverty is increasing, i.e. their work incomes are below a certain poverty threshold, even they have a job. Other circumstances added to this picture, such as certain individual or household characteristics, generate the increase of the poverty risk and also the vulnerability to poverty of these households / persons. In this paper, in-work poverty rates will be analyzed for some types of households and certain determinants related to education or some occupational characteristics and structures, detailing those circumstances that influence, generate and sustain in-work poverty. The analysis of in-work poverty incidence indicators will be structured at national level and, comparatively, at international level, in dynamics, during the period 2007-2015 / 2016. This in-work poverty profile can lead to highlighting some of the main factors and determinants that generate and sustain this type of poverty. Sharpening an in-work related poverty profile by highlighting the high incidences or persistence over time of this phenomenon could lead to better targeted actions for the most vulnerable groups to poverty and in-work poverty. These actions must target the multiple dimensions of the labor market, of social protection / social assistance and tax policies, or even combinations of these major policies, to alleviate poverty and in-work poverty incidence.","[Stroe, Cristina; Cojanu, Silvia-Florina] Natl Sci Res Inst Labour & Social Protect, Bucharest, Romania",,"Stroe, C (通讯作者)，Natl Sci Res Inst Labour & Social Protect, Bucharest, Romania.",cristinaradu@incsmps.ro; silvia.cojanu@yahoo.com,,,,,,,7,3,3,0,5,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,129,138,,,,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6MR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426857700013,0

Through the optimization of the power index and weights for accumulative generation, WNGBM can more actively adapt to non-linear fluctuations in the raw data than NGBM. A typical case of topological rolling prediction verifies that the WNGBM exhibits better non-linear prediction capabilities than other grey models. Furthermore, the forecasting performance of WNGBM is compared with that of Holt-Winters, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and BP Neural Network (BPNN) based on the Shanghai Stock Exchange(SSE) Composite Indices. Results indicate that WNGBM shows the best ability to fit non-linear data from small sample sizes, while it has a slightly higher error in the prediction of out-of-sample data for the SSE Composite Index than that of BPNN. The extreme values mean that the prediction curve of the Holt-Winters method generally deviates from the actual data, which leads to a greater prediction error.","[Wang, Zheng-Xin] Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University of Finance & Economics,"Wang, ZX (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",zxwang@zufe.edu.cn,,,European Community [FP7-PIIF-GA-2013-629051]; Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China [2016M590527],European Community; Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation),"This research was supported by a Marie Curie International Incoming Fellowship within the 7th European Community Framework Programme (Grant No. FP7-PIIF-GA-2013-629051), and the Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 2016M590527).",,15,8,8,2,10,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

We discuss the policy implications of the findings.","[Yu, Hui-Yu] Takming Univ Sci & Technol, 56,Sec 1,Huanshan Rd, Taipei 11451, Taiwan; [Huang, Chunghuey] Natl Taipei Univ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Lin, Yi-Hua] Southern Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Accounting Informat, Tainan, Taiwan; [Tsai, Chun-Li] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Econ, Tainan, Taiwan",Takming University Science & Technology; National Taipei University; Southern Taiwan University of Science & Technology; National Cheng Kung University,"Yu, HY (通讯作者)，Takming Univ Sci & Technol, 56,Sec 1,Huanshan Rd, Taipei 11451, Taiwan.",hyyu@takming.edu.tw,,,,,,,33,2,4,3,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The dynamic autoregressive model has successfully forecast the bull and bear markets since 2007.

The study aims to meliorate astute plan for electricity generation expansion that would create a paragon future with low carbon emission. Combined utilization of Long-Range Energy Alternative Planning (LEAP) and EnergyPLAN software is done in this paper. Electricity demand, installation capacity and power production with overall cost and total GHG emission are planned till the year 2030 using LEAP. Baseline and GHG mitigation are the modeled scenarios with 2016 as the base year. The GHG mitigation scenario emits lesser GHG than the baseline scenario. The results of LEAP suggest to adopt GHG mitigation scenario and therefore the expansion capacities of power plants planned by this GHG mitigation scenario is given as input to EnergyPLAN software for monthly and hourly basis planning.","[Bhuvanesh, A.; Christa, Jaya S.

The current study overcomes the problems of spurious regressions and non-stationary time series through cointegration. The research involves both testing the existence of a long-term equilibrium relationship between the variables and the estimation of an error correction model (ECM). The findings show that the Spanish BEKP exports from Galicia and Asturias are significantly affected by the economic conditions registered in Europe, and favoured by the inflationary processes of the main competing developing countries (Brazil, Chile, Uruguay). However, this competitive advantage has been offset through the fall of the external value of competing countries' currencies against the Euro. In addition, the results also indicate that new investments in plantation pulp and factories in competing developing countries reduce the competitiveness of the BEKP industry in north west Spain.","[Gonzalez-Gomez, Manuel; Soledad Otero-Giraldez, Maria] Univ Vigo, Dept Appl Econ, Vigo, Spain; [Alvarez-Diaz, Marcos] Univ Vigo, Dept Econ, Vigo, Spain",Universidade de Vigo; Universidade de Vigo,"González-Gómez, M (通讯作者)，Univ Vigo, Dept Appl Econ, Vigo, Spain.",mgonzalez@uvigo.es,"Alvarez-Diaz, Marcos/AGF-3176-2022; , Manuel/C-9211-2019",", Manuel/0000-0002-8433-0941; Otero Giraldez, Maria Soledad/0000-0003-3247-2363; ALVAREZ-DIAZ, MARCOS/0000-0003-2372-1102",,,,,51,2,2,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,NOV,2018,96.0,,,,,,112,119,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.08.011,0.0,,,8,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GV3HM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445985000012,0

A federation, with the aim of maximizing the aggregate utility of its members, may find it advantageous to decentralize the decision-making, so that its members act autonomously to maximize their own utility. If utility is fully transferable within a federation, the larger a federation is or the more sensitive it is to the public good, the more it has incentives to remain centralized. If an overall increase in the sensitivity to the public good induces some fed-eration(s) to decentralize, it may lead to a decrease in the aggregate provision. With non-transferable utility within a federation, those members that are smaller or less sensitive to the public good are more likely to prefer decentralization.

Very little is known about whether self-report questionnaires are subject to age effects. Using a longitudinal sample of 14,762 students in Mexico surveyed in 9th and 12th grades (three years apart), we estimate the effects of relative age (i.e., age with respect to classmates) and absolute age (i.e., age at measurement). Relative age has no significant effect on the Grit perseverance of effort subscale, and a positive effect on the Grit consistency of interest subscale of 0.21 standard deviations per year (sigma). In contrast, absolute age has a positive effect of 0.09 sigma on perseverance of effort and a negative effect of -0.13 sigma on consistency of interest. Thus, measured perseverance of effort increases with absolute age but not with relative age, whereas measured consistency of interest increases with relative age and decreases to a lesser extent with absolute age. We discuss possible explanations for and implications of these age effects.","[Pena, Pablo A.] Microanalitica, Emeryville, CA 94608 USA; [Duckworth, Angela L.] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Peña, PA (通讯作者)，Microanalitica, Emeryville, CA 94608 USA.",pablo@uchicago.edu; aduckworth@characterlab.org,,"Pena, Pablo/0000-0002-1327-5412",,,,,36,29,33,2,36,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0272-7757,1873-7382,,ECON EDUC REV,Econ.

We reviewed recent appraisals of a pharmaceutical manufacturer in three major European markets (France; Italy; Germany) and identified and categorized related decision drivers. Methods: New marketing authorisation between January 2011 and August 2017, and Roche being the Marketing Authorization Holder, were included. Outcome of HTA appraisals by the Haute Autorite de Sante (HAS), Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco (AIFA), and Federal Joint Committee (Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss, G-BA) were reviewed. Respective decision drivers were identified and commonalities and differences across the three countries were determined leveraging the EUnetHTA conceptual taxonomy (i.e. the 9 domains of the EUnetHTA core model). Results: Within that time period Roche received European marketing authorization for eight new molecular entities (10 indications, respectively). Outcome of HTA appraisals was heterogeneous across the three countries. However, the four clinical domains of the EUnetHTA core model were driving the national HTA appraisals, with the clinical effectiveness domain being of most importance. Important drivers related to the other three clinical domains included the target patient population (subgroups, Germany), the current management of the condition (unmet need, Italy), the regulatory status (Orphan Designation, Germany), as well as safety considerations (all three countries). Average time between EMA approval and full commercial availability of new medicines was 63 (Germany), 459 (Italy), and 557 days (France). Conclusions: The clinical domains of the EUnetHTA framework are mainly driven by national HTA appraisals, providing a suitable starting point for further developing a joint European view on value and evidence. Underlying topics and issues still reveal considerable differences.","[Giuliani, Giovanni] Roche SpA, Monza, Italy; [Chassagnol, Frederic] Roche SAS, Boulogne Billancourt, France; [Traub, David] Roche Pharma AG, Grenzach Wyhlen, Germany; [Gyldmark, Marlene; Hebborn, Ansgar; Ducournau, Pierre] F Hoffmann La Roche, Basel, Switzerland; [Ruof, Joerg] Med Sch Hanover, Hannover, Germany; [Ruof, Joerg] R Connect Ltd, Hauensteinstr 132, CH-4059 Basel, Switzerland",Roche Holding; Roche Holding; Roche Holding,"Ruof, J (通讯作者)，Med Sch Hanover, Hannover, Germany.;Ruof, J (通讯作者)，R Connect Ltd, Hauensteinstr 132, CH-4059 Basel, Switzerland.",joerg.ruof@r-connect.com,,"Giuliani, Giovanni/0009-0005-3622-334X; Ruof, Joerg/0000-0001-8706-934X",,,,,10,6,6,0,3,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

While many studies have investigated the relationship between violence against children and health of the victims, little is known about the long term economic consequences of child maltreatment, especially in developing countries. Using data from the Cape Area Panel Study, this paper applies Heckman selection models to investigate the relationship between childhood maltreatment and young adults' wages in South Africa. The results show that, on average, any experience of physical or emotional abuse during childhood is associated with a later 12% loss of young adults' wages. In addition, the correlation between physical abuse and economic consequence (14%) is more significant than the relationship between emotional abuse and wages (8%) of young adults; and the higher the frequency of maltreatment, the greater the associations with wages. With respect to gender differences, wage loss due to the experience of childhood maltreatment is larger for females than males. Specifically, males' wages are more sensitive to childhood emotional abuse, while females' wages are more likely to be affected by childhood physical abuse. These results emphasize the importance of prioritizing investments in prevention and intervention programs to reduce the prevalence of child maltreatment and to help victims better overcome the long-term negative effect.","[Zheng, Xiaodong; Fang, Xiangming] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Fang, Xiangming] Georgia State Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, 140 Decatur St, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Fry, Deborah A.; Casey, Tabitha] Univ Edinburgh, Moray House Sch Educ, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Ganz, Gary; Ward, Catherine L.] Univ Cape Town, Dept Psychol, Cape Town, South Africa; [Hsiao, Celia] Save Children South Africa, Johannesburg, South Africa",China Agricultural University; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University of Edinburgh; University of Cape Town; Save the Children,"Fang, XM (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Fang, XM (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, 140 Decatur St, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",xmfang@cau.edu.cn,"Ward, Catherine L./ACR-5809-2022; Fang, Xiangming/B-8650-2014; zheng, xiaodong/C-4050-2008; Fang, Xiangming/O-1653-2014","Ward, Catherine L./0000-0001-8727-4175; Fang, Xiangming/0000-0001-9922-8977",,,,,64,4,6,0,11,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

MEDLINE, MEDLINE in process, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched in April 2017. We selected: (1) economic evaluations that estimated the costs and detected cases of trisomy 21, 18 or 13; (2) comparisons of prenatal screening with NIPT (universal or contingent strategies) and the usual screening without NIPT, (3) in pregnant women with any risk of foetal anomalies. Studies were reviewed by two researchers. Data were extracted, the methodological quality was assessed and a narrative synthesis was prepared. In total, 12 studies were included, four of them performed in Europe. Three studies evaluated NIPT as a contingent test, three studies evaluated a universal NIPT, and six studies evaluated both. The results are heterogeneous, especially for the contingent NIPT where the results range from NIPT being dominant to a dominated strategy. Universal NIPT was found to be more effective but also costlier than the usual screening, with very high incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. One advantage of screening with NIPT is lower invasive procedure-related foetal losses than with usual screening. In conclusion, the cost-effectiveness of contingent NIPT is uncertain according to several studies, while the universal NIPT is not cost-effective currently.","[Garcia-Perez, Lidia; Linertova, Renata; Serrano-Aguilar, Pedro] Serv Canario Salud, Serv Evaluac, Camino Candelaria 44,1a Planta, Santa Cruz De Tenerife 38109, Canary Islands, Spain; [Garcia-Perez, Lidia; Linertova, Renata; Ferrer-Rodriguez, Jorge] Fdn Canaria Invest Sanitaria FUNCANIS, Camino Candelaria 44,1a Planta, Santa Cruz De Tenerife 38109, Canary Islands, Spain; [Garcia-Perez, Lidia; Linertova, Renata; Imaz-Iglesia, Inaki; Serrano-Aguilar, Pedro] Red Invest Serv Salud Enfermedades Cron REDISSEC, Madrid, Spain; [Garcia-Perez, Lidia; Linertova, Renata; Serrano-Aguilar, Pedro] Univ La Laguna, Ctr Invest Biomed Canarias CIBICAN, San Cristobal la Laguna, Spain; [Garcia-Perez, Lidia] Univ La Laguna, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Campus Guajara,Camino Hornera S-N, San Cristobal la Laguna 38071, Santa Cruz De T, Spain; [Alvarez-de-la-Rosa, Margarita] Univ La Laguna, Obstet & Gynecol Dept, HUC, Carretera Ofra S-N, San Cristobal la Laguna 38320, Santa Cruz De T, Spain; [Bayon, Juan Carlos] Basque Govt, Basque Off Hlth Technol Assessment OSTEBA, Dept Hlth, Alameda Rekalde 39, Bilbao 48008, Spain; [Imaz-Iglesia, Inaki] Inst Salud Carlos III, Monforte de Lemos 5, Madrid 28029, Spain",Universidad de la Laguna; Universidad de la Laguna; Universidad de la Laguna; Basque Government; Instituto de Salud Carlos III,"García-Pérez, L (通讯作者)，Serv Canario Salud, Serv Evaluac, Camino Candelaria 44,1a Planta, Santa Cruz De Tenerife 38109, Canary Islands, Spain.;García-Pérez, L (通讯作者)，Fdn Canaria Invest Sanitaria FUNCANIS, Camino Candelaria 44,1a Planta, Santa Cruz De Tenerife 38109, Canary Islands, Spain.;García-Pérez, L (通讯作者)，Red Invest Serv Salud Enfermedades Cron REDISSEC, Madrid, Spain.;García-Pérez, L (通讯作者)，Univ La Laguna, Ctr Invest Biomed Canarias CIBICAN, San Cristobal la Laguna, Spain.;García-Pérez, L (通讯作者)，Univ La Laguna, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Campus Guajara,Camino Hornera S-N, San Cristobal la Laguna 38071, Santa Cruz De T, Spain.",lidia.garciaperez@sescs.es; renata.linertova@sescs.es; malvrod@ull.edu.es; jc-bayon@euskadi.eus; imaz@isciii.es; jorgefr87@gmail.com; pserrano@gobiernodecanarias.org,"Imaz-Iglesia, Iñaki/E-4751-2010; Alvarez de la Rosa, Margarita/E-5402-2015; Linertová, Renata/F-6425-2011; García-Pérez, Lidia/C-6364-2011","Imaz-Iglesia, Iñaki/0000-0002-7864-4194; Alvarez de la Rosa, Margarita/0000-0002-0798-2161; García-Pérez, Lidia/0000-0002-5626-8116; Linertova, Renata/0000-0002-0138-9252","Ministerio de Sanidad, Servicios Sociales e Igualdad, Spain","Ministerio de Sanidad, Servicios Sociales e Igualdad, Spain","The authors would like to thank Laura Vallejo, Cristina Valcarcel, Sergio Marquez and Alberto Plaja.

When regulation and enforcement are minimal, economic incentives for low-intensity and non-deleterious forest use can provide conservation and livelihood benefits. One management option for promoting low intensity and non-deleterious forest use includes the harvest and production of non-timber forest products (NTFPs). This research identifies and examines strategies to promote sustainable livelihoods in a conservation landscape. We assess Pangkalan Bulian Village, Musi Banyuasin District, South Sumatra Province using the Community Livelihood Appraisal and Product Scanning (CLAPS) method to describe potential commodities and conduct value chain and market analyses on downstream sectors. Data collection included in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and household surveys disseminated through snowball sampling. We find that rattan is a priority NTFP due to the presence of abundant raw materials, trained human resources, and potential markets. Actors involved along the value chain are collectors, local brokers, large collectors, small processors, large processors, retailers and end consumers. Profit margins earned along each link of the value chain are around 25%. Thus, we encourage rattan harvest and production as a low intensity and non-deleterious forest use that can simultaneously benefit local livelihoods and forest conservation in a landscape where protected area rules and regulations are difficult to enforce.","[Harbi, Jun] Indonesia & Northeast Forestry Univ, Muhammadiyah Univ Palembang, Fac Agr, Forestry Dept, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Erbaugh, James Thomas] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Sidiq, Mohammad; Haasler, Berthold] Deutsch Gesell Int Zusammenarbeit GIZ, Biodivers & Climate Change BIOCLIME, Bonn, Germany; [Nurrochmat, Dodik Ridho] Bogor Agr Univ, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest Management, Bogor, Indonesia",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Bogor Agricultural University,"Nurrochmat, DR (通讯作者)，Bogor Agr Univ, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest Management, Bogor, Indonesia.",jerbaugh@umich.edu; mohammad.sidiq@giz.de; berthold.haasler@giz.de; dnurrochmat@ipb.ac.id,"Harbi, Jun/AAO-6270-2020; Erbaugh, James/ABA-9394-2020; Shaphe, Mohammad A/T-4602-2018; Nurrochmat, Dodik Ridho/GPK-2336-2022; Erbaugh, J.T./AAT-1425-2020; Harbi, Jun/GLR-9437-2022; SIDIQ, MOHAMMAD/AAV-8049-2020","Harbi, Jun/0000-0001-8583-2743; Erbaugh, James/0000-0002-0602-9045; Shaphe, Mohammad A/0000-0002-6046-9543; Erbaugh, J.T./0000-0002-0602-9045; Harbi, Jun/0000-0001-8583-2743; SIDIQ, MOHAMMAD/0000-0003-2448-8971; Nurrochmat, Dodik Ridho/0000-0002-4876-8612",BIOCLIME Project - GIZ [2012.9013.9-001.00],BIOCLIME Project - GIZ,"We acknowledge the funding support from BIOCLIME Project Number 2012.9013.9-001.00, a joint project between Indonesian and German government on biodiversity and climate change (BIOCLIME) which is supported by GIZ on behalf of German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB); the Muhammadiyah University of Palembang's Forestry Study Program for providing technical support; and all the community members and traders who participated in this study.

Appropriate anticoagulation reduces the risk of embolic events during and after ECV. The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban compared with vitamin K oral antagonists (VKAs) in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing elective ECV in the Netherlands. Methods and results A static transmission model over a 1-year time horizon was developed to compare rivaroxaban with VKAs in terms of clinical outcomes, health effects (quality-adjusted life years; QALYs), and costs. Cost-effectiveness was assessed from a societal and health care payer perspective at a willingness-to-pay level of (sic)20,000 per QALY gained. The use of rivaroxaban as an anticoagulant in patients with atrial fibrillation scheduled for ECV would lead to a health gain of 0.23 QALYs per patient and would cost (sic)1.83 per patient from the societal perspective, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of (sic)7.92 per QALY gained. The probability of rivaroxaban being cost-saving compared with VKAs was 49.6% from this perspective. From the health care payer perspective, the incremental cost would be (sic)509 per patient with a health gain of 0.23 QALYs per patient, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of (sic)2198 per QALY gained. Conclusions The use of rivaroxaban in elective ECV is a cost-effective alternative to the use of VKAs. Rivaroxaban has a 50% probability of being cost-saving compared with VKAs and would increase a patient's quality of life when non-health care costs such as productivity loss and informal care costs are taken into account.","[Jacobs, Maartje S.; van Hulst, Marinus] Martini Hosp, Dept Clin Pharm & Toxicol, Van Swietenpl 1, NL-9728 NT Groningen, Netherlands; [Jacobs, Maartje S.; de Jong, Lisa A.; Postma, Maarten J.; van Hulst, Marinus] Univ Groningen, Groningen Res Inst Pharm, Unit Pharmacotherapy Pharmacoepidemiol & Pharmaco, Antonius Deusinglaan 1, NL-9713 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Postma, Maarten J.] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Inst Sci Hlth Aging & Healthcare, Antonius Deusinglaan 1, NL-9713 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Postma, Maarten J.] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Epidemiol, Hanzepl 1, NL-9713 GZ Groningen, Netherlands; [Tieleman, Robert G.] Martini Hosp, Dept Cardiol, Van Swietenpl 1, NL-9728 NT Groningen, Netherlands; [Tieleman, Robert G.] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Cardiol, Hanzepl 1, NL-9713 GZ Groningen, Netherlands",Martini Hospital; University of Groningen; University of Groningen; University of Groningen; Martini Hospital; University of Groningen,"Jacobs, MS (通讯作者)，Martini Hosp, Dept Clin Pharm & Toxicol, Van Swietenpl 1, NL-9728 NT Groningen, Netherlands.;Jacobs, MS (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Groningen Res Inst Pharm, Unit Pharmacotherapy Pharmacoepidemiol & Pharmaco, Antonius Deusinglaan 1, NL-9713 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",m.jacobs@mzh.nl,,"de Jong, Lisa/0000-0001-8814-0670; Postma, Maarten/0000-0002-6306-3653",,,,,21,8,9,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

One alternative for increasing carbon sequestration is to convert pasture to forest while either reducing animal numbers or increasing cattle stocking density on more productive pastureland. This study uses data from a survey of beef cattle producers in the eastern United States to determine: (i) interest in afforesting pastureland; (ii) contingent upon interest, willingness to participate in a hypothetical afforestation program; and (iii) contingent upon willingness to participate, participation intensity in the form of enrolled acres. Less than one-third of producers were interested in afforesting pasture. Producer interest was associated with beliefs about the on- and off-farm effects of afforestation, risk aversion, age, educational attainment, opportunity costs, forest ownership, and previous experience with afforestation. Willingness to participate in the program was influenced by the incentive offered, household income, and opportunity costs. Respondents willing to participate in the program were willing to afforest an average of 55 acres, given the incentive offered. Producers with larger farms were willing to enroll more acres. Extrapolating these results to the population of beef cattle producers in the eastern United States provides a measure of the potential for pasture afforestation and carbon sequestration.","[Claytor, Hannah S.] Knoxville Utilities Board, Knoxville, TN USA; [Clark, Christopher D.; Lambert, Dayton M.; Jensen, Kimberly L.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Knoxville, TN USA",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; UT Institute of Agriculture,"Clark, CD (通讯作者)，302 Morgan Hall,2621 Morgan Circle, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",cdclark@utk.edu,"Lambert, Dayton/A-8401-2009; Clark, Christopher D/A-2073-2012","Clark, Christopher D/0000-0002-7735-4101; Jensen, Kimberly/0000-0001-7922-2324","Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grant from the United States Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture [10642663]","Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grant from the United States Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture","This project was supported by Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grant No. 10642663 from the United States Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture.",,60,8,9,0,33,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,JUL,2018,92.0,,,,,,43,54,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.03.004,0.0,,,12,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GJ9UI,,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000435750000005,0

Creating value and mitigating harm are typically explicit in the objects of public policy and implicit in adjudication, administration and adherence under public policies. Although conceptually distinct, creating value and mitigating harm can be both complementary and detrimental to each other. This article reviews various combinations of legislative objects over more than a century of Australian labour and employment relations policy. The objects examined include the prevention of industrial disputes, the introduction of a social minimum wage, the expansion of enterprise bargaining, expansion or curtailment of tribunal powers by government and other developments. Questions of for whom?' value is created or harm is mitigated are key. As an inductive study, the article concludes with hypotheses to guide future research, including implications that reach beyond Australia and employment legislation.","[Cutcher-Gershenfeld, Joel E.] Brandeis Univ, Heller Sch Social Policy & Management, 415 South St, Auburndale, MA 02466 USA; [Isaac, Joe] Monash Univ, Econ, Clayton, Vic, Australia",Brandeis University; Monash University,"Cutcher-Gershenfeld, JE (通讯作者)，Brandeis Univ, Heller Sch Social Policy & Management, 415 South St, Auburndale, MA 02466 USA.",joelcg@brandeis.edu,"Cutcher-Gershenfeld, Joel/ABF-5729-2020","Cutcher-Gershenfeld, Joel/0000-0001-7659-7024",,,,,60,4,5,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

The results suggest that prevalence increases by approximately 35 to 65 per cent when using child self-reports rather than proxy reports. This bias affects 14 to 31 per cent of the sample, depending on the indicator.

This data set is unique because it permits distinguishing of institutional characteristics (e.g., ownership status) from the mode of payment as determinants of hospital efficiency, due to the fact that some Swiss cantons introduced prospective payment early while others waited for federal legislation to be enacted in 2012. Since a hospital's choice of reserve capacity depends also on the risk preferences of management while affecting the cost function, heterogeneity is predicted even in the presence of identical technology and factor prices. For estimating hospitals' marginal costs, we employ the flexible representation of risk preferences by Pope and Chavas [Am J Agric Econ 76, 196-204 (1994)]. Production uncertainty is measured as the difference between actual admissions and admissions predicted by an autoregressive moving average model. Its effect on hospital cost is analyzed using a multilevel stochastic cost frontier model with random coefficients reflecting unobserved differences in technology. Public hospitals are found to opt for a higher probability of meeting unexpected demand, as predicted. Their operating cost is 1.1% higher than for private hospitals and even 1.9% higher than for teaching hospitals, creating an incentive to turn away patients or to keep them waiting for treatment.","[Widmer, Philippe K.; Trottmann, Maria] Polynomics AG, Baslerstr 44, CH-4600 Olten, Switzerland; [Zweifel, Peter] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Widmer, PK (通讯作者)，Polynomics AG, Baslerstr 44, CH-4600 Olten, Switzerland.",philippe.widmer@polynomics.ch,,,,,,,16,4,4,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

But in determining the overall value of and societal willingness to pay for health technologies, gains in quality of life and length of life are prima facie separate criteria that need not be put together in a single concept. A focus on costs per QALY can also be counterproductive. One reason is that the QALY does not capture well the value of interventions in patients with reduced potentials for health and thus different reference points. Another reason is a need to separate losses of length of life and losses of quality of life when it comes to judging the strength of moral claims on resources in patients of different ages. An alternative to the cost-per-QALY approach is outlined, consisting in the development of two bivariate value tables that may be used in combination to estimate maximum cost acceptance for given units of treatment-for instance a surgical procedure, or 1 year of medication-rather than for 'obtaining one QALY.' The approach is a follow-up of earlier work on 'cost value analysis.' It draws on work in the QALY field insofar as it uses health state values established in that field. But it does not use these values to weight life years and thus avoids devaluing gained life years in people with chronic illness or disability. Real tables of the kind proposed could be developed in deliberative processes among policy makers and serve as guidance for decision makers involved in health technology assessment and appraisal.","[Nord, Erik] Norwegian Inst Publ Hlth, POB 4404, N-0403 Oslo, Norway",Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH),"Nord, E (通讯作者)，Norwegian Inst Publ Hlth, POB 4404, N-0403 Oslo, Norway.",erik.nord@fhi.no,,,,,,,28,16,16,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Development of a comprehensive tool for assessing marketing communications and their impact on the choice of applicants will increase the attractiveness of the university in a competitive market. Methods of research. To solve the problem, the authors proposed to use a comprehensive approach, including traditional and special sociological methods. To traditional methods we refer: system, comparative and logical analysis, methods of observation, written and oral interview of entrants and students to identify the causes and sources of information when choosing a university. As special methods we see the application of content analysis of electronic media and the method of SWOT-analysis for determining students' values. The result of the research will be the approbation of the proposed approach based on the study of motivating motives, the reasons for the professional definition of applicants, sources of information that affect the choice of the institution.","[Alikperov, Igor] Yekaterinburg Acad Contemporary Arts, 9-A Red Partizan, Ekaterinburg 620012, Russia; [Lagutina, Evgenia; Melnikova, Anna] Ural State Univ Econ, 62,8th March Str, Ekaterinburg 620219, Russia",Ural State University of Economics,"Alikperov, I (通讯作者)，Yekaterinburg Acad Contemporary Arts, 9-A Red Partizan, Ekaterinburg 620012, Russia.",aigor55@mail.ru; Lagutinaee@usue.ru; anuta_kk@mail.ru,"Anna, MELNIKOVA/ACD-3255-2022","Anna, MELNIKOVA/0000-0001-8500-8009",,,,,11,1,1,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,30,40,,,,,,11,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400004,0

Specifically, it implements various tools of methodology: the continuous wavelet power spectrum, the cross-wavelet power spectrum, the wavelet coherency, the multiple and the partial wavelet coherence to the annual sample period 1969-2014. Our results unveil that the relationships among the variables evolve through time and frequency. From the time-domain view, we show strong but non-homogenous linkages between the four variables. From the frequency-domain view, we uncover significant wavelet coherences and strong lead-lag relationships. From an economic view, the wavelet analysis shows that Saudi economy is still exposed to several global risk factors, which are mainly related to the oil market volatility, and the pegging of the local currency to the US dollar. Such risk factors strongly and negatively affect the real economic growth, exert more pressure on inflation, and substantially limit the freedom to pursue an independent monetary policy.","[Aloui, Chaker] King Saud Univ, Dept Finance, Coll Business Adm, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Hkiri, Besma] Univ Jeddah, Coll Business, Dept Finance & Insurance, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; [Hammoudeh, Shawkat] Drexel Univ, Lebow Coll Business, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Hammoudeh, Shawkat; Shahbaz, Muhammad] Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier, France",King Saud University; University of Jeddah; Drexel University; Montpellier Business School,"Aloui, C (通讯作者)，King Saud Univ, Coll Business Adm, POB 2454, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia.",chakeraloui2@yahoo.fr,"hkiri, besma/K-2699-2019; Shahbaz, Muhammad/AAD-9038-2019; Aloui, Chaker/T-8129-2018","HKIRI, Besma/0000-0002-0747-8483","Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University [RGP-211]","Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University(King Saud University)","This work was supported by the Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University (RGP-211).",,65,73,76,1,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The analysis includes main macroeconomic determinants as an inflation, unemployment, government expenditure and investment in observed countries. Results show that 1% increase of tax revenue growth enhances the gross domestic product for 0.29% which is confirmed previous studies that manifested significant and positive relationship between these variables. Further, there is recorded the significant and positive effect of tax on property on economic growth, where 1% increase of this tax form raises a gross domestic product for 0.21%.

An important component of the analysis is the European Code of Best Practices Facilitating Access by SMEs to Public Procurement Contracts of 2008, providing guidelines and good practices, and ongoing public procurement reform. SMEs are found as significant source of jobs, growth and innovation, thus, their share in public procurement should be higher than the current 45% of aggregate contract value above EU thresholds. Thus, SMEs perform much below their economic weight. Considering the fact, that public expenditures on goods, services and works account for approximately 14% of the EU's GDP, public procurement may be recognized as the important trigger of economic recovery after the global crisis 2008+. Worth mentioning, public procurement may contribute to realization of the key EU2020 horizontal policies, focused on establishing more green, innovative and socially-inclusive economy. A key objective of newly established legislative measures is to open-up national public procurement markets to companies from the other EU countries, including cross-border procurement. Among important solutions aimed at enhancing higher participation of SMEs in the EU public procurement market there are, among others, fragmentation of contracts, reduction of turnover required to enter tender procedure and simplification of documentary requirements.","[Bobowski, Sebastian; Gola, Jan; Szydlo, Wojciech] Univ Wroclaw, Wroclaw, Poland",University of Wroclaw,"Bobowski, S (通讯作者)，Univ Wroclaw, Wroclaw, Poland.",sebastian.bobowski@gmail.com; golajan@op.pl; wojciech.szydlo@uwr.edu.pl,"Bobowski, Sebastian SB/Q-3884-2018","Szydlo, Wojciech/0000-0003-3987-9318; Gola, Jan/0000-0001-9236-9259",National Science Centre [DEC-2014/14/E/HS5/00845],"National Science Centre(National Science Centre, Poland)",Publication was prepared within the framework of research project funded by the National Science Centre-decision DEC-2014/14/E/HS5/00845.,,9,3,3,0,10,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-67916-7; 978-3-319-67915-0,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,89,103,,10.1007/978-3-319-67916-7_6,0.0,,,15,Area Studies; Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL4TI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450786500006,0

Due to the fact that these indicators have been proven to be very low, the following barriers limiting the internationalization process of the studied entities are analysed: access to sources of financing, lack of knowledge, investment expenditures, risk of starting business on the international market.","[Duda, Joanna] AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Management, Al Mickiewicza 30, PL-30059 Krakow, Poland",AGH University of Krakow,"Duda, J (通讯作者)，AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Management, Al Mickiewicza 30, PL-30059 Krakow, Poland.",aduda@zarz.agh.edu.pl,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,414,423,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400041,0

The questionnaires were collected among business students coming from more than 30 countries, from 2011 to 2016. The paper provides empirical proof of a significant difference of perception of what constitutes attractive work goals among an otherwise homogenous cohort due to cultural influence. The main limitations of the study came from the lack of biographical data collected during the gathering of the material, as only the nationality was surveyed. The main results are that receiving a Good Pay is clearly the most important goal to the Millennials interviewed. At the opposite side of the priorities, a Good Job Security scores relatively low to those students. The paper includes implications primarily for the field of cross-cultural management studies and practice, in particular in international human resource management.

The study determines the coniferous and non coniferous energy wood supply shifters. The econometrics approach of modelling was applied to create the models of energy wood supply in Slovakia. The results showed a set of significant explanatory variables for both types (softwood and hardwood) of energy wood. Supply of softwood energy wood was determined by the costs linked to felling operations and by the actual volume felled. On the other hand, the supply of hardwood energy wood was determined by the ratio of higher rotation age classes of forest and the volume of incidental felling. The developed supply models were the basis for the elaboration of prognosis of the energy wood supply in Slovakia.","[Dzian, Michal; Palus, Hubert; Parobek, Jan; Supin, Mikulas] Tech Univ Zvolen, Dept Mkt Trade & World Forestry, Fac Wood Sci & Technol, Zvolen, Slovakia",Technical University Zvolen,"Dzian, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Zvolen, Dept Mkt Trade & World Forestry, Fac Wood Sci & Technol, Zvolen, Slovakia.",michal.dzian@tuzvo.sk,"Dzian, Michal/D-8872-2018; Parobek, Jan/M-3686-2014; Paluš, Hubert/K-9135-2015","Parobek, Jan/0000-0002-3441-934X; Paluš, Hubert/0000-0002-1187-4286","Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic; Slovak Academy of Sciences [1/0473/16]; Slovak Research and Development Agency [APVV-14-0869]","Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic; Slovak Academy of Sciences(Slovak Academy of Sciences); Slovak Research and Development Agency(Slovak Research and Development Agency)","The authors are grateful for the support of the Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic, and the Slovak Academy of Sciences, Grant No. 1/0473/16, Dynamics and determinants of wood based products market in the Slovak Republicand the Slovak Research and Development Agency, Grant APVV-14-0869 Research of the utilization of wood as a renewable raw material in the context of a green economy.",,12,2,2,0,2,FAC FORESTRY BELGRADE UNIV,BELGRADE,"KNEZA VISESLAVA 1, BELGRADE, 11070, SERBIA",,,978-86-7299-277-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,347,353,,,,,,7,"Economics; Engineering, Manufacturing; Forestry",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Engineering; Forestry,BM4XC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000464293200041,0

In spite of this, research on financial performativity inspired by Latour's perspective can still be interpreted in terms of immanent critique and related to Political Economy (a critical discipline), through Kant's critique of metaphysics as a 'regulative axiom'. Research on financial performativity has uncovered evidence of the existence of constructive processes that show how an idea (like a financial model) can become something like an 'object'. This 'objectivity' appears to contradict Kant's critique of metaphysics - that there always remains a gap between our ideas and the world itself. This paper therefore explores financial performativity as a 'contradiction', historicizing it to argue that 'Barnesian performativity' and 'financial liquidity' are 'immanent' to one another in the events of recent financial crises. The paper conducts this interpretation to provide a new conceptualization of 'financial liquidity' that is more empirically apparent, helping to overcome some of the limits in the discussion of 'liquidity' in Political Economy (that Latour might want to highlight), where discussion occurs in metaphysical terms difficult to connect to actual events.","[Jefferis, Chris] Freie Univ, John F Kennedy Inst Amer Studies, Dept Polit Sci, Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin,"Jefferis, C (通讯作者)，Freie Univ, John F Kennedy Inst Amer Studies, Dept Polit Sci, Berlin, Germany.",cjefferis@zedat.fu-berlin.de,,,,,,,52,1,1,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party pointed out that China's economic development has entered a stage of high-quality development, and socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era. The main contradiction in our society has been transformed into a contradiction between the growing needs of the people's better life and the development of inadequate imbalances. At present, how to carry out enterprise management innovation in the new era has attracted widespread attention from scholars at home and abroad. Since the reform and opening up, China's economic strength has been greatly improved. Advanced management experience and technology have flowed into China, which has made tremendous contributions to the development of China's enterprises. Management innovation has played an increasingly important role in the development of enterprises. At present, China's economy has entered a new normal, and the resource conditions and dynamic factors supporting China's rapid economic growth are gradually changing. The nature of the new normal is a structural problem, and structural reform is urgently needed. The proposal of supply-side structural reform will build a new driving force for the next stage of economic growth and bring new opportunities to the development of enterprises. Therefore, the traditional enterprise management model is no longer suitable for the further development of enterprises, and innovation is the only way to promote the sustainable growth of enterprises. Enterprise growth is realized by enterprise innovation.","[Jin, Wu] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Nanfang Coll, Guangzhou 510970, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Nanfang College, Guangzhou; Sun Yat Sen University","Jin, W (通讯作者)，Sun Yat Sen Univ, Nanfang Coll, Guangzhou 510970, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,3,1,2,0,7,FRANCIS ACAD PRESS,LONDON,"35 IVOR PL, LOWER GROUND, LONDON, NW1 6EA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-912407-98-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,106,108,,,,,,3,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BL4ID,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450418800022,0

This paper explores the performance of certain parametric survival models in cases where this assumption doesn't hold. Firstly, a correctly specified likelihood for a bivariate parametric copula and two parametric marginal survival functions is derived. Secondly, the bias and variance of this estimator are compared on simulated data with the bias and variance of the standard estimator. The results of this simulation are confirmed analytically for special cases. In the third part, we discuss the consequences for regression models using a dummy covariate. In particular, we present a model where the parameters of dependence are also a function of covariate values. We show that standard survival models can lead to flawed conclusions if independence between survival time and censoring time is assumed wrongly, even in cases when parametric families of the margins are correct.","[Kovar, Radoslav; Mala, Ivana; Habarta, Filip] Univ Econ, Winston Churchill Sq 1938-4, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Kovár, R (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Winston Churchill Sq 1938-4, Prague, Czech Republic.",xkovr11@vse.cz; malai@vse.cz; xhabf00@vse.cz,,,Interni grantova agentura Vysoke skoly ekonomicke v Praze (Internal Grant Agency of the University of Economics in Prague) [F4/80/2018],Interni grantova agentura Vysoke skoly ekonomicke v Praze (Internal Grant Agency of the University of Economics in Prague),This paper is supported by the grant F4/80/2018 (Spolecne rozdeleni dvou dob preziti a jeho zmeny v case) which has been provided by the Interni grantova agentura Vysoke skoly ekonomicke v Praze (Internal Grant Agency of the University of Economics in Prague).,,12,0,0,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,891,900,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400089,0

Intercultural competence can be described as a range of competences that allow effective functioning in a multi- or intercultural environment. It facilitates understanding of people from other cultures, building lasting, satisfying relationships and managing efficient operations. It seems that intercultural competence is mostly important in the case of international team management or negotiations, but there are also other fields of international business where the intercultural knowledge can be crucial: team cooperation, leadership, sending employees abroad. Finally intercultural competence influences financial outcomes of companies' operations.

In order to find the solution of this problem, it is necessary to analyze statistical data, identib; character of influence of advertising costs and non-advertising factors on the company's financial result (profit or loss). In this paper the dynamic model of optimal control of advertising expenses is constructed. In contrast to classical dynamic advertising models (Nerlove-Arrow, Vidale-Wolfe etc.), the model describes accumulated advertising effect and accumulated effect of previous sales taking into account delayed consumers' reaction on advertisements. The optimal control problem is formulated as a system of nonlinear integral equations of Volterra type and an integral criterion functional. The special case of the nonlinear integral equation of Volterra type, which is produced by typically boundaries, is formulated. The theorem of existence of solution of this equation is proved. Also the theorem of solution existence of the total profit maximization problem for the planning period under restrictions is examined. These restrictions involve the limited advertising budget and the functional relation between advertising and consumers' reaction.","[Lutoshkin, Igor Victorovich] Ulyanovsk State Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Digital Econ, Ulyanovsk, Russia",Ulyanovsk State University,"Lutoshkin, IV (通讯作者)，Ulyanovsk State Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Digital Econ, Ulyanovsk, Russia.",lutoshkiniv@ulsu.ru; ynr92@yandex.ru,"Lutoshkin, Igor/E-3593-2014; Igor, Lutoshkin/O-5276-2019; Lopes, Mariana f/IAR-3054-2023; Yamaltdinova, Nailya/X-6286-2018","Lutoshkin, Igor/0000-0002-4108-7646; Igor, Lutoshkin/0000-0002-4108-7646; Yamaltdinova, Nailya/0000-0001-8105-6425",Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation [2.1816.2017/(sic)],"Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation(Ministry of Education and Science, Russian Federation)",This work has been done as a part of the state task of Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation No2.1816.2017/(sic).,,13,3,3,1,9,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

The level of Internet penetration in a given country and the level of involvement in online shopping measured by the percentage of online shoppers do not adequately explain this diversification at EU countries level. Paper goal is to explain the level of the percentage of cross-border online shoppers at 34 European countries level, including 28 EU countries, 2 EEA members and 4 EU candidates, using the Classification And Regression Trees (CART) approach. Data used include the Eurostat quantitative data, supplemented with mystery shopping study data commissioned by the European Commission, indicators for local B2C e-commerce markets, and qualitative variables - e.g. sharing an official language, being insular country. The main identified factors affecting the level of cross-border online shopping are geo-blocking practices of online sellers, level of online-shopping from national sellers, having a common/similar language with another country, and EU membership. Unexpectedly, the existence of the local language version of AliExpress.com website coincides with the higher level of cross-border online shopping.","[Macik, Radoslaw] Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Fac Econ, Chair Mkt, 5 Maria Curie Sklodowska Sq, PL-20031 Lublin, Poland",Maria Curie-Sklodowska University,"Macik, R (通讯作者)，Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Fac Econ, Chair Mkt, 5 Maria Curie Sklodowska Sq, PL-20031 Lublin, Poland.",radoslaw.macik@umcs.pl,,"Macik, Radoslaw/0000-0002-4093-2924",,,,,12,0,0,0,5,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",2545-1227,,978-83-65907-20-2,SOC ECON MODEL FOREC,,,2018,1.0,,,,,,266,275,,10.14659/SEMF.2018.01.27,0.0,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BQ1LQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000576774700027,0

A stochastic production frontier is estimated together with a technical inefficiency model using cross-sectional data from 622 hotel units in Romania. The results show that the average efficiency is high. However, there are significant differences between hotels in different regions and with different star ratings. The most influential factor affecting efficiency is the online visibility of a hotel unit on social media platforms and on travel planning sites.

The aim of this paper is to present an analysis and an opinion of the attitudes of entrepreneurs to SME internationalisation in the context of political risk, including an indication of the geography of threats, directions of expansion, and preferred models of activity in foreign markets. The findings are based on a group administered questionnaire among 312 respondents from various industries in Poland in 2017. The research focused on preferences regarding the directions of geographic expansion in correlation with diverse internationalisation models, and opinions on markets presenting the highest political risk. The respondents showed awareness of risks related to geographic expansion, indicating political factors as the key source, which was mostly assessed through international conflicts and hostilities discussed in the media (TV, radio, and internet). The research contains unique data on entrepreneurial attitudes to internationalisation.

The pieces of information were gathered via personal interviews with the managers of the enterprises, and they were compared with the results from the questionnaire survey conducted among other industrial medium-sized enterprises operating in the Slovak Republic. The enterprises start the process of investment decision-making with the identification of a problem, and then proceed to the definition of variants, assessment of these variants, and the subsequent selection of the optimal one. The substantial criteria during the assessment are represented by the amount and return on investment but also by qualitative criteria, such as the impacts of the investment on the quality of products, or the previous experience. The enterprises acquire the information on opportunities in the market or on possible investment variants from various sources but mainly from the solutions of their competitors, trade fairs, customers, and from their employees. Even though the analysed enterprises belong among the efficient ones in relation to their investment process, they do not use the methods of appraisal of economic efficiency of investment during the assessment of investment variants, or they use them only to a low degree. Mainly, the amount of investment is important for them. The absence of these methods of appraisal is directly connected to the absence of analysis and quantification of risk of investment problems. The results of comparison of processes of investment decision-making in enterprises shall contribute to the identification of those factors that can make the investment process more efficient and inspire these enterprises to implement them.","[Malichova, Eva] Univ Zilina, Fac Management Sci & Informat, Zilina, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Malichova, E (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Management Sci & Informat, Zilina, Slovakia.",eva.malichova@fri.uniza.sk,"Malichová, Eva/AAV-7505-2020; Malichová, Eva/M-7105-2016","Malichová, Eva/0000-0002-8220-5637",,,,,16,2,2,0,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,428,435,,,,,,8,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO8KK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000527683300048,0

Israel and Arab countries have their legal arguments that they can use to justify the Arab League boycott or to invalidate it. The use of the national security exception in international economic law must be evaluated on the bottom-line question of effectiveness. The boycott has proven ineffective and is now increasingly counter-productive due to transformative regional and global developments. Free trade and efficient markets combined with the ability of talented individuals to work without discrimination and restriction are the hallmarks of vibrant economies and stability - true national security. While the establishment of the boycott-over seventy years ago - may at one time have served a perceived national security goal, there is no longer such a need. Continuing the boycott undermines the WTO's commitment to free trade and prosperity which ultimately harms all parties and their national security and harms the greater global interest in international stability for all parties.","[Malkawi, Bashar H.] Univ Sharjah, Law, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates; [Slawotsky, Joel] IDC Radzyner Law Sch, Herzliyya, Israel",University of Sharjah,"Malkawi, BH (通讯作者)，Univ Sharjah, Law, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates.",bmalkawi@sharjah.ac.ae; jslawotsky@idc.ac.il,,,,,,,90,0,0,0,4,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

By these means, researchers have observed that cognitive performance, including attention, executive function, working memory and even language, could be enhanced or impaired according to the type of current applied to targeted area of the brain. Likewise, motor skills would be altered when the motor pathways were being targeted at the site of the stimulation. A number of studies have gone further to suggest that the effects elicited by this mild brain stimulation go beyond the time of the actual experiment and have the potential for long-lasting benefits in patients suffering from aphasia, depression, stress related mental disorders, to name just a few. The positive results obtained by noninvasive brain stimulation are not limited however to mental health conditions, a growing literature has looked at how this intervention can be used in healthy participants to improve performance, reduce stress-related conditions or potentiate positive emotions. This paper is a review of one of these neuromodulatoiy techniques, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and its effects on cognitive performance, specifically face and object processing. In the absence of adverse effects and due to its relatively easy set-up, tDCS interventions have been used successfully in non-clinical protocols, becoming over the last two decades extremely popular outside the neuroscience laboratory, with private internet companies capitalizing on its success and making tDCS kits available for a wide spectrum of applications.","[Melinte, Andreea] Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, 30A Expozitiei Blvd,Sect 1, Bucharest 012104, Romania; [Melinte, Andreea] Univ East London, Stratford Campus, London E15 4LZ, England",National University of Political Studies & Public Administration (SNSPA) - Romania; University of East London,"Melinte, A (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, 30A Expozitiei Blvd,Sect 1, Bucharest 012104, Romania.;Melinte, A (通讯作者)，Univ East London, Stratford Campus, London E15 4LZ, England.",melinte.andreea@yahoo.com,,,,,,,73,0,0,0,1,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,989,997,,,,,,9,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200084,0

Considering the large-scale instances of this problem is NP-Hard, three meta-heuristic algorithms, such as NSGA-II, MOPSO, and Pareto Envelope-based Selection Algorithm (PESA)-II, are proposed. These algorithms are compared, and NSGA-II outperforms the other algorithms. Afterward, the proposed NSGA-II is compared with the exact method. The computational results show that the exact method only outperforms this algorithm with around 6% gap in the first objective function on average. Eventually, a sensitivity analysis has been conducted with respect to the number of DCs and vehicles. This shows that total costs, and total earliness and lateness increase and decrease in both cases, respectively.","[Momenikiyai, Mohammad; Ebrahimnejad, Sadoullah] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Karaj Branch, Karaj, Iran; [Vahdani, Behnam] Islamic Azad Univ, Fac Ind & Mech Engn, Dept Ind Engn, Qazvin Branch, Qazvin, Iran",Islamic Azad University; Islamic Azad University,"Momenikiyai, M (通讯作者)，Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Karaj Branch, Karaj, Iran.",momenkiyai@yahoo.com; ibrahimnejad@kiau.ac.ir; b.vandani@gmail.com,"Ebrahimnejad, sadoullah/AAN-3083-2021; Vahdani, Behnam/AAU-9080-2021","Vahdani, Behnam/0000-0001-9850-2698; Ebrahimnejad, Sadoullah/0000-0003-4886-5348",,,,,23,4,4,2,9,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Here we propose a natural hybrid generalisation of conditionally Student t MGARCH models. Our new hybrid EMSF-MGARCH specification is obtained by multiplying the MGARCH conditional covariance matrix H-t by a scalar random variable g(t), which comes from a latent process with auto-regression parameter phi that, for phi = 0, leads to an inverted gamma distribution for gt and thus to the t-MGARCH case. If phi not equal 0, the latent variables gt are dependent, so (in comparison to the t-MGARCH specification) in the new model of the observed time series we get an additional source of dependence and one more parameter. We apply the scalar BEKK specification as the basic MGARCH structure. Using the Bayesian approach, equipped with MCMC simulation techniques, we show how to estimate the new hybrid EMSF-SBEKK model. We present an empirical example that serves to illustrate the hybrid extension of the t-SBEKK model and its usefulness, as well as to compare it to the MSF-SBEKK case.","[Osiewalski, Jacek] Cracow Univ Econ, Fac Management, Dept Econometr & Operat Res, Ul Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland; [Pajor, Anna] Cracow Univ Econ, Fac Finance & Law, Dept Math, Ul Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics; Cracow University of Economics,"Osiewalski, J (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Fac Management, Dept Econometr & Operat Res, Ul Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",eeosiewa@cyf-kr.edu.pl; eopajor@cyf-kr.edu.pl,,"Osiewalski, Jacek/0000-0002-6710-6825; Pajor, Anna/0000-0001-5643-0649",,,,,15,3,3,0,0,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",2545-1227,,978-83-65907-20-2,SOC ECON MODEL FOREC,,,2018,1.0,,,,,,345,354,,10.14659/SEMF.2018.01.35,0.0,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BQ1LQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000576774700035,0

We have looked at the way in which the two candidates relate themselves to and/or promote the doctrines of their supporting parties: The Democratic Liberal Party and the Social Democratic Party. In order to outline the theoretical and methodological frame required by the analysis, we have suggested the term of accord to refer to the adequacy/correspondence between the party's program and that of the supported candidate. The accord will be described by using a mathematical model capable of representing the relations between the two categories of discourse. Approaching the accord between the party's program and that of the candidate was done from three perspectives: thematic, actional and axiological. Thematically speaking, we are interested in the extent to which the approached topics, the terms and the concepts by means of which the problems are identified in the discourse of the candidate are also found in the discourse of his party. In terms of action, we shall analyze the extent to which the same type of solutions to the same type of problems can be found in the two discourses. Axiologically speaking, we shall emphasize the common values promoted in the discourses of the candidates and political parties involved in the electoral race. We have resorted to content analysis to approach the candidates' discourses and the parties' political programs.","[Patrut, Monica] Vasile Alecsandri Univ Bacau, 8 Spiru Haret St, Bacau, Romania",University of Bacau,"Patrut, M (通讯作者)，Vasile Alecsandri Univ Bacau, 8 Spiru Haret St, Bacau, Romania.",monicapatrut@yahoo.com,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,998,1006,,,,,,9,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200085,0

Do they perceive the CSR e-reporting as a tool for (un)fair competition? A pioneering study is performed with the use of both primary and secondary data. This interdisciplinary research is complemented by a Meta-Analysis, which holistically addresses the hypothesis that the CSR e-reporting, as set in the EU, demonstrates the information asymmetry which has an impact on the unfair competition phenomena, such as business secrets, denigration, misleading information, etc. This regime can lead to more transparency, information awareness and CSR commitment, as well as to, so far overlooked, abuses and unfair competition behaviour.","[Pelikanova, Radka MacGregor; MacGregor, Robert] Angloamer Univ, Letenska 5, Prague 11800 1, Czech Republic",Anglo-American University,"Pelikánová, RM (通讯作者)，Angloamer Univ, Letenska 5, Prague 11800 1, Czech Republic.",radkamacgregor@yahoo.com; robertkmacgregor@yahoo.com,"MacGregor Pelikanova, Radka/G-2601-2018; MacGregor, Robert/E-9858-2019","MacGregor Pelikanova, Radka/0000-0001-9628-7146; MacGregor, Robert/0000-0003-2888-3880",,,,,15,4,4,1,5,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,1112,1122,,,,,,11,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400111,0

Company must tend to keep inventories at an optimal level and collect receivables as soon as possible since it is important that cash is not tied up in inventories or in receivables. Cash gap represents the difference in days between the days of paying for purchases and days of collecting cash form receivables. Considering that in these days company is without cash, the cash gap must be financed. As higher the cash gap is, more funds are needed. When company is financed from other sources, there is the cost of financing, that is, interest cost. As higher the cash gap is, interest is higher. The starting point of this research is that the relation between the cash gap and the company's indebtedness is positive, in other words, the higher the cash gap is, liabilities are higher, such as interest cost. The research is conducted on the large entities in the Republic of Croatia for the period from the year 2010 to the year 2015. Cash gap was put in relation with debt indicators such as: financial expense which is interest cost and debt ratio which shows how big part of the company's asset is financed from external sources. Results showed that although there is weak positive correlation between the cash gap and interest cost, as well as between the cash gap and debt ratio, those correlations are not significant.","[Percevic, Hrvoje; Hladika, Mirjana; Micin, Marina] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Accounting, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Micin, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Accounting, Zagreb, Croatia.",hpercevic@efzg.hr; mhladika@efzg.hr; mmicin@efzg.hr,"Perčević, Hrvoje/JXR-7488-2024; Mićin, Marina/H-8303-2018; Hladika, Mirjana/I-1152-2018","Perčević, Hrvoje/0000-0001-9410-0755;",,,,,15,0,0,0,5,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-76288-3; 978-3-319-76287-6,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2018,9.0,,,,,,189,201,,10.1007/978-3-319-76288-3_14,0.0,,,13,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO7XE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000525862100014,0

The accuracy and precision of ES-GGM based models have proven superior in all project life cycles compared to EVM models.","[Simion, Cezar-Petre; Marin, Irinel] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Simion, CP (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",cezar.simion@man.ase.ro; irinel.marin@ase.ro,"Irinel, Marin/AFW-3687-2022","Irinel, Marin/0000-0002-0070-0352",,,,,17,3,4,0,38,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Other mechanisms, rooted in a commercial disguise, would be more effective as they could incentivize private standard-setters to comply with the WTO legal system. It is argued that WTO Members worried about the trade-restrictive nature of private standards should draft procedural guidelines in collaboration with intergovernmental organizations(IGOs) and private multi-stakeholder standard-setting bodies. Such procedural guidelines should be aimed at simplifying the certification process and making it easier for farmers and producers to comply with the private standard.","[van der Zee, Eva] Wageningen Univ, Law & Governance Grp LAW, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"van der Zee, E (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Law & Governance Grp LAW, Wageningen, Netherlands.",eva.vanderzee@wur.nl,,"van der Zee, Eva/0000-0002-0146-7679",Ministry of Economic Affairs,Ministry of Economic Affairs,"Postdoctoral researcher at the Law and Governance Group (LAW) at Wageningen University, the Netherlands.

This regulation is the latest milestone in the process of tightening the supply chain requirements concerning tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold. The aim of this process is to encourage companies to respect human rights and avoid contributing to conflict through their mineral sourcing practices by cultivating transparent mineral supply chains and sustainable corporate engagement in the mineral sector. Measures already in place include the US Dodd-Frank Act and the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Afflicted and High-Risk Areas. However, the former applies only to the Democratic Republic of Congo and its neighbouring countries. By contrast, the OECD Guidance is broader in material and geographic scope but stipulates only non-binding recommendations. The following article discusses these sets of rules.

The aim of this paper is to present the current rules related to the EU state aid in agriculture and show its extent and scope. Moreover, the paper tries to answer the question of the necessity of changes in the agricultural state aid given the planned alterations in the CAP and the challenges faced by the EU agriculture. The paper is based on the analysis of regulations related to state aid and the data on the scope and scale of the state aid applied by the EU member states. The results of the study show that there is still much room for simplification of the rules. Moreover, especially in the cases of plant and animal diseases it is worth considering whether the support should not be limited only to SMEs. Such situtionas are a serious problem not only to SMEs but to any enterprise and when not tackled properly can spread to other entities and endanger agricultural activity in whole regions or countries.","[Wieliczko, Barbara] Natl Res Inst, Inst Agr & Food Econ, Warsaw, Poland",Institute of Agricultural & Food Economy,"Wieliczko, B (通讯作者)，Natl Res Inst, Inst Agr & Food Econ, Warsaw, Poland.",Barbara.Wieliczko@ierigz.waw.pl,"Wieliczko, Barbara/AAG-7525-2021","Wieliczko, Barbara/0000-0003-3770-0409",,,,,4,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,61,68,,,,,,8,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO8KK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000527683300006,0

But any statistical survey is not able to determine the size of indirect losses - the number of unborn children due to the hostilities. In this case, it's possible to apply statistical modeling. In this article we presented the results of statistical estimation of the impact of armed conflict on reduction of the number of births using the Interrupted ARIMA model (0,1,1)(0,0,1)4, which also takes into account the seasonal character of childbearing. The model allows us to conclude that the number of births in Ukraine only in the second quarter of 2014 decreased by 9749 persons, through the annexation of the Crimea and the armed conflict in the Donbas. Continued hostilities, worsening of medical-demographic and socio-economic situation as in combat zone, as well as generally around Ukraine, gives reason to anticipate a further increase in indirect demographic losses.","[Yerina, Antonina M.; Palian, Zinaida O.] Taras Shevchenko Natl Univ Kyiv, Stat & Demog Dept, 90-a Vasylkivska St, UA-03022 Kiev, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv,"Palian, ZO (通讯作者)，Taras Shevchenko Natl Univ Kyiv, Stat & Demog Dept, 90-a Vasylkivska St, UA-03022 Kiev, Ukraine.",am_yerina@ukr.net; zipalyan@ukr.net,"Palian, Zinaida/B-2815-2018; Yerina, Antonina/AAY-8191-2021","Yerina, Antonina/0000-0002-3765-4441",,,,,13,0,0,0,1,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",2545-1227,,978-83-65907-20-2,SOC ECON MODEL FOREC,,,2018,1.0,,,,,,593,602,,10.14659/SEMF.2018.01.60,0.0,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BQ1LQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000576774700060,0

In this context, how can learning enable collective survival in the present and enlarge possibilities for yet-unimaginable alternative futures to emerge? This paper explores this question by juxtaposing three models of educational futurity in different neoliberal contexts. The first, dominating state education policy and practice in Anglospheric and specifically British institutions, promotes performative and disciplinary regimes of anticipation. The second, circulating in discourse and in experimental spaces within this hegemonic context, advocates an emergentist, critical and creative relationship to the future. The third, which thrives in the margins and relative exteriorities of the capitalist world system, promotes an ecological, epistemically disobedient and utopian mode of anticipatory consciousness which 'projects emancipation beyond the constraints of the existing discourse' of colonial modernity. We do not attempt to compare these different contexts and models in this paper, but to read each for its difference to illustrate that modes of anticipation in education influence the construction of hopelessness and hope by shaping what is learned about the nature of political possibility and the relationship between learning and the future. We argue that pedagogies which embrace critical modes of anticipation offer alternatives to contemporary regimes of anticipation in education in Britain today. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The concept of cluster, where several facilities producing different products are closely located, is introduced and specially considered. In order to analyze facilities integration, discounts on investment and production costs are assumed. In addition, tradeoffs between clusters and individual facilities configurations are assessed. The proposed approach is applied to a forest supply chain, where some production plants use the same raw materials while others compete for the use of byproducts and residuals. Results allow for costs reduction when resources and services are shared by plants within a cluster, where, besides, the effect of production scale on the overall SC is also taken into account.","[Vanzetti, Nicolas; Corsano, Gabriela; Montagna, Jorge M.] UTN, CONICET, INGAR Inst Desarrollo & Diseno, S3002GJC, RA-3657 Avellaneda, Santa Fe, Argentina; [Corsano, Gabriela] UNL, FIQ, S3002GJC, RA-2829 Santiago Del Estero, Santa Fe, Argentina",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); National University of the Littoral,"Montagna, JM (通讯作者)，UTN, CONICET, INGAR Inst Desarrollo & Diseno, S3002GJC, RA-3657 Avellaneda, Santa Fe, Argentina.",nvanzetti@santafe-conicet.gov.ar; gcorsano@santafe-conicet.gov.ar; mmontagna@santafe-conicet.gov.ar,,"Corsano, Gabriela/0000-0002-0235-4262; Vanzetti, Nicolas/0000-0002-9589-3715",CONICET [PIP 0682]; ANPCyT [PICT-2012-2484]; UTN [EIUTIFE0003974TC],CONICET(Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)); ANPCyT(ANPCyT); UTN,"The authors would like to acknowledge financial support from CONICET, ANPCyT, and UTN to develop research activities through their projects PIP 0682, PICT-2012-2484, and PID EIUTIFE0003974TC, respectively.",,31,9,9,1,14,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,OCT,2017,83.0,,,,,,88,98,,10.1016/j.forpol.2017.06.006,0.0,,,11,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,FK6JW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413611000010,0

To address the potential endogeneity of insurer entry, I use an instrumental variables approach. In the first year of the marketplaces, I find that an additional insurer decreased premium plus cost-sharing parameters by 5 percent or more. In the second year of the marketplaces, two national insurers entered many of the marketplaces for the first time. Except for inpatient services, I find that a new insurer had no average effect on premium plus cost-sharing parameters. However, new insurer entry was more likely to lower premium plus cost-sharing parameters in counties with fewer incumbent insurers. In counties with three or more incumbent insurers, a new insurer actually increased cost-sharing parameters for emergency room services. The increases may be related to new insurers shifting bargaining power to be more in favor of emergency departments when negotiating costs of medical services.","[Lissenden, Brett] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",University of Virginia,"Lissenden, B (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",bcl8ag@virginia.edu,,"Lissenden, Brett/0000-0001-7514-6037",UVA; Bynum Grant,UVA; Bynum Grant,This research has benefited from financial assistance through the UVA Steer Fund and a Bynum Grant.,,24,3,3,1,3,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",2332-3493,2332-3507,,AM J HEALTH ECON,AM.

This paper investigates the economic and environmental effects of different climate change policy designs in a general equilibrium setting with heterogeneous firms and monopolistic competition. The analysis predicts that the cap on emissions perfectly defines the environmental quality but has no effect on firms' profits, or decisions to enter or exit the market. In contrast, increasing the share of free allocations of emission allowances, as opposed to auctions, has no effect on environmental quality but reallocates resources among firms toward the most productive ones which has an impact on firms' entry and exit decisions, the mass of firms, and the composition of the market. Firm heterogeneity magnifies these economic effects of changes in the initial allocation of allowances. The paper provides a decomposition of the change in aggregate emissions which takes account of the changes at sector level, across the firms within a sector, and at the firm level.

Public goods sharing involves more exclusionary sharing out, and creates only weak ties and a limited sense of community or caring. The same is true of the so-called sharing economy.

The identification of priority areas for conservation is crucial for land use planning to ensure the protection of biodiversity and ecological function. Intact Forest Landscapes (IFLs), as defined by Greenpeace and World Resources Institute (WRI), are areas of the forest ecosystems not subjected to human activities. They have been identified by mapping human disturbances through remote sensing. Contrary to similar global-scale concepts, IFLs have been integrated into the standards of the certification body Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and therefore have practical implications for forest management policies. The Motion 65, approved in the general assembly of FSC in 2014, mandates the protection of IFLs located in FSC certified logging concessions. Until the implementation of national standards, forestry operations are banished from 80% of the IFL area within each forest management unit. To trace the history and evaluate the suitability of IFLs in the Central African context, we searched for documents related to the IFL method, and related approaches focusing on the identification of areas devoid of human disturbances. The IFL method is simple and cost-effective and allows for a global assessment of the influence of human infrastructures and industrial exploitation on forests. However, the method does not consider the situation below the canopy and those forest components not visible by satellites. For example, hunting, one of the main threats faced by wildlife in Central African forests today, cannot be detected with satellite imagery. On the other hand, other anthropogenic activities which remote sensing may detect may be compatible with forest ecosystem conservation. To better tailor the IFL approach to Central African forests, we recommend (i) the consideration of wildlife communities in the intactness analysis, (ii) a thorough evaluation of the impacts of human activities on forest ecosystems, and (iii) the integration of local stakeholders and governments in the design of land management strategies to respond to social, economic and environmental needs.

Compared with matched insured persons, those uninsured in 1992 consume fewer health-care services, but their health (while alive) does not deteriorate relative to the insured, and, in our central estimates, they do not die significantly faster than the insured.

The aim of this paper is threefold: 1) to quantify inequality in diabetes health care service utilization; 2) to understand determinants of these inequalities in relation to socio-demographic and clinical morbidity factors; and 3) to compare the empirical outcome of using income level and educational level as proxies for Socio Economic Status (SES). Data on the entire Danish population of diabetes patients in 2011 (N = 318,729) were applied. Patients' unique personal identification number enabled individual patient data from several national registers to be linked. A concentration index approach with decomposition into contributing factors was applied. Differences in diabetes patients' health care utilization patterns suggest that use of services differ among patients of lower and higher SES, despite the Danish universal health care system. Especially, out-patient services, rehabilitation and specialists in primary care show different utilization patterns according to SES. Comparison of the empirical outcome from using educational level and income level as proxy for patients' SES indicate important differences in inequality estimates. While income, alike other measures of labor market attachment, to a certain extent is explained by morbidity and thus endogenous, education is more decisive for patients' ability to take advantage of the more specialized services provided in a universal health care system.","[Sortso, Camilla; Lauridsen, Jorgen] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, Ctr Hlth Econ Res COHERE, Campusvej 55, DK-5S30 Odense M, Denmark; [Sortso, Camilla; Emneus, Martha; Green, Anders; Jensen, Peter Bjodstrup] Inst Appl Econ & Hlth Res ApEHR, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Green, Anders] Odense Univ Hosp, Odense Patient Data Explorat Network OPEN, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Green, Anders] Univ Southern Denmark, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark; University of Southern Denmark; Odense University Hospital; University of Southern Denmark,"Lauridsen, J (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, Ctr Hlth Econ Res COHERE, Campusvej 55, DK-5S30 Odense M, Denmark.",jtl@sam.sdu.dk,"Green, Anders/T-8788-2019","Green, Anders/0000-0002-5059-3655; Jensen, Peter Bjodstrup/0000-0001-5435-9092; Lauridsen, Jorgen T./0000-0001-9889-6236","Danish Centre for Strategic Research in Type 2 Diabetes, DD2; Astra Zeneca/BMS; Novo Nordisk; Merck; Sanofi Aventis; Bayer","Danish Centre for Strategic Research in Type 2 Diabetes, DD2; Astra Zeneca/BMS(AstraZeneca); Novo Nordisk(Novo NordiskNovo Nordisk Foundation); Merck(Merck & Company); Sanofi Aventis(Sanofi-Aventis); Bayer(Bayer AG)","Camilla Sortsos research was financed by an unrestricted grant from The Danish Centre for Strategic Research in Type 2 Diabetes, DD2.

Less attention has been given to the earnings risk of major choice. In this paper, we use an experiment to study the impact of an information intervention by providing individuals with data that show the earnings risk of a major choice. Our intervention allows us to compare earnings risk and major preferences among a group who is informed about earnings risk compared to a group not given information about risk. Our results show that individuals who see information about earnings risk form different earnings risk estimates and preferences over majors than individuals who see median earnings only. These differences show the negative consequences of making academic major decisions when holding incorrect estimates of earnings risk, and suggest the value of including earnings risk in tools such as college scorecards to inform students.

Disease definition, epidemiological approach, perspective, type of costs, activity data sources, cost valuation, sensitivity analysis, cost discounting and presentation of costs may be described in COI studies. Each reviewed study was assessed with a methodological grid including these nine items. The five following items have been detailed in the reviewed studies: epidemiological approach (59 % of studies described it), perspective (75 %), type of costs (98 %), activity data sources (91 %) and cost valuation (59 %). The disease definition and the presentation of results were detailed in fewer studies (respectively 50 and 46 %). In contrast, sensitivity analysis was only performed in 14 % of studies and cost discounting in 7 %. Considering the studies showing an average cost per patient and per year with a societal perspective, DR cost estimates were US $2297 (range 5-67,486), DKD cost ranged from US $1095 to US $16,384, and DFU cost was US $10,604 (range 1444-85,718). This review reinforces the need to adequately describe the method to facilitate literature comparisons and projections. It also recalls that COI studies represent complementary tools to cost-effectiveness studies to help decision makers in the allocation of economic resources for the management of DR, DKD and DFU.","[Schirr-Bonnans, Solene; Costa, Nadege; Lepage, Benoit; Molinier, Laurent] Natl Inst Hlth & Med Res Inserm, Fac Med, Unite Inserm 1027, Res Unit 1027, 37 Allees Jules Guesde, F-31073 Toulouse, France; [Schirr-Bonnans, Solene; Lepage, Benoit; Hanaire, Helene; Molinier, Laurent] Univ Paul Sabatier Toulouse III, Univ Sci Toulouse III, Batiment 1R1, F-31062 Toulouse 9, France; [Schirr-Bonnans, Solene; Martini, Jacques; Hanaire, Helene; Turnin, Marie-Christine] Univ Hosp Toulouse, Hop Rangueil, Diabetol Metab Dis & Nutr Dept, Serv Diabetol Malad Metabol & Nutr, 1 Ave Jean Poulhes,TSA 50032, F-31059 Toulouse 9, France; [Costa, Nadege; Derumeaux-Burel, Helene; Bos, Jeremy; Garnault, Valerie; Turnin, Marie-Christine; Molinier, Laurent] Univ Hosp Toulouse, Dept Med Informat, Hotel Dieu St Jacques, 2 Rue Viguerie, F-31059 Toulouse 9, France; [Lepage, Benoit] Univ Hosp Toulouse, Fac Med, Methodol Support Unit, USMR, 37 Allees Jules Guesde, F-31073 Toulouse, France",Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; CHU de Toulouse; CHU de Toulouse; CHU de Toulouse; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier,"Schirr-Bonnans, S (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Hlth & Med Res Inserm, Fac Med, Unite Inserm 1027, Res Unit 1027, 37 Allees Jules Guesde, F-31073 Toulouse, France.;Schirr-Bonnans, S (通讯作者)，Univ Paul Sabatier Toulouse III, Univ Sci Toulouse III, Batiment 1R1, F-31062 Toulouse 9, France.;Schirr-Bonnans, S (通讯作者)，Univ Hosp Toulouse, Hop Rangueil, Diabetol Metab Dis & Nutr Dept, Serv Diabetol Malad Metabol & Nutr, 1 Ave Jean Poulhes,TSA 50032, F-31059 Toulouse 9, France.",schirr-bonnans.s@chu-toulouse.fr,"Lepage, Benoit/AAD-6193-2021; LEPAGE, Benoit/R-4715-2019; LEPAGE, Benoit/C-1228-2011","LEPAGE, Benoit/0000-0002-1586-2055","French Ministry of Health (Programme de Recherche sur la Performance du Systeme de Soins, PREPS) [12-018-0078]; French Midi-Pyrenees Regional Council (Recherche en Transfert Clinique et Normalisation, APTCN) [13 05 06 30]","French Ministry of Health (Programme de Recherche sur la Performance du Systeme de Soins, PREPS); French Midi-Pyrenees Regional Council (Recherche en Transfert Clinique et Normalisation, APTCN)","This study was supported by a grant from the French Ministry of Health (Programme de Recherche sur la Performance du Systeme de Soins, PREPS 2012.

Because frailty is a distinct health condition, its contribution to HCE was assessed in comparison with other health covariates (including chronic diseases and functional limitations, time-to-death, and a multidimensional composite health index). Results indicate that whatever health covariates are considered, frailty provides significant additional explanative power to the models. Frailty is an important omitted variable in HCE models.

A Commentary on the Proposed TRIPS-Plus Damages Reforms in the Third Amendment to the Copyright Law of the PRC Through Comparison with the US and EU,JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The proposed third amendment to PRC copyright law endeavours to enhance the standards of damages to fight piracy more effectively via a TRIPS-Plus approach. This includes, inter alia, reframing statutory damages, introducing punitive damages, and new evidence rules granting the right of information to right holders. Nonetheless, the inconsistency of the extra-compensatory rationales of civil damage with the principle of restoration enshrined in the traditional Chinese copyright regime risks causing difficulties for the Chinese courts in implementing the new rules. The new provision on the right of information on pirated goods is a significant weapon to combat piracy that, conversely, risks causing tension between copyright enforcement and data protection, in addition to jeopardizing the defendants' and third persons' rights to privacy. This article argues that the proposed higher protection standards of copyright enforcement in China should not remain solely written law. The Chinese courts need to develop applicable conventions for calculating damages, based essentially on investigation using objective criteria of how much compensation ought to be payable, which is also the basis of calculating reasonable statutory damages. In this regard, this article advocates considering the merits and demerits of compatible enforcement provisions in the US and EU, and, meanwhile, developing a unified minimum standard for all courts in China via accepted and consistent judicial practice and through persistent dialogue and interaction with the academic community.",,,,,,,,,,,67,3,3,1,10,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Drawing on the 2007 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), which differentiates between physical and sexual IPV, results from logistic regressions reveal that the HBM better explains physical IPV, while the MBM better predicts sexual IPV. Further, the HBM does better accounting for IPV among wealthier women, while the MBM best explains IPV among poorer women. The findings suggest the need to reconsider broad programs and policies intended to prevent and ameliorate IPV in the Dominican Republic, and to implement targeted initiatives focusing on the economic factors motivating them.","[Bueno, Cruz Caridad] SUNY Coll New Paltz, Black Studies Dept, 1 Hawk Dr, New Paltz, NY 12561 USA; [Henderson, Errol A.] Penn State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, University Pk, PA 16801 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY New Paltz; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Bueno, CC (通讯作者)，SUNY Coll New Paltz, Black Studies Dept, 1 Hawk Dr, New Paltz, NY 12561 USA.",buenoc@newpaltz.edu; eah13@psu.edu,,,,,,,41,24,26,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Income tax, together with excise duty, profit tax and value added tax make up the majority of the country's tax revenue. Since the professional and political discussions give to the income tax gives (too) much attention, it is subject to frequent changes. The goal of changes in personal income tax is to increase personal consumption, which makes 60 to 70% of GDP, which results in an increase of GDP. The Croatian tax system distinguishes several categories of taxes: state taxes, county taxes, city or municipal taxes, joint taxes, gambling profit tax and gambling bonuses, as well as fees from the established value of the prize pool funds. Income tax falls into the category of common taxes, ie that tax is partly part of the state budget, part of the counties budget and the city/municipalities or prat of the city/municipality budget. The Law on Financing the Units of Local and Regional Self-Government determines exactly in which proportions income tax is distributed. Thus, 60% of income refers to the income of the city / municipality, 16.5% represents the share of the county while the share for decentralized functions is 6%, the share of the call for decentralized assistance calls for 16%, and the share of assistance for projects co-financed by the European Structural and Investment funds 1.5%. It is also important to note that cities, municipalities and counties (including the City of Zagreb), which, according to special laws, finance decetralized functions, have the right to an additional income tax share of 1.9% (primary education), 1.3% (secondary education), 0.8% (social welfare) and 1% for health and public fire brigade units. Any change in personal income tax should be communicated to the accounting departments of the company so that there will be no mistake when calculating and recording the obligations resulting from employee salaries calculation. The purpose of this paper is to compare income tax changes over the last five years in Republic Croatia and to show the accounting recording thereof, with an analysis of the impact on personal conspumtion of the changes carried out.","[Grubisic, Anita; Grubisic, Anita; Mijatovic, Eva] Univ Coll Management & Design ASPIRA, Split, Croatia",,"Grubisic, A (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Management & Design ASPIRA, Split, Croatia.",toni.miljak@aspira.hr; anita.grubisic@aspira.hr; eva.mijatovic@aspira.hr,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,508,514,,,,,,7,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6MR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426857700055,0

SAV provides important ecosystem functions, many of which are beneficial to local residents. To understand the implicit value residents place on SAV and the ecosystem services it provides, we undertake a hedonic property value study using residential transactions in 11 Maryland counties adjacent to the Chesapeake Bay. These data are matched to high resolution maps of SAV coverage. We pose a quasi-experimental comparison and examine how the prices of homes near the waterfront vary with the presence of SAV. On average, waterfront and near-waterfront homes within 200 meters of the shore sell at about a 6.5% premium when SAV is present. Applying these estimates to the 185,000-acre SAV attainment goal suggests total property value gains on the order of $436 million.","[Guignet, Dennis; Griffiths, Charles; Klemick, Heather] US EPA, Natl Ctr Environm Econ, 1200 Penn Ave NW, Washington, DC 20460 USA; [Walsh, Patrick J.] Landcare Res, 231 Morrin Rd, Auckland 1072, New Zealand",United States Environmental Protection Agency; Landcare Research - New Zealand,"Guignet, D (通讯作者)，US EPA, Natl Ctr Environm Econ, 1200 Penn Ave NW, Washington, DC 20460 USA.",guignet.dennis@epa.gov; griffiths.charles@epa.gov; klemick.heather@epa.gov; walshp@landcareresearch.co.nz,,"Walsh, Patrick/0000-0001-9390-6538; Klemick, Heather/0000-0003-2141-2023",US Environmental Protection Agency,US Environmental Protection Agency(United States Environmental Protection Agency),This research was supported by funding from the US Environmental Protection Agency.

However, the underlying stochastic process to derive DCC has not yet been established, which has made problematic the derivation of regularity conditions, such as stationarity and invertibility, and asymptotic properties of the Quasi-Maximum Likelihood Estimators (QMLE). To date, the statistical properties of the QMLE of the DCC parameters have been derived under highly restrictive and unverifiable regularity conditions, which essentially leads to proof by assumption. The paper shows that the DCC model can be obtained from a vector random coefficient moving average process, and derives the stationarity and invertibility conditions of the DCC model. The derivation of DCC from a vector random coefficient moving average process raises three important issues: (i) demonstrates that DCC is, in fact, a dynamic conditional covariance model of the returns shocks rather than a dynamic conditional correlation model; (ii) provides the motivation, which is presently missing, for standardization of the conditional covariance model to obtain the conditional correlation model; and (iii) shows that the appropriate univariate conditional volatility model for DCC is based on the standardized shocks rather than the returns shocks. The derivation of the regularity conditions, especially stationarity and invertibility, should subsequently lead to a solid statistical foundation for the estimates of the DCC parameters.","[Hafner, Christian M.] Catholic Univ Louvain, ISBA, Louvain, Belgium; [Hafner, Christian M.] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, Louvain, Belgium; [McAleer, Michael] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Quantitat Finance, Hsinchu, Taiwan; [McAleer, Michael] Dhurakij Pundit Univ, Inst Social & Econ Sci, Bangkok, Thailand",Universite Catholique Louvain; Universite Catholique Louvain; National Tsing Hua University,"McAleer, M (通讯作者)，Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Quantitat Finance, Hsinchu, Taiwan.;McAleer, M (通讯作者)，Dhurakij Pundit Univ, Inst Social & Econ Sci, Bangkok, Thailand.",michael.mcaleer@gmail.com,"McAleer, Michael/K-8780-2019; McAleer, Michael/A-2407-2008",,"Australian Research Council; National Science Council, Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan","Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); National Science Council, Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan","The authors are most grateful to Massimiliano Caporin, Guillaume Gaetan Martinet and Yuk Tse for helpful comments and suggestions.

The main task of the researchis to analyse the business activity of the joint stock company Latvia's State Forests and the influence of a quality management system on the entity's external relations. Research methodology: analysis of documents, semi-structured interview, SWOT analysis. The results of the researchreveal that the quality management system is linked with the external relations, as by establishing the quality management system, external relations are being influenced.","[Kaufmane, Dace] Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,"Kaufmane, D (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia.",dace.kaufmane@llu.lv,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,1,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-260-6,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2017,,44,,,,,90,98,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BI1NX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406529200011,0

However, the United States President, Donald Trump, radically changed this prospect by withdrawing the United States from TPP, shortly after taking office in January 2017. This is an ironic turn of history, because prior Obama administration had considered TPP to be its new trade platform in the Asian-Pacific region and pushed for its conclusion. This article discusses the possible future scenarios of TPP post the exit of the United States. TPP is also unique in its membership comprised of both developed-and developing-country members in nearly equal numbers. This article also examines whether TPP, regardless of its future life, presents a meaningful model for the North-South economic and trade integration.","[Lee, Yong-Shik] Law & Dev Inst, Decatur, GA 30033 USA",,"Lee, YS (通讯作者)，Law & Dev Inst, Decatur, GA 30033 USA.",yslee@lawanddevelopment.net,"Lee, Yong-Shik/AAK-5926-2020",,,,,,33,2,2,0,3,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

J,"Peng, SY; Liu, HW",,,,"Peng, Shin-yi; Liu, Han-wei",,,The Legality of Data Residency Requirements: How Can the Trans-Pacific Partnership Help?,JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,DATA LOCALIZATION; SERVICES; PRIVACY,"Article 14.13 of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Agreement -the data localization (DL) clause - represents the first time that a far-reaching preferential trade agreement (PTA) seeks to reduce protectionism arising from data residency (DR) requirements. The DL clause, however, is linked to a loose GATT Article XX-like exception: Article 14.13(3)(b), which allows the parties to maintain DR measures to achieve a legitimate public policy objective as long as the measure in question can satisfy the 'necessity test'. The ambiguity of the DL exception will be clarified by TPP tribunals when a real dispute occurs. After examining the rationales of the DR measures in the context of the necessity test, we find that the responding party invoking a DL exception will have strong arguments, especially when defending Types II and III of the DR measures. Arguments could be made that there is a genuine relationship between the ends, i.e. privacy protection, and the means, i.e. the DR measures. In addition, the responding party invoking a DL exception in a potential dispute would undoubtedly argue that the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) cannot qualify as a 'genuine alternative', because the proposed measure must not only be 'less trade restrictive' than the DR measures, but should also 'preserve for (the responding party's) right to achieve its desired level of protection' with respect to law enforcement or a criminal investigation. Based upon our findings, we argue that with regard to Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) and Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) negotiations on e-commerce, the major challenge of trade negotiators is the disciplinary fragmentation of global economic regulation. The DR issues in question confirm that international economic law (IEL) correlates to other areas of law. Future negotiations require more collaborative and interdisciplinary solutions through productive dialogue with experts in private international law and criminal procedure law. True and substantial changes in the theories and practices of Internet jurisdiction would allow us to argue for a more narrow interpretation of the DL exception - rendering it more difficult to satisfy the necessity test.","[Peng, Shin-yi; Liu, Han-wei] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Law, Hsinchu, Taiwan",National Tsing Hua University,"Peng, SY (通讯作者)，Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Law, Hsinchu, Taiwan.",sypeng@mx.nthu.edu.tw; han-wei.liu@graduateinstitute.ch,"Liu, Han-Wei/V-9408-2019","Liu, Han-Wei/0000-0001-9135-4258",,,,,86,14,14,0,2,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Strategic management of the policy of clustering is pre-determined mainly by quick changes of external environment and emergence of hardly predictable economic and financial situations.

Enterprises and organizations of small business should become their bearers. The Concept of long-term socio-economic development of the Russian Federation until 2020 sets one of the most important conditions for transition to innovational development as creation of a network of territorial and production clusters which realize competitive potential of territories. Besides, the Strategy of innovational development of the Russian Federation until 2020 includes into the main goals of innovational policy of regions the transition to principles of innovational cluster policy.

Based on an international survey of around 2000 consumers in four countries, the analysis finds that consumers with high food involvement scores rate fish higher than low involvement score consumers, often favorably to terrestrial meats. Low involved consumers perceive terrestrial meats more favorably than seafood. Seafood struggles with perceived value for money and availability compared to terrestrial meats, particularly among the low and middle involvement groups. The results indicate that low involvement consumers might not consider seafood a substitute for terrestrial meats, in contrast to higher food involvement groups.","[Torrissen, Jonas K.; Onozaka, Yuko] Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ Risk Management & Planning, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway",Universitetet i Stavanger,"Torrissen, JK (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ Risk Management & Planning, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway.",jonas.torrissen@uis.no,"Onozaka, Yuko/AAU-9770-2020",,Research Council of Norway [233709]; Norwegian Seafood Council,Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); Norwegian Seafood Council,"Acknowledgments are given to the Qualifish project (Research Council of Norway, Project No: 233709) and the Norwegian Seafood Council for providing the funding for this study.",,61,23,23,5,24,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

The paper argues that for development to be made meaningful, it needs to legitimate itself through the production of healthy bodies, which can be realized through food security, immunization drives, and housing schemes among others. A postcolonial democratic state like India makes an effort to protect its people from hunger and draws its legitimacy from the same. Yet at the same time, the supposed development of the nation implies a concurrent elision of the weak and the vulnerable. Drawing upon India's experiment with food security, public distribution systems, and other similar schemes, the paper advances an idea of development that is not only inherently biopolitical, but also a compromise between the commitment to protect people from hunger and the need for working around international agencies. While doing so, the paper borrows from the theoretical vocabulary of Foucault, Agamben, and others to historicize the modernist idea of protecting citizens as well as the reality of deaths from hunger and development-induced displacement.","[Tripathy, Jyotirmaya] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Madras,"Tripathy, J (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India.",jyotirmaya@iitm.ac.in,,,,,,,32,4,4,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

Data were obtained from the police files of twelve criminal investigations into human trafficking in Amsterdam between 2006 and 2010. The empirical data show that sex workers are intermeshed in a network of people who intercede with them and their work: pimps, bodyguards, errand boys, drivers, brothel owners, and accountants. While these informal players offer services to facilitate sex work, they simultaneously create a network of control around the sex workers and profit from the latters' earnings. The existence of this informal network and its activities both supports sex workers, but also undermines the autonomy of self-employed sex workers in the studied cases.","[Verhoeven, Maite; van Gestel, Barbra] WODC CRS, POB 20301, NL-2500 EH The Hague, Netherlands",,"Verhoeven, M (通讯作者)，WODC CRS, POB 20301, NL-2500 EH The Hague, Netherlands.",m.a.verhoeven@minvenj.nl; b.van.gestel@minvenj.nl,,,,,,,43,2,4,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Focusing on cross-border bank lending, we employed firm-level loan data with regard to the syndicated loan market and measured the international bank lending channel through changes in the United States dollar-denominated loans extended to Asian borrowers. We found that the growth of dollar credit in Asia increased substantially in response to the quantitative easing in the US financial market.

The article also provides new evidence of cross-border liquidity spillover in the syndicated loan market.

Next, we propose a cost-benefit analysis to discuss the cost-effectiveness of this measure. We find that over three-quarters of respondents report complying with home confinement. Their choice depends on their individual characteristics, the interaction they may have with an infected person and home confinement conditions, but not their experience with preventive measures. We find that behaviors such as sensitivity to certainty, selfishness and altruism emerge.

Expenditure responsibilities, especially social welfare, have been devolved to the subnational level, while local revenue tools and policy authority are preempted. This decoupling of responsibility and power is cracking the foundations of fiscal federalism. At the behest of corporate-legislative coalitions, subnational state governments are shrinking local capacity and authority to govern.

A particular emphasis is the timing of remediation. We show that traditional standards-based regulation incentivizes operators to delay remediation. A policy that instead requires the operator to pay ongoing damages from the pollution stock via a Pigouvian stock tax is socially optimal and provides the operator with the correct incentives to remediate the pollution stock. A Pigouvian pollution flow tax, which has been a popular recommendation in the stock pollution literature, does not generate these remediation incentives. Nor do financial assurances, also known as reclamation bonds. The financial incentives embodied in mine regulatory reform in the United States, China and Western Australia have no explicit intention of implementing a Pigouvian stock tax. They are therefore unlikely to incentivize optimally timed remediation by the firm, even though the policy reforms have been driven by a recognition that past standards-based policies were ineffective at incentivizing timely remediation.

Pharmaceutical companies may withdraw their medications from the market at any time during the process. This analysis aims to compare recommendations in clinical guidelines and HTA appraisals of medicines that were withdrawn from the German market since the introduction of AMNOG in 2011. Methods: Medications withdrawn from the German market between January 2011 and June 2016 following benefit assessment were categorized as opt-outs (max. 2 weeks after start of price negotiations) or supply terminations (during or after further price negotiations). Related guidelines were systematically analyzed. For all withdrawals, therapeutic area, additional benefit rating and recommendation status in relevant clinical guidelines were assessed. Results: Among 139 medications, 10 opt-outs and 12 supply terminations were identified. Twenty-one out of 22 withdrawn medicines (95%) received 'no additional benefit' appraisal by the G-BA (average 'no additional benefit' rating for all AMNOG products: 47%). Of the 22 medicines, 15 (68%) were recommended by at least one guideline at the time of benefit assessment and 18 (82%) on 1 June 2016. Heterogeneity among guidelines was high. Acceptance of clinical trial endpoints was different between G-BA appraisals and clinical guidelines. Conclusion: Our analysis revealed considerable differences across clinical guidelines as well as between clinical guidelines and HTA appraisals of the medicines that were withdrawn from the German market. Better alignment of the clinical perspective and close collaboration between all involved parties is required to achieve and maintain optimization of patient care.","[Staab, Thomas R.] Roche Pharma AG, Grenzach Wyhlen, Germany; [Walter, Miriam; Nesurini, Sonja Mariotti] Nspm Ltd, Meggen, Switzerland; [Dintsios, Charalabos-Markos] Heinrich Heine Univ, Hlth Serv Res & Hlth Econ, Dusseldorf, Germany; [von der Schulenburg, J. -Matthias Graf] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Hannover, Germany; [Staab, Thomas R.; Amelung, Volker E.; Ruof, Joerg] Med Sch Hanover, Hannover, NH, Germany; [Ruof, Joerg] R Connect Ltd, Hauensteinstr 132, CH-4059 Basel, Switzerland",Roche Holding; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf; Leibniz University Hannover,"Ruof, J (通讯作者)，Med Sch Hanover, Hannover, NH, Germany.;Ruof, J (通讯作者)，R Connect Ltd, Hauensteinstr 132, CH-4059 Basel, Switzerland.",joerg.ruof@r-connect.org,,"Ruof, Joerg/0000-0001-8706-934X",Roche Pharma AG,Roche Pharma AG(Roche Holding),"Medical writing services were provided by nspm ltd, Meggen, Switzerland, with financial support from Roche Pharma AG.",,43,9,9,1,3,SPRINGEROPEN,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

We generalize the threshold analysis by adding the therapeutic risk, i.e., in accounting for the risk that a treatment might sometimes fail. We derive a priori probability of illness threshold as a function of the probability of successful treatment, as well as the inverted function, where the successful treatment probability threshold is a function of the a priori probability of illness. The thresholds in the general model are higher than those in the special cases where one of the two risks is absent. Applications show that the changes in the thresholds can be substantial. Our general model might explain empirical findings of much higher thresholds than the Pauker-Kassirer model suggests.","[Felder, Stefan] Univ Basel, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Hlth Econ, Peter Merian Weg 6, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland; [Felder, Stefan] Univ Duisburg Essen, Fac Business Adm & Econ, CINCH, Essen, Germany; [Mayrhofer, Thomas] Harvard Med Sch, Stralsund, Germany; [Mayrhofer, Thomas] Stralsund Univ Appl Sci, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Business Studies, Stralsund, Germany",University of Basel; University of Duisburg Essen,"Felder, S (通讯作者)，Univ Basel, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Hlth Econ, Peter Merian Weg 6, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.;Felder, S (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Fac Business Adm & Econ, CINCH, Essen, Germany.",stefan.felder@unibas.ch,,"Mayrhofer, Thomas/0000-0001-6287-5185",,,,,28,4,4,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

We apply the model's predictions to an empirical analysis of the influence of severe wildfires on housing prices and sales rates in the Front Range of Colorado.

In this study we find that less than 15% of a sample of community college students in California rank broad categories of majors accurately in terms of labor market outcomes. Students believe that salaries are 13% higher than they actually are, on average, and students underestimate the probability of being employed by almost 25%. We find that the main determinants of major choice are beliefs about course enjoyment and grades, but expected labor market outcomes also matter. Experimental estimates of the impact of expected labor market outcomes are larger than OLS estimates and show that a 10% increase in salary is associated with a 14 to 18% increase in the probability of choosing a specific category of majors.","[Baker, Rachel] Univ Calif Irvine, 3200 Educ, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Bettinger, Eric] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Bettinger, Eric; Jacob, Brian] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Jacob, Brian] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Marinescu, Ioana] Univ Penn, Sch Social Policy & Practice, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine; Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Pennsylvania,"Baker, R (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, 3200 Educ, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",rachelbb@uci.edu,"Bettinger, Eric/AAL-6962-2020","Bettinger, Eric/0000-0002-0337-8223; Marinescu, Ioana/0000-0001-9131-6390",Stanford Predoctoral Training Program in Quantitative Education Policy Research; Institute of Education Sciences (IES) [R305B090016],Stanford Predoctoral Training Program in Quantitative Education Policy Research; Institute of Education Sciences (IES)(US Department of EducationInstitute of Education Sciences (IES)),"This work would not have been possible without the assistance and collaboration of the institutional researchers at the two community colleges with whom we partnered.

We analyze these data in the southeastern United States to test hypotheses regarding the influence of timber and other land rents, population growth, and various topographic position variables on transitions among rural and developed land uses. This region provides a complete and recent set of land use and forest measurement, is the most important and dynamic timber production region in the world, and increasingly is the focus of international policy debates regarding wood based bioenergy. This analysis is the first to link specific land use changes with forest conditions for modeling rural land use response. While previous studies have relied on aggregate measures of timber values, the detailed forest condition measures allow for site-specific estimates of timber quasi-rents, providing new and unique insights into the influence of timber market conditions on land use changes. Results provide an empirical analysis of the influence of timber rent on transitions to all other uses and specifically show that higher timber rents reduce transitions of forests to all other rural land uses as well as to developed land uses The latter finding is unique and provides support for the claim that stronger timber markets enhance the area of forests and alter patterns of land use change including patterns of development in the southeastern United States.","[Kim, Taek Joo; Li, Ruhong] US Forest Serv, Southern Res Stn, 3041 Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Wear, David N.] US Forest Serv, Southern Res Stn, Ctr Integrated Forest Sci, 3041 Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Coulston, John] US Forest Serv, Southern Res Stn, 1710 Res Ctr Dr, Blacksburg, VA 24060 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service,"Kim, TJ (通讯作者)，US Forest Serv, Southern Res Stn, 3041 Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",tjkim@ncsu.edu; dwear@fs.fed.us; jcoulston@fs.fed.us; rnli@ncsu.edu,,,USDA Forest Service RPA Assessment Program,USDA Forest Service RPA Assessment Program,Funding for this project was provided by the USDA Forest Service RPA Assessment Program.,,25,9,12,0,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,AUG,2018,93.0,,,,,,45,52,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.05.012,0.0,,,8,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GM5LY,,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000438180100006,0

Using a district-level dataset of California teacher CBAs that includes measures of overall and subarea contract strength linked to district-level panel data, we build on prior work by controlling for unobserved fixed and time-varying confounders. This study demonstrates that naive pooled OLS estimates of student achievement on overall CBA strength are larger and more negative than lagged achievement and within-district estimates, signifying a negative bias in the naive levels models. When controlling for time invariant and time-varying unobservables, the relationship between CBA strength and student achievement is persistently negative and small, or null, but never significantly positive. This relationship extends to specific CBA subareas and to subgroups of students. These findings have important implications for new reforms designed to weaken teacher collective bargaining rights.","[Marianno, Bradley D.] Univ Southern Calif, Rossier Sch Educ, 3470 Trousdale Pkwy, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Strunk, Katharine O.] Michigan State Univ, Coll Educ, Educ Policy & Econ, 201 Erickson Hall, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",University of Southern California; Michigan State University,"Marianno, BD (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Rossier Sch Educ, 3470 Trousdale Pkwy, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",marianno@usc.edu; kstrunk@msu.edu,,"Marianno, Bradley/0000-0002-3846-4041",National Academy of Education/Spencer Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship,National Academy of Education/Spencer Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship,"Funding for this study was provided in part by the National Academy of Education/Spencer Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship.

Methods: Patients (n = 287) with KRAS wt mCRC treated with cetuximab or BSC in eight hospitals in the Netherlands between 2009 and 2012 were included in our real-world study. Outcome measures were costs per life-year (LY) and costs per quality-adjusted LY (QALY) gained. A Markov model was developed, and a time horizon of four years was applied. Outcomes were calculated from Kaplan-Meier survival curves from patient-level data and literature. Direct medical costs were estimated in all centers (2013 values), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Results were discounted, and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed. Results: Administration of cetuximab in third-line treatment of mCRC resulted in a gain of 0.29 LYs and 0.25 QALYs compared with BSC. In the four-year study period, average discounted healthcare costs were (sic)36,637 in the cetuximab group vs. (sic)3648 in the BSC group. The discounted ICERs of cetuximab vs. BSC in the real-world setting were (sic)114,907 and (sic)133,527 per LY and QALY gained, respectively. Conclusions: Results of this cost-effectiveness analysis showed that third-line treatment with cetuximab for patients with KRAS (exon 2) wt mCRC offered clinical benefits at additional cost. The real-world ICERs were in line with those of previously published cetuximab and panitumumab cost-utility models.","[Groot, Carin A.

Policy attempts have been made to improve women's participation in forest governance at the local level. However, this has had insignificant effect on women's inclusion in forestry as it neglected the structural problems of power and inequity. This paper examines how forest policy has attended to gender concerns in India. It maps the gender trajectory within policy positions and identifies the gap in policy and research. It provides an analytical framework to analyse the Gender Responsiveness of forest policies. The framework helps classifying post-independence forest policies as Gender Blind, Gender Aware and Gender Responsive, based on the gender specific provisions. Analysis indicates that except for few provisions in the FRA, 2006, none of the forest policies appear to be categorically Gender Responsive. This could possibly be because of the limited engagement with structural issues; and, failure to design enabling institutions. Finally, our findings suggest that forest policies need to be grounded in a more nuanced understanding of gender relations and gender roles for sustainable socio-ecological outcomes.","[Tyagi, Niharika; Das, Smriti] TERI Sch Adv Studies, Dept Policy Studies, 10 Inst Area, Delhi 110070, India",TERI University,"Tyagi, N (通讯作者)，TERI Sch Adv Studies, Dept Policy Studies, 10 Inst Area, Delhi 110070, India.",niharikatyagi90@gmail.com,"tyagi, Niharika/AAE-6575-2022","tyagi, Niharika/0009-0002-3493-5851; Das, Smriti/0000-0003-0723-3950",,,,,53,10,10,1,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,JUL,2018,92.0,,,,,,160,168,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.05.004,0.0,,,9,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GJ9UI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000435750000016,0

It overruled a Panel finding that measures to increase taxes on financial transactions with non-cooperative jurisdictions were discriminatory. We argue that the AB reached the right conclusion on the basis of the wrong arguments; that it missed an important opportunity to clarify what WTO Members are permitted to do to enforce their domestic regulatory regimes; and increased the scope for confusion and future litigation by considering that the likeness of services and service suppliers may be a function of prevailing domestic regulatory regimes.","[Delimatsis, Panagiotis] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Law & Econ Ctr, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Hoekman, Bernard] European Univ Inst, Robert Schuman Ctr Adv Studies, Fiesole, FI, Italy; [Hoekman, Bernard] CEPR, London, England",Tilburg University; European University Institute; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Delimatsis, P (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Law & Econ Ctr, Tilburg, Netherlands.",p.delimatsis@uvt.nl; bernard.hoekman@eui.eu,"Delimatsis, Panagiotis/JNS-9156-2023","Delimatsis, Panagiotis/0000-0002-4121-1555; Hoekman, Bernard/0000-0002-6839-7142",,,,,30,6,6,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,APR,2018,17.0,2,,,,,265,290,,10.1017/S1474745617000635,0.0,,,26,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,GD7PN,,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430704500005,0

Our results point to a very peculiar structuration of the economic field; we find that credentialism has a very weak influence, there is a clear and massive cleavage between owners and managers of capital, social capital carries decisive weight and the actors closest to the state apparatus occupy a marginal role.

The paper proposes retroduction as a transition research methodology that is used to identify and test social mechanisms for their explanatory power. The methodology consists in the joint use of case study and system dynamics as modeling and simulation method. The paper discusses how the two methods are used iteratively, and each one complements the strengths and counters the weaknesses of the other.

The question of the approach to its management has always been controversial because forest ecosystems were essentially modified due to intensive forest management and in particular, the indigenous vegetation with native species composition has been preserved in insignificant residues only. The discussion between supporters of the non-intervention regime and supporters of forestry approaches is also reflected in reporting of the media, which addresses the public. The authors use media content analysis and framework based on a CIMO logic to find out whether the media and way of reporting can reflect the dynamism of the acting factors, provide feedback to the policy and decision makers and interests groups, and how the media influence the perception of the forestry sector by the public and, in this connection, the communication of foresters with the public and forest policy enforcement.

The identification of peer effects relies on idiosyncratic variation in the proportion of migrant students across classes within schools. We find that the proportion of migrant students in each class has a small, and positive, effect on local students' test scores in Chinese, but has no significant effect on math and English test scores. We also find considerable evidence of heterogeneity in the effects of the proportion of students in the class on local students' test scores across subsamples. Local students toward the bottom of the achievement distribution, local students enrolled in small classes and local students enrolled in lower-ranked schools benefit most in terms of test scores from having a higher proportion of migrant students in their class.

First, using detailed firm-product emission intensity data from India, we find that more efficient firms are less emission intensive, and that products with the largest sales tend to be cleaner than other products within the firm. We also find that emission intensity in India dropped significantly between 1990-2010 through reallocations across firms, while product mix played a counteracting role in increasing firm emission intensity. Next, we develop a multi-product multi-factor model with heterogeneous firms, variable markups, and monopolistic competition in which each product has a specific emission intensity. We find that pro-competitive market developments lead to an improvement in the aggregate emission intensity - through reallocations across firms - even though firms can become dirtier or cleaner through product mix. This theoretical result fits particularly well the empirical facts. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Though immensely popular and highly selective, their policy of admitting students using a single entrance exam has raised questions about diversity and equity in access. In this paper, we provide a descriptive analysis of the pipeline from middle school to matriculation at a specialized high school, identifying group-level differences in application, admission, and enrollment. In doing so, we highlight potential points of intervention to improve access for underrepresented groups. Controlling for other measures of prior achievement, we find black, Hispanic, low-income, and female students are significantly less likely to qualify for admission to a specialized high school. Differences in application and matriculation rates also affect the diversity in these schools, and we find evidence of middle school effects on both application and admission. Simulated policies that offer admissions using alternative measures, such as state test scores and grades, suggest many more girls, Hispanics, and white students would be admitted under these alternatives. They would not, however, appreciably increase the share of offers given to black or low-income students.","[Corcoran, Sean Patrick; Baker-Smith, E.

Tax credits benefit taxpayers at all income levels by reducing their net tax liability and modify the price of out-of-pocket expenditure. To the extent that consumer demand is price elastic, they may influence the amount of eligible healthcare expenditure for which taxpayers may claim a credit. These effects influence, in turn, income distributions and taxpayers' health status and therefore income-related inequality in health. Redistributive consequences of tax credits have been widely investigated. However, little is known about the ability of tax credits to alleviate health inequality. In this paper, we study the potential effects that tax credits for health expenses may have on income-related inequality in health status with reference to the Italian institutional setting. The analysis is performed using a tax-benefit microsimulation model that reproduces the personal income tax and incorporates taxpayers' behavioral responses to changes in tax credit rate. Our results suggest that the current healthcare tax credit design tends to favor the richest part of the population.","[Di Novi, Cinzia] Univ Pavia, Dept Econ & Management, Via San Felice 5-7, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Marenzi, Anna; Rizzi, Dino] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Econ, Venice, Italy; [Di Novi, Cinzia] Univ York, Hlth Econometr & Data Grp, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Di Novi, Cinzia] Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, LCSR, Moscow, Russia",University of Pavia; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; University of York - UK; HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Di Novi, C (通讯作者)，Univ Pavia, Dept Econ & Management, Via San Felice 5-7, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.;Di Novi, C (通讯作者)，Univ York, Hlth Econometr & Data Grp, York, N Yorkshire, England.;Di Novi, C (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, LCSR, Moscow, Russia.",cinzia.dinovi@unipv.it,"Di Novi, Cinzia/AAK-3184-2021; Rizzi, Dino/M-9698-2015","Di Novi, Cinzia/0000-0002-3536-5507",,,,,53,5,5,3,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Poor development prospects and an increasing belief that these places have no future-as economic dynamism has been posited to be increasingly dependent on agglomeration economies-have led many of these so-called places that don't matter to revolt against the status quo. The revolt has come via an unexpected source: the ballot-box, in a wave of political populism with strong territorial, rather than social foundations. I will argue that the populist wave is challenging the sources of existing well-being in both the less-dynamic and the more prosperous areas and that better, rather than more, place-sensitive territorial development policies are needed in order to find a solution to the problem. Place-sensitive development policies need, however, to stay clear of the welfare, income support and big investment projects of past development strategies if they are to be successful and focus on tapping into untapped potential and on providing opportunities to those people living in the places that don't matter.","[Rodriguez-Pose, Andres] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Rodríguez-Pose, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",a.rodriguez-pose@lse.ac.uk,"Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/B-8746-2008","Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/0000-0002-8041-0856",,,,,66,784,808,14,167,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-1378,1752-1386,,CAMB J REG ECON SOC,Camb.

I estimate the effect of an appliance conveying using a difference-in-differences across states and appliance types, allowing me to fully control for state-level trends with fixed effects. I find that consumers purchase less expensive refrigerators and clothes washers when those appliances convey.

We bring empirical evidence to bear on this issue. Specifically, we examine how estimates of teacher value-added are influenced by assessment changes across 12 test transitions in two subjects and five states. In all of the math transitions we study, value-added measures from test change years and stable regime years are broadly similar in terms of their statistical properties and informational content. This is also true for some of the reading transitions; we do find, however, some cases in which an assessment change in reading meaningfully alters value-added measures. Our study directly informs contemporary policy debates about how to evaluate teachers when new assessments are introduced and provides a general analytic framework for examining employee evaluation policies in the face of changing evaluation metrics.","[Backes, Ben; Cowan, James; Goldhaber, Dan; Xu, Zeyu] Amer Inst Res, Washington, DC 20007 USA; [Koedel, Cory] Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Miller, Luke C.] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",American Institutes for Research; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of Virginia,"Backes, B (通讯作者)，Amer Inst Res, Washington, DC 20007 USA.",bbackes@air.org; jcowan@air.org; dgoldhaber@sir.org; koedelc@missouri.edu; lcm7t@virginia.edu; zxu@air.org,"Xu, Zeyu/ABE-1371-2021","Xu, Zeyu/0000-0003-4894-0141",Institute of Educational Sciences [R305C120008],Institute of Educational Sciences,"This work was supported in part by grant R305C120008 from the Institute of Educational Sciences to CALDER.

We focus on a subset of schools involved in LAUSD's Public School Choice Initiative (PSCI), which aimed to increase high quality school options by awarding management of newly-constructed relief schools to diverse operators based on innovative and evidence-based school plans and autonomies from district policies. We employ a Comparative Interrupted Time Series approach using administrative student-level data that tracks students for 10 years, following students in the first (1.0) and second (2.0) cohorts of PSCI schools for three and two years of implementation, respectively. We find that relief school openings had negative start-up effects on student achievement, but led to improved achievement in subsequent years of PSCI. We find suggestive evidence that improvements made to the reform after the first round of relief school openings helped Cohort 2.0 schools perform significantly better than Cohort 1.0 schools.","[Hashim, Ayesha K.; Marsh, Julie A.] Univ Southern Calif, Rossier Sch Educ, Waite Phillips Hall 901c,3470 Trousdale Pkwy, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Strunk, Katharine O.] Michigan State Univ, Coll Educ, 620 Farm Lane, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",University of Southern California; Michigan State University,"Hashim, AK (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Rossier Sch Educ, Waite Phillips Hall 901c,3470 Trousdale Pkwy, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",ahashim@usc.edu,,,United States Department of Education's Investing in Innovation Grant,United States Department of Education's Investing in Innovation Grant,"This work was financially supported from the United States Department of Education's Investing in Innovation Grant.

However, the main international testing regimes, such as PISA, TIMSS, or PIRLS, include almost no low-income countries. Instead, many developing countries opt for regional assessments sponsored by the United Nations. This paper exploits an overlap between the regional test for Southern and Eastern Africa, SACMEQ, and the TIMSS test - in both country coverage, and questions asked to assesses the feasibility of constructing global learning metrics by equating regional and international scales. I find considerable variance when comparing three commonly-used equating methods, suggesting precise country rankings are unreliable. Across all methodologies, however, learning levels in this sample of African countries are consistently (a) low in absolute terms, by roughly one-and-a-half standard deviations or more compared to OECD pupils of a similar age; (b) significantly lower than predicted by African per capita GDP levels; and (c) converging slowly, if at all, to the rest of the world during the 2000s. The robustness of these simple facts suggests even crude linking methods may suffice for many international policy questions, such as tracking the UN's development goals.","[Sandefur, Justin] Ctr Global Dev, Washington, DC 20002 USA",,"Sandefur, J (通讯作者)，Ctr Global Dev, Washington, DC 20002 USA.",jsandefur@cgdev.org,,,,,,,28,11,17,0,3,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0272-7757,1873-7382,,ECON EDUC REV,Econ.

There were used quarterly time series data over the period of 2007 (1st quarter) - 2017 (4th quarter) on the case of Romania. In order to explain the impact of fiscal policy and monetary policy on the evolution of inflation rate, the econometric model involved endogenous variables such as the growth rate of the money supply, the rate of change in the inflation rate and the rate of change in the public budgetary balance. Furthermore, the analyzed econometric model was used to forecast over a period of t+4 (4 quarters) the evolution of the variable budgetary balance along with the evolution of money supply using as an exogenous variable the annual target value computed by the central bank for the inflation rate. Thus a positive impulse or a negative impulse in the value of the rate of inflation could explain any influence on the value of money supply or the value of budgetary balance. The Granger causality test applied to the VECM model revealed a unidirectional causality form between the variable budgetary balance to the variable rate of inflation and from the variable inflation to the endogenous variable represented by the value of money supply. This revealed that an increase in the level of budgetary balance would be computed in an increase in the level of the inflation rate. Moreover, an increase in the rate of inflation would lead to an increase in the value of money supply according to the results generated on time series data taken into consideration over the analyzed period. The VECM model revealed under the variance decomposition that the fiscal policy such as the evolution of public revenues and of public spending would have a significant impact on inflation. On the other hand, monetary policy tended not to have a significant impact on the evolution of inflation over the analyzed period of time.","[Bazgan, Ramona-Mihaela] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 6 Piata Romana,1st Dist, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Bâzgan, RM (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 6 Piata Romana,1st Dist, Bucharest, Romania.",bazgan.ramona.mihaela@gmail.com,,,,,,,14,1,1,0,1,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,112,120,,,,,,9,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200010,0

And yet, why today, more than ever, does everything go from interpreting it in a way that becomes almost obsessive? Often invoked risk management motivation leads us into a banking system that fails to credit the economy, companies have increasingly difficult access to finance, whole sectors suffer, large companies collapse. The question that is naturally born is what has changed in the interpretation of risk in recent years? Can we talk about a subjective element that defines the risk? Referring to modern times, we notice that the barrier that delimits this change of paradigm is 2008, a time that has fundamentally transformed the approach of risk, not necessarily its quantification. This is why we need to address the risk through human behavior with its subjective valences and its implications for decision-makers.","[Chisu, Mihai; Paun, Cristian] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 6 Piata Romana,Sect 1, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Chisu, M (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 6 Piata Romana,Sect 1, Bucharest, Romania.",chisu_mihai@yahoo.com; cristian.paun@rei.ase.ro,"Paun, Cristian/I-5609-2016","Paun, Cristian/0000-0002-5057-3750",,,,,16,0,0,0,1,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,225,231,,,,,,7,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200020,0

However, it has not yet been able to solve the following puzzle: the differentiation and specification of multiple markets that exist at the same time in the same place. In this paper, I argue that White's model of 'markets from networks' can contribute to filling this gap, since it is centred on the specification of a market's structural and cultural boundaries. His mod& allows for the analysis of concrete market practices intertwined with more abstract concepts of markets formed in discourses that move firms and markets across different levels - from local markets to market sectors. An indepth analysis of the emergence of the World Music market demonstrates the advantages of employing this model in the analysis of multiple markets.","[da Silva, Glaucia Peres] Univ Duisburg Essen, Inst Sociol, Lotharstr 63-LF 160, D-47057 Duisburg, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen,"da Silva, GP (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Inst Sociol, Lotharstr 63-LF 160, D-47057 Duisburg, Germany.",glaucia.peres@uni-due.de,,"Peres da Silva, Glaucia/0000-0002-6650-8232",German Academic Exchange Service,German Academic Exchange Service(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),"This research was conducted during the author's doctoral studies that were funded by the German Academic Exchange Service.

Their main proponents argued that FDI is a long-term and stable cross-border flow of capital that enhances productive capacity of domestic economies and helps them to meet their balance-of-payments shortfalls. Moreover, FDI supports transfers technology and management skills and links domestic economies with the wider global markets. But, in reality, the effects from FDI for the host countries are very ambiguous. There are number of debates among scholars and policy makers regarding its nature and impact on capital accumulation, technological progress, industrialization, growth and development in the host countries. However, in the last two decades, FDI has increasingly been viewed by policy makers in the Western Balkan countries (WBCs) as one of the most important external sources to finance development, increase productivity and import new technologies. This has been accompanied by an increase in competition among the WBCs to attract FDI, resulting in higher investment incentives offered by the host governments. So, for policy makers one of the most important issues is being able to determine which factors are crucial in driving FDI inflows and what the real effects of these policies are. Thus, the main focus of this paper is to address these questions.","[Daniela, Mamucevska; Natalija, Nikolovska] Univ Ss Cyril & Methodius, Fac Econ Skopje, Skopje, Macedonia",Saints Cyril & Methodius University of Skopje,"Daniela, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ss Cyril & Methodius, Fac Econ Skopje, Skopje, Macedonia.",danielam@eccf.ukim.edu.mk; natalijan@eccf.ukim.edu.mk,,,,,,,28,1,1,2,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-67916-7; 978-3-319-67915-0,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,339,356,,10.1007/978-3-319-67916-7_22,0.0,,,18,Area Studies; Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL4TI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450786500022,0

Although the innovation level of a region overall is difficult to assess, indicators, such as patent applications or enterprises introducing an innovation with environmental benefits offer a measurement tool for this aspect. The present study estimates first a panel regression model with patent applications to the European patent office as dependent variable in connection to other economic and research and development factors between 2010-2014 for the selected European Union member states. The second part of the study focuses on a regression for 2014 having the enterprises that introduced an innovation with environmental benefits obtained within the enterprise as a dependent variable and economic independent variables also in the case of certain selected European Union countries. Therefore, the present paper inquires two types of dependent variables regarding innovation and proposes to offer dependencies models between innovation and economic indicators based on regression models. The results indicate a relationship with expenditures on research and development on regional level, as well as enterprises development for the selected countries of the European Union. While innovation is mostly treated as a separate independent factor in the economic system, a systematic approach of innovation is significant for it to be designed and created, in order to ensure the basis for further innovation stimulating policies. From a statistical point of view, a main current issue is represented by the selection of relevant indicators measuring innovation levels on a regional level, most indicators being more qualitative and subjective than quantitative. The relevance of the study lies in the fact that the subject is a novelty in terms of scientific literature, as these indicators have not been tested throughout other regression models before.","[Dima, Alina Mihaela; Maassen, Maria Alexandra; Petrariu, Radu] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 2-2A Calea Grivitei, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Dima, AM (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 2-2A Calea Grivitei, Bucharest, Romania.",alinamihaeladima@yahoo.com; maria_nichifor@hotmail.com,"Dima, Alina Mihaela/AAL-2950-2020; PETRARIU, Ioan-Radu/AAQ-4223-2021; Maassen, Maria Alexandra/M-6277-2018; Dima, Alina/AAQ-6730-2021; PETRARIU, Ioan-Radu/AAQ-1606-2021; Maassen, Maria Alexandra/ABF-9709-2020; Vasilache, Simona N/B-2909-2010","PETRARIU, Ioan-Radu/0000-0002-9133-0181; PETRARIU, Ioan-Radu/0000-0002-9133-0181;",,,,,24,1,1,1,4,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,1426,1440,,,,,,15,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200120,0

In this article, an attempt of statistical assessment of trends and the scale of effects of VAT taxation on individual consumption as well as to determine the nature of the Polish VAT (its regressiveness, progressiveness, or linearity) has been taken. The study of Polish households' burden with VAT has been divided into two major stages. The first one focused on determining, based on a detailed list of household expenses, the amount of VAT paid in the expenses of particular types of households. In the second stage, VAT burden was estimated by referring the amount of VAT paid to the net income of a given type of household. Net incomes are all values that enter the household, without advances on income tax from natural persons paid by the payer on behalf of the taxpayer, and without social security contributions. The research was based on unpublished GUS data from the Household Budgets Surveys (1995-2016) according to decile income groups. In the methodological layer, emphasis was put on the issue of differentiating rates of consumption taxes.","[Dobrowolska, Boguslawa; Kruszynski, Kamil] Univ Lodz, Fac Econ & Sociol, Inst Stat & Demog, 3-5 POW St, PL-90255 Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Dobrowolska, B (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Fac Econ & Sociol, Inst Stat & Demog, 3-5 POW St, PL-90255 Lodz, Poland.",boguslawa.dobrowolska@uni.lodz.pl; kamil.kruszynski@uni.lodz.pl,,"Dobrowolska, Boguslawa/0000-0003-3497-6223",,,,,10,0,0,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,344,354,,,,,,11,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400034,0

Also, we found that not all the components of the Romanian territorial capital positively influenced economic growth.

Increasing level of corruption may discourage some people to start a business. Therefore it is important to control the level of corruption continuously. In this study, we utilise data from Transparency International together with other data sources, and we quantify the relationship between the corruption perceptions and the regional entrepreneurial activity in the Czech Republic. We analyse years 2000-2015, and we operationalise regional entrepreneurship by the two rates: the rate of business companies per capita and rate of self-employed persons per capita. The estimated panel regressions empirically support a hypothesis about the negative impact of corruption on both types of regional business activity. Based on these findings, we recommend policymakers to put more efforts into controlling and decreasing the level of corruption.","[Dvoulety, Ondrej] Univ Econ Prague, Dept Entrepreneurship, Fac Business Adm, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic; [Blazkova, Ivana] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Reg & Business Econ, Fac Reg Dev & Int Studies, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Mendel University in Brno,"Dvoulety, O (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Dept Entrepreneurship, Fac Business Adm, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",ondrej.dvoulety@vse.cz; blazkova@mendelu.cz,"Blažková, Ivana/D-8710-2018; Dvouletý, Ondřej/F-5845-2018","Blažková, Ivana/0000-0001-6923-5201; Dvouletý, Ondřej/0000-0001-9151-2033","Internal Grant Agency of Faculty of Business Administration, University of Economics in Prague [IP300040]; Internal Grant Agency of Faculty of Regional Development and International Studies, Mendel University in Brno [2018/004]","Internal Grant Agency of Faculty of Business Administration, University of Economics in Prague; Internal Grant Agency of Faculty of Regional Development and International Studies, Mendel University in Brno","This work was supported by Internal Grant Agency of Faculty of Business Administration, University of Economics in Prague, under no.: IP300040 and by Internal Grant Agency of Faculty of Regional Development and International Studies, Mendel University in Brno, under no.: 2018/004.",,18,4,4,0,4,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,433,440,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400043,0

This argument is made by revisiting the strawberry market in Sologne, France as analyzed by M. Callon and M.-F. Garcia-Parpet, respectively. Two decades have passed since the publishing of The Laws of the Market, and considering its great impact, this anniversary gives occasion for revisiting the central place the particular market for strawberries is given in the argument and discussing the concepts developed by Callon with a view to how Garcia-Parpet comes to identify a particular market. This revisit shows that although Callon in part distracts from a systematic attention to concepts of market as an empirical object of inquiry, he also offers distinctions valuable for better understanding concepts of markets. It also shows that, following one part of Callon's argument, we should not expect to find concrete markets and that attention to market concepts thus becomes even more important.","[Frankel, Christian] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Org, Copenhagen, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Frankel, C (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Org, Copenhagen, Denmark.",frankel@cbs.dk,,"Frankel, Christian/0000-0002-5094-3686",Dansk Standard,Dansk Standard,This essay has benefitted from the financial support of Dansk Standard.

To develop loyalty programmes, it is necessary not only to investigate the style of consumer preferences, but also to reveal the power of influence of the factors shaping it. The style of consumer preferences can be described with the help of a two-component model which includes basic motives of human behaviour and strategies for their implementation. With the help of this model, two key consumer styles - constructive and adaptive (protective) - were defined as well as their varieties. The next step of the research involved identifying factors which influence consumer choice, selecting a range of methods and techniques, creating a sample. Materials of the empirical study made it possible to assess the effect of these factors on consumer behaviour of the residents of the Volgograd and Astrakhan regions. The obtained results imply the fact that most consumers in the region are oriented towards keeping to constructive styles. It means that developing loyalty programmes should be performed with due regard for both rational (those concerning functional attributes of goods) and emotional arguments (prospects of self-development by means of using goods, adhering to consumer values, communicating within a certain group of consumers).","[Golub, Oksana V.; Timofeeva, Tatiana S.] Volgograd State Univ, Inst Hist Int Affairs & Social Technol, Volgograd, Russia; [Serova, Olga F.] Volgograd State Univ, Inst Management & Reg Econ, Volgograd, Russia",Volgograd State University (VOLSU); Volgograd State University (VOLSU),"Golub, OV (通讯作者)，Volgograd State Univ, Inst Hist Int Affairs & Social Technol, Volgograd, Russia.",golub@volsu.ru; timofeeva@volsu.ru; serova.o@volsu.ru,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,3,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-514-6,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,39.0,,,,,,461,465,,,,,,5,Business; Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BO4YG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000515721900095,0

The book market in Romania has always been at the edge of the interest of state people, either by disinterest or through regulations that hinder the development of the domain. Do you need Romanian authors alive? Or only translations? Bestseller - a noun that came worldwide directly from English, is the magic word of the book industry. For some Romanian publishers, of course, the bestseller means the first print run of 100 copies, for others, large numbers mean four or five zero at the end. The development of digital printing has allowed books to be printed in small prints at reasonable prices for any customer, whether publishing house or individual (independent author). The main question both authors and readers ask is whether we still need publishers. There are already commercial companies in Romania that provide editorial services on demand. On the Romanian market, some important actors in online book distribution are struggling, with three of them having a top position, detached from the rest of the platoon, made up of smaller companies, the sites of important bookstore networks, or even the publisher's personal websites. By comparing the statistics provided by the Cultural Consumption Barometer and those of the main market actors (publishers and book fairs) for the Romanian side to those of other European and international markets (from the specialized publications) we will find the situation of the market of the book in Romania. I will try to identify the potential problems and potential solutions for stabilizing and eventually developing the book industry. Between the lack of interest in reading and the development of functional illiteracy at an extreme and the rapid technological development at the other extreme, the Romanian book market is still in the search for a faithful public and methods to approach the written text no matter how it is presented - printed book or e-book and regardless of how it is published or distributed.","[Hrib, Bogdan] Triton Publishing Grp, 5 Coacazelor St,Sect 2, Bucharest 022651, Romania",,"Hrib, B (通讯作者)，Triton Publishing Grp, 5 Coacazelor St,Sect 2, Bucharest 022651, Romania.",bohrib@gmail.com,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,1,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,1405,1413,,,,,,9,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200118,0

In order to identify the factors influencing the amount of government expenditure on R&D in the European Union states, an econometric model for panel data has been created. The data come from the Eurostat database. The dependent variable is the amount of public sector expenditure on R&D in particular EU countries in years 2007-2016. The set of independent variables, on the other hand, contains variables referring to the condition of public finances, such as the public sector deficit and public debt. Other factors taken into consideration are a country's GDP, its level of development expressed with GDP per capita, and a variable describing the share of export in GDP. An important factor, whose influence is negative, is general government gross debt. A positive impact on the amount of public spending on R&D in the EU was discovered in the case of variables referring to the countries' economic growth, i.e. nominal gross domestic product and GDP per capita.","[Ignasiak-Szulc, Aranka; Lapinska, Justyna; Huterski, Robert] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Fac Econ Sci & Management, Ul Gagarina 13a, PL-87100 Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Ignasiak-Szulc, A (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Fac Econ Sci & Management, Ul Gagarina 13a, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.",aranka@umk.pl; justlap@umk.pl; robhuski@umk.pl,"Huterski, Robert/G-3837-2014; Łapińska, Justyna/HMD-4197-2023","Łapińska, Justyna/0000-0003-4134-4750","National Science Centre, Poland [DEC-2017/25/B/HS4/01113]","National Science Centre, Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)","The paper was developed as part of the project Positive social change in an organization as a factor of a company engagement in sustainable development.

The work wants to respond to the issue of using subsidies in the field of further training. The research plan focuses on the question of whether granted programmes (funded from EU funds) are used efficiently, and whether Czech companies behave equally responsibly to further training, depending on funding from their own or other sources (EU funds). The work evaluates the hypothesis of a link between sources of financial founding for further training in small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) and the quality of the training process. The presented results are part of a comprehensive study involving SMEs. This paper focuses on mapping the behaviour of Czech companies and their management in the context of the attitude of employees towards training. It has used quantitative research on data collection through a questionnaire survey to address management of SMEs responsible for human resource management and training. The paper has presented data and an elementary analysis, which will continue in the next step by deeply analysing the efficiency of financial resources used for further training, and company behaviour in the context of money sources in efficiency of training programmes. At the same time, the management approach is assessed to evaluate employee training and also to understand whether there are written standards in the SMEs concerned to implement the acquired knowledge and skills within the framework of the training: these are described and used in the company's practice. The survey showed that the Czech companies underestimated the expenditure to their training. The results from the research showed that there is not a link between sources of financial funding for further training in SMEs and the emphasis on the implementation of the knowledge / skills acquired in the framework of further training into the processes / practice of the company. On the other hand, there is not a link between sources of financial funding and the emphasis on evaluation (measurement) of training in SMEs, because the data did not show the bigger differences despite higher interest from the companies using subventions for their training.

Using the 2011 and 2013 waves of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), the study finds that the New Rural Pension Program (NRPP) reduced the hours of farmwork and increased the hours of grandchild care among elderly rural men; and both elderly women and men reported less expected reliance on adult children for financial support when they become infirm. These differential effects probably occur because the size of the pension benefit is very small and because of previous gender differences in farmwork and grandchild care. Additionally, the study shows that adult children reduced out-migration and increased their hours spent in farming activities, indicating that the effect of the NRPP has spilled over to younger members of the household.","[Li, Qin] South China Agr Univ, Econ & Management Coll, 483 Wushan Rd, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yafeng] Peking Univ, Inst Social Sci Survey, Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yaohui] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",South China Agricultural University; Peking University; Peking University,"Li, Q (通讯作者)，South China Agr Univ, Econ & Management Coll, 483 Wushan Rd, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",liqin@scau.edu.cn; econyfwang@gmail.com; yhzhao@nsd.pku.edu.cn,"sun, jiamin/JPY-2155-2023; 王, 娅冰/JGE-0541-2023; liu, huan/JEO-4705-2023","Zhao, Yaohui/0000-0002-9252-9715","National Social Science Foundation of China [17AJL013, 13CJY055]; International Development Research Center of Canada [107579]",National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); International Development Research Center of Canada,"The work was carried out with the aid of a grant from the International Development Research Center of Canada (Project no. 107579).

Agriculture is a source of food of both animal and plant origin and is a producer of many raw materials for other industries. Agriculture meets basic human needs. A balanced and sustainable development of agriculture is therefore a must. That is why it is necessary to know which items have the greatest impact on the value of the farm. The aim of this paper is to identify generators of the value of businesses in agriculture in the Czech Republic, provided that we measure the value of an enterprise using an EVA equity indicator. The comprehensive data set contains the complete annual accounts of agricultural holdings in the Czech Republic for 2016. For each enterprise, EVA equity is calculated, using Statistica software with the automated artificial neural network tool for analysis. A total of 1,000 artificial neural networks - multi-layer perceptron neural networks (MLP) and radial basic function neural networks (RBF) - have been generated. The five best- performing structures are preserved. Based on the sensitivity analysis, the most important items of financial statements that are most involved in the value of businesses in agriculture are identified.","[Machova, Veronika] Univ Econ, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Zizkov, Czech Republic; [Vrbka, Jaromir] Inst Technol & Business Ceske Budejovice, Okruzni 517-10, Ceske Budejovice 37001, Czech Republic","Prague University of Economics & Business; Institute of Technology & Business, Ceske Budejovice","Machová, V (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Zizkov, Czech Republic.",machova@mail.vstecb.cz; vrbka@mail.vstecb.cz,"Vrbka, Jaromir/AAH-4429-2019; Machová, Veronika/AAF-9612-2021","Machová, Veronika/0000-0001-5479-6655",,,,,12,22,22,0,3,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,1123,1132,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400112,0

The research methods applied allowed to assess the strengths and weaknesses of Member States and the European Union itself in achieving inclusive growth objectives. EU countries face social challenges and European economies are diverging in terms of social dynamics. In 2010, the European Commission placed inclusive growth at the heart of its economic, employment and social agenda - the Europe 2020 strategy and set ambitious targets to obtain it. The analysis show that since 2008, substantial progress has been made in the area of education where the EU is within reaching distance of both headline targets, while meeting the employment and poverty targets will remain challenging. There are also big differences in the progress made by Member States towards their national targets.

Developing customer relationship management based on personalized IT systems developed on business specificity and using socializing and promotion channels to increase visibility and online availability on all the customer's favorite channels is translated in engaging customers. Also, using the consumers' reviews in the process of developing/improving products/services is giving to businesses an advantage over the competition. Business management must constantly pursue the dynamism of the market according to the trends of the industry in which it plays, adapting the vision and the uniqueness of the business to the dynamism of the market. Recent studies about marketing programs in which companies are tending to invest anticipate a further increase in investment in 2018, on customer service management programs, which suggests that the business's intention to increase loyalty to existing customers is a core marketing trend for modern companies. This article will explore the link between e-marketing and the client, in order to identify the connections between them and to provide a theoretical model for improving the marketing process, considering the client's requirements. The aim of the proposed model is to improve the current marketing process implemented by companies through digital solutions to strengthen the relations between e-marketing and the client, after identifying the weaknesses the respective companies are facing.","[Negoita, Olivia Doina; Purcarea, Anca Alexandra; Popescu, Mirona Ana-Maria] Univ Politehn Bucuresti, Splaiul Independencei 313, Bucharest, Romania",National University of Science & Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest,"Negoita, OD (通讯作者)，Univ Politehn Bucuresti, Splaiul Independencei 313, Bucharest, Romania.",negoita.olivia@gmail.com; apurcarea@gmail.com; mirona.popescu15@gmail.com,"olivia, negoita/ABB-7161-2020; Popescu, Mirona Ana-Maria/AAT-5857-2020","olivia, negoita/0000-0002-6977-654X;",,,,,14,0,0,0,2,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,933,942,,,,,,10,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200079,0

The analysis covers ten fastest growing LDCs and ten countries with negative or very low average GDP per capita growth rates during the 15 years. The study is based on the data retrieved from the World Bank Open Data. GDP in the fastest growing LDCs has been primarily generated through services and industry sectors. Services and agriculture sectors have contributed the most to GDP in the slowest growing LDCs. However, in terms of employment, agriculture has been a major sector in most LDCs. On the demand side, domestic private consumption was the main source of growth in the examined LDCs. A few LDCs sustained strong growth mainly because of foreign assistance. In other countries remittances were a significant source of development finance. Resource rich countries recorded high inflows of foreign direct investment. Several LDCs substantially improved their development indicators. To maintain or accelerate economic growth, the analysed LDCs have to improve the business climate, governance, and control of corruption.","[Nowak, Wioletta] Univ Wroclaw, Wroclaw, Poland",University of Wroclaw,"Nowak, W (通讯作者)，Univ Wroclaw, Wroclaw, Poland.",wioletta.nowak@uwr.edu.pl,"Nowak, Wioletta/L-1548-2019","Nowak, Wioletta/0000-0002-9200-2972",,,,,13,0,0,0,1,UNIV WISMAR,WISMAR,"PHILIPP-MULLER-STRASSE 14, WISMAR, 23966, GERMANY",,,978-3-942100-56-4,,,,2018,,,,,,,41,48,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BN0CA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000472641400005,0

This study examines how these tariffs have impacted the price relationship between domestically produced and imported catfish products. Cointegration tests confirm a long-run price relationship between domestic and imported catfish, which has persisted despite the anti-dumping tariffs. However, imports are composed of catfish from Vietnam and other countries, with only the former subjected to tariffs. Results from vector error correction models suggest that Vietnamese catfish prices do not significantly influence domestic prices. Conversely, the price of catfish from countries other than Vietnam continues to impact prices received by domestic catfish farmers and processors. The domestic catfish industry is still affected by lower-priced imports from countries other than Vietnam, although some of these may be transshipments that truly originate in Vietnam. This research methodology could be adapted to investigate trade and price interactions among other aquacultured species, which will become increasingly important as global aquaculture expands.","[Scuderi, S.

The distribution of households to ten deciles is given by their net money income and relevant data are taken from the website of the Czech Statistical Office. In this part of the paper, there are analyzed the changes in total gross money income of each three classes and also fluctuations in four forms of gross money income (i.e. income from employment, income from self-employment, social income, and capital earnings) of these three income groups. Different share in the total income and different developments of four types of gross money income allow explaining the changes of income inequality during recession period 2009 - 2013.","[Soukup, Jindrich] Univ Econ, W Churchilla 4, Prague 3, Czech Republic",,"Soukup, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, W Churchilla 4, Prague 3, Czech Republic.",soukup@vse.cz,"Soukup, Jindrich/H-2214-2014",,research project Competitiveness Faculty of Business Administration [IP 300040],research project Competitiveness Faculty of Business Administration,This article is provided as one of the outputs of the research project IP 300040 Competitiveness of the Faculty of Business Administration.,,13,0,0,1,3,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,1687,1697,,,,,,11,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400167,0

Prior to its implementation in 2002, sustained concerns to improve this social program existed. In recent years, efforts to reduce poverty have been increasing by introducing financial activation elements within the guaranteed minimum income to stimulate employment among its beneficiaries. The current law on guaranteed minimum wage includes such an activation component, but it was found, however, that this is not stimulating, as the beneficiaries are not thus encouraged to find a job and get out of the social care network. As a more pronounced activation of the guaranteed minimum income recipients is desired in the recent years, the present paper proposes two exercises of simulation, namely the introduction of this incentive support within the Guaranteed minimum income (two simulation scenarios, one pessimistic and another optimistic, respectively with two thresholds of 35% and 65%), to analyze the degree to which poverty incidence would be reduced among these recipients. The two impact assessment exercises will be carried out using the classic simulation model, based on HBS/Household Budget Survey data. Considering these financial activation elements, poverty rates will be calculated in each of the two scenarios to analyze to what extent these pro-active components, upon its insertion in the guaranteed minimum income, would contribute to poverty reduction among social aid beneficiaries. These simulations could provide some basic guidelines to be subsequently improved and supplemented, helping to improve this social assistance benefit concerning the Guaranteed minimum income, while promoting and enhancing the employment and social inclusion among the beneficiaries of this important social policy.","[Stroe, Cristina; Dragoiu, Codruta] Natl Sci Res Inst Labour & Social Protect, Bucharest, Romania; [Cambir, Andreea] Natl Inst Stat, Bucharest, Romania",,"Stroe, C (通讯作者)，Natl Sci Res Inst Labour & Social Protect, Bucharest, Romania.",cristinaradu@incsmps.ro; cdragoiu@incsmps.ro; cristinaradu@incsmps.ro,,,Ministry of Labor and Social Justice,Ministry of Labor and Social Justice,"The integrated system for poverty and social exclusion alleviation in rural areas Project was contracted and financed from the state budget, through the Ministry of Labor and Social Justice.

To address the portfolio optimization problem, a hybrid swarm intelligent optimization approach that combines harmony search (HS) and teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO) is presented in this work. We introduce a Cardinality Constrained Mean-Variance (CCMV) model which incorporates the boundary constraints (such as the bound of portfolio selection proportion of each asset and the number of assets) and considers transaction costs. To enhance the global optimization performance, an improved HS and modified TLBO are synergistically performed using a dynamic selection strategy for balancing the global exploration power and the local exploitation power. The experimental results on five data sets (HangSeng, DAX 100, FTSE 100, S&P 100, and Nikkei 225) demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is effective and efficient in solving complex portfolio selection problems.","[Tuo, Shouheng] Xian Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [He, Hong] Xian Univ Posts & Telecommun, Coll Econ & Management, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Xi'an University of Posts & Telecommunications; Xi'an University of Posts & Telecommunications,"Tuo, SH (通讯作者)，Xian Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",tuo_sh@l26.com; hehongtbw@126.com,,,,,,,17,2,3,0,9,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Are ITC tools used in the quality management process? The study consists of two parts. The . first is an analysis of literature and an attempt to present the issue of the quality of hotel services in literature. Issues related to the quality management elements in hotels were raised here. Particular attention has been paid to modern technologies and information and communication systems that have a major impact on the quality of services in the hotel industry. The second part of the article is an analysis of empirical research conducted by means of a diagnostic survey using a questionnaire sent via the Internet to hotel managers in Gdynia. All objects defined in Polish law were examined as hotels located in the city of Gdynia. The study was conducted from July to September 2018. The analysis shows that the vast majority of respondents consider quality to be an important sphere of hotel operation. However, few hotels implement quality systems, in addition to those required by top-down regulations.

To support such theorizing, we analyzed the institutional structures of 61 major economies, accounting for 93.5% of 2013 world GDP at purchasing power parity. We found nine main types of business systems: Highly Coordinated, Coordinated Market, Liberal Market, European Peripheral, Advanced Emerging, Advanced City, Arab Oil-Based, Emerging, and Socialist Economies. Our findings illustrate the need to go beyond the Varieties of Capitalism and Business Systems frameworks; provide empirical support for the CME versus LME dichotomy for part of the OECD; identify some of the business systems proposed recently as sub-types of larger clusters; indicate that institutional diversity may increase with development level; and cast doubt on the notions of state-led and family-led capitalism as types of business systems.

Backcasting -a means to create normative scenarios- seems promising, but sparsely used. Combining backcasting with exploratory scenarios (combined scenario approach) seems appropriate to address these critiques. We performed such an exercise with the participation of Dutch forest sector stakeholders. A one-day workshop was successfully executed, in terms of process, results, and participant satisfaction. A robust strategy was formulated, consisting of cross scenario actions related to marketing, public opinion, and education. Novel methodological elements were included, related to the desired end-point, visually represented by ecosystem services ladders. Although the method requires the capacity to prepare, use and learn from scenarios, which is not easily attained, the main added value lies in the 'soft' results. It fits in with the government's shifted focus towards policy approaches that include social engagement, effectiveness and social support. It provides structured accounts of informed decisions towards ownership, transparency, legitimacy and accountability, and thus aids in grasping increasing complexity and uncertainty. We recommend continued testing the usefulness of the combined scenario approach (and thus tapping in to the diversity of participative methods offered by future studies), carefully choosing the duration of the workshops, applying broad stakeholder involvement, and continuing the use of ecosystem services ladders.","[de Bruin, Jilske Olda; Hoogstra-Klein, Marjanke Alberttine] Wageningen Univ, Forest & Nat Conservat Policy Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Kok, Kasper] Wageningen Univ, Soil Geog & Landscape Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research,"de Bruin, JO (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Forest & Nat Conservat Policy Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.",jilske.debruin@wur.nl; kasper.kok@wur.nl; marjanke.hoogstra@wur.nl,,"Hoogstra-Klein, Marjanke/0000-0001-8405-4345; Kok, Kasper/0000-0002-6319-9227","European Union's Seventh Program for research, technological development and demonstration [282887]","European Union's Seventh Program for research, technological development and demonstration(European Union (EU))","This project has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Program for research, technological development and demonstration under grant agreement No 282887 (INTEGRAL).

In many disciplines concerned with aspects of industrial relations, including political science, law and history, it is the traditional political ideologies of the industrial era which take centre stage: liberalism (classical, social and neoliberalism), socialism (Marxism, social democracy and labourism) and conservatism. By contrast, ideological issues in the discipline of employment relations are chiefly addressed in terms of Fox's three analytical perspectives: unitarism, pluralism and radicalism. The disjunction between these parallel discourses goes largely unnoted in the literature of the relevant disciplines, which all tend to proceed using their own preferred approach without making reference to the other. This article critically explores the relationship between these two discourses and investigates the broader implications that the existence of the two different discursive traditions has for the analysis of industrial relations phenomena in Australia.","[Fry, Simon] RMIT Univ, Employment Relat, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Mees, Bernard] RMIT Univ, Management, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Fry, S (通讯作者)，RMIT Univ, Sch Management, GPO Box 2476, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia.",simon.fry@rmit.edu.au,,,,,,,64,3,3,0,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

In this paper, we use two enterprise-level data sets - China's Environmental Statistics Database and China's Industrial Enterprise Database - to estimate the impact of a more stringent wastewater discharge standard imposed on all the textile printing and dyeing enterprises in the Lake Tai, Jiangsu region, on labor demand. We find that enterprises which face this new more stringent standard decreased labor demand by approximately 7%. Furthermore, we find that the new standard had heterogeneous impacts on different types of enterprises.

The GATT recognizes that governments may choose to participate in international commerce in competition with private firms, but it does not leave them with a free hand when it comes to carrying out trading operations. The core rules regulating a State's trading activities are found in Article XVII and related provisions of the GATT. In the 70 years since their adoption, developments in both the GATT 1947 and the WTO have delineated a set of relatively limited disciplines rooted in the principle of non-discrimination, raising doubts about their effectiveness to address the kinds of problems caused by 'State trading' today. It remains true, however, that while State trading enterprises continue to operate across the world, and fundamental questions about the full reach and scope of the existing disciplines endure, opportunities to clarify their role in the modern trading system may well arise in the future practice of WTO Members.","[Mastromatteo, Andrea] WTO Secretariat, Rules Div, Geneva, Switzerland",,"Mastromatteo, A (通讯作者)，WTO Secretariat, Rules Div, Geneva, Switzerland.",Andrea.mastromatteo@wto.org,,,,,,,16,17,18,2,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,OCT,2017,16.0,4,,,,,601,618,,10.1017/S1474745617000222,0.0,,,18,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,FK0ML,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413173800003,0

Yet their use for policy design is often limited by the difficulty of extrapolating on the basis of reduced-form estimates. In this study, we exploit an age condition in the eligibility for social assistance in France, which lends itself to a regression discontinuity (RD) design. We suggest making the underlying labor supply model explicit-that is, translating the reduced-form discontinuity in terms of discontinuous changes in disposable incomes. This exercise shows the potential of combining natural experiments and behavioral models. In particular, we can test the external validity of the combined approach. We find that it predicts the effect of a subsequent reform, which extends transfers to the working poor, remarkably well. The model is then used to simulate the extension of social assistance to young people and finds that a transfer program with an in-work component would not create further disincentives to work in this population.","[Bargain, Olivier] Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, CNRS, Marseille, France; [Bargain, Olivier] EHESS, Paris, France; [Bargain, Olivier; Doorley, Karina] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Doorley, Karina] LISER, Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Aix-Marseille Universite; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Bargain, O (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, CNRS, Marseille, France.;Bargain, O (通讯作者)，EHESS, Paris, France.;Bargain, O (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.",,"Bargain, Olivier/A-5972-2019","Doorley, Karina/0000-0002-6535-0648",,,,,47,6,6,0,16,UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS,MADISON,"JOURNAL DIVISION, 1930 MONROE ST, 3RD FL, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0022-166X,1548-8004,,J HUM RESOUR,J.

Internalizing the cost of pollution leads firms to reduce output to the efficient quantity. However, firms often make decisions other than quantity, such as a choice of which technology to use in production, and studying these choices is often mathematically challenging for undergraduates. One result from this literature is that markets characterized by imperfect competition may not adopt less-polluting production processes - green technology - even when the green technology confers net benefits on society. I present a simple argument to illustrate how a basic monopoly will continue to use a dirty production technology in the presence of a known superior green technology, even when subject to a perfectly internalizing pollution tax, without appealing to further technological or informational market failures.","[Davis, Andrew] Acadia Univ, Dept Econ, Wolfville, NS, Canada",Acadia University,"Davis, A (通讯作者)，Acadia Univ, Dept Econ, Wolfville, NS, Canada.",andrew.davis@acadiau.ca,,,,,,,12,4,4,1,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1477-3880,2352-4421,,INT REV ECON EDUC,Int.

This study identifies four motives for these practices - statistical, customer taste, employer taste and regulatory. It discusses their distinctive roles in the Chinese labour market and in regard to labour-market regulations. Using a convenience sample of large Chinese employers, the study evaluates the economic and institutional determinants of screening approaches and implications for firms' performance. Statistical screening, based on the assumption that social group membership is an indicator of productivity or loyalty, is found to be related positively to employers' capitalisation, labour-market power and private ownership, and negatively to skill supply in provincial markets. Customer-taste screening is prevalent in the services and sales sectors, and interestingly in wealthy first-tier cities. Employer-taste screening endures in privately owned firms, and in skill-intensive industries and first-tier cities, and appears linked to customer-taste screening. Some forms of screening breach anti-discrimination laws and persist because of lax enforcement of such laws, but requests for personal data on job applications forms may also reflect compliance with equity indicators. Regulatory compliance-based screening is related positively to firms' market power, capitalisation and state ownership. The implications of the different screening practices for public policy and corporate strategy are examined.","[Hlasny, Vladimir] Ewha Womans Univ, Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Ewha Womans University,"Hlásny, V (通讯作者)，Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Econ, 401 Ewha Posco, Seoul 120750, South Korea.",vhlasny@gmail.com,"Hlasny, Vladimir/AAI-9716-2020","Hlasny, Vladimir/0000-0002-6029-1634",,,,,27,1,1,0,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

The expansion of this business model has led some to proclaim that traditional jobs' will come to an end. Some welcome this development, others fear its consequences for the stability and quality of work - but most see it as driven primarily by technology, and therefore largely inevitable'. This article provides historical and theoretical perspective on the expansion of digitally mediated work, to better understand the range of forces (technological, economic and socio-political) at work. It shows that the major features of platform work were all visible in earlier periods of capitalism, but they became less prominent with the rise of the standard employment relationship' in the 20th century. The rise and fall of the standard employment relationship is described with reference to the changing context for the labour extraction effort of private employers. A better understanding of the complete range of forces driving changes in work organisation, and a rejection of the assumption that they are technologically determined and hence inevitable, can inform regulatory and political responses to the rise of platform work.","[Stanford, Jim] Australia Inst, Ctr Future Work, Level 3,4 Goulburn St, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia; [Stanford, Jim] McMaster Univ, Econ, Hamilton, ON, Canada",McMaster University,"Stanford, J (通讯作者)，Australia Inst, Ctr Future Work, Level 3,4 Goulburn St, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia.",jim@tai.org.au,,,,,,,54,136,147,6,80,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

In Ghana, the Social Responsibility Agreement (SRA) is a forest management scheme that entails devolution of decision-making powers on benefit sharing from commercial logging to local authorities to represent local interest. This paper explores how democratic representation is manifested under the choice of local leaders in the context of the SRA by focusing on: choice of local leaders, responsiveness (how represented and desired interests compare), and accountability (feedback and sanction mechanisms). A joint representative body comprised of the chief and the customary structure, and the elected local government leaders represented the communities. The authority of the customary structure is reinforced by cultural and historical settings; enabling chiefs to capture dedsion making powers and dominate activities in the representation processes. Devoid of popular consultation, the leaders largely assume local priorities relying mainly on their nearness to the local population. To some extent, and for multiple reasons, the concluded SRAs under this study succeeded in providing social amenities to the people but due to accountability failures, the scheme was weak in engaging the local population in the negotiation of benefits from commercial forest exploitation. The question remains open as to whether greater accountability - that is, more-democratic representation - would produce greater responsiveness and a more efficient and equitable match between what leaders have to offer and the services people ultimately receive.

We argue that mobilising a sense of community is not only instrumental to promising a more intense consumption experience; it is crucial to eliciting users' active participation in the self-regulation of peer-to-peer exchanges and for dealing with relevant trust issues, especially when sharing implies co-presence and/or non-monetary compensation.

If the cap does not capture all sectors, we demonstrate that variations of a renewable energy subsidy change aggregate carbon emissions through an inter-industry leakage effect. We decompose this effect into intuitively intelligible components that depend in natural ways on measurable elasticity parameters. Raising the subsidy always reduces emissions if funded by a lump-sum tax, reinforcing recent findings that tightening environmental regulation can cause negative leakage. However, if the subsidy is funded by a levy on electricity, it can increase emissions. These results provide a valuable basis for an informed design of renewable energy policies and an accurate assessment of their effectiveness. We highlight how a state-of-the-art statistic used by governments to gauge such effectiveness, virtual emission reductions, is biased, because inter-industrial leakage effects are not captured.

To gauge the chance of success of this reform, a game involving a SHI, a MCO, and a representative insured (RI) is analyzed. In a three-player/three-cake game the coalitions {SHI, MCO}, {MCO, RI}, and {SHI, RI} can form. Players' possibility to switch between coalitions creates new outside options, causing the conventional bilateral Nash bargaining solution to be replaced by the so-called von Neumann-Morgenstern triple.

We examine how the prevalence of thirty diseases and health conditions is distributed across the income spectrum using survey data collected in Iceland in 2007, 2009 and 2012. Thus, we are able to take advantage of the unusually sharp changes in economic conditions in Iceland during the Great Recession initiated in 2008 and the partial recovery that had already taken place by 2012 to analyze how income-related health inequality changed across time periods that can be described as a boom, crisis and recovery. The concentration curve and the concentration index are calculated for each disease, both overall and by gender. In all cases, we find a considerable income-related health inequality favoring higher income individuals, with a slight increase over the study period. Between 2007 and 2009, our results indicate increased inequality for women but decreased inequality for men. Between 2009 and 2012 on the contrary, men's inequality increases but women's decreases. The overarching result is thus that the economic hardship of the crisis temporarily increased female income-related health inequality, but decreased that of men.","[Asgeirsdottir, Tinna Laufey; Johannsdottir, Hildur Margret] Univ Iceland, Dept Econ, Reykjavik, Iceland",University of Iceland,"Asgeirsdóttir, TL (通讯作者)，Univ Iceland, Dept Econ, Reykjavik, Iceland.",ta@hi.is,"Ásgeirsdóttir, Tinna Laufey/ISA-3677-2023",,The Icelandic Student Innovation Fund [1536030091]; The Icelandic Research Fund - Icelandic Center for Research [130611-052],The Icelandic Student Innovation Fund; The Icelandic Research Fund - Icelandic Center for Research,We are grateful for having received funding from The Icelandic Student Innovation Fund (application number 1536030091) and from The Icelandic Research Fund - Icelandic Center for Research (IRF grant number 130611-052) to support assistantship by Hildur Margret Johannsdottir.,,66,4,4,0,16,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

Although they offer the potential of reflecting on issues at stake from different perspectives, dilemmas often lead to paralysis for those encountering them. This study presents a three dimensional collaboration tool specifically developed to surface dilemmas in a multi-actor context. The assumption is that revealing and debating dilemmas encourage finding solutions that bridge the apparently competing demands that resulted in dilemmas in the first place. Our tool, called the 'dilemma cube', is based on cognitive mapping principles and allows a diversity of participants to share their interpreted actions, effects, and connections among different issues at stake. We tested our tool in a collaborative workshop for a multifunctional land use project in the Netherlands. Our results show that the 'dilemma cube' guided participants to share their interpretations about the project, revealing the interdependence of issues at stake. Revealing the socially constructed nature of dilemmas in multi-actor contexts is the stepping stone to explore strategies that stimulate deliberation, and realize the opportunities of exploiting opposites in light of dilemmas.

Through analyzing forest area, biomass dynamics, and factors influencing deforestation and forest restoration, we found that the natural disasters And economic development drove forest dynamics and transition in China. The growth of the economy and population drove up demand for forest products, facilitating deforestation. The booming economy also boosted government's investment in forest restoration and conservation programs. Natural disasters damaged and frequently destroyed forests, but they also served as stimuli for the authorities to adopt remedy forestry policies and programs that ultimately led to forest increase. Nationwide, increasing peaks of annual afforestation were observed in the late 1950s, early 1980s, and early 2000s, and the newly increased area closed for forest restoration reached the peak in 1998. All these peaks were closely associated with peaks of natural disasters (i.e., floods, drought, and dust storm events). Based on the dynamics of forest area, biomass and forest consumption over the past 40 years, forest transition occurred during the late 1980s to the early 1990s, and it also strengthened the carbon (C) sink function of forests in China (with an increasing rate of 0.137 Pg Cyr.(-1) during 1994-2008). Overall, our study highlighted the influences of natural disasters and economic development on the forestry policies and forest C dynamics in the newly industrialized country. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health, this paper shows that taller individuals typically earn higher grades and attain more schooling, but the associations are not uniform across school size. Height is only associated with better outcomes for students attending large schools and these improvements are concentrated among males. Data suggest that height contributes more to sports participation and school satisfaction in large schools where resources are more scarce. Thus, differential opportunities or treatment across height in large schools may drive the performance differences. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Research on these relationships has focused almost exclusively on the effects of human-made pollutants, and has not fully distinguished between contemporaneous and long-run effects. This paper contributes on both of these fronts. Merging data on ambient levels of human-made pollutants and plant pollen with detailed panel data of children beginning kindergarten in 2010, I study the relationship between poor air quality on achievement in early grades. I also provide tentative estimates of the effects of air quality in the first years of life on school-readiness. I find that students score between 1 to 2 percent lower on math and reading scores on days with high levels of pollen or fine airborne particulate Matter, and that asthmatic students score about 10 percent lower on days with high levels of ozone. I find suggestive evidence that poor air quality during early childhood negatively affects school readiness. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Many governments, particularly from low- and middle-income countries, have voiced concerns that mega-regional agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, will erode governments' scope for health protection, weakening for instance those options that remain permissible under World Trade Organization rules. Further, these mega-regional agreements will set default standards and rules of the game that even non-signatories will need to emulate in order to be competitive in the global market. This article begins by reviewing the changing structure of trade and investment policy, global production, and the relation between the two. The effects of TIAs on health are then analysed, based on some of the most relevant evidence. Key power asymmetries within the global trade and investment architecture are described, and the way they influence how trade rules are made, implemented and adjudicated. Section 5 examines a particularly striking and topical instance of such power asymmetries, investor-state dispute settlement provisions in TIAs, and their relevance to health. The article concludes with recommendations to mitigate the potential negative health externalities of TIAs.","[McNeill, Desmond] Univ Oslo, Ctr Dev & Environm, Oslo, Norway; [Barlow, Pepita] Univ Oxford, Dept Sociol, Oxford, England; [Birkbeck, Carolyn Deere] Univ Oxford, Global Econ Governance Programme, Univ Coll, Oxford, England; [Fukuda-Parr, Sakiko] New Sch, Int Affairs, New York, NY USA; [Grover, Anand] HIV AIDS Unit Lawyers Collect, New Delhi, India; [Schrecker, Ted] Univ Durham, Global Hlth Policy, Durham, England; [Stuckler, David] Univ Oxford, Polit Econ & Sociol, Oxford, England",University of Oslo; University of Oxford; University of Oxford; The New School; Durham University; University of Oxford,"McNeill, D (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Ctr Dev & Environm, Oslo, Norway.",desmond.mcneill@sum.uio.no; pepita.barlow@nuffield.ox.ac.uk; carolyn.deerebirkbeck@bsg.ox.ac.uk; fukudaps@newschool.edu; anandgrover@gmail.com; theodore.schrecker@durham.ac.uk; david.stuckler@chch.ox.ac.uk,"Fukuda-Parr, Sakiko/JFS-1714-2023; Stuckler, David/H-2261-2012","Stuckler, David/0000-0002-1288-8401; mcneill, desmond/0000-0002-8948-3197; Barlow, Pepita/0000-0002-7959-4360",,,,,120,24,25,1,15,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

The purpose of this study stems from the belief that bankruptcy specialists may have an impact on changes in information obligations of the debtor / bankrupt. As a result of the research, it was found that the opinions of bankruptcy specialists concerning the financial statements of the examined entities are very different, both extremely positive and negative. The results of the study indicate a low assessment by insolvency professionals of the qualitative characteristics of financial statements of entities which were studied.

The purpose of this study is to link innovation capacity of nascent entrepreneurs with services provided by University Business Incubators and find out which factors contribute most to the success of incubation. The quantitative study of tenants of Latvian University business incubators revealed that open innovation strategies and motivation to engage in open innovation activities are positively associated with the use of incubation services.

Information dragnets increasingly yield huge quantities of individual-level data, which are analyzed to sort and slot people into categories of taste, riskiness or worth. These tools deepen the reach of the market and define new strategies of profit-making. We present a new theoretical framework for understanding their development. We argue that (a) modern organizations follow an institutional data imperative to collect as much data as possible; (b) as a result of the analysis and use of this data, individuals accrue a form of capital flowing from their positions as measured by various digital scoring and ranking methods; and (c) the facticity of these scoring methods makes them organizational devices with potentially stratifying effects. They offer firms new opportunities to structure and price offerings to consumers. For individuals, they create classification situations that identify shared life-chances in product and service markets. We discuss the implications of these processes and argue that they tend toward a new economy of moral judgment, where outcomes are experienced as morally deserved positions based on prior good actions and good tastes, as measured and classified by this new infrastructure of data collection and analysis.","[Fourcade, Marion] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Healy, Kieran] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Duke University,"Fourcade, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Healy, K (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",fourcade@berkeley.edu; kjhealy@soc.duke.edu,,"Healy, Kieran/0000-0001-9114-981X; Fourcade, Marion/0000-0002-4821-9031",,,,,76,303,344,5,89,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

WBL as an educational approach in vocational education in Latvia was launched in 2013 in the form of pilot projects, in 2015 it was included in the regulations as a form of education acquisition, and in summer 2016 it was adopted by the regulation of the Cabinet of Ministers.

Therefore, the tasks include a detailed analysis of the experience of stakeholders in WBL implementation process, mainly focusing on awareness-raising and communication experience of WBL implementers. The article is based on the analysis of legislative acts, reports from the ministries and interviews with stakeholders (10 interviews were conducted). Results show that in WBL pilot stage there has been a quite varied school awareness and interpretation of what WBL is and how to implement it within the existing legislative framework-this has contributed to the emergence of different experiences. Furthermore, the lack of experience in the implementation of the WBL approach and the school competition are some of the reasons influencing the communication among schools.","[Golca, Liene; Rajevska, Feliciana] Vidzeme Univ Appl Sci, HESPI, Vaimiera, Latvia",Vidzeme University of Applied Sciences,"Golca, L; Rajevska, F (通讯作者)，Vidzeme Univ Appl Sci, HESPI, Vaimiera, Latvia.",liene.golca@va.lv; Feliciana.Rajevska@va.lv,,,,,,,16,1,1,0,1,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-261-3,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2017,,45,,,,,79,86,,,,,,8,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BI1NY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406530100009,0

What has not received an adequate attention in this discussion, however, is possible implication of certain DSU amendment proposals vis-a-vis developing Members. Some of the proposals being tabled, while providing an important contribution to the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism (DSM) by filing the loopholes in the system, could arguably pose new challenges to developing Members' enhanced participation in a future DSM. On the other hand, some of the proposals for strengthened S&D treatment in the DSU, as proposed by certain developing Members, may run the risk of negatively affecting the neutrality of the WTO as an adjudicator. An amended DSU should be designed to enhance the participation of developing Members, but at the same time specific methods to facilitate the participation should be carefully chosen for the integrity of an international adjudicating proceeding. This article looks into these aspects of the DSU amendment negotiation. It provides suggestions to accommodate the interest of developing Members while maintaining the integrity of the dispute settlement proceedings, so as to achieve the basic objectives of the DSU amendment negotiation.","[Lee, Jaemin] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Law, Law, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Lee, J (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Law, Law, Seoul, South Korea.",jaemin@snu.ac.kr,,,Seoul National University Asia-Pacific Law Institute,Seoul National University Asia-Pacific Law Institute,"Ph.D., LL.M., LL.B.

This article seeks to contribute to the debate, analysing the potential regulatory impact of a TPP-like agreement on Brazil and developing countries in general, arguing that third-generation broad economic partnerships may be incompatible with the foreign policy stance of keeping 'policy space' for development. The article compares the TPP legal text with previous free trade agreements (FTAs), and analyses provisions in various TPP chapters that contrast with Brazil's traditional stance in key issues relating to market access, services, investments, intellectual property, electronic commerce and regulatory convergence. Evidence from this exercise outlined that Brazil has not acceded to various international agreements which participation is required under the TPP, and Brazil still lacks modern domestic regulations in crucial areas that would be demanded in a third generation agreement. The recent withdrawal of the United States from the TPP and the uncertainties surrounding trade global governance suggests that Brazil has a window of opportunity to revamp its domestic institutions and decision-making process to become a 'rule maker' instead of 'rule-taker' in international trade.","[Martins Cesar de Oliveira, Susan Elizabeth] Univ Brasilia, Campus Planaltina FUP UnB, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Martins Cesar de Oliveira, Susan Elizabeth] Columbia Univ, Sch Int & Publ Affairs, New York, NY USA",Universidade de Brasilia; Columbia University,"de Oliveira, SEMC (通讯作者)，Univ Brasilia, Campus Planaltina FUP UnB, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",susan@unb.br,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,2,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

The conceptual arguments are complex and empirical evidence is mixed. We analyse the impact of standards and tariffs on the dramatic rise and fall of the raisin trade between France and Greece in the course of 25 years at the end of the nineteenth century. The case illustrates how product standards can be used to address consumer concerns and to protect producer interests. Economic conditions and French policies first stimulated Greek raisin imports. Later, changing conditions and political pressures led to the introduction of tariffs and wine standards which caused major declines in Greek exports and ultimately the bankruptcy of the Greek economy.

But knowledge of these issues is scant, particularly in developing world fisheries. Using per-trip, geo-referenced data for the period 1994-2004, we test the hypothesis that sea surface temperature anomalies related to El Nino events have systematically induced the Chilean fleet exploiting the Chilean (straddling) jack mackerel stock to fish beyond the 200-nm zone more frequently and farther south (than its traditional fishing grounds) than in the absence of El Nino. We take this as an indirect testing of El Nino-triggered effects on the spatial distribution of the Chilean straddling jack mackerel stock in the southeast Pacific. While measuring environmental variability, we also control for regulatory regime shifts, fleet technology features, and seasonal and price effects. Our estimation results clearly support the stated hypothesis.","[Pena-Torres, Julio] ECONLink Consultores Ltda, La Peninsula 11-296, Santiago, Chile; [Dresdner, Jorge] Univ Concepcion, Dept Econ, Res Nucleus Environm & Nat Resource Econ, Victoria 471, Concepcion, Chile; [Dresdner, Jorge] Univ Concepcion, Interdisciplinary Ctr Aquaculture Res INCAR, Victoria 471, Concepcion, Chile; [Vasquez, Felipe] Univ Desarrollo, Fac Econ & Negocios, Res Nucleus Environm & Nat Resource Econ, Concepcion, Chile; [Vasquez, Felipe] Univ Concepcion, Ctr Ciencias Ambientales EULA, Ctr Estudio Forzantes Multiples Sistemas Socioeco, Ainavillo 456, Concepcion, Chile",Universidad de Concepcion; Universidad de Concepcion; Universidad del Desarrollo; Universidad de Concepcion,"Peña-Torres, J (通讯作者)，ECONLink Consultores Ltda, La Peninsula 11-296, Santiago, Chile.",julioalept@gmail.com; jdresdne@udec.cl; fvasquez@udd.cl,"Lavin, Felipe/AAF-7373-2020","Vasquez Lavin, Felipe/0000-0002-0767-998X","STIC/AmSud-CONICYT Cooperation Program (MIFIMA Project); Scientific Millennium Initiative of the Chilean Ministry of Economics, Promotion and Tourism [RS 130001]; [CONICYT/FONDAP/15110027]","STIC/AmSud-CONICYT Cooperation Program (MIFIMA Project); Scientific Millennium Initiative of the Chilean Ministry of Economics, Promotion and Tourism;","Pena-Torres acknowledges support by the STIC/AmSud-CONICYT Cooperation Program (MIFIMA Project).

Which sources of fiscal revenue, in what capacity and in what way to distribute are the main problems that all federative states encounter frequently. However, states that are not federative, but have developed system of regional and local self-government encounter the same problems because of the high level of decentralisation of public functions. One of the benefits of fiscal decentralisation is to draw attention to the problems concerning revenue collection or the lack of it when the local and regional self-government units are in question. Tax systems of modern countries are using a large number of tax forms, which differs from country to country. The Republic of Croatia has adopted solutions that are used by the majority of European countries. Each fiscal level has its own revenue to collect, especially tax revenue. But one cathegory of tax revenue stands out-shared taxes. The revenue collected from shared taxes is divided between two or more fiscal levels.

Method: literature review. Results: Cancer constitutes an enormous burden on society in more and less economically developed countries alike. The occurrence of cancer is increasing because of the growth and aging of the population, as well as an increasing prevalence of established risk factors such as smoking, overweight, physical inactivity, and changing reproductive patterns associated with urbanization and economic development. Based on GLOBOCAN estimates, about 14.1 million new cancer cases and 8.2 million deaths occurred in 2012 worldwide. Despite a worldwide decline in incidence, gastric cancer remains a major health concern. It ranks as the fourth most common cancer and the second most frequent cause of death from cancer, accounting for 10.4% of cancer deaths worldwide. Each year, approximately 900 000 people are diagnosed with the disease and around 700 000 people die from it. Conclusions: Helicobacter pylori is recognized as one of the most significant risk factors for gastric cancer, and H. pylori eradication has been proposed as a possible primary chemo-preventive strategy to reduce gastric cancer incidence. A meta-analysis of seven randomized controlled trials concluded that H. Pylori eradication reduces gastric cancer incidence by 35%.

The analysis of the results took place in two phases. In the first phase there were determined the interdependences among items with the help of the factor analysis in the SPSS program leading to 6 factors.

We find that investor sentiment is positively associated with future stock price crash risk and poorer financial report quality and short-sale constraint will strengthen this association.

Efficiency analysis revealed that inefficient farms would have needed to increase production output levels by 32% to perform as well as the best practice farms. The decomposition of the economic efficiency showed that allocative inefficiency was the primary cause of economic inefficiency. There were positive relationships between economic efficiency and age, culture mode and period through Tobit regression, while experience, family members, and technology support had negative effects on economic efficiency.

This assertion has recently replaced the more ambitious contention that microfinance has an empowering impact on women. The paper argues that this shift has occurred because of increased commercialization at the global level and authoritative assessments against the empowerment claim. The study further considers whether the frame of competing logics from institutional theory can explain the case of the Pakistani microfinance sector, in which, as shown here, commercialized microfinance has actually led to a rise in gender inequalities in access to finance. The paper attributes this rise to the inability of the Pakistani microfinance sector to reconcile the competing logics of development and banking.","[Zulfiqar, Ghazal] Lahore Univ Management Sci, Suleman Dawood Sch Business, Lahore, Pakistan",Lahore University of Management Sciences,"Zulfiqar, G (通讯作者)，Lahore Univ Management Sci, Suleman Dawood Sch Business, Lahore, Pakistan.",ghazal.zulfiqar@lums.edu.pk,,,University of Massachusetts Boston,University of Massachusetts Boston,"This research was funded in part by a dissertation grant from the University of Massachusetts Boston.

One can mitigate such problems at the strategic level by accounting for potential fire losses in the timber supply planning process by reducing harvest levels to maintain a buffer stock of timber. With a forest planning model based on a timber volume maximizing policy, reducing the harvest level will lead to a reduction in the harvested timber volume and likely, of revenues. One possible solution is to change the policy to increase the value of the wood that is harvested so as to minimize such reductions with less risk. We have evaluated alternative policies for three commercially-managed forests that have different burn rates in northeastern Canada. When compared with a volume-maximization policy, a revenue-maximization policy that considers sustained production and the sale of sawmilling wood products (lumber, chips and sawdust) increased mean revenues by 130% (36-770%) with > 0.90 probability and substantially decreased the area and volume harvested by 27% (11-38%) and 28% (14-36%), respectively. By reducing the harvest volume, the total number of jobs associated with forest operations decreased by 20% (10-27%) but the number of jobs per unit area harvested and volume increased. The policy also increased the harvest age and thereby enhanced the retention of a greater proportion of old-growth stands. Our study indicated that a tighter link between strategic planning and wood product processing helped identify better compromises between harvesting activities and revenues, despite the occurrence of natural disturbances.","[Rijal, Baburam; Raulier, Frederic] Univ Laval, Fac Foresterie Geog & Geomat, Ctr Etud Foret, 2405 Rue Terrasse, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Martell, David L.] Univ Toronto, Fac Forestry, 33 Willcocks St, Toronto, ON M5S 3B3, Canada",Laval University; University of Toronto,"Rijal, B (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Fac Foresterie Geog & Geomat, Ctr Etud Foret, 2405 Rue Terrasse, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",baburam.rijal.1@ulaval.ca,"Rijal, Baburam/JOZ-8450-2023; Lopes, Mariana f/IAR-3054-2023","Rijal, Baburam/0000-0003-0499-7816;",NSERC Value Chain Optimization (VCO) Network under its research theme 1 Integrated Forest and Industry Strategies for the Modern Bio-economy,NSERC Value Chain Optimization (VCO) Network under its research theme 1 Integrated Forest and Industry Strategies for the Modern Bio-economy,"We thank the Ministry of Forests, Wildlife and Parks of Quebec for providing access to the data from their Forest Inventory Program (2002-2004) and the 1971-2014 fire history map.

The aim of this study is to assess the sustainability of current management in the Dopolan community forest and assess alternative management scenarios towards SFM. To this end, we applied multi criteria analysis which consists of three steps: a) developing a primary set of criteria and indicators (C&Is) on focus groups discussions, b) finalizing and weighing the set of C&Is, applying a pair wise comparison as well as ranking method, and c) assessing the current forest management regimes and alternative scenarios against a set of C&Is. As a result, 8 criteria and 40 indicators were selected. Our results indicated that to achieve SFM, the criteria including forest protection against natural and human factors, the establishment of appropriate legal and institutional requirements and socioeconomic functions of forests, are the most important criteria (weighted 14.60%, 14.28% and 13.96%, respectively). Assessing the current management regimes revealed that the criteria consisting of biodiversity conservation and local communities' awareness have the maximum distance to SFM (weighted 7.75% and 9.18%, respectively). Among the alternative forest management scenarios, the sixth scenario namely conservation and rehabilitation, local investment attraction in forest conservation and rehabilitation, enabling and capacity building of forest inhabitants were realized as the best scenarios (weighted 26.20%) to achieve SFM. A joint effort of the concerned government forestry officials and local people is needed to enhance the sustain ability of all community based forestry models.","[Jafari, Ali; Kaji, Hamdollah Sadeghi] Shahrekord Univ, Fac Nat Resources & Earth Sci, Shahrekord, Iran; [Azadi, Hossein] Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, Ghent, Belgium; [Azadi, Hossein; Van Passel, Steven] Univ Antwerp, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Engn Management, Antwerp, Belgium; [Gebrehiwot, Kindeya] Mekelle Univ, Dept Land Resource Management & Environm Protect, Mekele, Ethiopia; [Aghamir, Fateme] Shahid Beheshti Univ, Environm Sci Res Inst, Tehran, Iran; [Van Passel, Steven] UHasselt, Environm Econ Res Grp, Ctr Environm Sci, Agoralaan, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium",Shahrekord University; Ghent University; University of Antwerp; Mekelle University; Shahid Beheshti University; Hasselt University,"Jafari, A (通讯作者)，Shahrekord Univ, Fac Nat Resources & Earth Sci, Shahrekord, Iran.",jafari.ali@sku.ac.ir,"Azadi, Hossein/E-2361-2011","Jafari, Ali/0000-0002-9488-4972; Van Passel, Steven/0000-0002-6971-9246",,,,,42,10,10,1,22,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,NOV,2018,96.0,,,,,,1,8,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.08.001,0.0,,,8,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GV3HM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445985000001,0

We begin by rigorously testing whether or not residential water customers exhibit evidence of rational inattention. We then propose a heuristic water demand model to explore the decision-making of rationally inattentive consumers and validate the model by comparing the model with the discrete-continuous choice model on attentive and fully informed decision makers in out-of-sample predictions.

They instead rely more heavily on an ex post selection mechanism, based on the students' performance during higher education. We analyze how a system of ex post selection affects initial enrollment and final degree completion, using a rich dataset for Belgium (region of Flanders). We develop a dynamic discrete choice model of college/university and major choice, where the outcome of the enrollment decision is uncertain. Upon observing past performance, students may decide to continue, reorient to another major, or drop out. We find that ex post student selection is very strong: less than half of the students successfully complete their course work in the first year. Unsuccessful students mainly switch from university to college majors, or from college majors to drop-out. We use the estimates to evaluate the effects of alternative, ex ante admission policies. We find that well-designed moderate admission standards reduce unsuccessful initial enrolment and at the same time do not decrease degree completion. This is because ex ante screening better matches students to the right majors, reducing the probability of early drop-out.","[Declercq, Koen; Verboven, Frank] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; [Verboven, Frank] CEPR, Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Declercq, K (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.",Koen.Declercq@kuleuven.be; Frank.Verboven@kuleuven.be,"PATTANAYAK, MANORANJAN/N-7858-2017; Declercq, Koen/IQV-5501-2023; Verboven, Frank/GLV-3358-2022","Verboven, Frank/0000-0002-5686-3820",,,,,36,13,18,1,17,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0272-7757,1873-7382,,ECON EDUC REV,Econ.

Findings indicate that traceability information flows that provide more precise information to oyster consumers regarding the location of harvest ameliorate consumers' perceived risk of eating oyster meals after the spill, leading to a significant increase in demand. Further, the magnitude of the increase is greater than the negative long-term, post-spill effects, leading to overall welfare gains. However, any price increase associated with the information will mitigate the initial welfare gains. Overall, our findings suggest that the potential success of a new seafood traceability system depends on implementation costs and the extent to which price increases are passed on to consumers.","[Morgan, O.

The findings are not the result of a research project, but draw on practice and reflection on risk management and strategic futures in central government in the UK over the last 15 years, with an emphasis on the role of the Government Chief Scientific Advisor and Government Office for Science. From the perspective of a policy-maker, extreme risks are likely to be viewed initially through the lens of experience of risk in policy-making more generally. Approaches to the management of well-characterised risks in the context of civil emergencies show the importance of linking assessments of risk to the purpose of making the assessment, of communication and engagement, and of avoiding groupthink and narrow disciplinary discussions. In some cases where the risks cannot be well-characterised or easily imagined, new forms of visualisation and narrative, including futures work, can be used to shape and bound the risks and to engage policy-makers or citizens. Approaches to risk management in the context of innovation policy show the need to consider the risk of inaction as well as action, and the importance of path dependency.","[Craig, Claire] 6-9 Carlton House Terrace, London SW1Y 5AG, England",,"Craig, C (通讯作者)，6-9 Carlton House Terrace, London SW1Y 5AG, England.",Claire.craig@royalsociety.org,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,15,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,SEP,2018,102.0,,,,SI,,146,152,,10.1016/j.futures.2018.04.001,0.0,,,7,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,GS4ZR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000443666900014,0

The resulting endogenous dynamic increasing returns to scale external to producers that create endogenous growth of production lead to ongoing and accelerating rates of natural capital depletion. Optimum and open-access steady-state equilibriums indicated by canonical models may not exist, and corresponding resource stocks vary considerably from conventional wisdom. Market-based solutions alone for the commons problem are insufficient to achieve optimal economic welfare, and require a complementary technology policy for the second market failure and dynamic increasing returns to scale arising from nonrival ideas and knowledge spillovers and social learning.

These species may also create value for hunters in terms of recreational and other values. However, in Sweden and many other countries hunters have access to multiple game species, which needs to be considered when comparing eventual costs and values of different game. In this study we estimated hunters' trade-offs in valuation of the four main game animals in Sweden, moose, roe deer, wild boar and small game, by regarding them as different attributes of hunting. To this end, a discrete choice experiment framework was used to elicit hunters' trade-offs between the different game animals. Estimates with a mixed logit model showed significant differences in valuations of the game animals. Average annual marginal willingness to pay (WTP) for hunting moose was SEK 1878/animal (SEK 8.44 = 1 USD in 2015), which was approximately four-fold and six-fold the corresponding WTP for roe deer and wild boar, respectively.","[Engelman, Marc; Lagerkvist, Carl-Johan; Gren, Ing-Marie] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, Box 7013, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Gren, IM (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, Box 7013, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",ing-marie.gren@slu.se,,,Wildlife Fund at the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency [12/133],Wildlife Fund at the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency,We are much indebted to the Wildlife Fund at the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency for financial support for the project 'Economic analysis of wild boar' (grant no. 12/133) and to two anonymous reviewers for useful comments.,,49,9,10,0,25,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,JUL,2018,92.0,,,,,,73,81,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.04.004,0.0,,,9,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GJ9UI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000435750000008,0

Currently, < 7.5% of this forest area is defined as planted forest. Removals from planted forests are shown to be responsible for about 45% of the global industrial roundwood production. It is therefore of great importance to study how the production of roundwood from planted forests could potentially influence the production of roundwood from natural forests and the global wood markets in general. The objective of this study is to describe and specify the functioning and interdependencies of global wood markets and implement wood removals from different types of forests, such as planted or natural. In this study we use an econometric approach to analyze how global markets affect the amount of wood supply, demand and trade. According to our results and with regard to roundwood supply, only removals from planted forest respond significantly positive to changes in the roundwood prices. The supply of all other roundwood products seems to be nearly inelastic. Regarding wood product demand, all products under consideration show significantly negative responses to changes in product prices. To test the plausibility of our estimations, we implemented the computed elasticities in an economic partial equilibrium model. The results suggest that the nearly inelastic wood supply improves model simulations as the results better replicate historical data compared to the original model version.","[Morland, Christian; Schier, Franziska; Janzen, Niels; Weimar, Holger] Thuenen Inst Int Forestry & Forest Econ, Leuschnerstr 91, D-21031 Hamburg, Germany",Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute,"Morland, C (通讯作者)，Thuenen Inst Int Forestry & Forest Econ, Leuschnerstr 91, D-21031 Hamburg, Germany.",christian.morland@thuenen.de,"Morland, Christian/AAL-8732-2020; Weimar, Holger/G-7797-2016","Morland, Christian/0000-0001-6600-570X; Weimar, Holger/0000-0001-8211-3735",,,,,40,28,31,0,15,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,JUL,2018,92.0,,,,,,92,105,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.04.003,0.0,,,14,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GJ9UI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000435750000010,0

After discussing this issue in two dimensions - the vertical relationship between trade and national and European Union (EU) law, and the horizontal relationship between trade and human rights law - the author concludes that these limits are real and pose serious risks. Inspired by recent developments in safeguarding labour, and environmental standards and sustainable development, the article argues that privacy and personal data protection should be part of, and protected by, international trade deals made by the EU. The EU should negotiate future international trade agreements with the objective of allowing them to reflect the normative foundations of privacy and personal data protection.

Differences in the severity levels can be subtle, and confusion about which is 'worse' can lead to logically inconsistent valuation data. A solution could be to mimic the way patients self-report health, where the ordinal structure of levels is clear. We develop and test the feasibility of presenting EQ-5D-5L health states in the 'context' of the entire EQ-5D-5L descriptive system. An online two-arm discrete choice experiment was conducted in the UK (n = 993). Respondents were randomly allocated to a control (standard presentation) or 'context' arm. Each respondent completed 16 paired comparison tasks and feedback questions about the tasks. Differences across arms were assessed using regression analyses. Presenting health states 'in context' can significantly reduce the selection of logically dominated health states, particularly for labels 'severe' and 'extreme' (chi(2) = 46.02, p < 0.001). Preferences differ significantly between arms (likelihood ratio statistic = 42.00, p < 0.05). Comparing conditional logit modeling results, coefficients are ordered as expected for both arms, but the magnitude of decrements between levels is larger for the context arm. Health state presentation is a key consideration in the design of valuation studies. Presenting health states 'in context' affects valuation data and reduces logical inconsistencies. Our results could have implications for other valuation tasks such as time trade-off, and for the valuation of other preference-based measures.","[Cole, Amanda; Shah, Koonal; Feng, Yan; Devlin, Nancy] Off Hlth Econ, Southside 7th Floor,105 Victoria St, London SW1E 6QT, England; [Mulhern, Brendan] Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Evaluat, 1-59 Quay St, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia",University of Technology Sydney,"Shah, K (通讯作者)，Off Hlth Econ, Southside 7th Floor,105 Victoria St, London SW1E 6QT, England.",kshah@ohe.org,"Shah, Koonal/M-9123-2014; Cole, Amanda/M-3752-2014; Feng, Yan/M-5358-2014","Shah, Koonal/0000-0002-4927-7858; Cole, Amanda/0000-0001-6179-7752; Feng, Yan/0000-0003-4436-1126; Mulhern, Brendan/0000-0003-3656-8063",EuroQol Research Foundation,EuroQol Research Foundation,"This study was funded by the EuroQol Research Foundation.

Moreover, the article outlines examples on how human-robot interactions in the aforementioned sectors may be shaped once humanoid robots with artificial intelligence develop human like self-awareness.

Separate analyses of each cohort map these trajectories at different stages of adult life and cross-cohort similarities are found. The analysis reveals that durable access is differentiated from long-range vertical mobility and a stepping stone function of middle-class attachment.

Recently, the relationship came to a standstill, with both parties to be blamed for a vanishing enthusiasm in moving the relationship forward. Yet, what today seems to be a closed chapter, might well, in the next 15 years, develop into a working relationship, with both Turkey and the EU benefiting from a functional cooperation. Applying the foresight methodology, which helps avoid prejudging the future of the EU-Turkey relations, we came up with three scenarios thereof, namely down in the dumps, frenernies in flexible and functional cooperation and into the European fold. The scenarios are informed by three drivers, that are the intra-EU dynamics, internal developments in Turkey, and the situation in the joint neighbourhood, which we see as key determinants of the possible EU-Turkey futures.","[Haferlach, Lisa] Hertie Sch Governance, Dahrendorf Forum, Berlin, Germany; [Teldn, Funda] Univ Cologne, Ctr Turkey & European Union Studies, Cologne, Germany; [Teldn, Funda] Ctr Int Format Europeenne, Berlin, Germany; [Wodka, Jakub] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Polit Studies, Warsaw, Poland",Hertie School; University of Cologne; Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Political Studies of the Polish Academy of Sciences,"Haferlach, L (通讯作者)，Hertie Sch Governance, Quartier 110,Friedrichstr 180, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",Haferlach@hertle-school.org,,"Wodka, Jakub/0000-0003-3926-0814",,,,,54,3,3,2,15,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,MAR,2018,97.0,,,,SI,,53,62,,10.1016/j.futures.2017.04.006,0.0,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,GA7AD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428485900007,0

While factor replacement therapy constitutes the majority of costs in haemophilia, the relationship between target joints and non drug-related direct costs (NDDCs) has not been studied. Methods: Data on haemophilia patients without inhibitors was drawn from the 'Cost of Haemophilia across Europe - a Socioeconomic Survey' (CHESS) study, a cost assessment in severe haemophilia A and B across five European countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom) in which 139 haemophilia specialists provided demographic and clinical information for 1285 adult patients. NDDCs were calculated using publicly available cost data, including 12-month ambulatory and secondary care activity: haematologist and other specialist consultant consultations, medical tests and examinations, bleed-related hospital admissions, and payments to professional care providers. A generalized linear model was developed to investigate the relationship between NDDCs and target joints (areas of chronic synovitis), adjusted for patient covariates. Results: Five hundred and thirteen patients (42% of the sample) had no diagnosed target joints; a total of 1376 target joints (range 1-10) were recorded in the remaining 714 patients. Mean adjusted NDDCs for persons with no target joints were EUR 3134 (standard error (SE) EUR 158); for persons with one or more target joints, mean adjusted NDDCs were EUR 3913 (SE EUR 157; average mean effect EUR 779; p < 0.001). Conclusions: Our analysis suggests that the presence of one or more target joints has a significant impact on NDDCs for patients with severe haemophilia, ceteris paribus. Prevention and management of target joints should be an important consideration of managing haemophilia patients.","[O'Hara, Jamie] Univ Chester, Fac Hlth & Social Care, Chester, Cheshire, England; [Walsh, Shaun; Camp, Charlotte] HCD Econ, Daresbury WA4 4FS, England; [Mazza, Giuseppe] UCL, UCL Inst Liver & Digest Hlth, Royal Free Hosp, London, England; [Carroll, Liz] Haemophilia Soc, London, England; [Hoxer, Christina; Wilkinson, Lars] Novo Nordisk AS, Vandtamsvej 114, DK-2860 Soborg, Denmark",University of Chester; University of London; University College London; Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust; UCL Medical School; Novo Nordisk,"Camp, C (通讯作者)，HCD Econ, Daresbury WA4 4FS, England.",j.ohara@chester.ac.uk; shaun.walsh@hcdeconomics.com; charlotte.camp@hcdeconomics.com; giuseppe.mazza.12@ucl.ac.uk; liz@haemophilia.org.uk; cish@novonordisk.com; laws@novonordisk.com,,,Novo Nordisk,Novo Nordisk(Novo NordiskNovo Nordisk Foundation),This study was funded by Novo Nordisk.

These consequences primary concern socio-economic and environmental areas. The most important economic benefits are connected with production, turnover and employment in the biofuels industry and the development of agriculture through higher demand on agricultural commodities. The aim of the paper was to quantify labour productivity in the liquid biofuels sector in European Union countries. It is hypothesized that highly developed countries (measured by GDP per capita) have higher labour productivity in the liquid biofuels industry than poorer European Union countries. The second hypothesis states that countries with high liquid biofuel production have higher labour productivity than other countries. The period under research covered the years 2009-2015. The data are mainly from Eurostat, EurObserv'ER consortium and World Bank. This research provides the general conclusion that a high level of economic development is not accompanied by high labour productivity (two types) in the liquid biofuels sector (there is no significant positive correlation). The same applies to the relation between biofuel production volume and labour productivity. The research proves that a high level of GDP per capita or the big scale of biofuel production (and use) is not a determinant of high labour productivity in this sector.","[Borychowski, Michal] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Fac Econ, Al Niepodlegloki 10, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Borychowski, M (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Fac Econ, Al Niepodlegloki 10, Poznan, Poland.",michal.borychowski@ue.poznan.pl,"Borychowski, Michał/AAE-8489-2021","Borychowski, Michał/0000-0001-6256-2680",,,,,24,0,0,0,0,Warsaw Univ Life Sciences Pr,Warsaw,"Nowoursynowska 166, Warsaw, POLAND",,,978-83-7583-802-2,,,,2018,,,,,,,116,124,,10.22630/ESARE.2018.1.16,0.0,,,9,Development Studies; Economics; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Geography,BO1TN,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000502413100016,0

Again, we add time series data of CMI's capital, labor, energy, and mid-input to the model to calculate the direct rebound effect of CMI.

Selection and policies matter,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Self-reported health status; Immigration; Europe; Israel; Older population; Multilevel regression; SHARE,ASSIMILATION,"Previous literature on a variety of countries has documented a healthy immigrant effect (HIE). Accordingly, immigrants arriving in the host country are, on average, healthier than comparable natives. However, their health status dissipates with additional years in the country. HIE is explained through the positive self-selection of healthy immigrants as well as the positive selection, screening and discrimination applied by host countries. In this article we study the health trajectories of immigrants within the context of selection and migration policies. Using SHARE data we examine the HIE, comparing Israel and 16 European countries that have fundamentally different migration policies. Israel has virtually unrestricted open gates for Jewish people around the world, who in turn have ideological rather than economic considerations to move. European countries have selective policies with regards to the health, education and wealth of migrants, who also self-select themselves. Our results provide evidence that (1) immigrants who move to Israel have compromised health and are significantly less healthy than comparable natives. Their health disadvantage persists for up to 20 years of living in Israel, after which they become similar to natives; (2) immigrants who move to Europe have significantly better health than comparable natives.

In face of the increasing expenditure of the National Healthcare System with chronic kidney disease, together with an environment of economic and financial crisis making the management function a hard challenge, health organizations and health professionals are called for real integration of clinical information and economic information in their decision-making. A longitudinal study in a central teaching hospital was designed. During the research period, it was studied which of the therapies currently provided by the hospital for chronic kidney disease is economically less costly.

Through innovations developing countries are able to make up for the delay to the developed countries. However, developed countries have a significant advantage. This study did not confirm decrease in the innovation gap between developed and developing countries. Positive is the fact, that poorer countries are becoming more efficient in the innovation process. Although, countries with lower income do not have adequate infrastructure and human capital, and thus do not achieve the significant innovative results. Investments in the innovation-friendly environment should be key area for the state activity.

Creative tourism considers active participation in local creative activities, such as gastronomy workshops, harvests, learning traditional dances, songs and many more cultural elements. In order to keep a traditional lifestyle and keeping locals in their motherland, new management models should be brought together, including various sectors: tourism, culture, ethnology, spatial planning and agronomy. In a dynamic tourist market, with small investments, it is possible to create a competitive advantage based on the authenticity of a particular destination.

In accomplishing this goal, the essence and explanation of the specificity of the managerial profession were presented to confront traditional expectations addressed to managers with expectations resulting from the development of the digital economy. ICT was presented as General Purpose Technologies (GPT), which led to the third technological revolution. Next, new ICT solutions are synthetically presented, which currently have a particularly strong impact on the work of managers, their decisions and the strategies and management methods they adopt. The main attention was paid to such solutions as mobile and wireless technologies, Big Data, Cloud Computing, Internet of Things and 3D printing technology. The importance of ICT power resulting from their range and universality of the application was also emphasized and it was also indicated that such solutions as artificial intelligence, supercomputer, autonomous cars, robots, bitcoins and blockchains and neurotechnologies are also interesting. Next, an attempt was made to explain how the expectations addressed to contemporary managers change. It was pointed out that currently, managers need to revise the existing, traditional management methods. At the same time, new approaches to management should apply to virtually all dimensions of their activity and responsibility. Fundamental changes should include, among others, organization strategy, shaping organizational structures, human resources management practices, marketing, managing people and managing teams. As a consequence, managers should be able to implement new business models. As it results from the analysis, the managers' approach to the tasks they fulfill should change fundamentally. In the conditions of the digital economy, they should be ready to give up some of their power and link the organization's success with work within flattened organizational structures. In a new way, they also have to approach the implementation of organizational leadership and team management. The paper is an attempt to implement the prognostic goals of management theory and practice. It is based on a critical analysis of available, very extensive literature on the subject in the area covered by the topic. It also used the analysis of statistical data on ICT development and the results of querying reports and thematic studies of well-known consulting companies. Also included are business case studies published in reputable business journals, which particularly use ICT effectively.","[Gonciarski, Wieslaw; Swiatkowski, Marek] Mil Univ Technol, 2 Gen Witolda Urbanowicza St, PL-00908 Warsaw, Poland",Military University of Technology in Warsaw,"Gonciarski, W (通讯作者)，Mil Univ Technol, 2 Gen Witolda Urbanowicza St, PL-00908 Warsaw, Poland.",w.gonciarski@gmail.com; swiatkowskimarek1@gmail.com,"Gonciarski, Wiesław/ABA-9574-2020",,,,,,63,1,1,1,23,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,332,345,,,,,,14,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200030,0

Majority of these countries have still felt the effects of the Yugoslav Wars so that their growth path is limited. Nowadays, the Western Balkan countries are aiming to be a member of the European Union. However, the accession path is considered to be a long and tough process with a number of criteria to be met. Many researchers suggest that regional development should be considered as one of the first issues to be addressed in the EU Accession Process. However, this paper takes the position that while regional development is indeed of great importance, it need not be a requirement to join the EU. The paper suggests that these countries should focus on meeting different EU accession criteria in the first place. Then once they become an EU member, they will have time and all necessary funds and financial aids to comply with regional development. The paper is based on a critical and synthetic literature review on the problem of regional development of the Western Balkans and in the perspective of the potential EU enlargement. It clearly addresses the issue of whether the Western Balkans should focus on the regional development and once it is achieved, the EU accession will come naturally. Many researchers think in that way, however, it seems that such a process might be time-consuming, so instead of focusing on regional development, the WBs countries need to focus on their economic, institutional, legal and political environment to speed up the EU integration process.","[Grodzicki, Tomasz] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Jurija Gagarina 13a, PL-87100 Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Grodzicki, T (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Jurija Gagarina 13a, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.",tomgro10@wp.pl,"Grodzicki, Tomasz/JAN-8615-2023","Grodzicki, Tomasz/0000-0001-7819-2127",,,,,25,0,0,1,2,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,121,129,,,,,,9,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200011,0

Investigated macroeconomic trade conditions included population size, GDP, GDP per capita and the inflation rate. Naive forecasting methods were used to estimate selected characteristics, as well as export and import volumes, considering their development trends. The analyses showed that currently, the largest global trade centres, i.e. the EU and the USA, are losing their share in global GDP. Their share in global exports and imports is decreasing to the advantage of BRICS countries. The simulation up to 2070 showed that the trends observed in previous years may be increasing, while the position of the EU and the USA in world trade may be weakening.","[Jabkowski, Dawid; Szalaty, Norbert; Wyduba, Weronika] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Life Sciences,"Jabkowski, D; Szalaty, N; Wyduba, W (通讯作者)，Wojska Polskiego 28, Poznan, Poland.",dawid.jabkowski@up.poznan.pl; norbert.szalaty@up.poznan.pl; weronika.wyduba@up.poznan.pl,,"Jabkowski, Dawid/0000-0002-8315-136X; Wyduba, Weronika/0000-0003-4091-5574",National Science Centre within the OPUS research project [2015/17/B//HS4/00262],National Science Centre within the OPUS research project,"The paper is funded by the National Science Centre within the OPUS research project 2015/17/B//HS4/00262, entitled 'Polish agri-food sector under the implementation of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership agreement (TTIP)'.",,25,0,0,1,4,Warsaw Univ Life Sciences Pr,Warsaw,"Nowoursynowska 166, Warsaw, POLAND",,,978-83-7583-803-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,209,215,,10.22630/ESARE.2018.2.27,0.0,,,7,Development Studies; Economics; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Geography,BO1TO,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000502418600027,0

The indicator of it is the assessment of the regional impact of human capital, which will be proven to be influenced by the density and level of employment in Russia. The paper shows the dependence of the population income on the regional characteristics, estimates of the impact of human capital are demonstrated. The regression analysis based on the Cobb-Douglas model is used as the method of research, and the relative capital armament of labor, the density of employment, the average level of education in the economy, the share of employed with higher education in the total number of employees are taken as exogenous variables. The income of the population was considered as an exogenous variable. The authors assumed that in regions with higher population densities the impact of human capital (and hence the knowledge diffusion) is higher, so the regions are grouped by this indicator into European (high) and Asian (low) regions. The growth of the employment density by 1% corresponds to the growth of income per employee by about 0.02-0.03%, therefore, the doubling of the employment density is accompanied by the increase in income by 2-3%. At the same time, the coefficient of elasticity of impact of human capital was lower than the coefficient of elasticity of impact of the relative capital-labor ratio. It can be assumed that the income is less affected by human capital than physical capital. Regression spatial analysis has shown that in the regions of the European part of Russia the impact of physical and human capital is higher than in the regions of the Asian part, which means that investment in physical capital is more appropriate to be placed mainly in more densely populated regions, but this does not solve the problem of ensuring access to knowledge and realization of its potential.","[Koritsky, Alexei] Novosibirsk State Tech Univ, Sch Business, Novosibirsk, Russia; [Aletdinova, Anna] Novosibirsk State Tech Univ, Dept Automat & Comp Engn, Novosibirsk, Russia; [Babkin, Alexandr] Peter Great St Petersburg Polytech Univ, St Petersburg, Russia",Novosibirsk State Technical University; Novosibirsk State Technical University; Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University,"Koritsky, A (通讯作者)，Novosibirsk State Tech Univ, Sch Business, Novosibirsk, Russia.",koritskiy-a@mail.ru; aletdinova@corp.nstu.ru; babkin@spbstu.ru,"Aletdinova, Anna A/M-5695-2017","Aletdinova, Anna A/0000-0002-9257-4735",,,,,19,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-514-6,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,39.0,,,,,,711,715,,,,,,5,Business; Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BO4YG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000515721900144,0

The spa facilities operating in the Slovak Republic according to the Statistics Classification of Economic Activities (SK NACE) belong to the section 869 - Other health care. The paper deals with the 21 spa companies in the Slovak Republic. The rating of these companies is the contribution realized by defined criteria that represent proportional financial indicators such as basic production strength of an enterprise, return on sales, financial performance and financial productivity of one employee. Financial and economic position of the company in the space is realized on the basis of the order method, the scoring method, the normalized variable method and the method of distance from a fictitious object. As a result, the market order of the spa facilities is set. In addition multidimensional scaling is applied to show similarities in the group of 21 spa facilities in a two-dimensional space.","[Litavcova, Eva; Jencova, Sylvia; Kosikova, Martina; Senkova, Anna] Univ Presov, Fac Management, Konstantinova 16, Presov 08001, Slovakia",University of Presov,"Litavcová, E (通讯作者)，Univ Presov, Fac Management, Konstantinova 16, Presov 08001, Slovakia.",eva.litavcova@unipo.sk; sylvia.jencova@unipo.sk; martina.kosikova@smail.unipo.sk; anna.senkova@unipo.sk,"Košíková, Martina/C-8994-2018; Litavcova, Eva/JAN-6178-2023; Litavcova, Eva/Q-3792-2018; Jenčová, Sylvia/Q-7398-2018","Košíková, Martina/0000-0002-8765-2399; Litavcova, Eva/0000-0002-5323-4359; Jenčová, Sylvia/0000-0002-0736-0880","Grant Agency VEGA [1/0470/18, 1/0945/17]",Grant Agency VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),Supported by the grant No. 1/0470/18 and by the grant No. 1/0945/17 of the Grant Agency VEGA.,,12,4,4,2,7,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,1070,1079,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400107,0

Among the alternative sources, the sun's energy is most appealing. Therefore, the development of solar energy, in the long run, is one of the top priorities. In practice, there are numerous barriers to the growth of the solar energy market. First of all, economic: fairly high prices for solar systems and payback period; the absence of working capital from manufacturing enterprises, the absence of specific mechanisms for stimulating production in the form of subsidies, tax exemptions, preferential tariff policies, etc. Therefore, research into the development of solar energy, as a real tool for a comprehensive solution to economic and environmental problems, is becoming increasingly relevant. The paper considers the energy policy of the use of renewable energy sources in rural areas. The theoretically feasible and technically achievable potential of solar energy in the territory of Ukraine was characterized. It was noted that the sun is the most affordable supplier of energy on earth today. The use of solar radiation is expedient for the development of thermal and electric energy and is possible throughout the territory of Ukraine. The dynamics of the commissioning of solar power plants by private households was analysed. The attention is focused on the application of the 'green' tariff, which stimulates the increase in the number of solar projects implemented in households. A financial model of private households of choosing a solar power plant option was proposed. The problems were identified and the possibilities of using solar energy for ensuring energy independence of households and profit generation were assessed. The forecast for the development of solar energy of the period up to 2020 was made.","[Mandych, Oleksandra] Kharkiv Natl Tech Univ Agr, Educ & Sci Inst Business & Management, Kharkov, Ukraine; [Prokopchuk, Liliia] State Agr & Engn Univ Podilya, Fac Econ, Kamianets Podilskyi, Ukraine; [Mykytas, Arkadii] Kharkiv Natl Tech Univ Agr, Educ & Sci Inst Mech & Management Syst, Kharkov, Ukraine",State Biotechnological University; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Podillia State University; State Biotechnological University,"Mandych, O; Mykytas, A (通讯作者)，Alchevskykh 44, UA-61002 Kharkov, Ukraine.;Prokopchuk, L (通讯作者)，Schevchenko 13, UA-32300 Kamianets Podilskyi, Ukraine.",Ol.mandych@gmail.com; prokopchuklm@gmail.com; Arkadiimykytas@ulcr.net,"Prokopchuk, Liliya/ABG-6963-2020; Mandych, Oleksandra/AAJ-4413-2020; Mykytas, Arkadii/AAE-6992-2021","Mandych, Oleksandra/0000-0002-4375-2208; Prokopchuk, Liliya/0000-0002-9075-8549; Mykytas, Arkadii/0000-0001-7059-9205",,,,,10,1,1,0,5,Warsaw Univ Life Sciences Pr,Warsaw,"Nowoursynowska 166, Warsaw, POLAND",,,978-83-7583-802-2,,,,2018,,,,,,,231,236,,10.22630/ESARE.2018.1.32,0.0,,,6,Development Studies; Economics; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Geography,BO1TN,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000502413100032,0

The contribution of our article consists in the decomposition of income inequality by subgroups of household classified by characteristics such as the type and size of the household, the socio-economic group of the household, the educational level of the household head and the place of residence. The analysis on income inequality is based on microdata obtained from the Eurostat (EU-SILC). To assess the overall income inequality the measures of Generalized Entropy were used. The study shows that in the V4 group the lowest level of income inequality is observed in Slovakia and Czech Republic. Our findings suggest that education and prevailing source of income are among the main determinants of income inequality. In all V4 countries, the difference in the level of education is the most crucial driver of income inequality.","[Muszynska, Joanna; Wedrowska, Ewa] Nicholas Copernicus Univ, Fac Econ Sci & Management, Ul Gagarina 13a, PL-87100 Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Muszynska, J (通讯作者)，Nicholas Copernicus Univ, Fac Econ Sci & Management, Ul Gagarina 13a, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.",Joanna.Muszynska@umk.pl; Ewa.Wedrowska@umk.pl,"Wędrowska, Ewa/ABA-2559-2020; Muszynska, Joanna/Q-6761-2017","Wędrowska, Ewa/0000-0003-3902-0896; Muszynska, Joanna/0000-0002-9436-4336",Eurostat [164/2016-EU-SILC],Eurostat,"This paper is prepared within the research project: Income Inequalities in the European Union Countries (Eurostat, No.: 164/2016-EU-SILC) and is based on data from Eurostat, EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions - EU-SILC CROSS-SECTIONAL UDB 2016 - version of October 2017.

In Slovakia, over the last decade, the number of university graduates has grown to a large extent. High school students continue to pursue their studies with great expectations, hoping to find a better job and faster career growth after graduation. Unfortunately, young people tend to learn more from less demanding disciplines, pedagogy, andragogy, social work, prestigious law and medical science. Studying the more demanding sciences such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, electrical engineering is of minimal importance. Therefore, we have is large the demand after such graduates on the labour market today. Currently, learning opportunities are almost unlimited. If students who want to continue studying in college have chosen the appropriate field of expertise they want to deal with in the future, they should also find the right university. What is the basis for choosing a student university if you have already found the right area for yourself?

Several former Spanish Empire estates and provinces, having broken free from the reign of Spain, decided to unite as a single state organism. However, it was not until the second half of the 19th century that this idea of unity began to come to life. There were several favourable factors at play: the nation states, similar social structures, coinciding economic situations, a common history, a common Catholic creed, cultural relatedness and the weakening of the Kingdom of Spain. The rapid inflow of new ideas from Western Europe - new philosophy and ideals of the Enlightening - also played a major role in the process. Unfortunately, it ended in failure almost as soon as it started. Even at the beginning of the second half the 19th century, new issues arose which managed to successfully shut down the ongoing efforts, primarily including the increasing sense of difference between the individual nations' ideals and beliefs, as well as a feeling of strong territorial independence of the local populations. These differences had the painful and bloody result of nearly a hundred years of conflict and strife across the entire continent. Another major effect was the formation of several independent, sovereign countries, whose borders have almost not changed since. Due to the success of the Cuban Revolution, the thought of a political and territorial unity of Latin America resurfaced in the 1950s. The ideals of socialism and communism are well received among the poorest classes, with all manner of leftist groups propagating, among others, the concept of creating a melting pot of the various nations in the region. On the other hand, far right and oftentimes authoritarian parties tended to seize power in the individual countries, frequently with external support. These parties were not always opposed to the idea of collaboration and integration with their neighbours, but would accept it merely in terms of economy. Nowadays, Latin America is internally torn by diametrically opposed political and ideological forces to a degree unlike any other continent. Which of these forces will prevail and complete the task of uniting the region has not yet been determined.","[Przygoda, Miroslaw] Univ Warsaw, Fac Management, Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Przygoda, M (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Management, Warsaw, Poland.",miroslawprzygoda@wp.pl,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,410,418,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO8KK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000527683300046,0

It may be reasonable to believe that better accountability mechanisms lead to less corruption or better governance is given by a higher level of corruption control. Classical theories that address the effectiveness of sanctioning policies developed by Becker and Tullock state that the increase in sanctioning policies reduces fraud tendency. The cost of maintaining control and punishment policies is growing bigger due to the psychological changes of individuals, which involve additional and costly steps, both in terms of cost per se and increasing cognitive dissonance over rules. If we plan to observe this phenomenon, we can simply look back only 20 years ago in Italy (the mani pulite nationwide judicial investigation into Italy's political corruption and especially in the later developments). Moreover, we can analyze the current situation in Romania nowadays when we notice that the fight against corruption is difficult to sustain in the long term after a period of strong development. Similar situations have been described in theory during the experiments of Robert Sears in which people who have been subject to higher penalties for committing an act prohibited by the rules tend to commit the offense more often compared to those who were undergoing milder punishment. The models which use the cognitive dissonance theory to determine the effectiveness of sanctions policies, such as those of Akerlof and Dickens, based on Sears's experiments, explain that the internal decision not to commit an illegal act lies in the rule of law belief and enforced regulation rather than in the sanctions policy severity. Based on these theories, the paper aims to carry out a quantitative analysis of some factors that contribute to the government effectiveness increase. The analysis was performed using the worldwide governance indicators (WGI) developed by the World Bank and took into consideration the WGI indicators dynamics, rule of law and corruption control, and the way in which these two indicators influence the dynamics of government effectiveness. The research data included 32 countries for which the evolution of corruption control and rule of law indicators can be characterized by a significant trend. For each country have been calculated the trends in the indicators evolution for the period 1998 - 2016. The authors selected only those countries where the determinative factor was high, which means a significant trend of the corruption control indicator. A first conclusion of the paper highlights that the corruption control dynamics are directly correlated in the short term with the rule of law and government effectiveness dynamics which confirms Becker and Tullock's sanctions policy. The influence of cognitive dissonance on Sears's experiments (and also the models of Akerlof and Dickens) result from the second conclusion of the study, which emphasize that the increase in the difference between the two indicators tends to affect the government effectiveness dynamics. The conclusion of the paper is that the growth rate of corruption control should be roughly equal to the rule of law growth to achieve a maximal government effectiveness.","[Serbanescu, Cosmin; Vintilescu, Adrian] Natl Inst Internal Control, Bucharest, Romania",,"Serbanescu, C (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Internal Control, Bucharest, Romania.",cosmin.serbanescu@incir.ro; adrian.vintilescu@incir.ro,"Serbanescu, Cosmin/ABF-5392-2020",,,,,,22,0,0,1,4,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,1260,1272,,,,,,13,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200107,0

The notion of happiness and the ways of its measurement has long been left on the margin of the economic science. Determining the definition of happiness has not been the only problem, but the methods of measuring it as well. A research in literature on wealth and happiness has been carried out for the sake of this paper. The specific nature of economics as part of humanities has been discussed proving that it is the challenge for economics to study both wealth and happiness. The specific nature of Positive and Normative Economics has been compared which resulted in the conclusion that it is the task of Normative Economics to shape the reality in order to provide wellbeing and happiness to ordinary people. The idea of good economics has been exposed to be used to focus on man and their needs. Further, empirical study of the level of happiness and wealth has been carried out in the European Union states. The level of wealth was measured with the use of the most popular tool, i.e. Gross National Product per capita. For this purpose, the data of the World Bank was used. Also the level of happiness of the UE citizens has been measured. The HPI- Happiness Index Planet was used, developed by experts of New Economic Foundation. This tool involves such elements as wellbeing, life expectancy, inequality of outcomes, ecological footprint. The findings showed a moderate correlation between happiness and wealth. They proved a significant differentiation between particular countries of the European Union showing that the countries of the so called Central-Eastern Europe make up the group of poor and least happy ones. The Scandinavian countries and Holland proved the reverse. An interesting situation was noted in Luxembourg which is regarded as the richest country in the European Union, where the results showed the worst coefficient of happiness. The Author has drawn the conclusion that the happiest countries cannot be the poorest. This means that the European Union faces a challenge and within social and political policies is supposed to provide the nations not only with wealth but happiness as well.","[Studzieniecki, Tomasz] Gdynia Maritime Univ, Gdynia, Poland",Gdynia Maritime University,"Studzieniecki, T (通讯作者)，Gdynia Maritime Univ, Gdynia, Poland.",tomaszstudzieniecki@wp.pl,"Studzieniecki, Tomasz/Q-7351-2018","Studzieniecki, Tomasz/0000-0002-1272-0908",,,,,34,0,0,2,5,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,653,660,,,,,,8,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO8KK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000527683300072,0
