We expect that the process of classifying stocks into Sharia-compliant (Islamic) and non-Sharia-compliant (conventional) has an effect on the investibility and acceptance of the stocks especially by unsophisticated or individual investors. The wider acceptance of Islamic stocks among individual investors promotes and facilitates the circulation of firm-specific information among certain groups of investors. Our results indicate that stock classification has an effect on stock price comovements through increased stock trading correlation among the groups of Islamic investors. The commonality in preferences among holders of Islamic stocks generates commonality in trading activity and in stock liquidity. We find that classifying a stock as an Islamic stock increases its price comovement with other Islamic stocks and also increases its commonality in liquidity.","[Alhomaidi, Asem; Alhassan, Abdulrahman] King Saud Univ, Dept Finance, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Hassan, M.

In addition, it approaches geographic distance through historical ties and kilometer differences, examining their role on the relationship proposed. The sample consists of 245 foreign equity investments concluded between 2002 and 2010 by investors from European Union Member States and 21 non-European Union countries. Results show that institutional distance affects both the entry mode choice and all other framework variables. Furthermore, geographic distance, through historical ties and kilometer differences, emerges as significant factor influencing the various forms of FDI ownership strategy in the case of Turkey.","[Adamoglou, Xanthippe; Kyrkilis, Dimitrios] Univ Macedonia, Dept Balkan Slav & Oriental Studies, 156 Egnatia St, Thessaloniki 54636, Greece",University of Macedonia,"Adamoglou, X (通讯作者)，Univ Macedonia, Dept Balkan Slav & Oriental Studies, 156 Egnatia St, Thessaloniki 54636, Greece.",adamoglou@hotmail.com; kyrkilis@uom.gr,,,,,,,71,1,2,3,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1868-7865,1868-7873,,J KNOWL ECON,J.

Our definition includes multipurpose and single-purpose technologies, defining them according to their micro-technological characteristics, not their macro-economic effects. Identifying technologies as GPTs requires recognizing their evolutionary nature, and accepting possible uncertainties concerning marginal cases. Many of the existing tests' of whether particular technologies are GPTs are based on misunderstandings either of what GPT theory predicts or what such tests can establish. The development of formal GPT theories is outlined, showing that only the early theories predicted the inevitability of GPT-induced showdown and surges. More recent GPT theories, designed to model the characteristics of GPTs, do not imply the necessity of specific macro effects. We show that GPTs can rejuvenate the growth process without causing slowdowns or surges. We conclude that existing criticisms of GPT theory can be resolved and that the concept remains useful for economic theory.","[Bekar, Clifford] Lewis & Clark Univ, Portland, OR USA; [Carlaw, Kenneth] Univ British Columbia Okanagan, Kelowna, BC, Canada; [Lipsey, Richard] Simon Fraser Univ, 1125 26th St W, N Vancouver, BC, Canada",University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia Okanagan; Simon Fraser University,"Lipsey, R (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, 1125 26th St W, N Vancouver, BC, Canada.",bekar@lclark.edu; kenneth.carlaw@ubc.ca; rlipsey@sfu.ca,,,,,,,40,35,37,10,44,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

We examine relationship status, income support and other incomes both before and after separation with a particular focus on the routes into and out of welfare receipt. Exits associated with new partnering are compared with those likely to be due to earnings increases. We find substantial volatility in relationships, with around a third of separations being only temporary (re-partnering with the original partner). Focusing on the permanent separations, we find a convergence in the welfare receipt rates of initially well-off and poor mothers, which is then slowly unwound as more advantaged mothers leave welfare at a faster rate. The channels of welfare exit (finding a new partner versus exiting welfare while remaining single) are associated with different characteristics. Family size is an equally important predictor of exit rates as the age of the youngest child.","[Bradbury, Bruce] Univ New South Wales, Social Policy Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Zhu, Anna] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Carlton, Vic, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Melbourne,"Zhu, A (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst, Carlton, Vic, Australia.",zhu@unimelb.edu.au,"Bradbury, Bruce/AAD-4140-2021; Zhu, Anna/N-7447-2015","Bradbury, Bruce/0000-0002-0718-1399; Zhu, Anna/0000-0002-1671-5428",Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence for Children and Families over the Life Course [CE140100027]; Australian Research Council [LP170100472]; Australian Research Council [LP170100472] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence for Children and Families over the Life Course(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"Welfare Entry and Exit after Marital Separation among Australian Mothers was supported by the Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence for Children and Families over the Life Course (project number CE140100027).

We explore models of expectation formation that can potentially explain why and how survey data deviate from full-information rational expectations.

Originally universities engaged with entrepreneurship mostly in terms of commercializing innovations based on research in the sciences. The new initiatives are instead focused on students and recent alumni, and encompass a much wider set of entrepreneurial initiatives, including student work spaces, accelerators programmes, or industry partnerships. This paper examines these emergent entrepreneurial activities in and around universities, and then asks what the role of government policy is. It argues that any policy approach will have to understand the multi-faceted nature of these new initiatives, and be sensitive to the porous nature of the boundaries between university and private-sector activities.","[Durufle, Gilles] QCC Tech Innovat Platform, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Hellmann, Thomas] Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch, Oxford, England; [Wilson, Karen] OECD, Paris, France; [Wilson, Karen] GV Partners, Paris, France",University of Oxford; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Duruflé, G (通讯作者)，QCC Tech Innovat Platform, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.",gdurufle@quebeccityconference.com; thomas.hellmann@sbs.ox.ac.uk; karen@gvpartners.com,,,,,,,61,7,11,1,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

The two main hypotheses relate to a positive relationship between cultural capital and voluntary work and a significant relationship between relational cultural goods and voluntary work. We corroborate these assumptions empirically by applying a two-stage least squares regression to Italian data at the regional level. The data are drawn from official sources and cover 20 Italian regions over the span of 2005-2013. The results show that volunteering is stimulated by cultural participation in more niche cultural goods and is shared by individuals with some knowledge and human and artistic sensitivity. Moreover, the consumption of specific cultural goods with a strong relational component, such as museums, exhibitions and theatre, has a significant impact on volunteer activity.","[Furia, Donatella; Crociata, Alessandro] Univ G dAnnunzio, Dept Philosoph Pedag & Econ Quantitat Sci, Viale Pindaro 42, I-65127 Pescara, Italy; [Agovino, Massimiliano] Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Econ & Legal Studies, Via Ammiraglio Ferdinando Acton 38, I-80133 Naples, Italy",G d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara; Parthenope University Naples,"Furia, D (通讯作者)，Univ G dAnnunzio, Dept Philosoph Pedag & Econ Quantitat Sci, Viale Pindaro 42, I-65127 Pescara, Italy.",dfuria@unich.it; crociata@gmail.com; agovino.massimo@gmail.com,"Furia, Donatella/AAX-1994-2021","Furia, Donatella/0000-0002-6263-0468",,,,,76,2,2,0,15,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

Evidence from both industry-aggregated data and administrative individual-level data in Japan,JAPAN AND THE WORLD ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Aging; Occupational accident; Administrative individual-level data,WORKPLACE INJURY; HEALTH; RETIREMENT; EMPLOYMENT,"As a result of recent government policies, Japanese firms have a growing number of elderly workers. However, little attention has been given to the various costs of an aging workforce, one of which is an increase in occupational accidents. Based on the industry-aggregated data and publicly available administrative individual-level data from the late 2000s, during which many policies aimed at promoting elderly employment have been implemented, this study investigates whether the probability of having a work-related accident rises with a worker's age and whether injury (or illness) due to an accident is more likely to be fatal when the worker is older. We found a positive and statistically significant impact of a worker's age on the probability of having a work related accident, after controlling for factors such as industry and firm size. We also found that occupational accidents are more likely to cause death to sufferers in their 60 s or later. However, the impact of age on work related accidents has remained almost unchanged throughout the period of our analysis.","[Hasebe, Takuya] Sophia Univ, Fac Liberal Arts, Chiyoda Ku, 7-1 Kioi Cho, Tokyo 1028554, Japan; [Sakai, Tadashi] Hosei Univ, Dept Econ, 4342 Aihara Machi, Machida, Tokyo 1940298, Japan",Sophia University; Hosei University,"Sakai, T (通讯作者)，Hosei Univ, Dept Econ, 4342 Aihara Machi, Machida, Tokyo 1940298, Japan.",t.sakai@hosei.ac.jp,"Hasebe, Takuya/AAF-6303-2021","Hasebe, Takuya/0000-0001-8004-4107",,,,,32,12,13,0,13,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0922-1425,1879-2006,,JPN WORLD ECON,Jpn.

These findings suggest growing interdependence among cryptocurrencies and, by extension, a higher degree of contagion risk. It may be the case that cryptocurrencies are becoming more integrated, albeit this makes for interesting future empirical testing.

The analyses focus on the relationship between insurance purchase and health facility choice based on data drawn from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS). The results show that households from villages that reported use of village clinics are more likely to be insured compared with households from villages that reported use of county hospitals. The results indicate that the perception of quality of care is an important factor affecting people's enrolment decisions. The NRCMS is expected to help patients obtain better quality health services from higher tier of the healthcare system that are unaffordable otherwise. However, given the prevailing fee for -service payment mechanism for health care, the insurance may also drive up the healthcare cost and direct patients to use more expensive and unnecessary hospital care.","[Yang, Miaoqing] Univ Lancaster, Sch Management, Dept Econ, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England; [Yang, Miaoqing] RAND Europe, Westbrook Ctr, Milton Rd, Cambridge CB4 1YG, England",Lancaster University; RAND Corporation; RAND Europe,"Yang, MQ (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Sch Management, Dept Econ, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England.;Yang, MQ (通讯作者)，RAND Europe, Westbrook Ctr, Milton Rd, Cambridge CB4 1YG, England.",myang@rand.org,,"Yang, Miaoqing/0000-0001-7975-374X","Lancaster University Management School; Carolina Population Center [P2C HD050924, T32 HD007168]; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; NIH [R01-HD30880, DK056350, R24 HD050924, R01-HD38700]; NIH Fogarty International Center [D43 TW009077, D43 TW007709]; China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Ministry of Health; National Institute for Nutrition and Health, China Center for Disease Control and Prevention","Lancaster University Management School; Carolina Population Center; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NIH Fogarty International Center(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC)); China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Ministry of Health; National Institute for Nutrition and Health, China Center for Disease Control and Prevention","Special thanks to Prof. Bruce Hollingsworth and Prof. Colin Green for their valuable encouragements and insightful comments on the draft of this paper.

However, micro-entrepreneurs often undersave, even when they have some surplus and the desire to save. Knowledge gaps and behavioural biases such as limited attention have been discussed as potential constraints on saving. To test ways to alleviate such constraints, we offered a 4-hour financial literacy training and periodic SMS reminders for 3 months to a randomly selected group of micro-entrepreneurs in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. We particularly compared the joint treatment to the two treatments in isolation for the first time in the literature. We find that SMS reminders increased savings relative to no treatment, and that the combination of reminders and financial training improved the financial literacy score and increased short-term deposits in the bank. Our results confirm earlier findings that savings can be limited by attention, and that financial literacy matters for saving behaviour when saving is at the top of the mind.","[Abebe, Girum; Tekle, Biruk] Ethiopian Dev Res Inst, Addis Ababa 2479, Ethiopia; [Mano, Yukichi] Hitotsubashi Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Tokyo 1868601, Japan",Hitotsubashi University,"Mano, Y (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Tokyo 1868601, Japan.",yukichi.mano@gmail.com,"Abebe, Girum/V-4986-2019","Abebe, Girum/0000-0001-8335-3028",African Capacity Building Foundation (ACBF); Canada's Think Thank Initiative-International Development Research Centre (TTI-IDRC),African Capacity Building Foundation (ACBF); Canada's Think Thank Initiative-International Development Research Centre (TTI-IDRC),"We thank Yutaka Arimoto, Nick Bloom, Stefano Caria, Pascaline Dupas, Marcel Fafchamps, Taiji Furusawa, Yuki Higuchi, Jota Ishikawa, Dean Karlan, Yuya Kudo, Takashi Kurosaki, Qing Liu, Keijiro Otsuka, Owen Ozier, Saumik Paul, Simon Quinn, Yasuyuki Sawada, Daniela Scur, Masahiro Shoji, Tetsushi Sonobe, Yoichi Sugita, Aya Suzuki, Kazushi Takahashi, Yoshito Takasaki and Yasuyuki Todo for their useful comments.

Our model, which identifies the effect of quality on trade that arises on the demand side, through the relationship between income and quality choice, predicts that a negative income shock disproportionately reduces the demand for higher relative to lower quality traded goods (a flight from quality). Using a unique dataset of firm-level wine exports for an emerging market economy, Argentina, combined with experts wine ratings as a measure of quality, we find strong evidence of a flight from quality as we show that the values, volumes, unit values, and markups of higher quality exports contracted more sharply during the crisis.

The level of the decoupling between labor productivity and real hourly compensation is highest in the U.S. and Japan and lowest in Norway and Germany. This study investigates the great decoupling phenomena between 1950 and 2014 for eight economies with available time series data. The results should assist policy makers in developing efficient wage-setting mechanisms and help researchers in the field of wage moderation policy and the great decoupling. For this purpose we use fractional integration and cointegration techniques. Countries with stagnating minimum wages, rigid wage moderation policy and a high level of technological progress (strong total factor productivity growth) register higher wage stagnation in relation to labor productivity. Policy makers should be extremely careful when using wage moderation policy to improve a country's competitiveness and should monitor the wage stagnation behind labor productivity (great decoupling) since workers have been producing more but receiving significantly less since 1980. The great decoupling is more prominent today and it is constantly increasing not just in the U.S. and Japan but worldwide.","[Gil-Alana, Luis A.] Univ Navarra, Fac Econ, E-31080 Pamplona, Spain; [Gil-Alana, Luis A.] Univ Navarra, ICS NDID, E-31080 Pamplona, Spain; [Skare, Marinko] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkov, Preradoviceva 1-1, Pula 52100, Croatia",University of Navarra; University of Navarra; University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Gil-Alana, LA (通讯作者)，Univ Navarra, Fac Econ, E-31080 Pamplona, Spain.;Gil-Alana, LA (通讯作者)，Univ Navarra, ICS NDID, E-31080 Pamplona, Spain.",alana@unav.es; mskare@unipu.hr,"Škare, Marinko/L-5504-2019","Škare, Marinko/0000-0001-6426-3692; Gil-Alana, Luis/0000-0002-5760-3123",Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2014-55236],Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government),Prof. Luis A.

Use of a local agent allows the multinational to avoid costly mistakes by finding out if the market is large enough to support direct investment. However, the agent is able to extract information rents from the multinational due to being better informed about market characteristics.

The USA, with a flexible labour market, has the highest job mobility, so mismatches for workers' jobs in terms of educational attainment are resolved via job mobility. In contrast, in Korea, which has a dual-structure labour market where workers have limited job mobility between core and periphery sectors, the likelihood of being mismatched increases. In Germany, the educational system, which emphasises job training, makes it possible to resolve or extinguish mismatches via job mobility only for the youth; while job mobility does not help resolve mismatches in any other age groups. These findings indicate that the different patterns in job mobility resolving mismatches over the three countries may not only stem from the efficacy of job information systems or from reducing friction in the labour market but may also be an interactive outcome of various labour market institutions affecting flexibility, such as stratification or job competency.","[Jeong, Yeasung] Sungkyunkwan Univ, HRD Ctr, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Ayoung] Korea Inst Hlth & Social Affairs, Seoul, South Korea; [Cho, Joonmo] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Cho, J (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",kidwave@naver.com; ay3646@naver.com; trustcho@skku.edu,,,,,,,51,3,4,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

We match this novel mood index with trading data of German individual investors. We find that when mood is positive, investors purchase more, particularly trading into risky and out of less-risky securities. To proxy for household attitudes towards the economy, we use an already existing index (FEARS), which bases on Google search volumes of negative economic terms. We find that FEARS drives trading in the same fashion as in previous studies and that these effects significantly depend on mood.

Does opening to trade change the benefits of a progressive tax system? We answer these question within a standard incomplete markets model with frictional labor markets and Ricardian trade. Consistent with empirical evidence, adverse shocks to comparative advantage lead to labor income losses for import-competition-exposed workers: with incomplete markets, these workers are imperfectly insured and experience welfare losses. A progressive tax system is valuable, as it substitutes for imperfect insurance and redistributes the gains from trade. However, it also reduces the incentives for labor to reallocate away from comparatively disadvantaged locations. We find that optimal progressivity should increase with openness to trade with a ten percentage point increase in openness necessitating a five percentage point increase in marginal tax rates for those at the top of the income distribution.

This allows me to determine the extent that remittances received via mobile money are shared within villages, creating wider benefits to the community.

We contend that the channel of liberty-to-innovation is the most critical channel in which democracy holds a unique advantage over autocracy in promoting growth, especially during the stage of growth via innovation. Our theory thus predicts that democracy holds a positive but indirect effect upon growth via the channel of liberty-to-innovation, conditioned by the level of economic development. We then present quantitative evidence for our theory. To our best knowledge, we are the first to propose such an indirect and conditional effect of democracy upon economic development and provide systematic evidence. Our study promises to integrate and reconcile many seemingly unrelated and often contradictory theories and evidence regarding regime and growth, including providing a possible explanation for the inconclusive results from regressing overall regime score against the rate of economic growth or change in level of GDP per capita.","[Tang, Shiping] Fudan Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Tang, Rui] Jinan Univ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Fudan University; Jinan University,"Tang, SP (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",twukong@yahoo.com,,,Academic Excellence grant (2017-2020) from Fudan University,Academic Excellence grant (2017-2020) from Fudan University,This research has been supported by an Academic Excellence grant (2017-2020) from Fudan University to Shiping Tang.,,78,20,21,2,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,NOV,2018,71.0,4,,,,,642,666,,10.1111/kykl.12184,0.0,,,25,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GW5QR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000446991700006,0

As such, it provides some of the first empirical evidence on the relationship between cognition and subjective well-being of older individuals in Europe.","[Zikos, Vasileios] Univ Thai Chamber Commerce, RIPED, 126-1 Vibhavadee Rangsit Rd, Bangkok 10400, Thailand; Univ Thai Chamber Commerce, Sch Econ, 126-1 Vibhavadee Rangsit Rd, Bangkok 10400, Thailand",University Thai Chamber Commerce; University Thai Chamber Commerce,"Zikos, V (通讯作者)，Univ Thai Chamber Commerce, RIPED, 126-1 Vibhavadee Rangsit Rd, Bangkok 10400, Thailand.",V.Zikos@riped.utcc.ac.th,"Kesavayuth, Dusanee/AAR-7084-2020","Kesavayuth, Dusanee/0000-0002-7398-8908","European Commission through the 5th Framework Programme [QLK6-CT-2001-00360]; European Commission through the 6th Framework Programme [SHARE-I3, RII-CT-2006-062193, CIT5-CT-2005-028857, CIT4-CT-2006-028812]; European Commission through the 7th Framework Programme [211909, 227822, 261982]; U.S. National Institute on Aging [U01 AG09740-13S2, P01AG005842, P01 AG08291, P30 AG12815, R21AG025169, Y1-AG-4553-01, IAG BSR06-11, OGHA 04-064]; German Ministry of Education and Research; University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce; Interreg [SHARE] Funding Source: Interreg",European Commission through the 5th Framework Programme; European Commission through the 6th Framework Programme(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); European Commission through the 7th Framework Programme(European Union (EU)); U.S. National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); German Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce; Interreg(Interreg Europe),"We would like to thank Nattavudh Powdthavee (the Editor) and two anonymous referees.

This paper quantifies foreign competition threats by exploiting news of potential multinational investments from over 35,000 media outlets around the world. Using firm-specific measures of foreign competition threat, the analysis shows that domestic firms respond by upgrading productivity, raising innovation, and altering product composition. However, there is a U-shape relationship between initial productivity and productivity growth where the right and left tails upgrade productivity through innovation and product dropping, respectively. These responses constitute an economically important source of gains and convey new implications for the timing of economic policies.","[Bao, Cathy Ge] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Qiuzhen Hall 427,10 Huixin East St, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Chen, Maggie Xiaoyang] George Washington Univ, 2115 G St NW,Suite 367, Washington, DC 20052 USA",University of International Business & Economics; George Washington University,"Bao, CG (通讯作者)，Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Qiuzhen Hall 427,10 Huixin East St, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",baoge@uibe.edu.cn; xchen@gwu.edu,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71703021]; Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities at UIBE [16QN03],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities at UIBE,"We are very grateful to Nick Bloom, Jonathan Eaton, Amit Khandelwal, Bill Lincoln, Aaditya Mattoo, Marc Melitz, Patricia Tovar, Stephen Yeaple, and session and seminar participants at the World Bank, American Economic Association Meeting, XIV Annual Conference of the Euro-Latin Study Network on Integration and Trade, University of Texas at Austin, and Washington Area International Trade Symposium for very helpful comments and suggestions.

First, we examine decompositions of the mismatch wage gap, finding that characteristics explain less than half of the mismatch penalty. Second, we use unconditional quantile regression to examine the mismatch penalty across the earnings distribution, showing that the penalty shrinks as the position in the earnings distribution increases. Third, we decompose the differentials using quantile decompositions. Different reasons for mismatch show heterogeneity in our results, with larger penalties for being mismatched due to working conditions, location, family, and no available job.","[Bender, Keith A.] Univ Aberdeen, Dept Econ, Dunbar St, Aberdeen AB24 3QY, Scotland; [Bender, Keith A.] Univ Aberdeen, Ctr European Labour Market Res, Dunbar St, Aberdeen AB24 3QY, Scotland; [Roche, Kristen] Mt Mary Univ, Business Adm Dept, 2900 North Menomonee River Pkwy, Milwaukee, WI 53222 USA",University of Aberdeen; University of Aberdeen,"Bender, KA (通讯作者)，Univ Aberdeen, Dept Econ, Dunbar St, Aberdeen AB24 3QY, Scotland.;Bender, KA (通讯作者)，Univ Aberdeen, Ctr European Labour Market Res, Dunbar St, Aberdeen AB24 3QY, Scotland.",kabender@abdn.ac.uk; rochek@mtmary.edu,"Bender, Keith/AAF-6225-2020","Bender, Keith/0000-0001-9409-3129",,,,,22,4,4,2,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

P.; Schivardi, Fabiano",,,The productivity puzzle and misallocation: an Italian perspective,ECONOMIC POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,FIRM-LEVEL; TRADE; CHINA; EFFICIENCY; IMPACT; PANEL; TFP,"Productivity has recently slowed down in many economies around the world. A crucial challenge in understanding what lies behind this 'productivity puzzle' is the still short time span for which data can be analysed. An exception is Italy, where productivity growth started to stagnate 25 years ago. The Italian case can therefore offer useful insights to understand the global productivity slowdown. We find that resource misallocation has played a sizeable role in slowing down Italian productivity growth. If misallocation had remained at its 1995 level, in 2013 Italy's aggregate productivity would have been 18% higher than its actual level. Misallocation has mainly risen within sectors rather than between them, increasing more in sectors where the world technological frontier has expanded faster. Relative specialization in those sectors explains the patterns of misallocation across geographical areas and firm size classes. The broader message is that an important part of the explanation of the productivity puzzle may lie in the rising difficulty of reallocating resources across firms within sectors where technology is changing faster rather than between sectors with different speeds of technological change.","[Calligaris, Sara] OECD, Paris, France; EIEF, Rome, Italy; Univ G dAnnunzio, Pescara, Italy; CRENoS, Cagliari, Italy; Bank Italy, CEP, Rome, Italy; Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; London Sch Econ, London, England; Univ Bocconi Milan CEP, Milan, Italy; CEPR, Washington, DC USA; LUISS, EIEF, Rome, Italy",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); G d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara; European Central Bank; Bank of Italy; Trinity College Dublin; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Luiss Guido Carli University,"Calligaris, S (通讯作者)，OECD, Paris, France.",,"Del Gatto, Massimo/ABG-4159-2021; Hassan, Fadi/AAL-2047-2021","Del Gatto, Massimo/0000-0002-3261-8038",Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs (DG ECFIN) of the European Commission; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs (DG ECFIN) of the European Commission; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We thank the editor Tommaso Monacelli, four anonymous referees, and our discussants, Alberto Martin and Kurt Mitman, for detailed feedback that greatly improved the paper.

The paper combines VAR model together with the Random Forest technique to provide a novel framework which overcome some weaknesses in VAR modelling and help in the selection of oil-risk factors considered. Our results in general show that the response of sectoral stocks to changes in oil-risk factors is not homogenous and their sensitivities are not uniform across BRICS markets. Stock returns of Basic Materials, Financials and Industrials sectors show consistently negative sensitivity to crude oil volatility (OVX) and oil price shocks for major oil importers, whereas sectoral stocks among major oil exporters seems to demonstrate systematic pattern. To explain sectoral stock variations, the results reveal OVX and oil to be the most significant risk transmitting factors in BRICS, irrespective of whether the market is a major oil importer or exporter. However, our results also confirm the presence of asymmetric effects in sectoral stocks for Brazil and Russia while no such evidence is found for India, China and South Africa. Overall, the findings suggest that the manner in which sectors respond to fluctuations in oil-risk factors varies between different sectors and it depends on the oil characteristics of the markets, nature of sectors and the type of oil-risk factors considered.

In our setup, the actual probability of the good outcome (a win) can be determined based on computer simulations from any point in the process. We compare this actual probability to the subjective probability stated by participants at three different points in each of six races. In line with previous research in which participants have direct access to actual probabilities, we find that the inverse S-shaped curve relating subjective to actual probabilities is also evident in our far more complex situation, and that there is only a limited degree of learning through repeated play. We show that the model in the inverse S-shaped function family that provides the best fit to our data is Prelec's 1998 conditional invariant model. We also find that individuals who report a greater degree of ambiguity are more pessimistic and less responsive to actual changes in real probabilities. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Food insecurity, health status, crime, poor behavior and test scores track these cycles. This paper leverages new data from the USDA-the FoodAPS survey-to better understand these cycles in three ways. First, I find that expenditure and consumption cycles are correlated within households-a fact not previously established. Second, I study diet quality over the benefit month, and find that it worsens, potentially compounding the harmful consequences of cyclical food insecurity. Third, I find that kids bear less of the burden of the consumption cycle than adults, and that much of this difference may be driven by school-meal programs. This finding suggests large potential gains in child welfare from expanding summer meal programs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Instead, the natural demand for institutions that protect property rights has led to the emergence of alternative, inefficient institutions such as that of cronyism - the practice of appointing personal acquaintances of the political leader to key positions. A political leader not constrained by institutions appoints cronies, as competent subordinates are more prone to switching allegiance to a potential challenger. As competence makes a bigger difference in a rule-based environment, such a leader has no interest in any institutional development. In a simple empirical exercise, using a dataset that covers the richest Russians, we find a positive and significant effect of direct connections to the personal circle of President Putin on the wealth of businessmen. The magnitude of the effect varies at different levels of rents available for redistribution and network centrality of a businessman': it is higher during the years of high oil prices, but is attenuated by the prominence of the businessman in the network.","[Lamberova, Natalia] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Sonin, Konstantin] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of Chicago,"Lamberova, N (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",natalam@ucla.edu; ksonin@uchicago.edu,"Sonin, Konstantin/Q-5660-2019; Sonin, Konstantin/C-1146-2014","Sonin, Konstantin/0000-0003-1581-9951;",,,,,32,18,20,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

One option is to pay a single price for biomass collected field-side (processor collection). Another is to pay a single price for biomass at the plant gate (supplier delivery). The literature in this area is relatively young, but there is a sense that the evolution of contracting and pricing structures will dictate the industry's success, and ultimately the costs of producing biofuels from dedicated and non-dedicated energy crops. We examine the collection and pricing choices for a cost-minimizing cellulosic biofuel processor, who initially has monopsony power in feedstock procurement in their collection area. We derive optimal prices, total expenditures on feedstocks, and the collection areas required to meet a processor's fixed input needs. We show that while societal welfare is greatest under supplier delivery; however, the processor will be indifferent between supplier delivery and processor collection unless they are concerned about entry of a competing processor. When this is the case, the processor can use the processor-collection mechanism as an effective deterrent to entry. Numerical simulation based on corn stover for biomass is used to illustrate optimal pricing and the extent of biomass collection areas for different procurement and pricing strategies. We use these findings to calculate the rates at which collection costs increase for a monopsonistic stover processor constrained to a defined procurement area, as might emerge as the industry moves toward commercialization. The derived marginal cost curve for a monopsonistic processor of stover is compared with the marginal cost curve across alternative feedstocks. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We first develop a small open economy general equilibrium model with credit constraints. In our model, constrained firms respond to real depreciations and appreciations in an asymmetric way, and exchange rate volatility reduces their exports on average. The effect of exchange rate volatility on unconstrained firms' exports, however, is ambiguous. Overall, exchange rate volatility has a more negative impact on constrained firms. In a large sector-level bilateral trade dataset, we find robust empirical evidence supporting the predictions of the model. We show that financially more constrained sectors have a more negative exposure of their trade volumes to exchange rate volatility. Moreover, the estimated trade effects of exchange rate volatility vary substantially across sectors and can be either positive or negative depending on the degree of credit constraints.

This paper examines patterns in overeducation between countries using a specifically designed panel data set constructed from the quarterly Labour Force Surveys of 28 EU countries over a 12- to 15-year period. It is not the case that overeducation has been rising rapidly over time in all countries, and where overeducation has grown, the trend has been very gradual. Furthermore, overeducation rates were found to be static or falling in approximately 50% of the 28 EU countries. The evidence points towards convergence in overeducation at a rate of 3.3% per annum. In terms of the determinants of overeducation we find evidence to support policies aimed at improving effective female participation, labour market flexibility and the practical aspects of educational provision as a means of reducing the incidence of overeducation within countries.","[McGuinness, Seamus] ESRI, Whitaker Sq, Dublin, Ireland; [McGuinness, Seamus] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Bergin, Adele; Whelan, Adele] Trinity Coll Dublin, ESRI, Dept Econ, Dublin, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); IZA Institute Labor Economics; Trinity College Dublin; Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI),"McGuinness, S (通讯作者)，ESRI, Whitaker Sq, Dublin, Ireland.;McGuinness, S (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.",Seamus.McGuinness@esri.ie,,"mcguinness, seamus/0000-0003-1729-3017","European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration [613256]","European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration(European Union (EU))","This work was supported by funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration [613256].",,30,28,29,3,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

These individual experiences are matched with outcomes observed in the survey about 20years later to examine their correlation with unemployment at the time of the transition. We find that becoming unemployed in the early 1990s correlates significantly with income, assets and a number of measures of well-being recorded in 2007 and 2012. Using plant closures to reflect exogenous changes to labour market status at the time of the transition, we are able to confirm the causal effect of unemployment on income and house ownership 20years later, but find no evidence for a long-term causal relationship between unemployment and such measures of well-being as life satisfaction, depression and subjective assessment of material conditions.","[Myck, Michal; Oczkowska, Monika] Ctr Econ Anal, Szczecin, Poland",,"Myck, M (通讯作者)，Ctr Econ Anal, Szczecin, Poland.",mmyck@cenea.org.pl; moczkowska@cenea.org.pl,"Myck, Michal/ABA-7136-2021","Myck, Michal/0000-0002-9894-838X; Oczkowska, Monika/0000-0001-7252-838X",Polish National Science Centre [2015/17/B/HS4/01018],Polish National Science Centre,"We acknowledge the support of the Polish National Science Centre through project no. 2015/17/B/HS4/01018.

We examine structures of networks on the Internet Dark Net (Virtual) and compare it to network structures of traditional black markets (Ground), using agent-based modeling. The purpose of modeling these two different types of illicit markets is to understand the network structure that emerges from the interactions of the agents in each environment. Traditional black markets are relatively hierarchical, with high degree and high betweenness. We compare the density and average length of the shortest path of the simulated Ground black market networks with our simulated Virtual network. We find that hierarchy and monopolization tendencies in networks are products of different transaction costs and information asymmetries. The Internet is an effective way to lower multiple aspects of network structure.

Second, provided that products differ in quality levels, in horizontal levels, and in terms of marginal costs, a rise in the difference in horizontal levels will enhance the superiority of a specific tax over an ad valorem tax. Third, the above two results remain valid, regardless of whether the mode of competition is Cournot or Bertrand.

It is however recognized that the pay schemes utilized in many real-life situations generally depart from this value. We propose a non-parametric approach to testing the empirical content of this concept with limited datasets. We introduce the Shapley distance, which, for a fixed monotone transferable-utility game, measures the distance of an arbitrary pay profile to the Shapley pay profile, and show that it is additively decomposable into the violations of the classical Shapley axioms. The analysis has several applications. In particular, it can be used to assess the extent to which an income distribution can be considered fair or unfair, and whether any particular case of unfairness is due to the violation of one or a combination of the Shapley axioms.

While this effect has been established previously, the novelty of this paper is to show that the effect propagates both directly and indirectly, through working conditions and work quality. Accounting for this indirect effect allows to obtain the effect of the contractual status on job satisfaction that is substantially larger in magnitude as compared to simple direct effects, confirming the importance of accounting for unobservable individual, company-specific, and job-specific heterogeneity when addressing this relationship. Moreover, the extent of co-determination of poorer working conditions and temporary contractual status, as well as the resulting bias in estimating only a direct effect of temporary employment on job satisfaction without accounting for such co-determination, vary depending on a country setting. It is shown that in transition economies, this co-determination is larger than in non-transition economies, possibly because of the workers' weaker bargaining power, strategic use of temporary employment to circumvent labor regulations, the absence of regulations prescribing equal treatment of workers with different contractual arrangements, or lack of compliance with such regulations.","[Aleksynska, Mariya] Int Labor Org, 4 Route Morillons, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland",,"Aleksynska, M (通讯作者)，Int Labor Org, 4 Route Morillons, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.",aleksynska@ilo.org,,,,,,,57,27,31,1,55,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0147-5967,1095-7227,,J COMP ECON,J.

In a widely-used version, a regression for log consumption calibrates a PMT score based on covariates, which is then implemented for targeting out-of-sample. The performance of various PMT methods is assessed using data for nine African countries. Standard PMTs help filter out the non-poor, but exclude many poor people, thus diminishing the impact on poverty. Poverty-focused econometric methods such as using quantile regression generally do better. We also characterize the optimal informationally-feasible solution for poverty targeting and compare it to econometric methods. Even with a budget sufficient to eliminate poverty with full information, none of the targeting methods studied bring the poverty rate below about three-quarters of its initial value. The prevailing methods are particularly deficient in reaching the poorest. A basic-income scheme or transfers using a simple demographic scorecard often do as well, or even better, in reducing poverty.","[Brown, Caitlin] Cent European Univ, Budapest, Hungary; [Brown, Caitlin; Ravallion, Martin] Georgetown Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [van de Walle, Dominique] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Central European University; Georgetown University; The World Bank,"Ravallion, M (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",mr1185@georgetown.edu,,"Brown, Caitlin/0000-0001-7322-8389",World Banks Strategic Research Program,World Banks Strategic Research Program,"For their comments the authors thank Arthur Alik-Lagrange, Kathleen Beegle, Mary Ann Bronson, Raphael Calel, Phillippe Leite, Xavier Gabaix, Essama Nssah, Mead Over, Mark Schreiner, Don Sillers, Adam Wagstaff and seminar participants at Aix-Marseille School of Economics, Georgetown University, the International Monetary Fund, the Paris School of Economics, Trinity College Dublin, University of Califomia, Riverside, and the World Bank.

However, little is known about whether such influence remains after they have left the group. Using a modified dictator game and a structural choice-revealed preference approach, we measure an individual's preferences before and after face-to-face interactions in a small group and then examine whether a change in preferences is observed after subjects have left the group and have to make their decisions alone. We find that social interactions do indeed change individuals' preferences. Specifically, individuals whose preferences are extremely egoistic and also unchanging tend to influence others the most.

The more striking finding is that the stagnation of real wages has played a more important role than demographics in the deterioration of the system's finances.

Consistent with the happiness results, we also find that relative to Catholics, Protestants and non-believers, those of Eastern Orthodox religion have less social capital and prefer old ideas and safe jobs. In addition, Orthodoxy is associated with left-leaning political preferences and stronger support for government involvement in the economy. Compared to non-believers and Orthodox adherents, Catholics and Protestants are less likely to agree that government ownership is a good thing, and Protestants are less likely to agree that getting rich can only happen at the expense of others. These differences in life satisfaction and other attitudes and values persisted despite the fact that communist elites sought to eradicate church-going in Eastern Europe, since communists maintained many aspects of Orthodox theology which were useful for the advancement of the communist doctrine. The findings are consistent with Berdyaev's (1933, 1937) hypothesis of communism as a successor of Orthodoxy.","[Djankov, Simeon] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England; [Djankov, Simeon] Peter G Peterson Inst Int Econ, Washington, DC USA; [Nikolova, Elena] Cent European Labor Studies Inst, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Nikolova, Elena] Leibniz Inst East & Southeast European Studies, Regensburg, Germany; [Nikolova, Elena] UCL, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Peterson Institute for International Economics; Leibniz Institut fur Ost und Sudosteuropaforschung; University of London; University College London,"Djankov, S (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England.",S.Djankov@lse.ac.uk; e.nikolova@ucl.ac.uk,"Nikolova, Elena/HKN-1043-2023","Nikolova, Elena/0000-0002-6924-5415; Nikolova, Elena/0000-0001-9566-1167; Djankov, Simeon/0000-0002-0822-6456",UCL Centre for Comparative Studies of Emerging Economies,UCL Centre for Comparative Studies of Emerging Economies,"We would like to thank Sergei Guriev, Olena Nizalova, Marcus Noland, Jakub Polansky, Nicolas Veron, Andrei Shleifer, seminar participants at Leibniz IOS-Regensburg, anonymous referees, and participants at the conference People Matter: Quality of Life in Post Transition Economies for useful comments.

School-level policies have played a leading role in recent school reforms in many countries, but there is no straightforward empirical evidence for how they affect pupils' outcomes and the equality of educational outcomes. Our findings show that that only some school policies intensify the Family Background Effect - (educational equity) and affect student outcomes (educational efficiency) simultaneously. We find that competitive schools are able to screen students by selecting higher socio-economic status parents, which mainly harms equity without having much effect on efficiency. There are some policies which allow some trade-off between aforementioned objectives, mainly policies related to management schools. (C) 2017 The Society for Policy Modeling.

We use a transparent empirical strategy, deploying previously unused daily data and exploiting two largely unexpected shocks which involved substantial variation in policies and institutions, providing a rare natural experiment. Allende's election and subsequent socialist experiment decreased share values, while the military coup and dictatorship that replaced him boosted them, in both cases by magnitudes unprecedented in the literature. The most parsimonious interpretation of these share price changes is that they reflected, respectively, the perceived threat to private ownership of the means of production under a socialist government, and its subsequent reversal.","[Girardi, Daniele] Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Bowles, Samuel] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA; [Bowles, Samuel] CORE, Santa Fe, NM USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; The Santa Fe Institute,"Girardi, D (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",dgirardi@umass.edu; samuel.bowles@gmail.com,"Girardi, Daniele/ABC-2097-2020","Girardi, Daniele/0000-0002-3423-3174",'Dynamics of Wealth Inequality Project' of the Santa Fe Institute Behavioral Sciences Program,'Dynamics of Wealth Inequality Project' of the Santa Fe Institute Behavioral Sciences Program,"We are grateful to Manuel Agosin, Ann Dube, Manuel Garcia, Oscar Landerretche, Juan Antonio Montecino, Suresh Naidu, Peter Skott, Barbara Stallings, Elizabeth Jean Wood, two anonymous referees and our editor at the JDE Gerard Padro i Miguel, and participants to the Fall 2017 Political Economy Workshop at the University of Massachusetts Amherst for comments and suggestions on previous drafts of this paper.

To examine the underlying transmission channels we take a closer look at the sources of income, i.e. labor and capital income.

In this paper, we study how to fairly distribute the benefit of the APG to its member countries by focusing on the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), which includes Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam. Using data from two different years, 2012 and 2020, we analyze 12 scenarios with different combinations of the generation and the transmission capacities together with the maximum percentage of power trade allowed. We propose to allocate the total cost saving of the GMS by using the Myerson (1977) value. We show that the resulting Myerson value allocation from the 2020 plan satisfies two stability properties: (1) core stability, which implies that it belongs to the core when the core is nonempty, so that no country has an incentive to leave the APG, and (2) pairwise stability, which implies that no country has an incentive to add a new transmission line or delete an existing transmission line.

It is therefore an important theme for analysis to deepen discussions related to reducing regional fertility disparities by increasing fertility through the implementation of comprehensive childcare support policies, which might facilitate the striking of a balance between child-rearing and work, even in highly populated regions. As described herein, we constructed a simple theoretical two-region overlapping generations (OLG) with attention explicitly devoted to population density and land price. Using this theoretical setup, we analyzed how the fertility rate is affected by population density and land prices. Our findings are as follows. First, considering congestion costs, the fertility rate is depressed by high population density. However, childcare services might mitigate such effects. Second, enriching regional childcare services raises the relative population density of its region. Third, the optimal regional tax rate to finance childcare services is independent of other regions' regional tax rates and childcare services. Therefore, adopting an optimal regional tax rate is a dominant strategy. (c) 2018 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We hypothesized that financially literate people are more able to earn income and accumulate assets, leading them to have a less anxious life in old age. On the other hand, less financially literate people rely more on social security to secure themselves in the old age as they are not able to accumulate sufficient assets. By using US survey data, we provide evidence that assets significantly reduce anxiety about life in old age only for people who are more financially literate. For less financially literate people, social security plays an important role in reducing anxiety about life in old age. Besides these, having a child and doing regular exercise also reduced anxiety for all respondents but marital status reduced anxiety in respondents over 40 years of age.

With a broad definition of radical political economics, we can continue to address problems of hegemony and inequality, which are as important today as they were fifty years ago.","[Kim, Marlene] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, 100 Morrissey Blvd, Boston, MA 02125 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston,"Kim, M (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, 100 Morrissey Blvd, Boston, MA 02125 USA.",Marlene.Kim@umb.edu,,,,,,,5,3,3,0,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

A loyal employee, strongly associated with the organization, is its valuable asset. On the other hand, in the dynamically changing reality, organizations more often use the alternative, flexible forms of employment, which are not only a response to the needs of the organization, but also employees themselves. Purpose of the article: The purpose of the paper is to examine the relationship between employee loyalty to the employer and the form of employment. Methods: The paper presents the results of research conducted by means of a diagnostic survey with the use of a questionnaire among 569 employees of manufacturing and service enterprises operating on the Polish market. Empirical data were collected from December 2015 to January 2016. The research process was based on the grounded theory and statistical analyses were conducted by means of the SPSS, assuming the level of significance at 0.05. In order to compare people with the different forms of employment, the Kruskal-Wallis test was used. Findings & Value added: The research results indicated that there arc certain relationships between the form of employment and loyalty to the employer. A majority of the respondents believed that the form of employment influences the loyalty to the employer. A majority also rated the degree of their own loyalty to the employer high. Employees working under an indefinite duration employment contract rated the impact of the current form of employment on loyalty to the employer higher than people that have a fixed-term employment contract. The people that have an indefinite duration employment contract rated the degree of their own n loyalty to the employer higher than people that have a fixed-term employment contract.","[Kot-Radojewska, Magdalena] Univ WSB, Dabrowa Gornicza, Poland; [Timenko, Iryna V.] Kyiv Int Univ, Kiev, Ukraine",,"Kot-Radojewska, M (通讯作者)，Univ WSB, Fac Appl Sci, Ul Cieplaka 1c, PL-41300 Dabrowa Gornicza, Poland.",mkot@wsb.edu.pl,,"Kot-Radojewska, Magdalena/0000-0002-7323-1913",,,,,46,18,21,3,25,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

In addition, negative returns are significant, but the effects of jumps and their intensity (probability) appear to not be significant during the in-sample period. Second, the out-of-sample results statistically support that our proposed models are able to achieve higher forecast accuracy than that of the benchmark in both the statistical and economic senses, especially when including the combination of significant jumps and jump intensity.

Credit constraints are derived from incentive constraints in optimal contracts which ensure default never occurs in equilibrium. Stock price bubbles can emerge through a positive feedback loop mechanism and cannot be ruled out by transversality conditions.

We also considered the UK position from the net oil exporter to net oil importer and implications of the Global Financial Crises. Employing a Time-Varying Vector Auto-regressive framework on monthly data from January 1990 to June 2015 in which the sources of time variation were both the coefficients and variance-covariance matrix of the innovations, this study found that historically oil price shocks have negatively affected the stock market, however the energy sector stock has always responded positively holding their title as hedge against oil shocks. It was also found that the shift from net oil exporter to net oil importer did not influence the association between the UK, stock market and oil shocks much. Including the discrete break and subsampling of series led to controlling for the prior beliefs and agent's behaviour in the Pre-GFC period. It turned out that the GFC had been a game changer and the stock market as well as the energy sector showed a positive and symmetric response to oil shocks. These findings have profound implications in terms of depressed global aggregate demand and oil shocks dynamics in the Post-GFC world.","[Nasir, Muhammad Ali; Rizvi, Sabin Abass] Leeds Beckett Univ, Fac Business & Law, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Rossi, Matted] Univ Sannio, Dept Econ, Benevento, Italy",Leeds Beckett University; University of Sannio,"Nasir, MA (通讯作者)，Leeds Beckett Univ, Fac Business & Law, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",,"Nasir, Muhammad Ali/I-6252-2019; Rossi, Matteo/AAC-3929-2019","Nasir, Muhammad Ali/0000-0003-2779-5854; Rossi, Matteo/0000-0002-3669-7976",,,,,109,34,34,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

To demonstrate this, I develop a new model of international trade that incorporates fixed costs of exporting and firm heterogeneity within a perfectly competitive framework. In this setting, despite the fact that there are no preexisting distortions, the optimal tariff is positive even for a small country with no world market power. In the limit, as either firm heterogeneity or the fixed costs of exporting vanish, the optimal tariff approaches zero.","[Sharma, Rishi R.] Colgate Univ, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA",Colgate University,"Sharma, RR (通讯作者)，Colgate Univ, Dept Econ, 13 Oak Dr, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA.",rsharma1@colgate.edu,,,,,,,22,1,1,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

I model the financial sector as a large number of investors divided into different groups, which I interpret as financial institutions, and a large number of dealers. Financial institutions and dealers trade assets in an OTC market a la Duffie et al. (2005) and Lagos and Rocheteau (2009). Investors receive privately observed preference shocks, and financial institutions use the balanced team mechanism, proposed by Athey and Segal (2013), to implement an efficient risk-sharing arrangement among their investors. When the market is liquid, in the sense that search and bargaining are small frictions, I show that the economy is likely to have a unique equilibrium and, therefore, is not fragile. When these frictions are severe, a run equilibrium exists-investors announce low valuation of assets because they believe everyone else in their financial institution is doing the same. Conditional on bank runs existing, the welfare impact of the search friction is ambiguous. During runs, trade is inefficient, and, as a result, a friction that reduces trade during runs has the potential to improve welfare. This result is in sharp contrast with the existing literature, which suggests that search friction has a negative impact on welfare. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Yet, distributional effects of nudges are largely unknown. We first design an economic laboratory experiment to examine the incidence of an opportunity cost reminder nudge (a salience nudge) designed to curb spending, while accounting for heterogeneity in emotional responses - specifically the pain of paying. Pain of paying is optimal for 'unconflicted' consumers, but too low for 'spendthrifts' and too high for 'tightwads', causing sub-optimal spending. Our empirical results imply the nudge increases pain of paying for tightwads, thereby reducing spending by tightwads, who already spend too little, while it entirely fails to reduce the spending of those who would have benefited from a spending reduction (spendthrifts). Overall, the nudge therefore might reduce consumer welfare. We next examine if the adverse impact of the opportunity cost reminder nudge is explained by a general tendency for all nudges to exacerbate peoples' underlying spending preferences. We specifically test whether a salience nudge designed to boost spending correspondingly adversely affects spendthrifts? We unexpectedly find that subjects perceive the spending booster nudge as a spending reminder, which again, reduces spending by tightwads only, while not affecting spending by the other consumer types. Our results highlight two important aspects of salience nudges - given the complexity of consumer emotions and information processing, salience nudges can have undesired welfare effects, and the direction of their impact may be the opposite of what was intended.

Furthermore, we decompose the wage gap using the counterfactual decomposition into endowment effect (explained by differences in characteristics) and a discrimination effect (attributable to unequal returns to covariates). We find that the discrimination effect against marginalized castes (in both cohorts) decreases, implying an increasing endowment effect across the distribution of the wage gap. This discrimination effect is more pronounced among younger compared to older cohorts.","[Arabsheibani, Gholamreza] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Gupta, Prashant] Swansea Univ, Swansea, W Glam, Wales; [Mishra, Tapas] Univ Southampton, Southampton Business Sch, Southampton, Hants, England; [Arabsheibani, Gholamreza; Parhi, Mamata] Univ Roehampton, Roehampton, England; [Arabsheibani, Gholamreza] IZA, Boon, Germany",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Swansea University; University of Southampton; Solent University; Roehampton University; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Gupta, P (通讯作者)，Swansea Univ, Sch Management, Dept Econ, Bay Campus, Swansea SA1 8EN, W Glam, Wales.",prashant.gupta@swansea.ac.uk,,"Parhi, Mamata/0000-0003-4024-0431; Gupta, Prashant/0000-0001-5401-5564",,,,,31,6,7,1,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

For this purpose we take advantage of a daily dataset of prices fixed by gas stations in two Spanish regions. It is consistently found that retail price dispersion is temporarily enlarged as a consequence of wholesale price increases, while it is reduced due to decreases. The presence of asymmetries in the short-run dynamics is also revealed. The impact of positive changes in the wholesale price is, in the first days of adjustment, clearly greater. The dynamics pattern could be explained, at least in part, by the faster response of prices in the stations associated with the two vertically integrated companies that have the largest market share (i.e. Repsol and Cepsa).

Energy productivity is an important factor in helping to achieve these objectives. In this paper, we test the hypothesis of energy productivity convergence in a panel of contiguous states and territories (S&Ts) in India. In measuring energy productivity at the S&T level, we use a unique firm level dataset maintained by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) for the period 1988 to 2016. We identify convergence clubs across Indian S & Ts; i.e. we identify groups of states that converge to different equilibria. The findings from the club merging analysis show that energy productivity across the S&Ts converges into two clubs with one divergent club. Higher initial energy productivity makes it more likely for states to be in the high energy productivity club. Industry structure is also an important determinant. The club convergence of the S&Ts has implications for Indian energy policy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Based on a large sample of Chinese manufacturing firms, we explicitly account for firms' endogenous export and innovation decisions, and isolate their impacts on firms' future performance, using a propensity score matching approach with multiple treatments. The results indicate that starting to export alone negatively affects firm-level markup and productivity, while starting to innovate alone has a significant positive impact. There is a complementarity between export and innovation in improving firms' performance. The negative effect of starting to export alone on revenue productivity may reflect the decrease of price-cost markup, rather than a change in physical productivity. Our study contributes to explaining puzzling results of exporter performance for China. The results also suggest that firms should establish domestic market power through innovation before turning to export markets.","[Dai, Xiaoyong; Sun, Zao; Liu, Hang] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Xi'an Jiaotong University,"Dai, XY (通讯作者)，74 Yanta West Rd, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",daixy87@gmail.com,,,"Endeavour Research Fellowship; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473025, 71632004]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2017M610626]; Social Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province [2017D021]; Social Science Foundation of Liaoning province [L16AJL002]",Endeavour Research Fellowship; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Social Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province; Social Science Foundation of Liaoning province,"Xiaoyong Dai would like to thank Professor Christopher O'Donnell and Martie-Louise Verreynne for insightful discussions and the financial support from the Endeavour Research Fellowship during his visit at the University of Queensland.

For this purpose, we use oil volatility index (OVX) to measure the IFG. Adding the IFG to existing heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) models, we develop many HAR models with IFG. Subsequently, we employ these HAR models to predict the volatility of crude oil futures. The results from the parameter estimation and out-of-sample forecasting show that the in-sample and out-of-sample performances of HAR models with IFG are significantly better than their corresponding HAR models without IFG. The results are robust in different ways. Thus, the HAR models with IFG are more beneficial to the decision making of all participants (including financial traders, manufacturers and policymakers) in the crude oil futures market. More importantly, the results suggest that the investor fear gauge has a significant positive effect on volatility forecasting, and can help improve the performances of almost all the existing HAR models.

Based on the most informative specification, we find that both types of wealthfinancial and housinghave significant effects in Canada and that the former has a greater effect than the latter.

The key identification challenge is that the composition of a school board is potentially correlated with unobserved determinants of school segregation. We overcome this issue using a regression discontinuity design at the electoral contest level, exploiting quasi-random variation from narrowly-decided elections. Such an approach is made possible by a unique dataset, which combines matched information about North Carolina school board candidates with time-varying district-level racial and economic segregation outcomes. Focusing on the political identity of school board members, regression discontinuity estimates reveal that (relative to their non-Democratic counterparts) Democratic board members decrease racial segregation across schools. Our findings suggest that school boards realize such reductions in segregation by shifting attendance zones (which we infer without the need for exact geocoded boundaries) and that white families differentially exit the traditional public school system for local charter schools in response.

Using a household production function, Grossman and Benham (1974) provide empirical evidence of the positive effect of good health on earnings. Carefully accounting for selection into the workforce and the potential endogeneity of our health variables, we use a sample of individuals between the ages of 25 and 55 from the Indonesian Family Longitudinal Survey (IFLS) to identify the effect of health on earnings and conduct Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions to identify possible discrimination. We compare these results to those using less conspicuous health measures such as blood pressure, cholesterol, and chest pain. Endogeneity of our health measures is subsequently addressed using several econometric methodologies. Results suggest that overweight males in Indonesia earn an income premium, while underweight females are subject to an income penalty.","[Ahsan, Md Nazmul] St Louis Univ, Dept Econ, 3674 Lindell Blvd,David Shaughnessy Hall Room 346, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Kelly, Inas Rashad] Loyola Marymount Univ, Natl Bur Econ Res, Univ Hall 4200,1 LMU Dr, Los Angeles, CA 90045 USA",Saint Louis University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Loyola Marymount University,"Ahsan, MN (通讯作者)，St Louis Univ, Dept Econ, 3674 Lindell Blvd,David Shaughnessy Hall Room 346, St Louis, MO 63108 USA.",ahsanm@slu.edu; inas.kelly@qc.cuny.edu,,,,,,,51,6,8,2,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

The highest effect of fiscal policy on GDP growth would be obtained if the structural deficits were used to increase the market size by reducing the tax burden. In line with Barro (1990), a deficit-financed reduction of tax burden has a stronger effect for European than for OECD countries, because in Europe the government size with respect to market size is too large. Therefore, if GDP growth is a dominant policy objective, in Europe specific actions should redress the 2012 Treaty toward a reduction of the tax burden.","[Beqiraj, Elton; Fedeli, Silvia; Forte, Francesco] Sapienza Univ Roma, Dept Econ & Law, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Fedeli, S (通讯作者)，Sapienza Univ Roma, Dept Econ & Law, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy.",silvia.fedeli@uniroma1.it,,,,,,,67,2,2,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

Within the standard New Keynesian model, we evaluate the macroeconomic performances of both regimes according to the strength of shocks affecting the economy. We find that when the economy faces small uncorrelated shocks, the level of inflation as well as its volatility are significantly lower in a band targeting regime, while the output gap and interest rate levels and volatility are significantly lower in a point targeting regime with tolerance bands. However, when the economy faces large uncorrelated shocks, choosing the suitable inflation targeting regime is irrelevant because both regimes lead to comparable performances. These findings stand in contrast to those of the literature and question the relevance of clarifying a mid-point target within the bands, especially in emerging market economies more inclined to large and frequent shocks.","[Cornand, Camille] Univ Lyon, CNRS, GATE UMR 5824, F-69130 Ecully, France; [M'baye, Cheick Kader] Univ Bamako, Bamako, Mali",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); University of Bamako,"Cornand, C (通讯作者)，Univ Lyon, CNRS, GATE UMR 5824, F-69130 Ecully, France.",cornand@gate.cnrs.fr; cheick_mbaye2004@yahoo.fr,"Cornand, Camille/H-3184-2017",,ANR-DFG joint Grant [ANR-12-FRAL-0013-01 StabEX],ANR-DFG joint Grant,We are thankful to the ANR-DFG joint Grant for financial support (ANR-12-FRAL-0013-01 StabEX).

We find that unexpected losses increase sentence lengths assigned by judges during the week following the game. Unexpected wins, or losses that were expected to be close contests ex ante have no impact. The effects of these emotional shocks are asymmetrically borne by black defendants. The impact of upset losses on sentence lengths is larger for defendants if their cases are handled by judges who received their bachelor's degrees from the university with which the football team is affiliated. Different falsification tests and a number of auxiliary analyses demonstrate the robustness of the findings. These results provide evidence for the impact of emotions in one domain on decisions in a completely unrelated domain among a uniformly highly educated group of individuals (judges) who make decisions after deliberation that involve high stakes (sentence lengths).

Second, we explore empirically the effect of an increase in skilled emigration on income distribution. A key prediction of our theoretical model is the existence of a non-monotonic relationship between income inequality and emigration of skilled workers.

Anticipating the subjective evaluation of an outcome requires the decision maker to project himself to the future and to imagine how much he will appreciate the outcome once he receives it. This projection may, but need not, be accurate. We provide a characterization of the WTU model in a static setting and propose a nonparametric method to measure its weighting and utility functions. We also consider a dynamic setting which allows for a varying decision time. The dynamic WTU model can accommodate the standard discounted expected utility model as well as observed deviations from stationarity, time invariance, and time consistency. It therefore enhances our understanding of the drivers of these behavioral phenomena.","[Gerber, Anke] Univ Hamburg, Dept Econ, Von Melle Pk 5, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Rohde, Kirsten I.

The agent tracks an optimal action that follows a Gaussian process. The agent chooses the properties of the signals that he receives, so as to minimize the mean squared difference between his action and the optimal action, subject to a constraint on information flow. We prove that the optimal signal is a one-dimensional signal about the elements of the state vector, which typically has non-zero signal weights on all elements of the state vector. The intuition for these results is that an agent with memory and limited attention wants to learn about the current optimal action and the best predictors of future optimal actions. Hence, in a dynamic economy, rational inattention creates a combination of delay in actions due to noise in the optimal signal and forward-looking actions due to forward-looking information choice. We illustrate these analytical results in a macroeconomic model of price-setting and a business cycle model with news shocks. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In this framework, education represents an environmental variable that enhances the monetary returns to investments in health through the use of time and medical care in health production. Using data from the 2004 to 2012 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), we examine the association between parental education and family health care spending in single-mother and two-parent families. We estimate one- and two-part expenditure models for total family health care spending, for specific components of such spending, and also examine the impact of parental education on selected measures of family health. Controlling for family income and health insurance status, we find consistent evidence that parental education beyond 12 years of schooling is associated with increases in family health care spending and with reductions in the likelihood of adverse health conditions.","[Monheit, Alan C.; Grafova, Irina B.] Rutgers State Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Syst & Policy, 683Hoes Lane West, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Monheit, Alan C.] NBER, 683Hoes Lane West, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Monheit, AC (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Syst & Policy, 683Hoes Lane West, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.;Monheit, AC (通讯作者)，NBER, 683Hoes Lane West, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",monheiac@sph.rutgers.edu,,"Grafova, Irina/0000-0002-0134-0600","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Economic Shocks and Family Health Security [AHRQ R01HS024053]","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Economic Shocks and Family Health Security","This research is funded by a grant from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ R01HS024053), Economic Shocks and Family Health Security.

To analyze the firm size-development link, I construct a frictionless general equilibrium model of occupational choice with skill-biased change in entrepreneurial technology (i.e., technical progress favors better entrepreneurs). The model accounts for key aspects of the US experience with only changes in aggregate technology. It attributes half the variation in mean and dispersion of firm size across countries to technical change.

It examines its reception, and its deployment by the Italian Marxian tradition of Operaismo, and the criticisms this has sometimes garnered from other Marxists. I argue that while the 'Fragment' has generally been critically evaluated in terms of its contribution to the 'scientific' (or wissenschaftlich) critique of political economy-revealing truth through a method seen as objective, rational and methodical-it is in fact better understood in terms of its function as science fiction. In other words, its function as a piece of social commentary and criticism, exploring the social relations caught up with techno-scientific developments that are evidently already imaginable-revealing something about the then present, its dystopian dangers and utopian possibilities-even where these remained (just) beyond the realm of the scientifically possible. I argue that evaluating the 'Fragment' as science fiction draws attention to its effects, namely its capacity to pose (on the basis of this scientifically plausible interrogation of emergent futures) important political questions. Foremost among these was the meaning-for our understanding of the possible locations of workers' resistance-of capital's increasing reliance on relationships, forms of knowledge and affects that cannot be contained by the times and places of work.","[Trott, Ben] Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Univ Salle 1, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany",Leuphana University Luneburg,"Trott, B (通讯作者)，Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Univ Salle 1, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany.",b.j.trott@gmail.com,,,,,,,51,3,3,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Macro evidence and implications for global inequality,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Inequality; Wealth; Tax evasion; Tax havens,CAPITAL FLIGHT,"Drawing on newly published macroeconomic statistics, this paper estimates the amount of household wealth owned by each country in offshore tax havens. The equivalent of 10% of world GDP is held in tax havens globally, but this average masks a great deal of heterogeneity from a few percent of GDP in Scandinavia, to about 15% in Continental Europe, and 60% in Gulf countries and some Latin American economies. We use these estimates to construct revised series of top wealth shares in ten countries, which account for close to half of world GDP. Because offshore wealth is very concentrated at the top, accounting for it increases the top 0.01% wealth share substantially in Europe, even in countries that do not use tax havens extensively. It has considerable effects in Russia, where the vast majority of wealth at the top is held offshore. These results highlight the importance of looking beyond tax and survey data to study wealth accumulation among the very rich in a globalized world.","[Alstadsaeter, Annette] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, As, Norway; [Johannesen, Niels] Univ Copenhagen, CEBI, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Zucman, Gabriel] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA USA; [Zucman, Gabriel] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Norwegian University of Life Sciences; University of Copenhagen; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Zucman, G (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA USA.;Zucman, G (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",annette.alstadsater@nmbu.no; niels.johannesen@econ.ku.dk; zucman@berkeley.edu,,"johannesen, niels/0000-0002-7850-2794",Nordic Tax Research Council; FRIPRO-program of the Research Council of Norway; Danish Council for Independent Research; Laura and John Arnold Foundation,Nordic Tax Research Council; FRIPRO-program of the Research Council of Norway; Danish Council for Independent Research(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF)); Laura and John Arnold Foundation,"This paper is supplemented by an Online Appendix available at http://gabriel-zucman.eu/offshore.

Recently, this transformation has been widely used to deal with omitted variable bias generated by local or site-specific unobservables in a 'boundary-discontinuity' design setting. However, as is well known in this literature, SD makes inference problematic. Indeed, given a specific distance threshold, a sample unit may be the neighbor of a number of units on the opposite side of a specific boundary inducing correlation between all differenced observations that share a common sample unit. By recognizing that the SD transformation produces a special form of dyadic data, we show that the dyadic-robust variance matrix estimator proposed by Cameron and Miller (2014) is, in general, a better solution compared to the most commonly used estimators.","[Belotti, Federico] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Econ & Finance, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [Di Porto, Edoardo] Univ Naples Federico II, CSEF, I-80126 Naples, Italy; [Di Porto, Edoardo] Uppsala Univ, UCFS, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden; [Santoni, Gianluca] CEPII, TSA 10726, F-75334 Paris 07, France",University of Rome Tor Vergata; University of Naples Federico II; Uppsala University,"Belotti, F (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Econ & Finance, I-00133 Rome, Italy.",federico.belotti@uniroma2.it; edoardo.diporto@unina.it; gianluca.santoni@cepii.fr,"santoni, gianluca/AAJ-3958-2020; Belotti, Federico/M-4247-2015","santoni, gianluca/0000-0002-8853-0051; Belotti, Federico/0000-0003-3169-0641",,,,,14,3,3,0,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1610-241X,1612-7501,,CESIFO ECON STUD,CESifo Econ.

While both Britain and the US have witnessed secular increases in 90/10 male earnings inequality over the last three decades, this measure of inequality in net family income has declined in Britain while it has risen in the US. To better understand these comparisons, we examine the interaction between labour market earnings in the family, assortative mating, the tax and welfare-benefit system and household income inequality. We find that both countries have witnessed sizeable changes in employment which have primarily occurred on the extensive margin in the US and on the intensive margin in Britain. Increases in the generosity of the welfare system in Britain played a key role in equalizing net income growth across the wage distribution, whereas the relatively weak safety net available to non-workers in the US mean this growing group has seen particularly adverse developments in their net incomes.

S. Campbell's The Great Transition: Climate, Disease and Society in the Late-Medieval World is a significant contribution to the growing literature that traces the roots of Europe's economic rise to the climatic and population shocks of the late medieval period. This review essay discusses the empirical, historical, and theoretical support for Campbell's view while highlighting that it struggles to explain why these positive effects were limited to Europe. It then hypothesizes that Europe's differential response to this shock reflected prior institutional advantages and provides some preliminary empirical evidence in support of this hypothesis. The essay concludes by examining Campbell's claim that these shocks contributed to Atlantic Europe's rise prior to the colonial period.","[Chaney, Eric] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Chaney, E (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford, England.",,,,,,,,32,4,4,0,4,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

Taking all dependences into consideration, this article estimates the total-factor spillovers, similarities, and competitions in the spirit of total-factor productivity.

Recent technological progress, however, often gives rise to pure intellectual contents, such as software codes or business models, directly usable in the production of final goods. Once a content of this type has been produced, it is in fixed supply, that is, the inventor can only rent it out (or sell it) or not; hence, the quantity restriction typical of monopoly cannot arise, while competition is viable. We show that, however, as long as the inventor owning a patent can control through license activation devices the access to the intellectual content of the workers using her invention in the final goods production, monopolistic exploitation becomes viable and will occur. It turns out that in this framework, the income share of labor is smaller than in the Lab-Equipment economy, which represents the setting closest to our model. Moreover, with elastic labor supply labor employment is also negatively impacted. This implies that some standard public policies devised for correcting inefficiencies in development may perform poorly in this framework.","[Marchese, Carla] Univ Piemonte Orientale Amedeo Avogadro, Inst POLIS DiGSPES, Via Cavour 84, I-15121 Alessandria, Italy; [Privileggi, Fabio] Univ Turin, Dept Econ & Stat Cognetti Martiis, Lungo Dora Siena 100 A, I-10153 Turin, Italy",University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro; University of Turin,"Marchese, C (通讯作者)，Univ Piemonte Orientale Amedeo Avogadro, Inst POLIS DiGSPES, Via Cavour 84, I-15121 Alessandria, Italy.",carla.marchese@uniupo.it; fabio.privileggi@unito.it,"CORREA, RENATA/AAA-2417-2022; MARCHESE, Carla/AAK-9591-2021; Marchese, Carla/AAF-8420-2020; Privileggi, Fabio/AAW-2106-2020","MARCHESE, Carla/0000-0001-9935-2038; Marchese, Carla/0000-0001-9935-2038; Privileggi, Fabio/0000-0002-8837-2006",Universita del Piemonte Orientale,Universita del Piemonte Orientale,Carla Marchese acknowledges the financial support from Universita del Piemonte Orientale.,,19,4,4,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Term structure models attempt to explain how interest rates depend on their maturities at a given point in time, characterizing the relationship between short-term and long-term rates. Our model can reproduce and fit a variety of TSIR shapes by capturing cyclical fluctuations of interest rates, different monetary policy reactions as witnessed pre- and post-crisis as well as the effect of the business cycle or exogenous shocks. Our modelling approach also provides a characterization of long-term fluctuations in the mean level of interest rates unveiling the effects of monetary policy interventions in interest rates. Furthermore, using daily US data, we compare the empirical ability of our model to both fit and forecast the TSIR under different economic scenarios. We show that our model improves pricing and risk management by fitting and predicting interest rates more accurately and precisely than do existing TSIR models.","[Moreno, Manuel] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Econ Anal & Finance, Cobertizo San Pedro Martir S-N, Toledo 45071, Spain; [Novales, Alfonso] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Quantitat Econ, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain; [Novales, Alfonso] Univ Complutense Madrid, ICAE, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain; [Platania, Federico] Leonard de Vinci Pole Univ, Res Ctr, F-92916 Paris, La Defense, France",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Complutense University of Madrid; Complutense University of Madrid,"Moreno, M (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Econ Anal & Finance, Cobertizo San Pedro Martir S-N, Toledo 45071, Spain.",manuel.moreno@uclm.es; anovales@ccee.ucm.es; federico.platania@devinci.fr,"Novales, Alfonso/H-7157-2015","Novales, Alfonso/0000-0002-2137-1789","Programa de Ayudas a la Investigacion from Banco de Espana; Spanish Ministry of Education-FPU-MEC; Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique FNRS [T.0014.14, PPII-2014-030-P]; [P12-SEJ-1733]; [PPII-2014- 030-P]; [ECO2017-85927-P]; [ECO2015-67305.P]; [PrometeoII/2013/015]",Programa de Ayudas a la Investigacion from Banco de Espana; Spanish Ministry of Education-FPU-MEC; Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique FNRS(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS); ; ; ; ;,"The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support by grants P12-SEJ-1733, PPII-2014- 030-P, and ECO2017-85927-P (Moreno), grants ECO2015-67305.P, PrometeoII/2013/015, and Programa de Ayudas a la Investigacion from Banco de Espana (Novales), and grants Spanish Ministry of Education-FPU-MEC, Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique FNRS (T.0014.14), and PPII-2014-030-P (Platania).

The main finding of this study is that it is technically feasible to achieve 80% greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction below the 2005 levels by 2050 through deployment of existing or near-commercially available technologies. GHG reductions are primarily achieved through high levels of electricity sector decarbonization, electrification of end uses, and exchange of the remaining end-uses to lower carbon fuels such as natural gas. However, deep decarbonization by 2050 triggers very high marginal CO2 reduction costs, unless significant cost reductions of zero and near-zero carbon technologies occur. The results show that CO2 reduction policies accelerate the deployment of renewables and carbon capture and storage (CCS) only in the scenarios where the decarbonization policies are more stringent than those in the Clean Power Plan (CPP). Electricity generation mixes in the reference scenarios are largely dependent on the price of natural gas, but also show significant sensitivity to cost reductions in CCS. When increased CCS learning rates are incorporated into the model runs, more CCS is optimal in the medium-term and long-term future in the scenarios with CO2 constraints. An 80% reduction scenario also prompts electrification in end-use demand sectors, creating even more dependence on CO2 management in the electricity generation sector. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The model also predicts that an enrollment policy featuring with tenant discrimination, accompanying with strict credit constraint, would reduce the chance of kids from middle-income families to attend better public schools while allow families with high initial wealth to access better high-quality public education at a lower cost. Using a hedonic pricing model, we find that, in Shanghai, rental yields of housings in neighborhoods associated with reputed public primary schools is on average 0.1-0.35 percentage-point lower than those associated with ordinary ones. We also explore how the rent-yields-gap varies across housing types, locations and changes over time. Nonetheless, our simulation computation suggests that the estimated opportunity cost of holding such schools in Shanghai is generally not a big amount and affordable for many families. Overall, the high entry costs of owing a housing is the major obstacle to access high-quality public primary education in urban China. These findings highlight how an education policy with features of inequality may contribute to education and residential segregation, and then reduce intergenerational mobility.","[Zhang, Muyang; Chen, Jie] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Muyang] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, China Publ Finance Inst, Phoenix Bldg,Guoding Rd 777, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Muyang] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Econ & Adm, Phoenix Bldg,Guoding Rd 777, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Chen, J (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Dept Investment, Sch Publ Econ & Adm, Phoenix Bldg 503,Guoding Rd 777, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.;Chen, J (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, IAR, Phoenix Bldg 503,Guoding Rd 777, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",zhang.muyang@mail.shufe.edu.cn; chen.jie@mail.shufe.edu.cn,"Chen, Jie/D-5868-2018; ZHANG, MUYANG/J-9999-2019","Chen, Jie/0000-0002-9254-4413; ZHANG, MUYANG/0000-0001-8819-146X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [NSF71173045, NSF71573166, NSF7161101095]; Program for Innovative Research Team of Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (IRTSHUFE)",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program for Innovative Research Team of Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (IRTSHUFE),"We thank Ming Lu, Xun Zhang, and Xufeng Zhu, and participants at 2014 China Young Economists Conference, the 14th China Economics Annual Conference, the 2nd Young Economists Forum for Public Economics, the 1st China Annual Conference for Public Administration, and ADB Institute Workshop on Urbanization and Infrastructure in Asia.

These estimates are based on electricity consumption data that do not reflect actual demand due to an electricity supply shortfall of up to 6000 megawatts (MW). Moreover, previous studies accounted for power consumption data of only one of the two electric power companies, Pakistan Electric Power Company (P.E.P.C.O.), ignoring the other company K-Electric, with a share of over 15% in country's electricity consumption. This study attempts to revisit electricity demand elasticities in Pakistan at the aggregate and sectoral level by including both P.E.P.C.O. and K-Electric and adjusting the consumption series for load shedding to reflect actual electricity demand. By employing an Autoregressive Distributive Lag model, the study finds electricity demand to be income elastic at aggregate level and in the agriculture sector in the long run, and relatively inelastic in the industrial sector. However, unlike previous studies, the electricity demand is price inelastic at all levels, which is an expected outcome in an economy facing electricity shortages. The coefficients of short-run income and price elasticities are smaller than their long-run counterparts. No evidence of cointegration is found for the commercial sector.","[Ishaque, Hanan] Alpen Adria Univ, Dept Econ, Klagenfurt, Austria",University of Klagenfurt,"Ishaque, H (通讯作者)，Alpen Adria Univ, Dept Econ, Klagenfurt, Austria.",h1ishaque@edu.aau.at,,"Ishaque, Hanan/0000-0001-5004-2098",,,,,49,6,7,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

This paper investigates the contagion from oil prices to Chinese stock sectors by considering differences between extreme positive returns and extreme negative returns. We compute time-varying cut-offs by employing a generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) function to estimate excess returns. We then use a multinomial logit (MNL) model to examine the probability of Chinese stock sector co-exceedances associated with oil price exceedances. Our results indicate that, compared to common domestic factors, the contagion between oil price and stock sectors is relatively weak, but never negligible. We argue that faced with volatile oil prices during turbulent periods, the existence of any contagion weakens the benefits of portfolio diversification related to oil and Chinese stock sector investment. Based on our findings, investors holding a portfolio of oil and Chinese sector stocks should pay special attention to the extreme changes in crude oil prices and adopt hedging measures to protect their portfolio from extreme shocks to oil markets.

We find that greater CB competence-more private information-about policy objectives is desirable while greater competence about operational shocks need not be. When the CB has less private information about operational shocks, the public infers that monetary policy depends more on the CB's information about objectives.

In particular, agents need not be globally risk-averse, or uncertainty-averse in the sense of Schmeidler (1989). We identify a behavioral condition under which betting is inefficient (i.e., every Pareto-efficient allocation provides full insurance, and conversely) if and only if agents' supporting probabilities (defined as in Rigotti et al., 2008) have a non-empty intersection.

Besides productivity growth and efficiency changes, the shape of the production function may also transform rapidly over time. Moreover, the four segments in agriculture (farming, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries) have different production processes and techniques, so the aggregated production function of agriculture may vary across provinces. Compared with existing studies, which usually assume a fixed production function, this paper allows a varying coefficient production function that can better capture the structure change in the six reform periods over the past four decades. The empirical results show that the labor elasticity is decreasing, the fertilizer and machinery elasticities are increasing, and the land elasticity has a U-shaped curve across time. Moreover, technology and inputs are leading the growth alternatively in different reform periods.","[Gong, Binlei] Zhejiang Univ, China Acad Rural Dev CARD, Sch Publ Affairs, Dept Agr Econ & Management, Room 1203 Qizhen Bldg,866 Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University,"Gong, BL (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, China Acad Rural Dev CARD, Sch Publ Affairs, Dept Agr Econ & Management, Room 1203 Qizhen Bldg,866 Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",gongbinlei@zju.edu.cn,,"Gong, Binlei/0000-0002-0615-9341",,,,,82,123,137,30,240,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

We propose some sensible properties of such methods and show that these properties characterize a unique rule of inference, called the transitive core. This rule is applied to a variety of nontransitive preference models, such as semiorders on the commodity space, relative discounting time preferences, justifiable preferences over ambiguous acts, regret preferences over risky prospects, and collective preferences induced by majority voting. We show that the transitive core offers a nontrivial and reasonable inference of the decision maker's true preference relation in these contexts.","[Nishimura, Hiroki] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Econ, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Nishimura, H (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Econ, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",hiroki.nishimura@ucr.edu,,,C.V.

Inattention also rationalizes the limited stock market participation observed in the data and improves the asset pricing performance of the model.

The paper, first, points out the difficulties in Piketty's neo-classical version of explanation of US income inequality, which stresses the effect of the rising aggregate wealth-income ratio and high elasticity of factor substitution. Second, the analysis, based on a Cambridge two-class model along the lines of Kaldor (1955-56, 1966) and Pasinetti (1962), highlights the role of financialization in increasing inequality. Third, the analysis suggests that the rise in the aggregate wealth-income ratio from 1980 to 2007 in the USA is explained mostly by asset price inflation, not by technical relations. Finally, the analysis examines the effects of the slowdown in capital accumulation on income distribution and wealth-income ratios, which are very different from those in Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century.","[Ryoo, Soon] Adelphi Univ, Garden City, NY 11530 USA",Adelphi University,"Ryoo, S (通讯作者)，Adelphi Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, Garden City, NY 11530 USA.",sryoo@adelphi.edu,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The modeling structure is novel in the sense that it can disentangle the optimizing behavior of different types of traders, namely uninformed, partially informed and informed traders. Instead of establishing equilibrium results, all of the three types of traders are supposed to be price takers and determine their optimal trading strategies based on an exogenously given mid-price process. It is shown that traders, who have an access to more information about potential market turmoils, such as triggering events, are more aggressive on trading profits which are reflected in higher required liquidity premiums. The informed traders are more cautious in inventory controls through lowering their trading positions prior to the triggering events. With potential regime shifts, the feature of information delay about market efficiency is captured by allowing that the security market has a response time for a market shock.

To this end, we first employ the advanced smooth time-varying cointegration model to investigate the existence of a time-varying cointegration relation among these markets and then employ the difference-in-differences approach to analyse whether or not the S.A.R.S. epidemic impacted the long-run relation between China and these four markets during the period 1998-2008, covering 5years before and after the S.A.R.S. outbreak. Our results support the existence of a time-varying cointegration relation in the aggregate stock price indices, and that the S.A.R.S. epidemic did weaken the long-run relationship between China and the four markets. Therefore, stockholders and policy makers should be concerned about the influence of catastrophic epidemic diseases on the financial integration of stock market in Asia.","[Chen, Mei-Ping] Natl Taichung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Accounting Informat, Taichung, Taiwan; [Lee, Chien-Chiang] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Lin, Yu-Hui] Nan Kai Univ Technol, Dept Business Adm, Nantou, Taiwan; [Chen, Wen-Yi] Natl Taichung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Senior Citizen Serv Management, Taichung, Taiwan",National Taichung University of Science & Technology; National Sun Yat Sen University; Nan Kai University Technology; National Taichung University of Science & Technology,"Chen, WY (通讯作者)，Natl Taichung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Senior Citizen Serv Management, Taichung, Taiwan.",chenwen@nutc.edu.tw,"Yan, Jing/JFA-6705-2023; Lee, Chien-Chiang/AAZ-9983-2020","Lee, Chien-Chiang/0000-0003-0037-4347",,,,,70,75,76,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We then build a heterogeneous-agents model with imperfectly-altruistic overlapping generations to account for the patterns we find. A key innovation is the availability of informal care (IC), which is determined through intra-family bargaining. This opens up a new margin in response to policy and allows for informal insurance through home-production of care. Our calibrated model captures the observed care arrangements well. We study the implications of non-means-tested IC and formal care (FC) subsidies as well as changes to means-tested Medicaid. We find that IC responds strongly to these policies. An IC subsidy substantially reduces reliance on Medicaid, while the reduction of tax revenues due to lower labour supply by caregivers is modest. There are large welfare gains from a combination of IC and FC subsidies, even when combined with a reduction of the Medicaid program.","[Barczyk, Daniel] McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Barczyk, Daniel] CIREQ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Kredler, Matthias] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Getafe, Spain",McGill University; Universite de Montreal; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Barczyk, D (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;Barczyk, D (通讯作者)，CIREQ, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",,"Kredler, Matthias/Y-5982-2018","Kredler, Matthias/0000-0001-6479-0708","Fundacion Ramon Areces; Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2012-34581, ECO2015-68615-P, MDM 2014-0431]; Comunidad de Madrid, MadEco-CM [S2015/HUM-3444]","Fundacion Ramon Areces; Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); Comunidad de Madrid, MadEco-CM(Comunidad de Madrid)","We thank Michele Tertilt and three anonymous referees for very helpful comments and suggestions.

We observe a relatively lower exit rate for more senior workers in Sweden in the shrinking firms and among the low-wage workers. These empirical patterns are consistent with last-in, first-out rules in Sweden providing protection from dismissals for the more senior workers among the worker groups to whom the rules are most relevant.

A framework of exogenous growth permits modeling countries in transition to a country-specific steady state and to discern steady-state and transitory effects of shocks on economic outcomes. The chosen framework is amenable to structural estimation and, in view of the parsimony of the model, fits data on 79 countries over the period 1996-2011 well. The counterfactual analysis based on the estimated model suggests that capital-tax reductions induce positive effects on output and the capital stock (per unit of effective labor) that are economically significant and are accommodated within time windows of 5 years without much further economic response after that. The responses of economic aggregates are found to be relatively strongest to changes in corporate-profit-tax rates and weaker for dividend and capital-gains taxes.","[Bosenberg, Simon] Swiss Natl Bank, Boersenstr 15, CH-8022 Zurich, Switzerland; [Egger, Peter; Zoller-Rydzek, Benedikt] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, KOF, Leonhardstr 21, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Egger, Peter] OUCBT, NoCeT, CEPR, CESifo, Oxford, England",Swiss National Bank (SNB); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of Oxford,"Zoller-Rydzek, B (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, KOF, Leonhardstr 21, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",simon.boesenberg@snb.ch; egger@kof.ethz.ch; rydzek@kof.ethz.ch,,"Egger, Peter/0000-0002-0546-1207",Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF),Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"The authors thank RonDavies, Michael Devereux, Clemens Fuest, Kimberley Scharf, and the anonymous referees for their helpful comments.

The analysis uses the multiple regime smooth transition autoregressive model, which is embedded within a nonlinear and asymmetric process, with time as the transition variable. In the model, parameters are allowed to change smoothly over time. The estimated structural change dates appear to be closely related to important economic events caused by macroeconomic shocks or changes in monetary policy. The results reveal that the persistence of the forward premium declines when nonlinearity, asymmetry, and structural changes are jointly allowed in the process. In addition, ignoring nonlinearity and asymmetry in the process tends to induce downward amplification in the persistence of the forward premium. This suggests that it is necessary to take into account all of the statistical properties of the forward premium when one measures persistence.","[Cho, Dooyeon] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 03063, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Cho, D (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 03063, South Korea.",dooyeoncho@skku.edu,,"Cho, Dooyeon/0000-0003-2588-9347",,,,,38,6,6,0,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

In this article, we posit that voters may systematically err when assessing potential changes in policy by underappreciating how new policies lead to new equilibrium behaviour. This biases voters towards policy changes that create direct benefits-welfare would rise if behaviour were held constant-even if those reforms ultimately reduce welfare because people adjust behaviour. Conversely, voters are biased against policies that impose direct costs even if they induce larger indirect benefits. Using a lab experiment, we find that a majority of subjects vote against policies that, while inflicting direct costs, would help them to overcome social dilemmas and thereby increase welfare. Subjects also support policies that, while producing direct benefits, create social dilemmas and ultimately hurt welfare. Both mistakes arise because subjects fail to fully anticipate the equilibrium effects of new policies. More precisely, we establish that subjects systematically underappreciate the extent to which policy changes will affect the behaviour of other people, and that these mistaken beliefs exert a causal effect on the demand for bad policy.","[Dal Bo, Ernesto] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Dal Bo, Pedro] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Eyster, Erik] LSE, London, England",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Brown University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Dal Bó, E (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,,ERC,ERC(European Research Council (ERC)),"We thank Alexander Kiam, Jeongbin Kim, Daniel Prinz, Santiago Truffa and Stephen Yen for excellent research assistance as well as Berkeley's XLab and Brown's BUSSELfor support.

In response to positive productivity shocks, risk premia fall and the sovereign borrows to finance investment. When adverse productivity shocks make international borrowing expensive, the sovereign responds by rolling over debt and reducing investment. This causes output to fall and the debt-output ratio to increase, and default occurs if the negative shocks continue long enough. Consequently, the model generates first an increase and then a decrease in investment, consumption, and output prior to default, as in the data. These relationships between productivity, spreads, investment, and borrowing also make the model consistent with many features of small open economy business cycles such as countercyclical spreads and net exports. While capital has nontrivial effects on the incentive to default, increased capital almost always reduces risk premia in equilibrium. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We extend a standard weakest link experiment with a manager who can decide to replace some workers at a cost. We address two main questions: (i) Does the fear of exclusion need to be a permanent element of contractual agreements? (ii) Are the results robust to the introduction of noise in workers' productivity? We find that the fear of exclusion strongly encourages cooperation among workers, but it does not generate the trust needed for cooperation once the fear of exclusion is lifted. That is, once some workers receive a permanent contract, effort levels steadily decrease. The results are robust to the introduction of noise in the link between effort and productivity.

Both duopoly games have evolutionarily stable conjectures that depend on other regarding preferences but that do not coincide with the consistent conjectures.

We document the previously unnoticed causal relationship between energy price elasticity and economic transition by modelling energy price elasticity as endogenous to the economic system. The central message is that economic transition promotes incentives and flexibility of micro-units to sufficiently use price signals. Three potential mechanisms are proposed and tested for economic transition affecting the energy price elasticity. The findings provide implications for energy price policies because it reveals how energy consumers respond to energy price changes alongside economic transition.","[Li, Jianglong] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhi] Xiamen Univ, China Ctr Energy Econ Res, Sch Econ, Xiamen, Peoples R China",Xi'an Jiaotong University; Xiamen University,"Li, JL (通讯作者)，Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",lijianglong@mail.xjtu.edu.cn; lzivy@xmu.edu.cn,"LIU, JIALIN/JXN-8034-2024; zhou, yang/JED-3951-2023",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71703120, 71773028, 71603079]; Social Science and Humanity Fund of the Ministry of Education [17YJC790068]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2016M602784, 2016M600772]; Special Foundation of China Postdoctoral Science [2017T100729]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Social Science and Humanity Fund of the Ministry of Education; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Special Foundation of China Postdoctoral Science,"The paper is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos. 71703120, 71773028 and 71603079), Social Science and Humanity Fund of the Ministry of Education (no. 17YJC790068), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (grant nos. 2016M602784 and 2016M600772) and Special Foundation of China Postdoctoral Science (no. 2017T100729).",,51,7,7,0,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

We evaluate these arguments in a model where officers invest in competence. Competence increases the officer's ability to identify criminals. Low sanctions for errors encourages bold policing by officers but may still raise the equilibrium level of crime because it also discourages investments in competence.

Empirical analysis reveals that differences in preferences inferred from heterogeneity in estimated happiness functions map onto differences in self-reported behavior and attitudes in expected ways, suggesting that SWB-based measures of differences in preferences indeed capture the construct they are supposed to capture.

China's exports are classified here as ordinary exports (OE), and two distinctive groups of processing exports, pure assembly exports (PAE) and mixed assembly exports (MAE). The data analyzed here are derived from panel data covering China's bilateral PAE and MAE with 120 trading partners from 1993 to 2013. The estimates of fixed effect models show that wage increase and the appreciation of the yuan reduced the proportion of assembly exports in China's bilateral exports. Specifically, for a 10% increase in Chinese manufacturing wages, the share of PAE in China's bilateral exports is expected to fall 4.59% and that of MAE to decrease 0.9%; and a 10% nominal appreciation of the yuan against the US dollar is expected to lower the shares of PAE and MAE 8.56% and 7.26% respectively. The empirical results imply that rising wage and cumulative appreciation of the yuan have eroded China's comparative advantage in the assembly of products for international markets, resulting in substantial contraction of assembly exports. The analysis provides a supply-side explanation for the fall of China's export growth.","[Xing, Yuqing] Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies, Minato Ku, 7-22-1 Roppongi, Tokyo 1068677, Japan",National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies,"Xing, YQ (通讯作者)，Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies, Minato Ku, 7-22-1 Roppongi, Tokyo 1068677, Japan.",yuqing_xing@grips.ac.jp,,,,,,,13,9,10,1,13,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

Impacts varied predictably with prior development - prior roads and prior deforestation and, further, in a pattern that suggests a potential synergy for roads between forests and urban growth. For multiple periods of roads investments, the authors estimate forest impacts for high, medium and low prior roads and deforestation. For each setting, census-tract observations are numerous. Results confirm predictions for this kind of frontier of a pattern not consistent with endogeneity, i.e., short-run forest impacts of new roads are: small for relatively high prior development; larger for medium prior development; and small for low prior development (for the latter setting, impacts in such isolated areas could rise over time, depending on interactions with conservation policies). These Amazonian results suggest 'SDG strategic' locations for infrastructure, an idea the authors note for other frontiers while highlighting major differences across frontiers and their SDG opportunities.","[Pfaff, Alexander] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Robalino, Juan] CATIE EfD, Turrialba, Costa Rica; [Robalino, Juan] Univ Costa Rica, San Pedro Montes De Oca, Costa Rica; [Reis, Eustaquio J.] IPEA Rio de Janeiro, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Walker, Robert] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Perz, Stephen] Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL USA; [Laurance, William] James Cook Univ, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Bohrer, Claudio] Univ Fed Fluminense, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil; [Aldrich, Steven] Indiana State Univ, Terre Haute, IN 47809 USA; [Arima, Eugenio] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Caldas, Marcellus] Kansas State Univ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Kirby, Katherine] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada",Duke University; Universidad Costa Rica; Michigan State University; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; James Cook University; Universidade Federal Fluminense; Indiana State University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Kansas State University; University of Toronto,"Pfaff, A (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",alex.pfaff@duke.edu,"Laurance, William F/B-2709-2012; Bohrer, Claudio/Q-3216-2017; Caldas, Marcellus M/C-1955-2014","Laurance, William F/0000-0003-4430-9408; Bohrer, Claudio/0000-0002-1217-5006;",NASA LBA; Tinker Foundation; EfD centers,NASA LBA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); Tinker Foundation; EfD centers,"For financial support we thank the NASA LBA (project led by R.

We test this unexplored implication of the theory empirically. We find that the anticipation of receiving new loan programs immediately after a political regime transition increases the probability of a transition from autocracy to democracy and reduces the probability of democratic survival.

Productivity Growth, Employment, and the Labor Share",BROOKINGS PAPERS ON ECONOMIC ACTIVITY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,DECLINE; OUTPUT; INPUT; JOBS,"Many technological innovations replace workers with machines. But this capital-labor substitution need not reduce aggregate labor demand, because it simultaneously induces four countervailing responses: own-industry output effects; cross-industry input-output effects; between-industry shifts; and final demand effects. We quantify these channels using four decades of harmonized cross-country and industry data, whereby we measure automation as industry-level movements in total factor productivity that are common across countries. We find that automation displaces employment and reduces labor's share of value added in the industries where it originates (a direct effect). In the case of employment, these own-industry losses are reversed by indirect gains in customer industries and induced increases in aggregate demand. By contrast, own-industry labor share losses are not recouped elsewhere. Our frame-work can account for a substantial fraction of the reallocation of employment across industries and the aggregate fall in the labor share over the last three decades. It does not, however, explain why the labor share fell more rapidly during the 2000s.","[Autor, David] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Salomons, Anna] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Utrecht University,"Autor, D (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,,,,,,,60,158,180,9,98,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

In these three countries, goods and credit market frictions play a dominant role in entry costs and account for 75% to 85% of the total entry costs. In the goods market, adverse supply shocks are amplified through their propagation to the demand side, as they also imply income losses for consumers. This adds up to, at most, an additional 15% to 25% to the impact of the shocks. Finally, the speed of matching in the goods market and the credit market accounts for a small fraction of unemployment: most variation in unemployment comes from the speed of matching in the labor market.

On the supply side, firms decide on production based on adaptive expectations for sales demand and a desired level of inventories. On the demand side, investment is determined as a function of utilization and profitability and can be financed by debt, whereas consumption is independently determined as a function of income and wealth. Prices adjust sluggishly to both changes in labour costs and inventory. Disequilibrium between expected sales and demand is absorbed by unplanned changes in inventory. This results in a five-dimensional dynamical system for wage share, employment rate, private debt ratio, expected sales, and capacity utilization. We analyze two limiting cases: the long run dynamics provides a version of the Keen model with effective demand and varying inventories, whereas the short-run dynamics gives rise to behaviour that we interpret as Kitchin cycles.

In this paper, I use a three-party model (consumers, local monopolistic merchants, and a proprietary EPN) with endogenous transaction volumes, heterogeneous card use benefits for merchants and network externalities of card-accepting merchants on cardholders to assess the efficiency and welfare effects of the NSR. I show that the NSR: (i) promotes retail price efficiency for cardholders, and (ii) inefficiently reduces card acceptance among merchants. The NSR can enhance social welfare and improve payment efficiency by shifting output from cash payers to cardholders. However, if network externalities are sufficiently strong, the reduction of card payment acceptance affects cardholders negatively and, with the exception of the EPN, all agents will be worse off under the NSR. This paper also suggests that the NSR may be an instrument to decrease cash usage, but the social optimal policy on the NSR may depend on the competitive conditions in each market.","[Henriques, David] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Henriques, David] Off Commun, Competit Econ, London SE1 9HA, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Henriques, D (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England.;Henriques, D (通讯作者)，Off Commun, Competit Econ, London SE1 9HA, England.",dthenriques@gmail.com,,,"Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [BD/47421/2008, 10.13039/501100001871]",Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Funder Id: 10.13039/501100001871, Grant Number: BD/47421/2008.",,30,1,1,0,7,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

Many studies have documented the sources of the increase in pension expenditures and the limitations of revenues from social security contributions to meet such an increase. Looking into the future, dependency ratios are expected to rise further, while, in the absence of additional changes to the system's sources of revenue, pension replacement rates will decline significantly from the current levels. In this context, this paper aims to contribute to the debate on the situation of the Spanish pension system through an analysis of its recent evolution and up-to-date forward-looking projections that include the impact of the latest reforms. Finally, we also analyse alternative reforms that are needed to restore financial sustainability and improve equity, both within and across generations.","[Hernandez de Cos, Pablo; Ramos, Roberto; Francisco Jimeno, Juan] Banco Espana, Madrid, Spain; [Francisco Jimeno, Juan] CEPR, Madrid, Spain; [Francisco Jimeno, Juan] IZA, Madrid, Spain",Banco de Espana,"de Cos, PH (通讯作者)，Banco Espana, Madrid, Spain.",,"Ramos, Roberto/HAQ-7638-2022; Jimeno, Juan F/AAF-6141-2020",,,,,,21,3,3,0,8,"UNIV ZARAGOZA DEV COOPERATION CHAIR, SPANISH NETWORK DEV STUDIES",ZARAGOZA,"GRAN VIA 2, ZARAGOZA, 50005, SPAIN",1133-455X,,,REV ECON APL-SPAIN,Rev.

We calculated two credit supply factors using a time-varying parameter FAVAR model. The first factor is identified as the willingness to lend, while the second factor is the lending capacity. The impact of these two types of shocks and their changes over time is examined using Hungarian data. The two types of lending shocks affect macro variables rather differently: a positive lending capacity shock (in a banking system mostly owned by nonresidents) influences GDP through a decrease in country risk and the easing of monetary policy, while willingness to lend primarily increases lending activity. The two financial shocks also differ in terms of their evolution over time: deviations from the average in the impact of a willingness to lend shock usually occur for short periods of time and are of a small degree between the various quarters. However, in the case of lending capacity, certain trends can be observed: before the crisis, the stability of the banking system played an increasing role in country risk, whereas after 2008 it appears that monetary policy paid increasing attention to financial stability. Finally, a new type of financial conditions index is quantified based on our estimates, which measures the impact of the banking system's lending activity on GDP growth.","[Hosszu, Zsuzsanna] Cent Bank Hungary, Szabadsag Ter 9, H-1054 Budapest, Hungary; [Hosszu, Zsuzsanna] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Fovam Ter 8, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary",Corvinus University Budapest,"Hosszú, Z (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Hungary, Szabadsag Ter 9, H-1054 Budapest, Hungary.",hosszuzs@mnb.hu,,,,,,,32,2,3,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0939-3625,1878-5433,,ECON SYST,Econ.

Using patents and knowledge capital stock as proxies for the output and input of the innovation process, we study their nexus in the emerging economy of India using a large sample of manufacturing firms over the period 2001-2010. Using a specification that addresses the problem of excess zeroes' in count data, the firm's non-technical knowledge stock as an additional factor of the success with which R&D transforms into patents, and a linear feedback mechanism that yields consistent estimators, we find that a one unit increase in knowledge capital likely raises expected patent count by only about 4.3% at most. Further, although patenting experience, resource access and knowledge spillovers are strongly significant in explaining patent counts, the magnitude of these effects is marginal at best. In brief, evidence for the knowledge production function is rather weak even in the context of a dynamic developing economy.","[Kanwar, Sunil; Singh, Shailu] Univ Delhi, Delhi, India",University of Delhi,"Kanwar, S (通讯作者)，Univ Delhi, Delhi Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Delhi 110007, India.",sunil_kanwar@econdse.org,,"Kanwar, Sunil/0000-0002-6112-2410",,,,,32,3,3,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

Macroeconomics since the crisis,OXFORD REVIEW OF ECONOMIC POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,macroeconomic models; pricing behaviour; measurement and data,INFLATION,"This paper argues that when the financial crisis came policy-makers relied on some version of the Hicksian sticky-price IS-LM as their default model; these models were 'good enough for government work'. While there have been many incremental changes suggested to the DSGE model, there has been no single 'big new idea' because the even simpler IS-LM type models were what worked well. In particular, the policy responses based on IS-LM were appropriate. Specifically, these models generated the insights that large budget deficits would not drive up interest rates and, while the economy remained at the zero lower bound, that very large increases in monetary base wouldn't be inflationary, and that the multiplier on government spending was greater than 1. The one big exception to this satisfactory understanding was in price behaviour. A large output gap was expected to lead to a large fall in inflation, but did not. If new research is necessary, it is on pricing behaviour. While there was a failure to forecast the crisis, it did not come down to a lack of understanding of possible mechanisms, or of a lack of data, but rather through a lack of attention to the right data.","[Krugman, Paul] CUNY, New York, NY 10021 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Krugman, P (通讯作者)，CUNY, New York, NY 10021 USA.",pkrugman@gc.cuny.edu,,,,,,,11,30,31,0,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Yet, in reality, at any particular point in time there is a trade-off between data coherence and theoretical coherence, and insisting that all academically respectable modelling should be at one extreme of this trade-off is a major mistake. The paper argues that if more traditional structural econometric models (SEMs) had been developed alongside microfounded models, links between finance and the real economy would have been more thoroughly explored before the financial crisis, allowing macroeconomists to respond better to the Great Recession. Just as microfoundations hegemony held back macroeconomics on that occasion, it is likely to do so again.

In particular, the use of assets in facilitating exchange, as well as different credit (or other financial) arrangements, should be outcomes of, not inputs to, theories. As a preview, I suggest that mainstream macro does a good job explaining many phenomena, and a financial crisis does not disprove such theory. But understanding crises requires better incorporating factors related to money, credit, banking, and liquidity.

In this paper, we review the history of Argentine trade policy to uncover its exceptional features and to explore its contribution to the Argentine debacle. Our analysis tells a story of bad trade policies, rooted in distributional conflict and shaped by changes in constraints, that favored industry over agriculture in a country with a fundamental comparative advantage in agriculture. While the anti-export bias impeded productivity growth in agriculture, the import substitution strategy was not successful in promoting an efficient industrialization.

We do not find empirical evidence for the existence of a natural resource curse in our sample. On the contrary, our results suggest a robust positive effect of oil rents on long-term economic growth. We then introduce interaction terms of oil rents with potential conditions under which oil dependency can lead to sub-standard growth. The results indicate that the positive effect of oil rents may be conditional on the quality of institutions.

For implementation, we use only the once- and twice-exercisable option values to approximate American option values. Our numerical results show that the effects of stochastic interest rates are very large, particularly for out-of-the-money American put options with a high-risk underlying asset price. For options with a high-risk return on asset as the underlying assets, the effects of stochastic interest rates are negligible, even for options with long-term maturity. Finally, the sign of correlation between asset prices and bond prices plays an important role in determining whether the values of American put options under stochastic interest rates are larger or smaller than those under constant interest rates.

We take advantage of variation in the partisan composition of Congressional districts stemming from Census-initiated redistricting in the 1990's, 2000's, and 2010's to examine how an increase in Democrat share within a district impacts the district representative's roll call voting. We find that an increase in Democrat share within a district causes more leftist roll call voting. This increase occurs because a Democrat is more likely to hold the seat, but also because - in contrast to existing empirical work - partisan composition has a direct effect on the roll call voting of individual representatives. The finding holds for both Democrats and Republicans. It is also true regardless of the nature of the redistricting (e.g., whether the redistricting was generated by a partisan or non-partisan process).

We contribute to this literature by selling identical simple goods (cell phone credits) at different prices from sellers that were identical except in name and with minimal ratings. The only way consumers could find us in this extremely thick market is to rank by price from lowest to highest. Out of 514 sales, 73 were of the higher priced item, for which we had non-negligible demand even when the price gap was 2%. Thus, even this selected sample of price-sensitive consumers do not necessarily buy the lowest priced item, all else being equal.

This is radically changing with breakthroughs in two technologies: (1) Photovoltaics (PV) enable domestic and commercial consumers to self-produce energy; (2) Batteries allow consumers and self-producers to gain control over their grid energy and capacity parameters. Contributing to the state of the art, the grid cost recovery problem for the Distribution System Operator (DSO) is modelled as a non-cooperative game between consumers. In this game, the availability and costs of the two named technologies strategically interact with tariff structures. Four states of the world for user's access to technologies are distinguished and three tariff structures are evaluated. The assessed distribution network tariff structures are: energy volumetric charges with net-metering, energy volumetric charges for both injection and withdrawal, and capacity-based charges. Results show that in a state of the world with new technology choices for grid users both efficiency and equity issues can arise when distribution network charges are ill-designed.

We consider that both economic issues such as job creation or reduction of import dependency, but also ecological issues including reducing greenhouse gas emissions are important in discussions about renewable energy in rural areas in Romania. By using linear regression it has been identified a strong correlation in Romania, for period 2004-2014, between share of renewable resources in gross final energy consumption and import dependency. Taking into account that energetic independence is a problem of great importance for each country, the paper aims to identify unused renewable energy potential in rural areas and also opportunities for developing renewable energy sector based on the resources that can be exploited with high efficiency, action that will generate economic and social positive effects. Our results reveal that Romania has a high development potential of rural areas using renewable energy because Romania has a high volume of renewable resources (sun, wind, water).

The nonparametric approach controls for the existing misspecification of a linear framework of causality, and hence, the mild evidence of causality obtained under the standard Granger tests cannot be relied upon. When we apply the nonparametric test, we find that there is no evidence of predictability of stock returns of these defense companies emanating from the geopolitical risk measure. However, the geopolitical risk index does predict realized volatility in 50% of the companies.

Specifically, we looked at the average ROA during the years 2004-2007 and compared it to the industry median.

Donald Trump proposed cutting taxes to provide tax relief for middle-class Americans, and lowering corporation taxes to boost economic growth, while Hillary Clinton proposed modest increases in taxes on high-income Americans, with a view to increasing the fairness of the tax code. We have simulated the effects of these two proposals, using a two-tier modeling design, with a large dynamic computable general equilibrium model to address the macroeconomic magnitudes, linked to a micro-simulation tax calculator model to measure the distributional effects. The Trump proposals would boost economic growth, but sharpening the incentives to work and to save/invest would be regressive, with 70% of the benefits accruing to those in the top income decile. The budget deficit could only be maintained if spending were to be cut sharply; and if spending were reduced more modestly, the deficit would rise greatly. The Clinton proposals would have little net effect on 90% of households, which is at odds with her promise of tax relief for working people, but would reduce net income in the top decile by almost 2%. They would slow economic growth slightly. Although he was elected president, Donald Trump's proposals are likely to be altered, mainly so that the budgetary effects are much smaller, before being presented to Congress. But the rationale, shape, and tone of the proposals will likely remain the same.","[Bhattarai, Keshab] Univ Hull, Business Sch, FBLP, Cottingham Rd, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7SH, N Humberside, England; [Bachman, Paul; Haughton, Jonathan; Tuerck, David G.] Suffolk Univ, Dept Econ, 8 Ashburton Pl, Boston, MA 02108 USA; [Bachman, Paul; Conte, Frank; Haughton, Jonathan; Tuerck, David G.] Suffolk Univ, Beacon Hill Inst, 8 Ashburton Pl, Boston, MA 02108 USA; [Head, Michael] IBM Watson Hlth, Cambridge, MA USA",University of Hull; Suffolk University; Suffolk University,"Bhattarai, K (通讯作者)，Univ Hull, Business Sch, FBLP, Cottingham Rd, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7SH, N Humberside, England.",K.R.Bhattarai@hull.ac.uk; pbachman@beaconhill.org; fconte@eastboston.com; jhaughton@suffolk.edu; dtuerck@beaconhill.org,"Bhattarai, Keshab/AAM-8733-2020; Bhattarai, Keshab/AFH-7332-2022","Bhattarai, Keshab/0000-0002-5398-984X",NCPA [NCPA-DCGE-2015/16],NCPA,Authors appreciate the NCPA (NCPA-DCGE-2015/16) grant for a project on the dynamic CGE model for tax policy analysis of the US.

However, the relationship with process innovation, R&D intensity, and product innovation intensity is insignificant. These results are in line with the idea that vertical educational diversity enhances the creative moment of the invention phase, while it has no effect on the commercialization phase due to the relevance of coordination and communication costs relative to the gains in creativity.","[Bolli, Thomas; Renold, Ursula; Woerter, Martin] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Bolli, T (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, Zurich, Switzerland.",bolli@kof.ethz.ch,"Woerter, Martin/E-6186-2010","Woerter, Martin/0000-0003-4467-9134; Bolli, Thomas/0000-0002-7317-6862",,,,,76,13,14,1,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

This multiplicity of fields induces a variety of felicity conditions and types of performed actions. If for example, an inference from a model is judged according to some epistemological criteria in the scientific field, the representation of the world which the model carries will not be judged by the same criteria outside the scientific field. A model can be considered as a standard in a strict scientific framework, while not being used as part of public policies, or vice versa.

This study extends both lines of research above by employing a unique panel data set consisting of 10 institutions that either added or eliminated college football between 1997 and 2015 in order to examine the impact of the presence of college football programme on both the size of university applicant pools and the quality of the students chosen for admission. Results from a panel data estimator presented here suggest that the size of their applicant pool shrinks the year following discontinuation of a college football programme.

Design/methodology/approach The authors employ a computable general equilibrium approach supplemented with qualitative analyses based on empirical evidence. Findings An increase in US import tariffs would result in economic losses for the USA and the corresponding country or region to which the import tariff increase is applied. An increase in US import tariffs for Chinese goods alone would not have any spillover effects on other East Asian countries. But, an imposition of a border adjustment tax (BAT) for all countries and for all products would actually boost US economic growth. Advanced economies would enjoy GDP increases, but China, Korea and the ASEAN countries would face an economic loss in a longer term period, although they would enjoy some growth in the short term. However, when the BAT only applies to a specific East Asian country, USA would suffer an economic loss, with the exception of a BAT specifically targeted at the ASEAN countries. ASEAN countries would not experience any economic loss under all scenarios except in the case of import tariffs specifically targeted at ASEAN. Research limitations/implications From the US perspective, it is beneficial to adopt a BAT for all countries and across the board. Under this arrangement, there would be an economic loss for China, Korea and the ASEAN countries in the longer term. An increase in US trade protectionism would only push the East Asian countries towards deeper economic integration, with serious implications for global pattern of trade and investment. Originality/value The existing literature on the likely economic impact of US trade protectionism on East Asia is very scarce and based on surveys and subjective speculations. This study uses a quantitative method based on empirical evidence.","[Cheong, Inkyo] Inha Univ, Coll Econ & Int Trade, Incheon, South Korea; [Tongzon, Jose] Inha Univ, Sch Logist, Tashkent, Uzbekistan",Inha University; INHA University Tashkent,"Tongzon, J (通讯作者)，Inha Univ, Sch Logist, Tashkent, Uzbekistan.",josetongzon@yahoo.com,,"Tongzon, Jose/0000-0002-6644-6983",,,,,15,5,6,5,25,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

This article contributes to this literature by empirically testing whether the time preference (discounting behaviour) is another important determinant of savings rate. To this end, we estimate the hyperbolic Euler equation using the generalized method of moments (GMM) to examine whether the short-run discount factor can account for savings behaviour. The empirical results show that people exhibit short-run patience (impatience) when savings rate increases (decreases), which is in line with the theoretical prediction. This result implies that the time preference also plays an important role in determining savings behaviour.

In laboratory experiments, we investigate how market interaction affects allocations when the right to divide a sum of money between oneself and a passive recipient is commoditized. Allocation to recipients is reduced by more than half when determined by subjects who purchase or keep the right to make the division as compared to a control where subjects are directly assigned the right. Sellers report accurate beliefs about recipient allocations and do not report feeling less responsible the more often they sell the allocation right. The market allocates the right to make divisions more frequently to buyers who allocate more to recipients, but sellers who allocate less to recipients tend to sell less often.

A similar rationing approach has been witnessed in California's recent drought. The aim of water restrictions is to slow the depletion of water storage but restrictions have also been criticized for the costs they impose on specific water users. In order to gain insight into the potential magnitude of the cost of water restrictions, this study uses a choice experiment to investigate the non-market values for specific attributes associated with the outcomes of drought restrictions. This information was sought to understand the community's willingness to pay for attributes related to the extent, frequency and duration of water restrictions. The article reports a latent class choice model for a major city in eastern Australia and investigates heterogeneity in preferences towards increasing water availability during drought. This study departs from the existing literature by conducting the choice experiment in a context where water supply is relatively abundant. This unique framing of the choice experiment allows for a useful comparison with existing studies and also raises challenges about the interpretation of the data for planning purposes.","[Cooper, Bethany; Crase, Lin] Univ South Australia, Sch Business, GPO Box 2471, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Burton, Michael] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Crawley, Australia",University of South Australia; University of Western Australia,"Cooper, B (通讯作者)，Univ South Australia, Sch Business, GPO Box 2471, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.",bethany.cooper@unisa.edu.au,"burton, michael/A-9541-2009; Crase, Lin/L-2072-2016; Cooper, Bethany/E-5425-2016","burton, michael/0000-0003-4213-4093; Crase, Lin/0000-0002-3615-7152; Cooper, Bethany/0000-0002-7484-1772",,,,,19,5,6,2,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Eight SAARC members and eight observed countries, including the EU, are analysed in capturing the trade effect of observed economies on intra-regional trade in SAARC. This article provides an empirical measure of observers' trade, FDI and Official development assistance (ODA) with SAARC if the exports and imports of observers to/from SAARC have positive or negative signs for intra-regional exports and imports. The results show that the exports and imports of observers to SAARC members have positive effects on bilateral exports among the members. The FDI of observers reduces the bilateral intra-imports in SAARC and ODA also has a negative effect on bilateral exports among the members. These results imply that the imports by SAARC members from observer countries increase intra-regional trade in the region. The FDI and ODA increase and decrease intra-regional trade in SAARC, respectively, implying that the policies for both FDI inflow from observers and efficient aid management are needed to increase regional welfare. The study also recommends that trade between SAARC members and its observers help to increase intra-regional trade in SAARC.","[De Silva, Dakshina G.] Univ Lancaster, Dept Econ, Lancaster, England; [Lee, Soon-Cheul] Busan Univ Foreign Studies, Busan, South Korea",Lancaster University; Pusan University Foreign Studies,"Lee, SC (通讯作者)，Busan Univ Foreign Studies, Busan, South Korea.",sclee@bufs.ac.kr,,"LEE, Soon-Cheul/0000-0001-5840-6167; De Silva, Dakshina/0000-0001-8820-1955",,,,,24,1,1,4,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This lack of reliable information should be particularly large in the case of recently promoted teams that have typically undergone major changes in the composition of their roster following their promotion. Without any information on the latter teams' potential performance, they are particularly difficult to evaluate, which may eventually lead to inefficiencies and positive returns on investment in the betting market. We analyse odds from German first division Bundesliga soccer for the seasons from 2002/03 to 2015/16 to find betting market inefficiencies at the start of the season. As expected, betting on recently promoted team wins generates temporarily positive returns, especially for away games. These results suggest bookmakers to underestimate promoted teams' ability to familiarize with the conditions in the new league, such as having to play in front of larger, often hostile crowds.","[Deutscher, Christian; Oetting, Marius] Bielefeld Univ, Dept Sport Sci, Bielefeld, Germany; [Frick, Bernd] Univ Paderborn, Dept Management, Paderborn, Germany; [Frick, Bernd] Schloss Seeburg Univ, Dept Sport Econ & Sport Mkt, Salzburg, Austria; [Oetting, Marius] Bielefeld Univ, Dept Business Adm & Econ, Bielefeld, Germany",University of Bielefeld; University of Paderborn; University of Bielefeld,"Deutscher, C (通讯作者)，Bielefeld Univ, Dept Sport Sci, Bielefeld, Germany.",christian.deutscher@uni-bielefeld.de,"Deutscher, Christian/AAN-8104-2020","Deutscher, Christian/0000-0002-3714-3326; Otting, Marius/0000-0002-9373-0365",,,,,17,16,16,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Based on different variants of development, it is expected that the average impact of CETA on the Slovak economy, as a result of the removal of the tariff barriers, will amount to 0.013% GDP, while the impact on job creation was estimated at 0.012% of the total employment.

In the model, housing market liquidity is very sensitive to changes in household credit conditions.

The usual role of commodity taxes in relaxing incentive constraints explains the remaining part of these taxes when there is taste heterogeneity between income classes.

By doing so, sellers can exploit their local monopoly power by adjusting prices or quantities once the local demand is realized. We find that when sellers can adjust quantities ex-post, there exists a unique symmetric equilibrium where an increase in the buyer-seller ratio leads to higher quantities and prices. When buyers instead can choose quantities ex-post, a higher buyer-seller ratio leads to higher prices but lower traded quantities. These equilibrium allocations are generically constrained inefficient in both intensive and extensive margins. When sellers post ex-ante quantities and adjust prices ex-post, a symmetric equilibrium exists where buyers obtain no surplus from trade. This equilibrium allocation is not constrained efficient either. If buyers choose prices ex-post, there is no trade in equilibrium when entry is costly.","[Wang, Liang] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Econ, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Gomis-Porqueras, Pedro] Deakin Univ, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia; [Julien, Benoit] Univ New South Wales, Kensington, NSW, Australia",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; Deakin University; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Wang, L (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Econ, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",lwang2@hawaii.edu,"Wang, Liang/AAF-3383-2020; Gomis-Porqueras, Pedro/AAS-6934-2020","Gomis-Porqueras, Pedro/0000-0002-3637-9142; Julien, Benoit/0000-0002-3993-9854",Australian Research Council [DP1701014229],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"Australian Research Council, (Grant / Award Number: 'DP1701014229')",,34,2,2,0,3,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

Banks with large capital ratios are persistently more profitable, and there is little evidence of a link between bank size and the persistence of bank profits. Commercial (saving) banks are persistently more (less) profitable in four of the six countries. The effects of the financial crisis in 2008 differed dramatically across countries as well as across ownership types.

We compare two groups of model structures: Armington assumption models and homogeneous goods models. Within these two groups of models, we also compare balanced trade structures to trade imbalance structures and production function transportation costs to iceberg transportation costs. Armington goods models generate more absolute welfare gains from transportation cost elimination than homogeneous goods models. Welfare gains under balanced trade structures are larger in production function transportation cost scenarios than in iceberg transportation cost scenarios, but under trade imbalance structures, welfare gains are greater under iceberg transportation cost scenarios. Canada's welfare gains in the iceberg transportation cost scenario are significantly larger than gains in the production function transportation cost scenario. On trade effects, homogeneous goods models generate more export and import gains, balanced trade structures have more trade variations, and iceberg transportation costs generate more trade effects.","[He, Chuantian] Guangdong Univ Foreign Studies, Sch Econ & Trade, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Li, Chunding] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst World Econ & Polit, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Whalley, John] Western Univ, Dept Econ, London, ON, Canada",Guangdong University of Foreign Studies; Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Li, CD (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst World Econ & Polit, Beijing, Peoples R China.",chundingli@gmail.com,,"He, Chuantian/0000-0001-6118-2707",,,,,31,1,1,2,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Simultaneously, this process has challenged the conventional view that countries urbanize alongside structural transformation, as urbanization in Africa has occurred despite low productivity gains in agriculture and very limited industrialization. While there are large household income gaps between urban and rural areas that induce migration, most cities have very high agricultural employment, blurring the connection between structural transformation and urbanization. Urban income premiums apply equally to farm and nonfarm families. Looking across the urban hierarchy, we discuss how high urban primacy presents problems for economic growth in Africa, how secondary cities are faltering with a lack of industrialization, and how growth of employment in tradable services may signal a different path to structural transformation.","[Henderson, J.

In this respect, a new model used together with the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and fuzzy Multi-Objective Optimization on the Basis of Ratio Analysis (MOORA), multi-criteria decision methods are proposed. In a real decision process, there are many uncertainties and ambiguities. In fact decision makers cannot always provide practical guidelines and especially precise judgments due to time limitations. The intelligent model proposed demonstrates that the AHP and fuzzy MOORA approach can not only be used easily to imitate the decision duration in the material selection but also the results obtained from this work provide contractors valuable insight into the material selection problem. At the same time, the quantitative analysis method based on the appropriately raised floor materials along the bidding process enables the builders to use their restricted resources more expeditiously and enhances considerably the possibility of winning agreement, as one of the most striking points deduced from the present study. In short, the model with AHP and fuzzy MOORA approaches can assist the builders to improve resolutions for the bidding.","[Ilce, Abdullah Cemil] Abant Izzet Baysal Univ, Fac Engn & Architecture, Dept Ind Engn, TR-14280 Golkoy Yerleskesi Merkez, Turkey; [Ozkaya, Kadir] Pamukkale Univ, Denizli Vocat Sch Tech Sci, Dept Mat & Mat Proc Technol, Camlaralti Mah Fak Cad 30, TR-20160 Denizli, Turkey",Abant Izzet Baysal University; Pamukkale University,"Ilce, AC (通讯作者)，Abant Izzet Baysal Univ, Fac Engn & Architecture, Dept Ind Engn, TR-14280 Golkoy Yerleskesi Merkez, Turkey.",cemil.ilce@gmail.com,,,,,,,62,13,14,0,9,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Contrary to prior studies, our analysis opts for a recent and robust technical setting within the framework of multivariate two-state Markov switching models. The findings indicate that the model is well suited to deal accurately with switching behaviour of the cointegrated relationships due to international economic events. The impulse response analysis reveals that government spending changes have a significant impact on output, consumption, investment, and reserves, with varied reactions for the last two aggregates across regimes. The effects are persistent throughout the impulse response horizon, except for reserves over the second regime. In comparison with an analysis based on a single regime model, the results point to the importance of differentiating the impulse responses between two regimes in order to maximize the effectiveness of the fiscal policy. The findings could help policymakers to establish efficient economic decisions to boost the economy.

Thus, the research is organized in two parts. The first part includes the evaluation of the significance and importance of IC at the level of a company level, of individual transactions and of sub-processes; it also examines the impact of IC on the financial performance of a company, as well as the effects of certain IC elements related to the sub-processes on the overall significance of IC. The second part of the research is about identifying the existence of dissimilarities in terms of the significance and importance of IC in companies by the type of business entity (i.e. the legal form) and the type of business activity. In accordance with the stated objectives of the research, data analysis is performed by using the following statistical and econometric methods: regression analysis and hypothesis testing for equality of arithmetic means and proportionality. This paper presents the results of the first part of the research. Based on the created database containing the collected structural data, the results of surveys and the specified regression models, as well as the results of quantitative analyses and the derived conclusions on the statistical significance of the effects of the specified independent variables, it is possible to obtain valid information on the importance and significance of IC for a company's operations. The results and information obtained from the first part of the research and the results obtained after the application of the statistical and econometric analysis are contrasted by means of comparative analysis. The results of this research will facilitate obtaining sound scientific information to be used for strategic management, planning and decision-making at all levels of a company regarding the significance and importance of internal control.","[Jovetic, Slavica; Ljubisavljevic, Snezana; Karapavlovic, Nemanja] Univ Kragujevac, Fac Econ, Kragujevac, Serbia",University of Kragujevac,"Jovetic, S (通讯作者)，Univ Kragujevac, Fac Econ, Kragujevac, Serbia.",,,,,,,,38,0,1,9,45,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,2720-5088,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

We compute the optimal allocation when ability is persistent across generations, as calibrated for the U.S. We show how the allocation can be implemented with student loans featuring contingent repayments.

Classic tools of financial analysis emphasize data in financial statements. When frying to reach an overall classification of a company, e.g. from the point of view of an investor, indicators of profitability, liquidity, leverage and activity might generate contradictory clues regarding financial health of the company. Such analysis does not only generate ambiguous results, but is also lengthy. Therefore, the IN05 financial model was created for particular specifics of the Czech Republic economic environment to predict prosperity of companies. It measures the prosperity on the base of economic value added (EVA). More than ten years have passed since the launch of the IN05 index. The aim of this study is to quantify contemporary prediction strength of the IN05 index on a sample of almost 500 companies. Moreover, an effort was made to enhance the accuracy of the model for particular branches of manufacturing industries. It was found that contemporary explanatory power of the index IN05 is 48.58 when applying the original evaluation scale, and 70.79 % when assessing 68.62 % of the sample except the gray zone. The accuracy of the model was enhanced by the author in all categories, i.e. a higher accuracy (correct prediction probability) without considering the gray zone and higher accuracy (conditioned correct prediction probability) using the gray zones in all branches of manufacturing industries. Robustness of these results was verified on another sample of 195 companies.","[Kubenka, Michal] Univ Pardubice, Studentska 95, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Kubenka, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Studentska 95, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic.",michal.kubenka@upce.cz,,,,,,,53,3,3,2,23,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We find that common movements of money supply, prices and economic sentiments each play a major role in comovements of the exchange rates.

Firstly, a modified satisfaction degree of alternative is presented, based on which a mathematical model for determining the stage weights is constructed. Secondly, the compromise ratio method (CRM), whose basic principle is that the optimal alternative should have the nearest distance from positive ideal solution and the longest distance from negative ideal solution simultaneously, is extended to accommodate hesitant fuzzy environment, and then adopted to tackle the dynamic decision-making with hesitant fuzzy information.

This article investigates the impact of animal disease outbreaks on the sustainability of China's meat imports by using the episode of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the United States in 2003 as a case study. Our results show that China's meat imports are becoming more diversified and sustainable. The outbreak did have significant negative impacts on beef imports from the United States. During the epidemic, not only was China able to increase beef imports from other major exporters, but it also increased imports of other animal products such as edible offal and pork. Our findings indicate that international trade can serve as a reliable source to meet China's soaring meat consumption.","[Luo, Zijun] Sam Houston State Univ, Coll Business Adm, Dept Econ & Int Business, Huntsville, TX 77340 USA; [Tian, Xu] Nanjing Agr Univ, China Ctr Food Secur Studies, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Texas State University System; Sam Houston State University; Nanjing Agricultural University,"Tian, X (通讯作者)，Nanjing Agr Univ, China Ctr Food Secur Studies, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",xutian@njau.edu.cn,,", xu/0000-0002-1070-3581","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71333008, 71473123]; National Social Science Foundation of China [14ZDA037]; Priority Academic Program Development (PAPD) of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions, P.

Total employment increased by more than five million. This process altered the sectoral and occupational structure of employment. The dynamics of final demand, technology and labour requirements linked to technology and labour market institutions mostly drive shifts in the structure of employment. We analyse their effects and relative weights on private employment growth in an input-output framework, by means of structural decomposition. The analysis of the occupational structure is a novelty. Sectoral and occupational structures of employment are receiving a great deal of attention: the productivity growth and economic prospects of service economies and the debate between skilling and polarization are, respectively, the main issues.

In this review, we show how the combination of geographic information systems with insights from disciplines ranging from the earth sciences to linguistics and history has transformed the research landscape on the roots of the spatial patterns of development.

Commons, regulation theory, and convention theory. In institutional economics (Commons 1934), by applying the idea of multiple causation, Commons approached macro-dynamics based on the expansion of some key concepts and studies on income distribution and demand growth. It is a prototype of the growth analysis based on the cumulative causation model, with the various forms of coordination later formulated by regulation theory. The two-layered coordination in convention theory attempted to explicitly explain the individuals' reflexive capacities to change preference endogenously and to evaluate collective and social value, which were implicitly assumed in Commons's term intellect.","[Nakahara, Takayuki] Hannan Univ, Econ, Matsubara, Osaka, Japan",,"Nakahara, T (通讯作者)，Hannan Univ, Econ, Matsubara, Osaka, Japan.",,"Nakahara, Takayuki/HSG-0028-2023",,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS); KAKENHI [26285048]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26285048] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","Takayuki Nakahara is a professor of economics at Hannan University (Japan).

The stationarity of variables under consideration at different orders require the application of the bounds testing approach to cointegration. The findings based on open economy IS-LM framework induce a negative effect of currency depreciation on output levels. This is consistent with the long-run estimates of the autoregressive distributive lag (ARDL) model. The short-run estimates of error-correction model (ECM) may lead to significant increment in output levels because of the depreciation of Pakistan rupee. Government spending may cause to reduce the output in the short-run, as well as, in long-run which furnishes strong support to crowding out hypothesis. The terms of trade, positive in the short-run, are negatively related to output in the long-run. However, surprise money has been insignificant in both long-run and short-run ECM.

Based on an analysis of four sets of occupational data drawn from the Indian Census (1981, 1991, 2001 and 2011), this paper demonstrates that, as a process driven largely by the outmigration of men from rural areas, the feminization of agriculture has no necessary relationship with wider INDICATORS of women's social or economic empowerment. Instead, women's growing participation in agriculture appears to be strongly related to several indicators of poverty. This paper concludes that women's growing contribution of labour in agriculture adds to the already heavy work burdens of most rural women, thereby further undermining their well-being, and suggests that the feminization of agriculture may better be described as the feminization of agrarian distress.","[Pattnaik, Itishree] GIDR, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India; [Lahiri-Dutt, Kuntala] Australian Natl Univ, ANU Coll Asia & Pacific, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Resource Environm & Dev Program, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Lockie, Stewart] James Cook Univ, Cairns Inst, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Pritchard, Bill] Univ Sydney, Sch Geosci, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Australian National University; James Cook University; University of Sydney,"Pattnaik, I (通讯作者)，GIDR, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India.",itishreep@gidr.ac.in,"Pattnaik, Itishree/AAP-9229-2020; Lahiri-Dutt, Kuntala/AAY-1526-2021; Pattnaik, ITishree/ACM-1502-2022; Lockie, Stewart/J-5263-2014","Pattnaik, ITishree/0000-0002-9653-9531; Lockie, Stewart/0000-0002-2109-6342; Lahiri-Dutt, Kuntala/0000-0003-1336-1422; Pritchard, Bill/0000-0001-7506-2095",Australian Research Council [DP 140101682]; Indian Council for Social Science research (ICSSR),Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Indian Council for Social Science research (ICSSR),"This work is a part of the project Farmers of Future: Challenges of Feminized Agriculture in India funded jointly by Australian Research Council (DP 140101682) and Indian Council for Social Science research (ICSSR).

In the model, a financial intermediary seeks to raise funds from many small investors, to finance a capital-intensive project. Investors face a coordination problem, as more capital invested in the project increases its chances of success. We employ a global games refinement to characterize the unique equilibrium of the game. The model features a non-monotonic relationship between the cost of capital and project profitability. There exists a 'socially optimal' price of capital that maximizes the probability of project success. However, fee-maximizing intermediaries set a return that is higher than the optimal rate. This higher cost of capital is the result of coordination frictions and suggests an inefficiency of the intermediation process. The model best characterizes project finance investments funded through bond markets and yields implications for their cost of capital.","[Peia, Oana] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Econ, Dublin, Ireland; [Vranceanu, Radu] ESSEC Business Sch, Cergy, France; [Vranceanu, Radu] THEMA, Cergy, France",University College Dublin; ESSEC Business School,"Peia, O (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Econ, Dublin, Ireland.",oana.peia@essec.edu; vranceanu@essec.fr,,"Peia, Oana/0000-0003-1868-6584; Vranceanu, Radu/0000-0003-2050-8269",,,,,45,2,2,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Aside from reducing poverty, microfinance can potentially improve health because it is the poor who are usually more constrained from health investments due to limited budgets. Furthermore, microfinancing specifically targets women, who are more likely to spend additional income on children's well-being. Finally, several MFIs have also begun to offer health-related services, such as health education, health-care financing, clinical care, training community health workers, health micro-insurance and linkages to public and private health providers. Using a new data set, this article conducts the first multi-country study of the effect of microfinance on child mortality, the health outcome, which is most sensitive to the effects of absolute deprivation. Our findings confirm that an increase in the proportion of MFI clients in a country is significantly associated with lower under-five and infant mortality rates. We conclude that if MFIs' educational and health services have indeed caused improvements in health outcomes at the community level, then it may be important for governments to complement these activities with similar campaigns, particularly in remote areas where MFI penetration is low.","[Posso, Alberto] RMIT Univ, Int Dev & Trade Res Grp, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Athukorala, Prema-chandra] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Arndt Corden Dept Econ, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Australian National University,"Posso, A (通讯作者)，RMIT Univ, Int Dev & Trade Res Grp, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",alberto.posso@rmit.edu.au,,"Posso, Alberto/0000-0003-4226-7072",,,,,47,2,3,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Evidence from the Korean economy,APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Supply chain networks; firm growth; small and medium enterprises; spillover effects,,"Previous literature has found that inter-firm cooperation leads to higher growth rates for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). However, these studies have focused only on direct effects, such as subcontracting, rather than on spillover effects in supply chain networks (SCNs). Regarding the spillover effects, this article investigates whether a large firm's growth leads to the growth of the directly and indirectly related SMEs in its SCN, using Korean firm-level data with the system Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) approach. The estimation results show that increases in the sales of large firms significantly affect the growth rates of the related SMEs. These effects, however, diminish as the relationship with the large firm goes down from the first vendor to the second vendor and from the second vendor to the third vendor. In the case of Korea, when a large firm grows by 1%, the first vendor grows by 0.38-0.44%, but the growth rates of the second and third vendors are only 0.036-0.047% and 0.003-0.005%, respectively. Thus, while there are spillover effects, the effects are weak.

Evidence from OECD countries,APPLIED ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Finance; financial development; stock market; economic development; growth; risk,EQUITY MARKETS; STOCK MARKETS; PANEL-DATA; SYSTEMS; INTERMEDIATION; DATABASE; MODELS; CRISES; BANKS; RISK,"Over the last decades, a large strand of finance and growth literature has provided ample evidence on the importance of financial deepening for economic development. Yet, recently, the focus of public debate has shifted towards the role of the financial system structure, an area in which empirical research remains relatively sparse and exploratory in nature. With this article, we aim to contribute to that debate by analysing the role the financial system structure plays in economic growth and risk. Focusing on stock markets and studying OECD economies over 1994-2013, we find that, ceteris paribus, financial systems with relatively larger stock markets facilitate economic growth and dampen economic risk. Our findings remain robust under application of instrumental variable and system generalized method of moments estimators, as well as when we use an alternative definition of stock market development, estimate median regressions, examine relatively high-frequency annual data, control for systemic banking crises or apply quadratic specifications. We find no such effect for private bond markets or private credit volume. Overall, our results suggest that financial system structure matters for the economic development of advanced economies and highlight the importance of a debate about the optimal structure of an economy's financial system.","[Rapp, Marc Steffen; Udoieva, Iuliia A.] Philipps Univ Marburg, Sch Business & Econ, Plan 1, D-35032 Marburg, Germany; [Rapp, Marc Steffen] Copenhagen Business Sch, Ctr Corp Governance, Frederiksberg, Denmark",Philipps University Marburg; Copenhagen Business School,"Rapp, MS (通讯作者)，Philipps Univ Marburg, Sch Business & Econ, Plan 1, D-35032 Marburg, Germany.",msr@m-s-rapp.de,,"Udoieva, Iuliia A./0000-0002-9843-4493; Rapp, Marc Steffen/0000-0001-9859-6014",,,,,45,10,10,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Based on the results from an empirical specification for team revenue, we find evidence that the reduction in revenue sharing increased marginal revenue by more for large market clubs than for small market clubs, despite holding constant other differences in how small and large market club revenues are determined. The upshot of this result is that the modest reduction in revenue sharing could have worsened league parity by 11 to 17 points in winning percentage between small and large market clubs, although other factors affect parity as well. The well-known invariance principle in the economics of sport literature does not appear to hold; however, the current consensus of theoretical models is not confirmed.","[Rockerbie, Duane W.] Univ Lethbridge, Dept Econ, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada",University of Lethbridge,"Rockerbie, DW (通讯作者)，Univ Lethbridge, Dept Econ, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada.",rockerbie@uleth.ca,,,,,,,34,1,1,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This article provides new evidence about the impact of preschool years on educational outcomes by exploiting a peculiar Spanish database that supplies information on two classrooms at fourth grade in primary schools where students were randomly allocated into each group. Using an identification strategy that reproduces a natural experiment, we find that belonging to the group with more average years of preschool education significantly and positively impacts on fourth-grade students' average outcomes. Particularly, an increase of one standard deviation in the difference in years of preschool attendance results in an increase of 0.16 (0.13) standard deviations in the group achievement for mathematics (reading). In view of the importance of preschool education and considering that preschool attendance before 3 years old is related with socio-economic variables, we conclude that extending free preschool education to the 2-year-old age group in Spain should be considered especially for students in families with less favourable backgrounds.","[Santin, Daniel] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Appl Econ Publ Econ & Polit Econ, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain; [Sicilia, Gabriela] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Econ & Publ Finance, Campus Cantoblanco, Madrid, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid; Autonomous University of Madrid,"Santín, D (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Appl Econ Publ Econ & Polit Econ, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain.",dsantin@ccee.mcm.es,"Sicilia, Gabriela/Y-4657-2019; Santín, Daniel/I-7784-2016","Santín, Daniel/0000-0002-1654-1659; Sicilia, Gabriela/0000-0002-1078-7762",Fundacion Ramon Areces; European Foundation Society and Education,Fundacion Ramon Areces; European Foundation Society and Education,The authors declare that this study was funded by the Fundacion Ramon Areces and the European Foundation Society and Education.,,36,1,1,2,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Price determination is a matter of high importance in both the academic community and managerial practices. The aim of the paper is to present a novel method of price determination based on reference price. The method presented is inspired by a fuzzy sets graphical interpretation and provides an alternative approach to the standard product price determination problem. It uses the satisfaction of customers as well as product sellers to find the optimal price for particular market. The method is based on two fundamental steps. First the method of product perception for a single customer is developed and then the method for the whole market is derived. The individual changing trend of customers' willingness to pay at each price level constitutes the essence of the method presented. The application of the suggested method is presented via empirical data obtained from the snowboard market. The results have a direct impact on managerial decision-making of the seller in terms of pricing. The resultant price given by the analysis conducted through the suggested method allows sellers to maximize the revenues related to a particular product. Moreover if the seller's goal is not to maximize revenues, but to achieve maximal market share, the price should be the same as the optimal willingness to pay price. These conclusions are explicitly mentioned in order to demonstrate that the suggested approach allows the definition of custom objectives by the seller.","[Schuller, David; Pekarek, Jan; Chlebovsky, Vit; Simberova, Iveta] Brno Univ Technol, Kolejni 4, Brno 61200, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,"Schuller, D (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Kolejni 4, Brno 61200, Czech Republic.",schuller@fbm.vutbr.cz; pekarek@fbm.vutbr.cz; chlebovsky@fbm.vutbr.cz; simberova@fbm.vutbr.cz,"Šimberová, Iveta/J-6472-2019; Simberova, Iveta/B-2037-2009; Schüller, David/IAL-9745-2023","Šimberová, Iveta/0000-0002-9236-4439; Chlebovsky, Vit/0000-0002-0710-3825",,,,,53,1,1,0,16,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The formal evaluation of such forecasts has attracted considerable attention in literature. However, empirical studies focusing on China are limited. This paper firstly proposes a new approach to test forecasts' accuracy and efficiency under asymmetric loss function by using a unique dataset from surveys conducted by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange in China. It is found that forecasters of the four macroeconomic variables (i.e., GDP growth rate, CPI, exports and imports) partially utilize new information and publicly available information under LINEX loss function when they update the forecasts, which are similar to those under quadratic loss function. Besides, a new finding in this paper is that over-smoothing hardly exists in the forecasts of GDP growth rate and CPI in China, which is different from the results in developed countries.

The main research methods are selected methods of financial analysis and personal interview with manager-owners of selected SMEs. The research confirmed that not all strategic development determinants are considered among SMEs as equally important. The monitored SMEs consider strategy for business development as important, although only 47% of them have a formulated strategy. Individual functional and corporate strategies and defined areas of strategic management are not considered by SMEs as equally important. The size of the SME has a direct impact on strategy formulation - the bigger the enterprise, the higher the probability that a strategy is formulated. The research also confirmed formulating and implementing a strategy has a positive effect on the economic results of the SME.","[Svatosova, Veronika] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Reg Dev & Int Studies, Trida Gen Piky 2005-7, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Svatosová, V (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Reg Dev & Int Studies, Trida Gen Piky 2005-7, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",veronika.svatosova@mendelu.cz,"Svatošová, Veronika/AAF-4918-2020","Svatošová, Veronika/0000-0002-5308-8822",,,,,36,6,6,0,24,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

In the models, consumers rationally determine whether to exhibit strategic waiting by weighing their costs against prospectively lower price. Our analysis yields three main results. First, single pricing that completely eliminates strategic waiting surely would be dominated by intertemporal pricing when facing rational consumers. Second, preannounced pricing may actually yield lower revenue than dynamic pricing when considering its effect on the reduction of consumer monitoring cost. Only when monitoring costs under dynamic pricing and under preannounced pricing are equal, is firm revenue weakly greater under preannounced pricing than under dynamic pricing. Third, in dynamic pricing equilibrium, increasing monitoring cost may increase firm revenue, consumer surplus and social welfare simultaneously.","[Tang, Xuan; Zheng, Xiaona] Peking Univ, Guanghua Sch Management, Bldg 2, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Peking University,"Zheng, XN (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Guanghua Sch Management, Bldg 2, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",xzheng@gsm.pku.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71272039, 71332006]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China: [Grant numbers 71272039, 71332006].",,21,1,1,3,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The 'global saving glut' (GSG) view, a prominent hypothesis, attributes the emergence of the global financial crisis to an excess of saving over investment, mirroring the current-account surplus, in emerging market countries. Crucially, according to this view, the financial crisis was triggered by an external and exogenous driver, not the shadow banking system in advanced countries which was the epicenter of the financial crisis. Instead, we argue that the global financial crisis was inherently caused by the endogenously dynamic process of balance-sheet expansion at a handful of large complex financial institutions (LCFIs) in the US and Europe. Importantly, this process was facilitated by the endogenous finance of the global dollar in the shadow banking system in the 2000s before the financial crisis. The endogenous finance of the global dollar became highly elastic during 2004-2006, accelerating the dynamically overstretched nature of balance sheets at LCFIs that contributed to the build-up of global financial fragility. Thus, the supreme position of the US dollar as a debt-financing currency in the shadow banking system, underpinned by the dominant role of the dollar in the development of new financial innovations and instruments, was an important, but underappreciated, driving force in this endogenously dynamic and ultimately destructive process.","[Tokunaga, Junji] Dokkyo Univ, Dept Econ, Saitama, Japan; [Epstein, Gerald] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Epstein, Gerald] PERI, Amherst, MA USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Tokunaga, JJ (通讯作者)，Dokkyo Univ, Dept Econ, Saitama, Japan.",,,,Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET),Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET),"We thank the Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET) for financial support.

The empirical results reveal that the Islamic stock market has a considerable negative exposure to interest rate risk, although a declining time pattern of interest rate sensitivity is observed. The unexpected changes in the level factor of the U.S. yield curve, closely linked to long-term interest rates, are identified as the most important interest rate factor in explaining the variability of Islamic equity returns. Furthermore, the interest rate exposure tends to be stronger during extreme bearish conditions in the stock market, possibly due to the greater pessimism and risk aversion under these market circumstances. It is also shown that Islamic equities are not different from their mainstream counterparts in terms of interest rate sensitivity, indicating that the Islamic stock market does not provide a cushion against interest rate risk.","[Umar, Zaghum] Zayed Univ, Coll Business, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Shahzad, Syed Jawad Hussain] Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier, France; [Ferrer, Roman] Univ Valencia, Valencia, Spain; [Jareno, Francisco] UCLM, Albacete, Spain",Zayed University; Montpellier Business School; University of Valencia; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,"Jareño, F (通讯作者)，UCLM, Albacete, Spain.",francisco.jareno@uclm.es,"Jareño, Francisco/L-7645-2014; Shahzad, Syed Jawad Hussain/D-1986-2019; Jareño, Francisco/AAO-8995-2020; Umar, Zaghum/HNI-4719-2023; umar, zaghum/AAE-6841-2021","Jareño, Francisco/0000-0001-9778-7345; Shahzad, Syed Jawad Hussain/0000-0003-3511-6057; Jareño, Francisco/0000-0001-9778-7345; Umar, Zaghum/0000-0002-0425-2665; Ferrer, Roman/0000-0003-0275-0596",,,,,44,37,37,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Using panel data with roughly 54,000 Swedish households, a dynamic probit model is estimated. The results suggest that the choice of contract exhibits substantial state dependence, with an estimated marginal effect of previous contract choice of 0.96, and that the short-run effects of variation in prices and temperature on the choice of electricity contract are small. Further, the state dependence and price responsiveness are similar across housing types, income levels and other dimensions. A plausible explanation of these results is that transaction costs are perceived to be larger than the relatively small cost savings from switching between contracts. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The severity of public sector wage cuts employed as a response to the economic crisis and subsequent recovery provides a test bed to analyse whether and how the public-private sector wage gap has adjusted after consolidation-driven wage cuts. Findings reveal that the observed wage gap is slightly in favour of the public sector; however, once differences in individual characteristics and selection effects are considered, results point to a private sector wage premium. Findings also suggest that the private sector wage premium has increased since the pre-crisis period. A significant private sector wage premium raises doubts on whether a system that is reliant on discretionary fiscal measures is efficient enough in eliminating unwarranted differences in wage. In particular, whether a re-adjustment process of public sector wages works after consolidation-driven wage cuts.","[Vilerts, Karlis] Univ Latvia, Fac Business Management & Econ, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Vilerts, K (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Fac Business Management & Econ, Riga, Latvia.",karlis.vilerts@bank.lv,,,University of Latvia,University of Latvia,The author is grateful to the University of Latvia for providing financial assistance for purchasing the anonymised LFS microdata.,,43,13,13,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1406-099X,2334-4385,,BALT J ECON,Balt.

The sample data used in this study consisted of the intraday data, with thirty minutes stock price, of Taiwan, Japan, and Hong Kong from 2012 to 2015. By taking into consideration the effects of asymmetric volatility, we employed the GJR-GARCH model to capture stock market returns. In addition, as the volatility of the stock market is affected by a number of economic factors, this study included the market situation, whether a bear or bull market type, as an additional condition to explore whether market condition renders the weather effects more significant.

In this article, we empirically investigate this policy's effect on the housing market. Using a difference-in-difference framework, we show that the housing purchase restriction policy reduces housing prices and transaction amounts but does not influence the housing investment or construction markets. Moreover, upstream industry suffers more than downstream industry. The results are robust to a battery of robustness checks. Heterogeneity exists across cities. We find that first- and second-tier cities as well as highly urbanized cities experience great declines in housing prices after the policy's implementation, especially cites that had high housing prices in 2010 and cities with high real estate investment as a proportion of fixed asset investment. However, the housing policy is less effective in curbing speculative demand.","[Wu, Yi] Jinan Univ, Dept Accounting, Sch Business, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yi] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Int Sch Business & Finance, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Li, Yunong] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Int Business, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Jinan University; Sun Yat Sen University; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Wu, Y (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, 601 Western Huangpu Ave, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;Wu, Y (通讯作者)，Sun Yat Sen Univ, Zhuhai 519082, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",angeliawuyi@gmail.com,,"WU, YI/0000-0003-0354-5658; LI, YUNONG/0000-0001-8225-7018","Fund of Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China","Fund of Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China","Supported by the Fund of Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China.",,30,26,28,7,108,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

These two models split decision making units into two subsets - efficient and inefficient. The second group can be easily ranked according to efficiency score of the units. The efficient units have identical efficiency scores and cannot be ranked directly. That is why this paper also aims to compare two important super-efficiency models derived from conventional CCR and SBM models - they are Andersen and Petersen model and SBM super-efficiency model. The results of all models are illustrated on a real data set - companies selling sports equipment and accessories in the Czech Republic.

This is pertinent for analyzing use externalities but limits our understanding of property institutions: A central problem of property markets lies in the interaction among multiple transactions, which causes exchange-related and non-contractible externalities. By retaining a single-exchange simplification, the economic analysis of property has encouraged views that: overemphasize the initial allocation of property rights, while some form of recurrent allocation is often needed; pay scant attention to legal rights, although these determine enforceability and, therefore, economic value; and overestimate the power of unregulated private ordering, despite its inability to protect third parties. These three biases have been a misleading policy in many areas, including land titling and business firm formalization.","[Arrunada, Benito] Pompeu Fabra Univ, Dept Econ & Business, Barcelona, Spain; [Arrunada, Benito] Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University; Barcelona School of Economics,"Arruñada, B (通讯作者)，Pompeu Fabra Univ, Dept Econ & Business, Barcelona, Spain.;Arruñada, B (通讯作者)，Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain.",benito.arrunada@upf.edu,"Arruñada, Benito/M-3408-2019","Arruñada, Benito/0000-0003-1391-9895",Spanish Government [ECO2014-57131-R],Spanish Government(Spanish Government),"This work has benefitted from exchanges with two reviewers, Yoram Barzel, Elodie Bertrand, Gillian Hadfield, Dean Lueck, Claude Menard, Fernando Mendez, Thomas Merrill, Henry Smith, and Giorgio Zanarone.

To avoid selection issues present in natural environments, we use an experiment in which we create simple laboratory firms and assign leadership roles at random. In our first experiment, firms engage in competition and unethical behavior enhances firm earnings but produces a negative externality for all firms. We vary, by treatment, two instruments through which leaders can influence follower conduct-prominent statements to the group and the allocation of monetary incentives. We find that leaders influence the ethical conduct of followers both through their statements and through the use of incentives. Moreover, leaders who are likely to have acted dishonestly in a preliminary stage of the experiment are more likely to employ mechanisms to encourage dishonesty among followers. As a result, firms randomly assigned one of these unethical leaders are more likely to engage in misreporting. A second experiment finds that the above relationships are present, though weaker, when firms do not engage in direct competition.

We find that the label significantly improves students' ratings of a university's educational quality and their job market expectations immediately following the award.

According to canonical models, a decrease in housing wealth has a symmetric negative impact on the fertility behavior of households. That is, housing gains and losses of the same size have identical quantitative effects on fertility. In comparison, the reference-dependent preferences in prospect theory suggest that people care more about housing losses than equivalent gains, leading to an asymmetric effect of housing wealth on the fertility decision. We propose a theoretical model where household utility depends on both childbirth and housing wealth. In this model, the utility from housing wealth is reference dependent in the sense that we assume the housing value in the previous year is the reference. The theoretical model suggests that a decrease in housing wealth would have a larger impact on the probability of childbirth than an equivalent increase. We test this theoretical prediction using longitudinal data on Japanese households. Consistent with the theoretical prediction, our empirical results show that the fertility responses of homeowners are substantially larger for housing losses than equivalent gains.","[Iwata, Shinichiro] Univ Toyama, Fac Econ, Toyama, Japan; [Naoi, Michio] Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan",University of Toyama; Keio University,"Iwata, S (通讯作者)，Univ Toyama, Fac Econ, Toyama, Japan.",iwata@eco.u-toyama.ac.jp,"Iwata, Shinichiro/AAZ-5353-2020; Naoi, Michio/Y-3640-2019","Iwata, Shinichiro/0000-0002-3161-7180; Naoi, Michio/0000-0002-5088-2828","JSPS KAKENHI [JP25380288, JP25870238]; Seimei-Kai; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24000003, 17H02072, 16H06323, 17H00988, 26504013, 16K03655] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Seimei-Kai; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We would like to thank two anonymous reviewers, Mototsugu Fukushige, Hassan Gholipour Fereidouni, Robert Jahoda and Yuko Nozaki, seminar participants at Gakushuin University, Kanagawa University and the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research, and conference attendees at ARSC, AsRES, ENHR, ERES and JEA for their valuable comments and suggestions.

More precisely, we use a wide dataset that contains 473 manufacturing industries, that are clustered based on their annual change of hourly earnings per worker and we make an attempt to interpret the economic fluctuations in the clusters formed. Meanwhile, we study the causal relationships between the crucial variables dictated by Schumpeterian theory. In this context, a number of relevant techniques have been used, such as hierarchical clustering, canonical discriminant analysis, cointegration analysis, periodograms and Granger causality tests. Our findings seem to give credit to certain aspects of the Schumpeterian theory of business cycles. The results are discussed in a broader context, related to the US economy. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

For this purpose, we adapt a recently developed nonparametric simulated maximum likelihood estimation based on kernel methods. In combination with the model developed by Brock and Hommes (1998), which is one of the most widely analysed heterogeneous agent models in the literature, we extensively test the properties and behaviour of the estimation framework, as well as its ability to recover parameters consistently and efficiently using simulations. Key empirical findings indicate the statistical insignificance of the switching coefficient but markedly significant belief parameters that define heterogeneous trading regimes with a predominance of trend following over contrarian strategies. In addition, we document a slight proportional dominance of fundamentalists over trend-following chartists in major world markets. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We argue that parental preference for sons over daughters creates a supply of, and demand for, prepubescent brides in impoverished societies. Evidence from India, one of the most son preferring and child-bride populous nations in the world, supports our theory's predictions: stronger son preference is associated with the birth of more unwanted daughters, younger postpubescent-female age at marriage, and a higher incidence of prepubescent brides. Moreover, son preference has a stronger positive association with prepubescent brides where poverty is more extreme; prepubescent brides have lower quality husbands than postpubescent brides; and stronger son preference is associated with a higher ratio of traditional-marriage-aged males to females.

Evidence from Poland,OECONOMIA COPERNICANA,,,English,Article,,,,,,general grants; revenue equalization; own revenues; revenue equalisation function; Poland,,"Research background: General grants in the system of local government finance should pursue five different functions. One of them is revenue equalization. This function is achieved if the revenue gap is reduced after the application of the subsidising mechanism. In addition, to be completed, the size of the support should be inversely proportional to own revenues. Purpose of the article: The aim of the article is to analyse the fulfilment of the revenue equalization function by general grants. Therefore, beside the theoretical analysis, which presents the general grants structure and the functions assigned to them, the article discusses the results of studies showing changes in the revenue gap after the application of the grant mechanism and the correlation between per capita own revenue and the amount of funds from selected parts (equalisation, balancing-regional, reserve, compensating) of the general grant. The following tentative research hypothesis was adopted: general grants fail to fulfil the revenue equalisation function. Methods: Two research methods were applied to achieve the aim of the article and verify the research hypothesis: descriptive statistics and correlation - calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient. Findings & Value added: Based on the analyses, it was concluded that, once the corrective and equalising mechanism was applied, the range between the extreme per capita revenue values was reduced by 40-50% on average, at all local government levels, i.e. at commune (including cities with county right), county and province levels, in each year from the period analysed, i.e. 2012-2016. The correlation between the sizes of revenue before and after budget subsidising is always negative, whereas the strength of the relationship ranged between low and significant, depending on the local government level. It was found that general grants do fulfil the revenue equalisation function, which contradicts the initially formulated research hypothesis.","[Sekula, Alicja] Gdansk Univ Technol, Narutowicza 11-12, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; Gdansk University of Technology,"Sekula, A (通讯作者)，Gdansk Univ Technol, Narutowicza 11-12, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland.",alicja.sekula@zie.pg.gda.pl,"Sekuła, Alicja/ABC-4539-2020","Sekuła, Alicja/0000-0003-4396-3811",,,,,16,6,6,0,5,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

The government faces asymmetric information regarding agents' ability, its evolution, and labor supply. When the wage elasticity with respect to ability is increasing in human capital, the optimal subsidy involves less than full deductibility of human capital expenses on the tax base and falls with age. Income contingent loans or a deferred deductibility scheme can implement the optimum. Numerical results suggest that full deductibility of expenses is close to optimal and that simple linear age -dependent policies perform very well.","[Stantcheva, Stefanie] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Stantcheva, Stefanie] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Stantcheva, S (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Stantcheva, S (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,62,50,61,5,20,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-3808,1537-534X,,J POLIT ECON,J.

Based on a bootstrap sub-sample rolling-window estimation, we find that information stickiness varies over time, which contradicts the strict time dependency implied under sticky-information theory. We provide evidence that information stickiness depends on inflation volatility, which indicates that information stickiness is state-dependent and that it has a time trend. Using a threshold model, we estimate structural changes in the state-dependence and time-trend of information stickiness. The results show that information stickiness has been more dependent on inflation volatility and has had a higher time-trend in both regions following the 2008 financial crisis.","[Xu, Yingying; Liu, Zhixin; Jia, Zichao] Beihang Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Su, Chi-Wei] Ocean Univ China, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China",Beihang University; Ocean University of China,"Xu, YY (通讯作者)，Beihang Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",xuying1221@126.com,"Su, Chi Wei/ABE-4976-2021",,National Social Science Foundation [15BJY155]; Ministry of Education's Humanities and Social Science Research Project [15YJC630042],National Social Science Foundation; Ministry of Education's Humanities and Social Science Research Project,This research is supported by the National Social Science Foundation (Grant number: 15BJY155) and the Ministry of Education's Humanities and Social Science Research Project (Grant number: 15YJC630042).,,63,5,5,0,11,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1617-982X,1617-9838,,PORT ECON J,Port.

We find that tightening monetary policy reduces corporate investment while cash holdings mitigate such adverse effects. The cash mitigating role is especially significant for financially constrained firms, non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs) and those firms located in a less developed financial market. Cash holding also improves investment efficiency when monetary policy is tightening and tightening monetary policy enhances the 'cash-cash flow' sensitivity. Our empirical evidence calls for a critical evaluation on the monetary policies implemented in China which are less effective for state-owned enterprises. It also calls for a necessity for local government to further develop regional financial markets to protect vulnerable businesses, such as non-SOEs and financially constrained firms, from external shocks in order to maintain their sustainable growth and competitive advantages.","[Yang, Xingquan; Yin, Xingqiang] Sch Econ & Management Shihezi Univ, Shihezi 832003, Peoples R China; [Han, Liang] Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, Reading RG6 6UD, Berks, England; [Li, Wanli] Chongqing Univ, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Chongqing 400030, Peoples R China; [Tian, Lin] Univ Surrey, Surrey Business Sch, Guildford GU2, Surrey, England",Shihezi University; University of Reading; Chongqing University; University of Surrey,"Han, L (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, Reading RG6 6UD, Berks, England.",Liang.Han@henley.ac.uk,"Yin, Xingqiang/GSI-4408-2022; Li, Wanli/AAD-7363-2020","Yin, Xingqiang/0000-0002-3978-9489; Li, Wanli/0000-0003-2081-0257; Han, Liang/0000-0002-2778-3338","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71362004, 71762024, 71572019]; Key Research Center of Humanities and Social Sciences in the general Colleges and Universities of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region [XJEDU020114C01]; Xinjiang Autonomous Region Graduate Student Research Innovation Project [XJGRI2015046]; Chinese Scholarship Council of the Ministry of Education [201408060001]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Research Center of Humanities and Social Sciences in the general Colleges and Universities of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region; Xinjiang Autonomous Region Graduate Student Research Innovation Project; Chinese Scholarship Council of the Ministry of Education,The authors thank the co-editor Prof. Zheng (Michael) Song and an anonymous reviewer for their insightful comments.

More specifically, we investigate how parental and children's aspirations form and document the relation between early aspirations and educational attainment at the age of 15 and 19. We find that aspirations are predictive of the number of year of schooling completed upon controlling for cognitive and non-cognitive skills together with a broad set of individuals and household-level characteristics. Interestingly, this correlation is stronger for boys than for girls. We find evidence of an early age pro-boys gender bias in aspirations which is diverted by age 19 when more girls than boys are still enroled at school. Finally, we documented the transmission of aspirations from parents to children and the role played by parental non-educational expectations in explaining this gender bias.","[Favara, Marta] Univ Oxford, Dept Int Dev ODID, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Favara, M (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Int Dev ODID, Oxford, England.;Favara, M (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.",marta.favara@qeh.ox.ac.uk,,"Favara, Marta/0000-0002-5764-4654",UK aid from the UK Department for International Development (DFID); Irish Aid; William and Flora Hewlett Foundation,UK aid from the UK Department for International Development (DFID); Irish Aid(CGIAR); William and Flora Hewlett Foundation,"Young Lives is core-funded from 2001 to 2017 by UK aid from the UK Department for International Development (DFID) and co-funded by Irish Aid from 2014 to 2015.

T identify three normative foundations of Eastern Orthodox monasticism with strong economic implications: I. solidarity, 2. obedience, and 3. universal discipline. I propose a public goods game with a three-tier hierarchy, where these norms are modeled as treatments. Obedience and universal discipline facilitate the provision of threshold public goods in equilibrium, whereas solidarity does not. Empirical evidence is drawn from public goods experiments run with regional bureaucrats in Tomsk and Novosibirsk, Russia. The introduction of the same three norms as experimental treatments produces different results. I find that only universal discipline leads to the provision of threshold public goods, whereas solidarity and obedience do not. Unlike in Protestant societies, in Eastern Orthodox societies free-riding occurs at lower than at higher hierarchical levels. Successful economic reforms in Eastern Orthodox countries start with the restructuring of the middle- and lower-ranked public sector. Authoritarian persistence is defined by the commitment of the dictator to overprovide public goods.","[Grigoriadis, Theocharis] Free Univ Berlin, Inst East European Studies, Sch Business & Econ, Garystr 55, D-14195 Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin,"Grigoriadis, T (通讯作者)，Free Univ Berlin, Inst East European Studies, Sch Business & Econ, Garystr 55, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",theocharis.grigoriadis@fu-berlin.de,,,,,,,70,2,2,0,15,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Instead, biological age increases at a stochastic non-linear rate in time like a broken clock that might occasionally move backwards. In other words, biological age could actually decline. Our paper is inspired by the growing body of medical literature that has identified biomarkers which indicate how people age at different rates. This offers better estimates of expected remaining lifetime and future mortality rates. It isn't farfetched to argue that in the not-too-distant future personal age will be more closely associated with biological vs. calendar age. Thus, after introducing our stochastic mortality model we derive optimal consumption rates in a classic (Yaari, 1965) framework adjusted to our proper clock time. In addition to the normative implications of having access to biological age, our positive objective is to partially explain the cross-sectional heterogeneity in retirement spending rates at any given chronological age. In sum, we argue that neither biological nor chronological age alone is a sufficient statistic for making economic decisions. Rather, both ages are required to behave rationally.

Three puzzles regarding the Tokyo fixing are: (1) the spikes in prices at the fixing time occur despite a high level of liquidity in the market; (2) the order flows before the fixing are biased toward the dollar, which generates a predictable price pattern; and (3) the bank-announced fixing rates are biased toward dollar appreciation. These puzzles can be explained as a consequence of unique institutional features of the Tokyo fixing and of banks' real-side customers in Japan. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

To analyze the effects of carbon tariffs on trade, welfare, and carbon emissions, we develop a multi-sector, multi-factor structural gravity model that allows an analytical and quantitative decomposition of the emission changes into scale, composition, and technique effects. Our analysis shows that carbon tariffs are able to reduce world emissions, mainly via altering the production composition within and across countries, hence reducing carbon leakage. This reduction comes at the cost of lower world trade flows and lower welfare, especially for developing countries. Applying our framework to investigate the effects of the emission reduction pledges made by the Annex I countries in the Copenhagen Accord, we find that combining national emission targets with carbon tariffs would increase the Accord's effectiveness by lowering the leakage rate from 13.4% to 4.1% (with bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals of [11.5,15.8] and [3.3, 4.9], respectively).

However, evidence suggests that short-selling bans during the turmoil in financial markets in 2007-2009 failed to achieve regulators' goals. We analyze a model of costly private information acquisition and asset pricing under short-sale constraints to examine a possible cause of this failure. We show that the constraints increase return volatility by adversely affecting the production of private information. When investors are highly risk averse or are holding highly correlated risky assets, the distortion in private information production arising from imposing short-sale constraints leads to undervaluation, implying that imposing short-selling bans during economic crises not only fails to curb volatility but also may fail to support prices.

In fact, literature review provided some methods to evaluate the total amount of reserves and solvency capital of different lines of business. However, these models were derived under the independent losses assumption. Thus, the total amount of reserves and capital may be inaccurate when losses are dependent, as it is the case in practice. In this paper, a novel model is proposed aiming to handle temporal dependence, both between a line of business claim's amounts and between the two lines of business claims. Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Sinistrality model is used to analyze the evolution in time of dependence and time varying copula functions are proposed to aggregate risks. To achieve such purpose, a simulation study, highlighting the impact on reserves and Solvency Capital Requirement, is performed. Results revealed that a diversification effect could be gained on the Solvency Capital when considering time varying dependence structures.","[Araichi, Sawssen; de Peretti, Christian] Univ Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Inst Financial & Insurance Sci, Lab Actuarial & Financial Sci LSAF, EA2429, Villeurbanne, France; [Araichi, Sawssen; Belkacem, Lotfi] Inst High Commercial Studies Sousse, Lab Res Econ Management & Quantitat Finance, Sousse, Tunisia",Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite de Sousse,"Araichi, S (通讯作者)，Inst High Commercial Studies Sousse, Lab Res Econ Management & Quantitat Finance, Sousse, Tunisia.",sawssen.araichi@gmail.com,"Belkacem, Lotfi/AAT-7998-2020; de+Peretti, Christian/AAA-3368-2019","de+Peretti, Christian/0000-0001-7956-6629; araichi, sawssen/0000-0001-5280-8552; Araichi, Sawssen/0000-0002-0554-0300",,,,,32,3,3,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Sticky wages make adjustment to an external imbalance more difficult within a monetary union. Periods of high unemployment are usually necessary to achieve the required real depreciation (internal devaluation). Gradual adjustment is usually recommended to distribute the output and employment cost over time. But a gradual adjustment also implies that current account deficits persist for longer, leading to higher debt, and higher debt-service costs. The optimal path of price and wage adjustment thus involves a trade-off between the pain (unemployment) and the gain (lower debt) from adjustment. A simple model shows the determinants of the optimal path in terms of deeper parameters, such as the slope of the Phillips curve and the degree of openness. The rules for the resolution of future crises within the euro area should take this into account. Gradual adjustment is not always the optimal choice, and sometimes the alternative path of introducing abrupt changes produces the desired results.","[Belke, Ansgar] Univ Duisburg Essen, CEPS, Brussels, Belgium; [Belke, Ansgar] Inst Study Labor IZA, Essen, Germany; [Gros, Daniel] CEPS, Brussels, Belgium",IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Belke, A (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, CEPS, Brussels, Belgium.;Belke, A (通讯作者)，Inst Study Labor IZA, Essen, Germany.",ansgar.belke@uni-due.de,,"Gros, Daniel/0000-0002-2911-8235",,,,,44,6,6,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

This paper, adopting an experimental economics framework, investigates the effect of different communication channels on promise-making and promise-keeping in an organizational context. Inspired by Ellingsen and Johannesson (Econ J 114:397-420, 2004), five experimental treatments differ with respect to the communication channel employed to solicit a promise of cooperation, i.e., face-to-face, phone call, chat room, and two different sorts of computer-mediated communication. The more direct and synchronous (face-to-face, phone, chat room) the interpersonal interaction is, the higher the propensity of an agent to make a promise. Treatment effects, however, vanish if we then look at the actual promise-keeping rates across treatments, as more indirect channels (computer-mediated) do not perform statistically worse than the direct and synchronous channels.","[Conrads, Julian] Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany; [Reggiani, Tommaso] LUMSA Univ, Rome, Italy; [Reggiani, Tommaso] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of Cologne; Universita LUMSA; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Reggiani, T (通讯作者)，LUMSA Univ, Rome, Italy.;Reggiani, T (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.",julian.conrads@uni-koeln.de; t.reggiani@lumsa.it,"Reggiani, Tommaso/A-2216-2013","Reggiani, Tommaso/0000-0002-3134-1049",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [FOR 1371],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We thank Katrin Recktenwald for excellent research assistantship; Michele Belot, Luigino Bruni, Giovanni Ferri, Bernd Irlenbusch, Patrick Kampkotter, Andrew Kinder, Pierluigi Murro, Rainer Michael Rilke, Matteo Rizzolli, Alessandro Saia, Rupert Sausgruber, Dirk Sliwka, Robert Slonim, Janna Ter Meer, Serena Trucchi, the Associate Editor and two anonymous referees for comments and valuable advice.

To this end, we estimate several discrete choice probit models using firm-level data. Our results show a positive relationship between the existence of environmental regulations (environmental expenditures as a proxy) and innovation. However, the magnitude of the effects and their significance depend on the type of innovation and the size of the firms: environmental regulation positively impacts process innovation only in large firms (>200 workers) while it positively impacts product innovation exclusively in small firms (up to 200 workers). Taking into account innovation activities, we additionally explore the behavior of product prices. We obtain that process innovation increases the probability of reducing prices for both small and large firms; while product innovation only raises the likelihood of increasing prices for the former. Finally, we look into the determinants of investment in environmental protection and find a positive impact of environmental regulation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Evidence from firm-level data for Indonesia,JOURNAL OF ASIAN ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Political connections; Credit constraints; Small and medium enterprises; Indonesia,FINANCING CONSTRAINTS; INTERNATIONAL EVIDENCE; CREDIT; MARKET,"Using a unique firm-level dataset for the manufacturing sector in Indonesia, we examine how firms' political connections affect their access to finance and performance. We determine individual firm's political connections by identifying whether the government owns shares in the firm, whether politicians are on its board of directors, and whether highly-ranked managers personally know any politician. Although several studies have examined effects of political connections on firms financing and performance, we contribute to the literature by distinguishing between large firms and small and medium enterprises (SMEs), between the loan approval and amount setting processes, and between formal and informal political connections. We find that politically connected firms are more likely to be able to borrow from state-owned banks. Moreover, being connected to the government raises the probability that a firm can receive the full loan amount it applied for. The improvement in access to finance from political connections is more prominent for SMEs than for large firms. Furthermore, such improvement mostly comes from personal connections with politicians rather than more formal connections measured by the government ownership or politicians on the board of directors. Finally, we examine the effect of political connected lending on allocative efficiency of capital and find weak evidence that scarce financial resources are likely channeled by state-owned banks to politically connected but less productive firms.

High-ability workers are more productive and have a larger number of professional contacts. Firms can choose between a vacancy in the regular market and a job opening in the referral market. The model predicts that a larger number of social contacts is associated with a larger wage gap between high-and low-ability workers and a larger difference in the unemployment rates. The net welfare gain of referrals is estimated at 1.2%. There are three reasons for the inefficiency of the decentralized equilibrium. First is the traditional search externality described by Hosios. Second, firms share their profits with workers, whereas the social optimum implies that full surplus should be given to firms in the referral market. This inefficiency can be internalized by means of referral subsidies. Third, there is the pooling inefficiency in the regular market. If high-ability workers are sufficiently more productive they impose a positive externality on low-ability workers and should be rewarded by positive transfers. On the contrary, if productivity differences are small, high-ability workers achieve unreasonably high wages by referring each other and reduce employment chances of low-ability workers. In this latter case, high-ability workers should be penalized. If optimal policy is implemented the net welfare gain of referrals rises up to 1.8%.","[Stupnytska, Yuliia; Zaharieva, Anna] Bielefeld Univ, Ctr Math Econ, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany; [Stupnytska, Yuliia] Univ Paris 01, CES, F-75013 Paris, France",University of Bielefeld; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Stupnytska, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, CES, F-75013 Paris, France.",ystupnytska@uni-bielefeld.de; azaharieva@wiwi.uni-bielefeld.de,,"Zaharieva, Anna/0000-0002-2952-8904",,,,,43,6,6,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Pursuing a strategy of credible reassurance commensurate to the shift in the distribution of power in China's neighborhood and globally, President Xi Jinping's administration has been cultivating a form of connective leadership that commits China to the encapsulation of the Belt and Road Initiative for transregional connectivity into its own national development strategy, generating an octroye, non-hegemonic, type of international social capital, and integrating the existing order without corroborating the position of its founder.","[Andornino, Giovanni B.] Univ Torino, Dept Culture Polit & Soc, Turin, Italy",University of Turin,"Andornino, GB (通讯作者)，Univ Torino, Dept Culture Polit & Soc, Turin, Italy.",giovanni.andornino@unito.it,"Andornino, Giovanni B./AAH-8686-2021","Andornino, Giovanni B./0000-0003-3759-1177",Torino World Affairs Institute is gratefully acknowledged (Global China Program),Torino World Affairs Institute is gratefully acknowledged (Global China Program),"The author wishes to thank several participants of the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation (Beijing, May 2017) for commenting on earlier versions of this essay, as well as members of the 2017 TOChina InSite program (Beijing and Tianjin, July 2017), and the students from the China & Global Studies graduate program (University of Torino) for their valuable contributions while discussing China's evolving foreign policy posture and the BRI.

By 2010, conventional human capital variables taken together explained little of the gender wage gap, while gender differences in occupation and industry continued to be important. Moreover, the gender pay gap declined much more slowly at the top of the wage distribution than at the middle or bottom and by 2010 was noticeably higher at the top. We then survey the literature to identify what has been learned about the explanations for the gap. We conclude that many of the traditional explanations continue to have salience. Although human-capital factors are now relatively unimportant in the aggregate, women's work force interruptions and shorter hours remain significant in high-skilled occupations, possibly due to compensating differentials. Gender differences in occupations and industries, as well as differences in gender roles and the gender division of labor remain important, and research based on experimental evidence strongly suggests that discrimination cannot be discounted. Psychological attributes or noncognitive skills comprise one of the newer explanations for gender differences in outcomes. Our effort to assess the quantitative evidence on the importance of these factors suggests that they account for a small to moderate portion of the gender pay gap, considerably smaller than, say, occupation and industry effects, though they appear to modestly contribute to these differences.","[Blau, Francine D.; Kahn, Lawrence M.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Blau, Francine D.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Blau, Francine D.; Kahn, Lawrence M.] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Blau, Francine D.] DIW, Berlin, Germany; [Blau, Francine D.; Kahn, Lawrence M.] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Kahn, Lawrence M.] NCER, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Cornell University; National Bureau of Economic Research; IZA Institute Labor Economics; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Ifo Institut,"Blau, FD (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.;Blau, FD (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Blau, FD (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.;Blau, FD (通讯作者)，DIW, Berlin, Germany.;Blau, FD (通讯作者)，CESifo, Munich, Germany.",,"Kahn, Lawrence/AAP-6684-2021",,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,256,1137,1406,101,697,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

We compare a number of GARCH-type models that capture short memory as well as asymmetry (GARCH, GJR-GARCH and EGARCH), estimated on raw returns, to three competing approaches that deal with the presence of jumps: GARCH-type models estimated on jump-filtered returns, and two new classes of volatility models, called Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS) and Markov-switching multifractal (MSM) models, estimated using raw returns. The forecasting performance of these volatility models is evaluated using the model confidence set approach, which allows us to identify a subset of models that outperform all the other competing models. We find that asymmetric models estimated on filtered returns provide better out-of-sample forecasts than do GARCH-, GAS-type and MSM models estimated on raw return series for Brent and WTI returns.

Uncertainty surrounding the enforcement of the mandate in addition to high production and harvest cost have contributed to a delay in the widespread planting of bioenergy crops such as switchgrass and miscanthus. Previous literature has shown that under uncertainty and sunk cost, an investment threshold is further increased due to the value associated from holding the investment option. In this paper, we extend the previous literature by applying a real option switching model to bioenergy crop production. First, we calculate the county-level break-even price which triggers a switching away from traditional field crops (corn, soybeans, and wheat) to bioenergy crops under various scenarios differing by commodity prices, production cost and biomass price expectations. We show that the resulting break-even prices at the county-level can be substantially higher than previously estimated due to the inclusion of the option value. In a second step, we identify counties that are most likely to grow switchgrass or miscanthus by simulating a stochastic biomass price over time. Our results highlight two issues: First, switchgrass or miscanthus are not grown in the Midwest under any scenario. Under low agricultural residue removal rates, biomass crops are mostly grown in the Southeast. Second, under the assumption of a high removal rates, bioenergy crops are not grown anywhere in the U.S. since the cellulosic biofuel mandate can be covered by agricultural residues.

Taxes can correct the so-called business stealing externality. We investigate how evading a tax on operating profits affects the excessive entry prediction. Tax evasion raises the number of firms in market equilibrium and can alter their welfare-maximising number. In consequence, evasion can aggravate or mitigate excessive entry. Which of these outcomes prevails is determined by the direct welfare consequences of tax evasion and the relationship between evasion and the tax base. We also determine conditions which imply that overall welfare declines with tax evasion.","[Goerke, Laszlo] Trier Univ, IAAEU, Inst Labour Law & Ind Relat European Union, Campus 2, D-54286 Trier, Germany; [Goerke, Laszlo] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Goerke, Laszlo] CESifo, Munich, Germany",Universitat Trier; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Ifo Institut,"Goerke, L (通讯作者)，Trier Univ, IAAEU, Inst Labour Law & Ind Relat European Union, Campus 2, D-54286 Trier, Germany.;Goerke, L (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.;Goerke, L (通讯作者)，CESifo, Munich, Germany.",goerke@iaaeu.de,,"Goerke, Laszlo/0000-0002-7621-5054",,,,,32,4,4,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

The paper first reviews the main trends governing the evolution of the European Social Fund (ESF) since its creation. The ESF promotes public expenditure in ALMPs in order to foster social cohesion across the EU. In order to test to what extent this strategy can be backed up by facts, we estimate the impact of public expenditure on ALMPs on the employment rate using panel data from 28 European countries (1985-2011), taking into account the endogeneity of the explanatory variables and the dynamic behaviour of their relationship. Results support the hypothesis that expenditure in ALMPs is more beneficial for employment than aggregate public expenditure. In addition, we show that periphery countries observe a larger efficiency of their ALMPs. These results support the recent policy strategy undertaken by the European Commission to raise the budget devoted to ESF in Member States experiencing higher unemployment rates.","[Gonzalez Alegre, Juan] Univ Malaga, Dept Econ, Malaga, Spain; [Gonzalez Alegre, Juan] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Dept Appl Econ, Barcelona, Spain",Universidad de Malaga; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Alegre, JG (通讯作者)，Univ Malaga, Dept Econ, Malaga, Spain.;Alegre, JG (通讯作者)，Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Dept Appl Econ, Barcelona, Spain.",jgonzalezal@uma.es,"González-Alegre, Juan/K-2306-2014",,Catedra Pasqual Maragall de Economia y Territorio under Ayudas a la Investigacion grants program; Generalitat de Catalunya AGAUR research grants program [2014-SGR-1326]; Spanish Ministry of Economics [ECO2014-52999-R],Catedra Pasqual Maragall de Economia y Territorio under Ayudas a la Investigacion grants program; Generalitat de Catalunya AGAUR research grants program; Spanish Ministry of Economics(Spanish Government),"This work was supported by the Catedra Pasqual Maragall de Economia y Territorio under the Ayudas a la Investigacion 2012 grants program, the Generalitat de Catalunya AGAUR research grants program (Grant no. 2014-SGR-1326) and the Spanish Ministry of Economics (Grant no.

We define a ban as a policy whereby government agents refuse to accept an alternative currency and mete out punishments to private agents caught using it. After identifying monetary equilibria where an alternative currency is accepted, we then derive the conditions under which a ban might deter its use. As in earlier studies, we show that a government of sufficient size can prevent an alternative currency from circulating without relying on punishments. We also show that, given its size, a government can ban an alternative currency so long as it is willing and able to mete out sufficiently severe punishments. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Respondents participated in a quiz on cold-water coral prior to the valuation task and we use the result of the quiz as an ex-ante measure of their knowledge. Our results suggests that a high level of knowledge, measured by a high quiz score, is associated with higher probabilities of attendance to the three non-cost attributes, although this effect is only significant for one of them. A higher quiz score is also associated with a significantly lower probability of attending to the cost attribute. Furthermore, although being told your score has mixed directional effects on attribute non-attendance, it does not significantly affect the probability of attending to any of the attributes. Finally, allowing for attribute non-attendance leads to substantially lower conditional willingness-to-pay estimates. This highlights the importance of measuring how much people know about the goods over which they are choosing, and underlines that more research is needed to understand how information influences the degree to which respondents ignore attributes.","[Sandorf, Erlend Dancke] Arctic Univ Norway, Univ Tromso, Fac Biosci Fisheries & Econ, Norwegian Coll Fishery Sci, NO-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Campbell, Danny] Univ Stirling, Econ Div, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland; [Hanley, Nick] Univ St Andrews, Dept Geog & Sustainable Dev, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland",UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; University of Stirling; University of St Andrews,"Sandorf, ED (通讯作者)，Arctic Univ Norway, Univ Tromso, Fac Biosci Fisheries & Econ, Norwegian Coll Fishery Sci, NO-9037 Tromso, Norway.",erlend.d.sandorf@uit.no; danny.campbell@stir.ac.uk; ndh3@st-andrews.ac.uk,"Sandorf, Erlend Dancke/AAO-4012-2021; Hanley, Nick/C-1759-2012; Campbell, Danny/E-1873-2011","Hanley, Nick/0000-0002-1362-3499; Campbell, Danny/0000-0001-7467-2318; Sandorf, Erlend Dancke/0000-0001-7521-4773",Research Council of Norway [216485]; Marine Alliance Science and Technology (MASTS); Marine Alliance Science and Technology (Scottish Funding Council) [HR09011],Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); Marine Alliance Science and Technology (MASTS); Marine Alliance Science and Technology (Scottish Funding Council),"The data from the cold-water coral survey was collected as part of the project Habitat-Fisheries interactions - Valuation and Bio-Economic Modeling of Cold-Water Coral, funded by the Research Council of Norway (Grant no. 216485).

Despite removal of deposit interest rate ceilings on 23 October 2015, controls like window guidance are still imposed to prevent commercial banks from setting interest rates freely. This paper estimates implicit interest rates in China (i.e., the additional yield to official interest rates that banks must pay to attract deposits) using headquarter-level data of 88 commercial banks from BankScope and branch-level data of 317 branches in 90 counties and 14 provinces for the period 2005-13. The econometric methods allow for both heterogeneity and spatial correlation in banks' behavior to better capture the characteristics of the Chinese banking industry. Three main findings emerge from this study. First, the estimated mean implicit interest rate is between 70 percent and 78 percent of the explicit interest rateignoring implicit interest rates results in underestimation of funding costs. Second, a 1 percent increase in deposit interest rates is estimated to decrease implicit interest rates by 0.44 percent, implying that the cost of interest rate liberalization will be smaller than the increase in deposit interest rates. Third, small share-holding banks, city commercial banks and rural commercial banks pay higher implicit interest rates than large state-owned banks. To promote efficient resource allocation, therefore, interest rate liberalization needs to be firmly pursued but its impact on different types of banks needs to be closely monitored to minimize disruptions to the real economy.","[Shen, Yan] Peking Univ, Inst Digital Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Shen, Yan] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Bian, Wenlong] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Grad Sch China, Seoul, South Korea",Peking University; Peking University; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Shen, Y (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Inst Digital Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Shen, Y (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China.",yshen@nsd.pku.edu.cn; bianwenlong0011@gmail.com,,,National Science Foundation of China [71103004],National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Yan Shen would like to acknowledge support from the National Science Foundation of China, grant no. 71103004.",,23,2,2,1,22,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

Based on simulations with a spatial partial equilibrium model, we analyze the changes in consumption, prices, and social welfare up to 2022 induced by the infrastructure expansions planned for this period, for the current market, as well as for three hypothetical scenarios: a halt of Russian gas deliveries to the EU during the winter period (RU-); a simultaneous doubling of available LNG (LNG +); and for Brexit, in which the United Kingdom market is isolated from the EU. In the case of the current market, the new infrastructure leads to a slight decrease of wholesale prices. Moreover, the potential of suppliers to exert market power decreases significantly, particularly in the Baltic states and Finland which are the most exposed countries today, and consumer surplus increases by 17.4% in the EU. In the RU- scenario, consumer surplus decreases across Europe, with the largest losses occurring in the Baltic states, as well as in Finland, Poland and Romania. In the LNG+ scenario, the gains in consumer surplus are primarily found in Western Europe. However, the planned infrastructure expansions distribute the gains and losses in consumer surplus more evenly over all EU member states, with the exception of Romania. In the Brexit scenario, consumer surplus decreases by up to 5.1% in the United Kingdom, 19.2% in Ireland, and 3.6% in the other EU countries. Our results allow us to distinguish three categories of projects: (i) Change in gas availability, leading to a general increase or decrease of social welfare all over the EU. The only project increasing social welfare in all scenarios in most countries is the Trans-Anatolian Gas Pipeline (TANAP); (ii) existing gas sources made available to additional countries. This leads to an increase of social welfare in the newly connected countries, while social welfare drops slightly everywhere else; (iii) projects with a marginal effect on the market. Most notably, the recently announced Turkish Stream falls into this category. Our results indicate that if all proposed infrastructure projects are realized, the EU's single market will become a reality in 2019 when Finland is interconnected to the EU markets. However, we also find that social welfare can only be increased significantly for the EU as a whole if new gas sources become accessible. At the same time, efficiency gains, albeit decreasing social welfare, help to improve the situation of consumers and decrease the dependency of the EU as a whole on external suppliers.

We ask how competence was affected by a zipper quota, requiring local parties to alternate men and women on the ballot, implemented by the Social Democratic Party in 1993. Far from being at odds with meritocracy, this quota raised the competence of male politicians where it raised female representation the most.

The extent of market segmentation is estimated using city-pair price differences within the framework of both linear autoregressive (AR) and nonlinear threshold autoregressive (TAR) models. We find that the magnitude of market segmentation varies from one product to another, but even more across city pairs in each product. Contrary to a widespread perception, market segmentation within the US is not necessarily larger for non-tradable services compared to tradable goods. We identify potential drivers of market segmentation by relating the cross-city and cross-product variations of market segmentation to location-specific and product-specific characteristicsdistance, relative city sizes, differences in wage and rent, type of product and proximity to marketplace. Distance, which captures more than transport costs, turns out to be the most salient factor even after controlling for a range of other potential factors. The effect of distance, however, varies substantially across products, with perishable products and locally produced products showing larger distance effect on market segmentation. We find that the magnitude of market segmentation has been somewhat stable during the sample period, but intercity price differences have become more sensitive to distance over time in many products under study.","[Choi, Chi-Young] Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Econ, Arlington, TX 76019 USA; [Murphy, Anthony] Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, Dallas, TX USA; [Wu, Jyh-Lin] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Econ, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Wu, Jyh-Lin] Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Chiayi, Taiwan",University of Texas System; University of Texas Arlington; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Dallas; National Sun Yat Sen University; National Chung Cheng University,"Choi, CY (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Econ, Arlington, TX 76019 USA.",cychoi@uta.edu,,,,,,,42,7,7,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

Using administrative annual earnings data from Canada, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, it applies the approach used in the analysis of earnings inequality in top incomes, as well as reweighting techniques, to the analysis of the gender pay gap. The analysis is supplemented by classic O-B decompositions of hourly wages using data from the Canadian and U.K. Labour Force Surveys.

Using one example of such policies - Kazakhization in Kazakhstan - we investigate their impact on the comparative earnings of two directly affected groups, ethnic Kazakhs and ethnic Russians. Oaxaca decompositions show that Kazakhs are better endowed with income generating characteristics but receive lower returns to these characteristics than Russians. The second effect dominates and Kazakhs have comparatively lower average living standards. While Kazakhization may have been successful in some sense it appears to also have induced ethnic Russians to move into jobs that (at least in monetary terms) are superior now to those held by Kazakhs.

This paper examines the dynamic effects of US and non-US oil production shocks on economic policy uncertainty using a structural VAR model. Such an examination is motivated by the substantial increases in US oil production in recent years with implications for US political and economic security. Positive innovations in US oil production are associated with decreases in US economic policy uncertainty. The economic forecast interquartile ranges about the US CPI and about federal/state/local government expenditures are, particularly sensitive to innovations in US oil supply shocks. Shocks to US oil supply disruption causes rises in the CPI forecast uncertainty and accounts for 21% of the overall variation of the CPI forecaster disagreement. Disaggregation. of oil production shocks into US and non-US oil production yields novel results. Oil supply shocks identified by US and non-US origins explain as much of the variation in economic policy uncertainty as structural shocks on the demand side of the oil market. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Contrary to this belief, the paper shows that under realistic parameterizations, rational explosive solutions are both E-stable and strongly E-stable in a class of models with lagged endogenous variables. It also establishes the convergence of least squares learning process to explosive solutions. Taking a simple Cagan model of inflation as an application, the paper shows that money supply feedback rule gives rise to a rational explosive solution for prices which is learnable in real time.

Policymakers have focused on (1) wireline telephone (and more recently, fixed-line broadband) services and (2) households. The widespread adoption of mobile telephones compels a fresh examination of this focus. We construct a new measure of universal connectivity which accounts for consumers' choices of communications technologies and for their geographic mobility over the course of the day. This measure, in turn, compels a conceptual and empirical investigation of the determinants of mobile telephone diffusion within families. Our estimations of intra-household demand for mobile service permit us to develop simulations that estimate the economic impact of modernizing a key element of existing universal service policy (viz., the Lifeline Program) to reflect the goal of improving individual connectivity. We find that a policy expansion from a single subsidy per household to multiple subsidies per eligible household members would increase mobile subscriptions by 2.25 million and Lifeline costs by $250 million.","[Macher, Jeffrey T.; Mayo, John W.; Ukhaneva, Olga] Georgetown Univ, McDonough Sch Business, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Woroch, Glenn A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Georgetown University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Mayo, JW (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, McDonough Sch Business, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",jeffrey.macher@georgetown.edu; mayoj@georgetown.edu; oru@georgetown.edu; woroch@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,29,5,5,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

We explain the results by the extent of liquidity concerns (hard and soft budget constraints), measured by cash flow interacted with a dummy variable of majority ownership of the respective group, and the extent of asset stripping for the corresponding ownership group and relate them to over- and under-investment, and to the free cash flow or cash constraint hypothesis.","[Mykhayliv, Dariya] Univ Bradford, Sch Management, Bradford BD7 1DP, W Yorkshire, England; [Zauner, Klaus G.] City Univ London, Dept Econ, Northampton Sq, London EC1V 0HB, England",University of Bradford; City University London,"Zauner, KG (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Dept Econ, Northampton Sq, London EC1V 0HB, England.",d.mykhayliv@bradford.ac.uk; klaus.zauner@city.ac.uk,"Zauner, Klaus/HOH-9472-2023","Zauner, Klaus/0000-0002-8605-5349",,,,,47,11,11,0,12,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Despite the significance he attaches to trust, Lawson does not provide an extended elaboration of the nature of trust but rather considers it in various contexts where his primary focus lies elsewhere. The purpose of the current paper is to examine how trust features in Lawson's discussions. I identify three phases of argumentation where trust has some significant prominence in his work. Most recently Lawson when outlining his general socio-philosophical ontology describes trust as the essential glue binding society together. In earlier contributions he approaches trust from a developmental perspective and at times sees trust as a condition required for generalised human flourishing. I argue that a coherent and compelling account of the nature and significance of trust emerges from these discussions and that it is one that deserves further elaboration and critical attention. Resources in the form of certain complementary perspectives are identified that may help to flesh out aspects of Lawson's account of trust.","[Pratten, Stephen] Kings Coll London, Sch Business & Management, 150 Stamford St, London SE1 9NH, England",University of London; King's College London,"Pratten, S (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Sch Business & Management, 150 Stamford St, London SE1 9NH, England.",stephen.pratten@kcl.ac.uk,,"Pratten, Stephen Bernard/0000-0001-6027-7528",,,,,29,15,15,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Second, it compares countries with different employment change pattern-mainly upgrading and polarizing-to establish a link between employment polarization and over-education. Using data from European Labour Force Survey covering the period from 1999 to 2007, the paper analyses four countries of Europe-Germany, Spain, Sweden and UK. The results suggest higher incidence of over-education in polarized countries-Spain and UK as compared to countries with a somewhat upgrading pattern of employment change-Germany and Sweden. It also reveals that in Spain and UK, over-education is prominent and increasing over time in the low-skill jobs which are mostly non-routine manual in nature, while Germany and Sweden have more over-educated workers in middle skilled routine and high skilled analytical jobs.

I examine the effect of competition on strike activity using evidence from a natural experiment of policy reform, the introduction of cartel legislation in the UK in the late 1950s. My econometric analysis, which takes advantage of the fact that different industries were affected to varying degrees by cartel policy, establishes that both the number of strikes and the number of working days lost as a result of strikes increased significantly when competition intensified after the abolition of cartels. I propose an interpretation of these results with reference to theoretical models of bargaining with asymmetric information. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, much less is known about the effects of local governance reform on the quality of local infrastructure. This paper examines the effects of governance reform implemented in rural Chinese villages on the quality of village road projects. We conduct surveys in 101 rural villages and collect data related to the implementation of the reform over the last two decades. We also measure the quality of over 550 village road projects completed in these villages. Using fixed effects and instrumental variable estimation methods, we find that the implementation of village governance reform increases the quality of village road projects. We also find evidence supporting the following effect mechanisms: (1) village leaders become younger and more educated, (2) high quality road projects increase incumbent leaders' re-election chances, and (3) village residents participate more actively in the management and monitoring of village road projects.

The nontradable good is exported via tourism and the induced tourism terms-of-trade (TOT) effect becomes an additional source of distortion. An increase in tariffs can cause a TOT improvement and an increase in pollution simultaneously, affecting the condition for a welfare-enhancing tariff policy. In addition, the welfare effect of a pollution tax reform is strongly linked to whether the reform improves the tourism TOT. The interactions between tourists' spending and domestic welfare are also examined.","[Yanase, Akihiko] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan",Nagoya University,"Yanase, A (通讯作者)，Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",yanase@soec.nagoya-u.ac.jp,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [15K13015]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16H03617, 15K13015] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This study was launched as a joint research project with Xuelian Lee.

SOME EVIDENCE FROM A SET OF HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE ACADEMIC ECONOMISTS,ECONOMIC INQUIRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,FOREIGN-BORN; BRAIN-DRAIN; SCIENCE; ELITE; SCIENTISTS,"This article compares the average productivity of migrants (who work in a country different from their country of origin) and stayers (whose entire academic career takes place in their country of origin) in a set of 2,530 highly productive economists that work in 2007 in a selection of the top 81 Economics departments worldwide. The main findings are the following two. First, productivity comparisons depend on the cohort and the type of department. For example, in the top U.S. departments, foreigners are more productive than stayers only among older individuals; in the bottom U.S. departments, this is the case for both cohorts, while in the other countries the productivity of foreigners and stayers is indistinguishable for both cohorts. Second, when we restrict our attention to an elite consisting of economists with above average productivity, all productivity differences between migrants and stayers in the United States vanish. As our analysis depends on observational data in which the migration decision is not exogenously identified, our estimates have a descriptive rather than a causal interpretation. However, our results are very robust to the treatment of the elite, the partition into several department categories, and the definition of the cohorts and the productivity notion.

Our identification strategy consists of focusing on donors with fixed election dates, making elections clearly exogenous. Furthermore, we find large interaction effects with natural and human disasters. This evidence is consistent with our theory that incumbent governments responding to humanitarian disasters can increase voter support for their party and insure against the political fall-out of not being seen as representatives of a country with global interests and influence. However, it is important to stress that despite our findings, human and natural disasters explain a substantially larger share of the overall variation in humanitarian aid observed in the data.

We develop a multi-agent principal-agent model with costly peer monitoring and solve for the optimal group loan contract. The optimal contract exhibits (i) a joint-liability scheme; and, (ii) asymmetric loan terms which can be interpreted as appointing a group leader, who has strong incentives to monitor her peer. Relaxing the joint-liability scheme implies the breakdown of equilibrium monitoring. When the contractual asymmetry is relaxed, the peer-monitoring game exhibits multiple Nash equilibria: a (weak) good equilibrium at which borrowers monitor each other and a (strong) bad equilibrium without monitoring. This key result suggests that profit maximizing MFIs should provide asymmetric group loan contracts - even to a homogeneous group of borrowers - to ensure stability in repayment rates.","[Carli, Francesco] Deakin Univ, 270 Elgar Rd, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia; [Uras, Burak R.] Tilburg Univ, CentER, European Banking Ctr, Tilburg, Netherlands",Deakin University; Tilburg University,"Carli, F (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, 270 Elgar Rd, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia.",fcarli@deakin.edu.au; r.b.uras@uvt.nl,"Carli, Francesco/AAQ-4465-2021","Carli, Francesco/0000-0001-9594-4706",,,,,10,1,1,1,11,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

These laws govern how different professions may operate in healthcare markets, and while they ostensibly exist to protect consumers, licensing laws can also insulate professionals from competition in healthcare markets. Higher political spending by physician interest groups increases the probability that a state maintains licensing laws restricting the practices of nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs). Conversely, increased spending by hospital interest groups increases the probability that a state allows NPs and PAs to practice with more autonomy. Nurse groups, which include groups affiliated with NPs, have a smaller effect on licensing laws. And nonphysician groups, which include groups affiliated with PAs, have almost no effect on licensing laws. These results are consistent with the investment theory of political spending.","[McMichael, Benjamin J.] Vanderbilt Univ, Owen Grad Sch Management, 401 21st Ave South, Nashville, TN 37203 USA",Vanderbilt University,"McMichael, BJ (通讯作者)，Vanderbilt Univ, Owen Grad Sch Management, 401 21st Ave South, Nashville, TN 37203 USA.",benjamin.j.mcmichael@vanderbilt.edu,"McMichael, Benjamin/R-8661-2019","McMichael, Benjamin/0000-0001-7190-1787",,,,,46,29,38,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

The work is inspired by our partial agreement with and partial criticism of Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century. We agree with him that inequalities are growing and we share his view that this is a major threat to the legitimacy of the liberal order both at the national and the international level. At the same time, we are deeply sceptical about his central explanation, namely that excessive growth of profits (r) is the main reason for inequalities which in turn slow growth (g) and generate popular dissatisfaction in the long run. We show that the confusion of profit and rent, capital and wealth, prevents Piketty to prove the r > g formula, because his computed values for r are statistical artefacts.","[Mihalyi, Peter] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Budapest, Hungary; [Mihalyi, Peter] Cent European Univ, Budapest, Hungary; [Szelenyi, Ivan] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Corvinus University Budapest; Central European University; Yale University,"Mihalyi, P (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Macroecon, Budapest, Hungary.;Mihalyi, P (通讯作者)，Cent European Univ, Dept Econ, Budapest, Hungary.;Szelényi, I (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Sociol & Polit Sci, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",peter@mihalyi.com,,,,,,,21,5,5,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

First, we provide extensive empirical evidence of the inappropriateness of linearization and testing strategies using Euler equations for consumption-a drawback for standard rule-of-thumb tests. Second, we propose a novel approach to testing for consumption optimality in this context: nonlinear estimation coupled with return aggregation, where rule-of-thumb behavior and habit are special cases of an all-encompassing model. We estimated 48 Euler equations using GMM. At the 5% level, we only rejected optimality twice out of 48 times. Moreover, out of 24 regressions, we found the rule-of-thumb parameter to be statistically significant only twice. Hence, lack of optimality in consumption decisions represent the exception, not the rule. Finally, we found the habit parameter to be statistically significant on four occasions out of 24.","[Reis Gomes, Fabio Augusto] Univ Sao Paulo Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Issler, Joao Victor] Getulio Vargas Fdn, Grad Sch Econ EPGE, Praia Botafogo 190 S 1100, BR-22250900 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo; Getulio Vargas Foundation,"Issler, JV (通讯作者)，Getulio Vargas Fdn, Grad Sch Econ EPGE, Praia Botafogo 190 S 1100, BR-22250900 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.",jissler@fgv.br,"ISSLER, JOAO/AAS-3277-2020; Augusto Reis Gomes, Fabio/C-3978-2018","ISSLER, JOAO/0000-0002-1745-1196; Augusto Reis Gomes, Fabio/0000-0001-9918-9445",CNPq-Brazil; CAPES; Pronex; FAPERJ; INCT,CNPq-Brazil(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Pronex; FAPERJ(Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio De Janeiro (FAPERJ)); INCT,"We are especially grateful to two anonymous referees, Caio Almeida, Marco Bonomo, Luis Braido, Carlos E.

An advisor with commitment power decides how much information to provide to an uninformed decision maker, so as to influence his short-term decisions. We deal with a stylized class of situations, in which the decision maker has a risky action and a safe action, and the payoff to the advisor only depends on the action chosen by the decision maker. The greedy disclosure policy is the policy which, at each stage, minimizes the amount of information being disclosed in that stage, under the constraint that it maximizes the current payoff of the advisor.

It presents some general reasons for the problem before specifically examining the proposition that a sound appreciation of Popper's doctrines cannot be attained from simply studying the doctrines themselves. What it also requires is an understanding of the problem situation that the doctrines sought to address. This is illustrated through an examination of the way methodologists have grasped, or failed to grasp, the development of Popper's own thought about the problem of demarcating empirical science from non-science and the related problem of whether the limits of empirical science coincide with the limits of arguability. The article demonstrates that a neglect of these considerations has produced confusion in the literature, both in the way that Popper's philosophy has been presented and in the way in which its contemporary relevance has been assessed.","[Thomas, Rod] Northumbria Univ, Business & Law City Campus East 1, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England",Northumbria University,"Thomas, R (通讯作者)，Northumbria Univ, Business & Law City Campus East 1, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England.",rod.thomas@northumbria.ac.uk,,"Thomas, Rod/0000-0003-3317-6611",,,,,59,2,2,3,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Energy use, aging population and consumption habits",ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Energy consumption; Cohort effects; Pseudopanel data,COHORT; EXPENDITURES; CONSERVATION; AGE,"In parallel with worldwide population growth, Europe is experiencing a fast demographic shift widely studied but generally undervalued by policymakers. Population aging may imply smaller household Sizes and more home-based energy consumption, which will change the energy mix. Consumer preference shifts and different attitudes towards environment among the generations determine additional effects. Study of the link between an aging population and energy demand is even more important for Italy because its energy dependence is almost complete and its population is aging quickly. This paper aims to assess the role of changing generational preferences in the energy expenditure trend in Italy by distinguishing between a pure age effect and a cohort effect. The decomposition shows significant differences in the shape of age and cohort effects, thus confirming that, beside an aging effect, we must consider that recent generations have a higher residential energy expenditure. Indeed, the energy culture of post war Italian generations seems more linked to thermal comfort (heating and air conditioning) than to environmental attitudes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

It provides an empirical illustration based on data available in the Demographic and Health Surveys of Egypt and Jordan. The paper relies on the general framework proposed by Silber and Yalonetzky (2013) to compare multidimensional poverty measures, such as the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) and others that are sensitive to the distribution of deprivation counts among individuals. It thus computes the measures introduced by Chakravarty and D'Ambrosio, 2006 and Rippin (2010) as well as indices based on the extension of the Aaberge and Peluso (2012), suggested by Silber and Yalonetzky (2013). It appears that it is useful to consider several multidimensional poverty measures when analyzing national poverty trends and when making a distinction between urban and rural areas.","[Berenger, Valerie] Univ Toulon & Var, LEAD, 70 Ave Roger Devoucoux, F-83000 Toulon, France",Universite de Toulon,"Bérenger, V (通讯作者)，Univ Toulon & Var, LEAD, 70 Ave Roger Devoucoux, F-83000 Toulon, France.",berenger@univ-tln.fr,,,,,,,28,11,12,1,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

The concept of an optimal threshold is wider than simply the maximisation of revenue net of administrative costs. At the optimal threshold, the marginal cost of funds from GST is equated to the ratio of the marginal value of public funds to their marginal social value, reflecting the value judgements of a decision-maker. The marginal cost of funds allows both for compliance costs and the marginal excess burden arising from a small increase in the threshold. Illustrative numerical values are reported, showing the sensitivity to administrative costs, the demand elasticity and, importantly, value judgements.","[Creedy, John] Victoria Univ Wellington, New Zealand Treasury, Wellington 6011, New Zealand; [Creedy, John] Victoria Univ Wellington, Victoria Business Sch, Wellington 6011, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington; Victoria University Wellington,"Creedy, J (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ Wellington, New Zealand Treasury, Wellington 6011, New Zealand.;Creedy, J (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ Wellington, Victoria Business Sch, Wellington 6011, New Zealand.",john.creedy@vuw.ac.nz,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-9018,1467-8462,,AUST ECON REV,Aust.

In contrast to the previous studies which mainly used unit root or stationarity tests, we use the results from subsampling confidence intervals. Furthermore, instead of considering convergence to a particular country benchmark, we explore all the possible pair-wise convergences. The findings, based on 7962 pairs of countries, are more favorable to the existence of the convergence.

The main findings are as follows. First, the labour force of many firms in Japan is above the optimal level (labour hoarding). Second, labour hoarding is more serious among larger firms. Third, firms do not adjust employment instantaneously; if they have surplus labour in the current period, they will gradually reduce it. This is consistent with the theoretical model on employment adjustment that we propose. Fourth, all else being equal, firms' conducting R&D are more likely to increase employment. Fifth, while we observe a negative correlation between firms' total factor productivity growth and employment, total factor productivity growth through innovation has a positive impact on employment. Finally, in the manufacturing sector, product innovation, which we proxy by R&D expenditure, has a positive impact on employment, while in the nonmanufacturing sector, process innovation, which we proxy by capital investment, has a positive effect on employment.","[Fukao, Kyoji] Hitotsubashi Univ, Kunitachi, Tokyo, Japan; [Fukao, Kyoji; Ikeuchi, Kenta; Kwon, Hyeog Ug] RIETI, Tokyo, Japan; [Kim, Young Gak] Senshu Univ, Tokyo, Japan; [Kwon, Hyeog Ug] Nihon Univ, Tokyo, Japan",Hitotsubashi University; Nihon University,"Fukao, K (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Kunitachi, Tokyo, Japan.;Fukao, K (通讯作者)，RIETI, Tokyo, Japan.",,"Kwon, Hyeog ug/L-9194-2017","Ikeuchi, Kenta/0000-0003-3689-9356; Fukao, Kyoji/0000-0002-9471-6653","Zengin Foundation for Studies on Economics and Finance; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15H03342, 16H06322, 17H02549] Funding Source: KAKEN","Zengin Foundation for Studies on Economics and Finance; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This study forms part of the project Analysis on Service Industries: Productivity, Economic Welfare, and Policy Evaluation at the Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry (RIETI).

It finds that not all fiscal rules have the same impact: the design matters. Specifically, investment-friendly rules reduce the procyclicality of both overall and investment spending. The effect appears stronger in bad times and when the rule is enacted at the national level. The introduction of escape clauses in fiscal rules does not seem to affect the cyclical stance of public spending. The inclusion of cyclical adjustment features in spending rules yields broadly similar results. The results are mixed for cyclically adjusted budget balance rules: enacting the latter is associated with countercyclical movements in overall spending, but with procyclical changes in investment spending. Structural factors, such as past debt, the level of development, the volatility of terms of trade, natural resources endowment, government stability, and the legal enforcement and monitoring arrangements backing the rule also influence the link between fiscal rules and counter-cyclicality. The results are robust to a wide set of alternative specifications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Following Alvaredo et al. (De Econ, 2017) we exploit kinks in the budget set generated by a drop in the marginal SSC rate at earnings caps for health and long-term care insurance. These concave kinks lead to discontinuities in the distributions of gross earnings, net earnings, or labor costs which-in the absence of labor supply responses-are informative about economic incidence. Administrative data for West Germany from 1975 to 2010 facilitate a comprehensive incidence analysis. Finding no evidence for labor supply responses and no significant discontinuities in gross earnings distributions, we conclude that neither employers nor employees shift a substantial part of their SSC burden. These results are consistent over the whole time period and hold for several robustness checks corroborating previous findings for Germany. A small trend towards a slight increase in the SSC burden for employees is not statistically significant.","[Mueller, Kai-Uwe; Neumann, Michael] DIW Berlin, German Inst Econ Res Berlin, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Müller, KU (通讯作者)，DIW Berlin, German Inst Econ Res Berlin, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",kmueller@diw.de,,,"German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG) [HA 5526/3-1 (ORA)]","German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG))","We would like to thank Peter Haan who read and commented on an earlier draft of this paper.

The results in this paper, however, challenge this conventional view. Drawing on a rich literature in biology and evolutionary psychology, we test the provocative Parasite Stress Theory of Values, which suggests a possible link between the historical prevalence of infectious diseases, the cultural dimension of individualism collectivism and differences in income inequality across countries. Specifically, in a two-stage least squares analysis, we use the historical prevalence of infectious diseases as an instrument for individualistic values, which, in the next stage, predict the level of income inequality, measured by the net GINI coefficient from the Standardized World Income Inequality Database (SWIID). Our findings suggest that societies with more individualistic values have significantly lower net income inequality.

Eating time is differentiated into primary and secondary eating time and further differentiated by location: at home versus away from home. We construct a simple theoretical model, based on Becker's household production approach, to motivate empirical equations for eating and food preparation time. Empirical analysis is performed using data from the 2006 to 2008 Eating and Health Module of the American Time Use Survey. Higher food-at-home prices are found to be associated with more time in food preparation and primary eating at home. Higher fast food prices are associated with more time in food preparation and less time in primary eating at home. We conclude that food prices influence home production and time allocation decisions. We also find that low-income adults spend more time in food preparation and primary eating at home and are less likely to eat away from home than those with more income. The presence of children in the household is associated with more time in food preparation and less time in primary eating away from home. Public policies attempting to effect an increase in food preparation among low-income, single adult households with children may need to account for limited opportunities such households can have to acquire and prepare healthier foods when additional time is required.","[Senia, Mark C.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Agr & Life Sci Bldg,2124 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Jensen, Helen H.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, 578 Heady Hall, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Zhylyevskyy, Oleksandr] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, 460D Heady Hall, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Iowa State University; Iowa State University,"Jensen, HH (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, 578 Heady Hall, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",mcsenia@tamu.edu; hhjensen@iastate.edu; oz9a@iastate.edu,,,"US Department of Agriculture [2012-70002-19386]; NIFA [2012-70002-19386, 578687] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",US Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),Funding for this research was provided in part by the US Department of Agriculture award #2012-70002-19386 to the Center for Agricultural and Rural Development at Iowa State University.,,55,10,11,1,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Following Holden and Wulfsberg (2009), we compute a measure of downward real wage rigidity (DRWR) of 12.09%, four times bigger than their aggregate estimate for the OECD economies. Moreover, in contrast to the evidence for the advanced economies, the determinants of such rigidities show no connection to the wage bargaining system. Amid the absence of effective labor market institutions to make rigidities less prevalent, economic growth appears as the most powerful mechanism to ward them off. Under this light, we provide a stylized description of the wage setting rule in Colombia, compare it with the common one in the advanced economies, and call for a far-reaching reform of the Colombian wage bargaining setup.

The concept of structural cycle is introduced here to study the two interdependent processes of 'technology transition' and 'organisational reconfiguration' characterising those firms shifting towards higher-value product segments. This private-public nexus is investigated in the Emilian Packaging Valley context. The mixed-method study focuses on the case of IMA Spa, its shifts from the food to the pharmaceutical value product segment of the packaging machine industry and its changing relationships with regional public policies and institutions.

First, in the single-player case (corresponding to an agent trying to adapt to an arbitrarily changing environment), we show that the stochastic dynamics under study lead to no regret almost surely, irrespective of the noise level in the player's observations. In the multi-player case, we find that dominated strategies become extinct and we show that strict Nash equilibria are stochastically stable and attracting; conversely, if a state is stable or attracting with positive probability, then it is a Nash equilibrium. Finally, we provide an averaging principle for 2-player games, and we show that in zero-sum games with an interior equilibrium, time averages converge to Nash equilibrium for any noise level.

As to be expected, numerous studies have found that economic freedom is associated with good economic outcomes. Additionally, much effort in public economics has worked to identify the features of quality non-market public institutions. No effort has been made to connect institutions that influence market activity and institutions that govern non-market activities. We take a first step. We employ a linear programming method for measuring relative efficiencies known as Data Envelopment Analysis. We apply this technique to information on the use of inputs to the production of the prosecution of crime across the thousands of local prosecutor offices in the U.S. We then compare state-level measurements of prosecution productivity with data on state-level economic freedom from the Economic Freedom of North America index. We show that there is a positive and statistically significant relationship between the two.

We address neighborhood sorting by analyzing city averages and omitted variable bias by instrumenting for segregation using historical railroad configurations. We find that segregation has a significant positive effect: a 10 percentage point increase in the dissimilarity index decreases the racial gap by about 3.3 percentage points. To minimize the effect of cross-city sorting, we use a narrower sample constructed from outcomes of young adults and find a similar effect. Our findings are importantbecause historically, entrepreneurship has been an avenue out of poverty, and entrepreneurship has been promoted as a way to decrease welfare and unemployment.

The integrated econometric approach developed by the authors allows for elicitation of factors that govern innovation activities for all Russian regions via factor and regression analyses. The approach can be adapted to any territory that is sub-divided into administrative regions. The composition of the elicited factors demonstrates that innovation activities that take place in the majority of Russian regions are in accordance with the priorities of the government 'Strategy for Development of Science and Innovation in Russia until the Year 2015'. For a full sample of eighty regions among the input innovation indicators, expenditure on technological innovation has the greatest significant positive impact on economic growth in these regions. Diffusion of knowledge via spillovers between regions stimulates growth in a reduced sample for regions that exclude both innovation leaders and laggers. The study also demonstrates that quality of the institutions affects the level of economic activity, that is, regions with higher levels of institutional capacity produced more (as indicated by greater GRP).","[Kaneva, Maria; Untura, Galina] Inst Econ & Ind Engn, Dept Reg & Municipal Governance, 17 Lavrentieva Prospekt, Novosibirsk, Russia; [Untura, Galina] Novosibirsk State Univ, Dept Econ, 2 Pirogova St, Novosibirsk, Russia",Institute of Economics & Industrial Engineering of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences; Novosibirsk State University,"Kaneva, M (通讯作者)，Inst Econ & Ind Engn, Dept Reg & Municipal Governance, 17 Lavrentieva Prospekt, Novosibirsk, Russia.",kaneva@iep.ru,"Kaneva, Maria/O-6955-2019; Untura, Galina/G-4680-2019","Kaneva, Maria/0000-0002-9540-2592; Untura, Galina/0000-0002-0987-3137",Presidium of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences [II.2P/XI.179-2],Presidium of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences(Russian Academy of Sciences),"The work was funded by the Presidium of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences (program number 27), Project II.2P/XI.179-2 'Theoretical and applied aspects of knowledge spillovers: social and mathematical modeling'.",,55,18,20,1,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1573-9414,1574-0277,,ECON CHANG RESTRUCT,Econ.

This is partially due to an increasing share of renewable energy, wind and photovoltaic, which requires power generators to balance out the forecasting errors in their production. We investigate the bidding behaviour in the intraday market by looking at both last prices and continuous bidding, in the context of a reduced-form econometric analysis. A unique data set of 15-minute intraday prices and intraday-updated forecasts of wind and photovoltaic has been employed. Price bids are explained by prior information on renewables forecasts and demand/supply market-specific exogenous variables. We show that intraday prices adjust asymmetrically to both forecasting errors in renewables and to the volume of trades dependent on the threshold variable demand quote, which reflects the expected demand covered by the planned traditional capacity in the day-ahead market. The location of the threshold can be used by market participants to adjust their bids accordingly, given the latest updates in the wind and photovoltaic forecasting errors and the forecasts of the control area balances.

The Logistics Performance Index (LPI) measures the on-the-ground efficiency of trade supply chains or logistics performance. The aim of this paper is to propose a data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach to compute a synthetic index of overall logistics performance (DEA-LPI) and benchmark the logistics performance of the countries with LPI. Dealing with the six dimensions of LPI, the proposed approach uses DEA as a tool for multiple criteria decision making (MCDM). Furthermore, the paper also analyses the potential differences observed when using different variables, namely income and geographical area. Our findings suggest that the logistics performance depends largely on income and geographical area. High income countries are in the group of best performers, which is highly dominated by the EU.","[Marti, Luisa; Puertas, Rosa] Univ Politecn Valencia, Grp Econ Int, E-46022 Valencia, Spain; [Carlos Martin, Juan] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Inst Tourism & Sustainable Econ Dev, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,"Puertas, R (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Valencia, Grp Econ Int, E-46022 Valencia, Spain.",mlmarti@esp.upv.es; jcarlos.martin@ulpgc.es; rpuertas@esp.upv.es,"Puertas, Rosa/IQU-5268-2023; Martin, Juan Carlos/F-6473-2014; MARTI, LUISA/W-3394-2018","Puertas, Rosa/0000-0003-4937-4575; Martin, Juan Carlos/0000-0002-2950-2405; MARTI, LUISA/0000-0001-8861-4442",,,,,45,68,70,18,104,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

Despite the presence of social constant returns to capital, which would otherwise generate unbounded growth, when pollution is left unabated, the economy cannot achieve such a path. Instead, it converges either to a stationary level of capital per worker or to a cycle in which capital per worker oscillates permanently. The government's involvement in environmental preservation proves crucial for both short-term dynamics and long-term prospects of the economy. Particularly, an active policy of pollution abatement emerges as an important engine of long-run economic growth. Furthermore, by eliminating the occurrence of limit cycles, pollution abatement is also a powerful source of stabilization.","[Palivos, Theodore] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece; [Varvarigos, Dimitrios] Univ Leicester, Leicester, Leics, England",Athens University of Economics & Business; University of Leicester,"Palivos, T (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, 76 Patiss Str, Athens 10434, Greece.",tpalivos@aueb.gr,,"Varvarigos, Dimitrios/0000-0003-0337-9493",,,,,36,16,16,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

We propose that a candidate's campaign promises are a partially revealing signal of her policy preference type. The incumbent's policy choice is yet another signal of her type. Policy choice is a costly signal (unlike campaign promises). The incumbent keeps her electoral promises in order to preserve ambiguity about her type, which is necessary to assemble a winning majority for reelection. She keeps her promises regardless of information about the efficiency of different public policies which she receives upon taking office.

Both static and generalized autoregressive score dynamic copulas are used to model the dependence between the EUAs and the four energy commodity futures prices, with an emphasis on the performance of two different portfolio strategies (diversified portfolios and hedged portfolios) and the resulting effect on risk mitigation in the carbon market. Our empirical results show that despite the superiority of the hedged portfolios in increasing the risk-adjusted returns of carbon assets, the dynamic diversified portfolios are much preferred for reducing variance and the downside risks of carbon assets. Of the four energy commodity futures examined, coal (electricity) is found to be the most (least) attractive in terms of mitigating the carbon risk.

We construct a model of vertical relationship where an upstream [a downstream] firm is considered as a content provider [a retailer]. Three business models are proposed depending on who has the right to implement digital rights management (DRM): a vertically-integrated entity, an upstream, and a downstream. First, we analyze how different modes of control on DRM affect the optimal prices and the level of copy protection. The results are dependent upon the different control modes of DRM and the degree of opportunistic behavior responding to increasing piracy costs. Second, we analyze the effect of two types of piracy depending on distribution channels (non-digital versus digital). Strengthening intellectual property rights (IPR) protection results in a price hike for both cases, while we have opposite changes in quantities depending on the types of piracy.","[Yoo, Kyeongwon] Sangmyung Univ, 7 Hongji Dong, Seoul, South Korea; [Bae, Sang Hoo] Clark Univ, 950 Main St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA; [Kim, Myungsup] Univ North Texas, 1155 Union Circle 311457, Denton, TX 76203 USA",Sangmyung University; Clark University; University of North Texas System; University of North Texas Denton,"Yoo, K (通讯作者)，Sangmyung Univ, 7 Hongji Dong, Seoul, South Korea.",kwyoo@smu.ac.kr,,,,,,,18,1,1,2,16,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

Inventories flatten the consumption path and eliminate price jumps at the end of the extraction period, so that market equilibrium becomes possible. We distinguish between two types of solutions, one with immediate and one with delayed buildup of inventories. For both cases, we do not only characterize potential optimal paths but also show that equilibria actually exist under fairly general conditions. It is found that optimum resource extraction involves increasing quantities over a period of time.

National culture can influence the ways managers cope with uncertainty, and their subsequent business decisions, as was described in seminal research by Hofstede (1991). By their very nature, cross-border acquisitions require that managers deal with different cultures and higher levels of uncertainty. We seek to understand how national culture affects value in cross-border acquisitions using data from the Asia-Pacific Rim region over the period between 2000 and 2009. The countries of this region have large cultural differences and the potential gains from acquisitions are very substantial, so these data are an excellent population for analysis. Our results show that different national cultures have an important influence on financial decisions by firms in ways consistent with classic research by Knight (2006), and also that different national cultures cope with uncertainty in different ways. We find that acquirers from countries with a high aversion to uncertainty conduct fewer cross-border acquisitions. Further, these high uncertainty aversion firms pay a higher price for control in cross-border deals. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, I develop a new empirical strategy for estimating the CES production function with biased technical change. The proposed method extends the control function approach to the CES specification to address endogeneity concerns and is able to retrieve sector-specific and time-varying estimates of technical change. Using data from U.S. manufacturing industries, I find evidence that (i) the production technology exhibits nonincreasing returns to scale, (ii) the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor is below unity, and (iii) technical change is generally labor-augmenting along the balanced growth path.","[Chen, Xi] STATEC, Luxembourg, Luxembourg",,"Chen, X (通讯作者)，STATEC Inst Natl Stat & Etud Econ Grand Duche Lux, BP 304, L-2013 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.",xi.chen@statec.etat.lu,,,,,,,40,5,6,0,17,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

First, we introduce the k-welfare lower bound, which requires that each agent should be guaranteed her utility at the kth queue position with zero transfer. For each k, we show that the k-pivotal rules (Mitra and Mutuswami, 2011) achieve the minimal deficit in each problem among all rules satisfying queue-efficiency, strategy-proofness, and the k-welfare lower bound. Next, we consider the identical costs lower bound, which is a counterpart of the identical preferences lower bound in our context, and show that when there is an odd number of agents, the k-pivotal rules with k = n+1/2 achieve the minimal deficit in each problem among all rules satisfying queue-efficiency, strategy-proofness, and the identical costs lower bound.

We find considerable mobility in the South African labour market, with men and women transitioning in and out of employment and between different forms of employment and non-employment, both in the short and medium run. Our econometric analysis shows that at least part of this mobility is explained by demand-side factors outside of individuals' direct control. Matric or post-matric level education and, to some extent, older age increased workers' job security, above and beyond the influence of other, job-related variables. Higher education also helped individuals find jobs, independent of their initial labour market status and earlier work experience. On the whole, our findings suggests that in South Africa labour market segmentation manifests itself through selective rather than indiscriminate rigidities: higher-educated and/or more experienced labour market participants more easily break through the barriers to entry into the most valued jobs and, once there, benefit more from downward rigidity in the labour market than others. We further show how, following the global financial and economic crisis, short-term labour market mobility gradually decreased and segmentation became somewhat less selective on the level of education.","[Essers, Dennis] Univ Antwerp, Inst Dev Policy & Management IOB, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium",University of Antwerp,"Essers, D (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Inst Dev Policy & Management IOB, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",dennis.essers@uantwerpen.be,,,,,,,55,5,6,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

This paper exploits an instrumental variable based on the fact that, since 1987, eligibility for aid from the International Development Association (IDA) has been based partly on whether or not a country is below a certain threshold of per capita income. The paper finds evidence that other donors tend to reinforce rather than compensate for reductions in IDA aid following threshold crossings. Overall, aid as a share of gross national income (GNI) drops about 59 % on average after countries cross the threshold. Focusing on the 35 countries that have crossed the income threshold from below between 1987 and 2010, a positive, statistically significant, and economically sizable effect of aid on growth is found. A 1 percentage point increase in the aid to GNI ratio from the sample mean raises annual real per capita growth in gross domestic product by approximately 0.35 percentage points.","[Galiani, Sebastian] Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Galiani, Sebastian] NBER, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Knack, Stephen; Xu, Lixin Colin] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Zou, Ben] Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; National Bureau of Economic Research; The World Bank; Michigan State University,"Knack, S (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",galiani@econ.umd.edu; sknack@worldbank.org; lxu1@worldbank.org; benzou@msu.edu,"Zou, Ben/IXD-8748-2023",,,,,,45,76,84,1,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

While female immigrants don't adjust their labour activities, male immigrants reduce their weekly labour supply and hence earn less when the Australian dollar appreciates.

We then argue that the presence of an energy consumption variable in a model of CO2 emissions can lead to systematic volatility in its coefficients, which has the potential to change their magnitude and sign.

Our empirical results, based on the 2007 and 2010 Chinese inter-regional input output tables, show that changes in most regions' final demand scale, final expenditure structure, and export scale have positive spatial spillover effects on other regions' CO2 emissions growth; changes in most regions' consumption and export preference help reduce other regions' CO2 emissions; changes in production technology and investment preferences may exert positive or negative effects on other region's CO2 emissions growth through domestic supply chains. For some regions, the aggregate spillover effect from other regions may be larger than the intra-regional effect in determining regional emissions growth. All these facts can significantly help provide a better, deeper understanding of the driving forces behind the growth of regional CO2 emissions and can thus enrich the policy implications concerning a narrow definition of carbon leakage through domestic inter-regional trade as well as a relevant political consensus about responsibility sharing between developed and developing regions inside China.

We develop a model that studies the dynamics of demand, profits and investment following a change of the nominal wage-rate, which is not accompanied by a simultaneous proportional change of prices to maintain the initial distribution of income. The initial income distribution, however, is eventually restored through a gradual adjustment of prices to the new level of the nominal wage-rate. We concentrate on the process of transition from the initial to a new equilibrium and consider both cases in which the process of transition is 'wage-led' and case in which it is 'profit-led'. In all cases, the dynamics of the economy is crucially affected by the firms' initial response to the shock and it is path-dependent. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Much research has established the cointegrated relationship between crude oil and natural gas prices in the U.S. The persistently low U.S. natural gas prices in recent years seem to mark a shift in this relationship, and have led some in industry to begin considering investments in GM capacity in the US. In order to look forward over decades when the underlying economic drivers may be outside of historical experience, we use a computable general equilibrium model of the global economy to evaluate the economic viability of GTL and its impact on the evolution of the crude oil-natural gas price ratio. Our results are negative for the potential role of GTL. In order to produce any meaningful penetration of GTL, we find it necessary to evaluate scenarios that seem extreme. With any carbon cap GTL is not viable. Moreover, even without a carbon cap of any kind, extremely optimistic assumptions about (i) the cost and efficiency of GTL technology and about (ii) the available resource base of natural gas and the cost of extraction, before the technology penetrates and it impacts the evolution of the crude oil-natural gas price ratio.

One of the most recent approaches is the inclusion of happiness or satisfaction indicators which function as measures of utility. In previous work using revealed preference data, adding satisfaction indicators resulted in gains in efficiency. This paper explores whether gains in efficiency also hold in a stated preference context of mode choice where the data is more controlled and the satisfaction that is measured includes both satisfaction with a usual commuting mode and expected satisfaction for a non-routine commuting mode. The paper also tests whether gains in efficiency lead to any improvements in prediction accuracy. Finally, the paper also presents a scenario analysis for the prediction of changes in satisfaction as a function of changes in car and bus attributes. The results indicate that the addition of satisfaction indicators to the model indeed improve model efficiency in line with other findings from previous research utilizing the same framework. Such findings encourage choice modelers to collect satisfaction indicators in revealed and stated preferences surveys and to subsequently include these indicators in choice models to increase model efficiency. However, the gains in efficiency do not lead to improvements in prediction in the study context probably due to the controlled nature of the stated preference data.","[Said, Maher] Amer Univ Beirut, Fac Engn & Architecture, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, POB 11-0236 Riad el Solh, Beirut 11072020, Lebanon; [Abou-Zeid, Maya] Amer Univ Beirut, Issam Fares Inst Publ Policy & Int Affairs, Bechtel 527,POB 11-0236 Riad el Solh, Beirut 11072020, Lebanon; [Abou-Zeid, Maya] Amer Univ Beirut, Fac Engn & Architecture, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Bechtel 527,POB 11-0236 Riad el Solh, Beirut 11072020, Lebanon; [Chalak, Ali] Amer Univ Beirut, Issam Fares Inst Publ Policy & Int Affairs, Reynolds 122,POB 11-0236 Riad el Solh, Beirut 11072020, Lebanon; [Chalak, Ali] Amer Univ Beirut, Fac Agr & Food Sci, Dept Agr Sci, Reynolds 122,POB 11-0236 Riad el Solh, Beirut 11072020, Lebanon",American University of Beirut; American University of Beirut; American University of Beirut; American University of Beirut; American University of Beirut,"Abou-Zeid, M (通讯作者)，Amer Univ Beirut, Issam Fares Inst Publ Policy & Int Affairs, Bechtel 527,POB 11-0236 Riad el Solh, Beirut 11072020, Lebanon.;Abou-Zeid, M (通讯作者)，Amer Univ Beirut, Fac Engn & Architecture, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Bechtel 527,POB 11-0236 Riad el Solh, Beirut 11072020, Lebanon.",ma202@aub.edu.lb,"Chalak, Ali/Y-3921-2019; Said, Maher/AAN-3139-2021","Chalak, Ali/0000-0001-7111-6674; Said, Maher/0000-0002-1671-3174",,,,,23,1,1,0,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-5345,,,J CHOICE MODEL,J.

Export controls are prudent government responses to the emergence of a new and widely perceived threat to national security. However, existing controls have failed to keep up with rapid global economic and technological changes, and are likely to have adverse effects on firms' economic performance. This article suggests regulatory and policy reforms, as well as corporate strategies for dealing with U.S. export controls in order to make such controls effective and relevant to changing technological developments. Among the problems the article identifies are the negative effects of these export controls on firm innovation, market competitiveness, investment, and trade flows. These issues point to a pressing agenda for regulatory reform. Reforms can focus on limiting control lists, enhancing the bilateral or multilateral cooperation in export controls, improving the efficiency and transparency of the licensing system, improving resources and the outreach to small and medium-size exporters, and compensation for the loss of market share.","[Seyoum, Belay] Nova Southeastern Univ, Huizenga Sch Business, Int Business Studies, Ft Lauderdale, FL 33314 USA",Nova Southeastern University,"Seyoum, B (通讯作者)，Nova Southeastern Univ, Huizenga Sch Business, Int Business Studies, Ft Lauderdale, FL 33314 USA.",,,,,,,,81,5,6,5,49,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

When allowing for costless and non-binding communication (cheap-talk), there exists a partially separating equilibrium that results in a substantially higher efficiency level than the adverse selection benchmark. The partially separating equilibrium hinges on the presence of matching frictions, which create a trade-off for low quality sellers between successfully mimicking high quality sellers and an increased matching probability if they truthfully reveal their type. The experimental results reflect the theoretical predictions of the partially separating equilibrium: communication is informative and improves efficiency compared to the benchmark without cheap-talk. We conduct control treatments to show that truth-telling is not explained by lying aversion or pro-social preferences, but is due to the pecuniary incentives of the partially separating equilibrium.

These concurrent instances of nationalization and privatization, on a major scale in historical terms, deserve attention. The paper examines why both now seem appropriate tools for crisis management in Europe and in the USA. It also estimates the scale of changes after 2008. The author argues that the rapid alternation, including parallel applications and mixed, silent' forms of nationalization and privatization, reflects ambiguity in political, theoretical and popular views. The uncertainty far exceeds ownership issues to include the role of the state in general, revealing fragmentation of measures in each direction: neither nationalization nor privatization has been based on any integrated, defined paradigm of economic policy.","[Voszka, Eva] Univ Szeged, Szeged, Hungary",Szeged University,"Voszka, É (通讯作者)，Univ Szeged, Szeged, Hungary.",voszka@yahoo.com,,,OTKA project [112069],OTKA project(Orszagos Tudomanyos Kutatasi Alapprogramok (OTKA)),"The study was prepared for the OTKA project No 112069 (Varieties of Capitalism Varieties of Direct Economic Intervention of the State).

We match firm-level information on a large sample of new manufacturing firms with available industry-level proxies of the main determinants of ownership structures according to existing economic theories. We estimate a logit model and quantify the empirical contribution of each argument to explain labor-owned versus capital-owned firm entry. Our results show that human capital specificity and workers heterogeneity largely explain labor owned firm entry, while other dimensions, such as limited worker wealth, have a weaker statistical relevance. These findings are robust to different estimation methods and are unlikely to be affected by endogeneity concerns. Our results contribute to the general understanding of the endogenous dynamics of ownership rights distribution in manufacturing firms and to the elaboration of policy initiatives aimed at supporting cooperative modes of firm organization.

Our estimates suggest that the phylloxera crisis caused a substantial increase in property crime rates and a significant decrease in violent crimes.","Banque France, Paris, France; Univ Paris 09, LEDa LEGOS, Paris, France; Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; IZA, St Martin Du Fresne, France; CNRS, OSC, Paris, France; Sci Po, Paris, France",European Central Bank; Bank of France; Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Laboratoire dEconomie de Dauphine LEDa; Paris School of Economics; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po),"Bignon, V (通讯作者)，Banque France DGEI DEMFI Pomone 041 1422, 31 Rue Croix Petits Champs, F-75049 Paris 01, France.",vincent.bignon@banque-france.fr,"Bignon, Vincent/JYP-2587-2024",,,,,,60,25,31,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0133,1468-0297,,ECON J,Econ.

The measure differs from the standard MFP growth as it measures productivity growth in the production of different types of products instead of by industry and it captures the effect of productivity gains in both foreign and domestic upstream industries. The paper finds that the increase in effective MFP is closely associated with the decline in output price and improvement in international competitiveness. Multifactor productivity growth for small, open economies and for the production of manufacturing, investment and export goods is partly attributable to productivity gains in the production of intermediate inputs in foreign countries.","[Gu, Wulong; Yan, Beiling] STAT Canada, Econ Anal Div, Ottawa, ON K1A 0T6, Canada",Statistics Canada,"Gu, WL (通讯作者)，STAT Canada, Econ Anal Div, Ottawa, ON K1A 0T6, Canada.",wulong.gu@canada.ca,,,,,,,33,18,19,2,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Virtual power plants are expected to be important components of the new intelligent energy infrastructure. They aggregate beside different types of distributed generation units also active consumers and storage technologies in order to integrate these in a profit-maximising, system-stabilising, and sustainable way. The assessment of the economic performance of virtual power plants requires a scenario-based and model-supported analysis. In this relation, future energy market conditions are simulated using the scenario methodology. Starting from the year 2015, three scenarios have been identified that illustrate alternative energy developments in Germany by 2030. Based on these scenarios, the additional revenues potential of the modeled virtual power plant is identified when compared to an independent and non-market-oriented operation mode of distributed energy resources. According to the model results, revenues of the VPP can increase by 11% up to 30% in the analyzed scenarios in 2030 due to the market-oriented operation mode. Nevertheless, the amount and composition vary depending on technology-specific subsidies, temporary nature of power demand and price structures in the energy market. Fluctuating renewable energies are expected to benefit from the market oriented operation mode in the virtual power plant, especially through the EEG direct marketing. The selective and regulated shutdown of renewable energies in times of negative electricity prices may lead to further cost savings. The utilization of temporary price fluctuations in the spot market and the demand-oriented provision of control power offer high additional revenue potential for flexible controllable technologies such as battery storage, biomethane as well as combined heat and power units. Finally, the determination of the long-term profitability of a virtual power plant still requires a full-scale cost-benefit analysis. For this holistic approach, the model results provide a reliable scientific basis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Using data from two waves of national household surveys, we find that wage inequality among migrants decreased significantly between 2002 and 2007. Our analysis on the wage distribution further shows that the high-wage migrants experienced slower wage growth than middle- and low-wage migrants a primary cause of declining inequality of migrants. By using distributional decomposition methods based on quantile regression, we find that an overall between-group effect dominates in the whole wage distribution, which means that the change in returns to the characteristics (education, experience and other employment characteristics) plays a key role, but on the upper tails of the wage distribution, the within group effect (residual effect) dominates, implying that the unobservable factors or institutional barriers do not favor the migrants at the top tail of the wage distribution. We also study wage differential between migrants and urban natives, and find that though the wage gap is narrowed, the gap at the upper wage distribution is becoming bigger. Overall, the results suggest that there exists a strong glass ceiling for migrants in the urban labor market. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

An individual is vulnerable if they are at risk of future absolute material deprivation, while they are insecure if they are threatened by losses in relative status. Using data from the first eleven waves of the Australian HILDA panel, we generate four alternative measures of real or perceived downside economic risk and employ panel data models to estimate their impacts on SF-36 mental and physical health indices. We test our hypotheses using a series of polynomial interactions which allow the effect sizes to vary non-linearly with income. Baseline estimates show that economic risks have consistently negative consequences for both mental and physical health, with the former effect being around three times the size of the latter. However our main finding is that increasing incomes do little to mitigate the sensitivity of health to these risks. This suggests it is mostly the prospect of loss rather than deprivation that impacts upon wellbeing. The finding is important as it helps distinguish between competing models (i.e. Beveridge vs Bismarck) for social insurance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Industrial developments are very important for all nations in terms of their economic prosperities. A problem is that the development produces various pollutions on air, water and other types of contaminations, all of which are usually associated with our health problems and climate changes. Thus, it is necessary for us to consider how to make a balance between economic success and pollution mitigation to maintain a high level of social sustainability in the world. It is widely considered that DEA is one of the methodologies to examine the level of sustainability. This study examines a recent research trend on DEA applications from 1980s to 2010s. Nowadays, many researchers have paid serious attention on how to combat various difficulties in the areas of energy and environment.As a result, the number of artides on DEA applications on energy and environment has dramatically increased, particularly after 2000s. However, it is true that DEA has strengths and drawbacks in the applications. Therefore, it is very important for us to carefully use DEA for guiding large policy issues and business strategies such as the global warming and climate change. An underlying premise of this study is that technology innovation in engineering and natural science may solve various problems by linking it with political and managerial efforts. The use of DEA provides a methodological linkage among them, so enhancing the practicality in mitigating problems due to climate change and environmental pollutions.

The study is novel in two main ways. First, labeled alternatives were used to assess whether the types of management options for reducing net emissions (green power, energy efficient technologies or carbon capture) are significant in understanding preferences for reducing emissions. Second, the importance of the level and type of uncertainty involved in reductions is tested. The types of uncertainty include (1) the uncertainty of achieving emissions reduction and (2) the uncertainty of international participation as the percentage of total global emissions covered by international agreements. The results of this survey identified how choice responses vary when the level of uncertainty associated with emissions reduction options is included within choice alternatives.

It is shown that after 2005, both geographic concentration and industrial specialization began to decline, resulting in an increased similarity of industrial structure among provinces. This paper posits that the industrial policies of the provincial governments are the cause of this phenomenon. The result is robust when using instrumental variables to deal with possible reverse causality. The underlying mechanism is that the policy of the central government, which is set to steer the direction of industrial development for several years to come, is an important reference document for all provincial planners. It therefore causes the less developed regions to deviate from their comparative advantages and results in a combination of insufficient geographic concentration and inverse specialization in China.","[Wu, Yiyun] Zhejiang Univ, Social Sci Acad, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Xiwei] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University,"Zhu, XW (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",xwzhu@zju.edu.cn,"Wu, Yiyun/JEF-3011-2023",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71503232, 71373235]; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang [LQ14G030011]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"The authors acknowledge the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71503232], [grant number 71373235]; the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang [grant number LQ14G030011]; and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.",,33,6,7,4,45,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

This study sets up a quasi-experiment using the Project Carbon Zero campaign, an energy-saving contest in Singapore, to empirically test the effectiveness of school children nudges in bringing electricity conservation messages home and influencing behaviors of their families and neighbors. Based on the 2 km (km) home school distance as an identification, our results show that families living within 2 km from participating schools (treatment group) used 1.8% less electricity at the block level than other families outside the 2 km school zone (control group) during the contest period. The electricity savings effects are persistent with an estimated marginal savings 1.6% in the post campaign months. The results imply that policy makers and advocates for energy conservation could use school children nudges in public campaigns, instead of pecuniary interventions, to drive home behavioral changes in electricity conservation of families.

The model accounts for human and physical capital accumulation, intra- and intergenerational health persistence, fertility choices, and women's time allocation between market work, child rearing, and home production. Bargaining between spouses and gender bias, in the form of discrimination in the work place and mothers' time allocation between daughters and sons, are also accounted for. The model is calibrated for a low-income country and various experiments are conducted, including improved access to infrastructure, an increase in subsidies to child care, a reduction in gender bias, and a composite gender-based reform program to assess the role of policy complementarities. The results illustrate the importance of accounting for changes in women's time allocation in assessing the impact of public policy on economic growth.","[Agenor, Pierre-Richard] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Agenor, Pierre-Richard] Ctr Growth & Business Cycle Res, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester; University of Manchester,"Agénor, PR (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Int Macroecon & Dev Econ, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",Pierre-richard.Agenor@manchester.ac.uk,"Peter, Serin/ITR-8938-2023",,,,,,75,10,10,1,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

We assess the performance of simple Taylor-type interest rate rules with respect to (a) equilibrium determinacy, (b) the model's ability to simultaneously generate output and inflation volatility similar to the pre-Volcker era, and (c) the model's response to a technology shock. We find that when individual preferences are affected by average household consumption (Aggregate Consumption Externality), stronger externalities increase the range of LAMP for which multiple equilibria arise even if the policy rule satisfies the Taylor principle. The interaction of LAMP and externalities can generate vast inflation/output relative volatility in line with the one observed in the data in the 1970s. According to our analysis, consumption externalities also affect the responses of endogenous variables to total factor productivity shocks.

Yet long-term interest rates and U.S. Treasury yields have remained remarkably low. What keeps long-term interest rates so low? This paper relies on a simple model, based on John Maynard Keynes' view that the central bank's actions are the key drivers of long-term interest rates, to explain the behavior of long-term interest rates in the U.S. The empirical findings confirm that short-term interest rates are the most important determinants of long-term interest rates in the U.S. Contrary to conventional wisdom, higher government indebtedness has a negative effect on long-term interest rates, particularly on a long run basis. However, in the short run, higher government indebtedness has a positive effect on long-term interest rates. These are relevant for contemporary policy debates and macroeconomic theory.","[Akram, Tanweer] Thrivent Financial, 625 Fourth Ave S,Mail Stop 1560, Minneapolis, MN 55415 USA; Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Acad Hall South,Room 404,39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Akram, T (通讯作者)，Thrivent Financial, 625 Fourth Ave S,Mail Stop 1560, Minneapolis, MN 55415 USA.",tanweer.akram@thrivent.com; huiqing_li@cufe.edu.cn,"Akram, Tanweer/AAB-9416-2021","Akram, Tanweer/0000-0002-6646-0902; Li, Huiqing/0000-0003-2559-0804",,,,,36,23,23,0,20,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Further, we establish feedback relationship among gas consumption, output and trade in the short-run. Given the significance of natural gas as the low-emission source of energy, we suggest governments and policy advisers of these major natural gas consumers to focus on developing pipeline infrastructure for adequate supply, reforming natural gas sector with a competitive price structure to combat excess demand in individual natural gas market.

In this paper, we show that a discriminatory competitive mechanism - which awards the contract on the basis of price and (firms') past performance - yields an efficient allocation of the contract and allows the buyer to implement her desired quality. Quality enforcement arises out of relational contracting whereby the buyer 'handicaps' a contractor in future competitive tendering processes if it fails to provide the required quality. We study an infinitely repeated procurement model with two firms and one buyer imperfectly informed on the firms' cost, in which, in each period, the buyer runs a discriminatory auction. We restrict our analysis to the case of a buyer committed to her handicapping strategy, a case which captures some of the features of a public buyer. When players use either grim trigger or stick-and-carrot strategies, we find that the buyer can induce the delivery of optimal (unverifiable) quality with a variety of handicap levels and, when applicable, durations of the punishment period; for some values of the handicap and the length of the punishment period, both firms remain active in the market even when punished.

We show how such reduced forms may be used to document policy-relevant derivative effects and to improve the understanding and implementation of structural models.,"[Arellano, Manuel] CEMFI, Madrid 28014, Spain; [Bonhomme, Stephane] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Arellano, M (通讯作者)，CEMFI, Madrid 28014, Spain.",arellano@cemfi.es; sbonhomme@uchicago.edu,"Arellano, Manuel/AAD-8080-2021",,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,86,3,3,1,8,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4609-6,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

This study estimates price elasticity of residential water demand to measure the responsiveness of water use to price changes, particularly for high water users. Household-level water use data for high residential water users from Central Florida were analysed using 3-stage least square (3SLS). Estimated price elasticity ranges between -0.07 and -0.14. This price elasticity estimate is below most of the estimates reported in the literature (in absolute value). The results imply that for price strategies to be effective in managing water demand of high residential water users, a significant price increase would be needed.

Over the last several years, brand valuation debate is growing in importance because of the need to provide a value of intangibles for different purposes. The purpose of this study is two-fold. First, we aim to understand whether brand valuation related to listed companies provided by three independent agencies is value relevant and therefore whether these brand valuations are taken into consideration by investors in their decision-making process. Second, we assess which of the three methods reflects the stock markets in a better way. We analyse a sample of 71 brands valuated by Interbrand, Brand Finance and BrandZ from 2013 to 2015. The results show that brand valuation provided by the independent agencies is value relevant; in addition, they reveal that the Brand Finance method, based on the royalty relief approach, is more value relevant than the others.

The first way has divisible money, take-it-or-leave-it offers by buyers, and a transfer scheme financed by money creation. If agents are sufficiently patient, the first best is achieved for finite money growth rates. if agents are impatient, the equilibrium allocation approaches the constrained efficient allocation asymptotically as the money growth rate tends to infinity. The second way has indivisible money, take-it-or-leave-it offers by buyers, and no government intervention.

However, electricity suppliers are uncertain about how much electricity their residential customers will use at any hour of the day until they actually turn switches on. While demand uncertainty is a common feature of all commodity markets, suppliers generally rely on storage to manage it. Singularly, electricity suppliers are exposed to joint volumetric and price risk on an hourly basis given the physical attributes of electricity. In the literature on electricity markets, few articles compare the efficiency of forward contracts, options and physical assets (i.e. power plants) within intraday hourly hedging portfolios, whereas electricity markets are precisely hourly markets. We analyse portfolios made of forwards, options and/or power plants for specific hourly clusters (9 am, 12 pm, 18 pm, 9 pm) based on electricity market data from 2013 to 2015 from the integrated German-Austrian spot market. Through a VaR model, we prove that intraday hedging with forwards is structurally inefficient compared to financial options and physical assets, no matter the cluster hour. Moreover, our results demonstrate the contribution of 'out of the money' options for all hours within volatile spot markets.","[Boroumand, Raphael Homayoun] PSB Paris Sch Business, Dept Appl Econ, Paris, France; [Goutte, Stephane] Univ Paris 08, LED, St Denis, France; [Goutte, Stephane] Vietnam Natl Univ, Int Sch, Hanoi, Vietnam",Universite Paris-VIII; Vietnam National University Hanoi,"Goutte, S (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 08, LED, St Denis, France.;Goutte, S (通讯作者)，Vietnam Natl Univ, Int Sch, Hanoi, Vietnam.",stephane.goutte@univ-paris8.fr,"Goutte, Stephane/Q-2202-2019","Goutte, Stephane/0000-0002-5206-866X",,,,,8,2,2,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Specifically, we consider the scenario where two contending parties engage in bargaining to avoid fighting when there are direct costs (e.g., arms buildups) and indirect costs (e.g., destruction to consumable resources) of conflict. Without imposing specific functional form restrictions on conflict, production, and destruction technologies, we show their interactions in determining an optimal decision between fighting and bargaining. We find that, under the shadow of conflict, bargaining is costly as the contending parties always allocate more resources to arming for guarding settlement through bargaining than in the event of fighting. In contrast to conventional thinking that bargaining is Pareto superior over fighting, we show conditions under which fighting dominates bargaining as the Nash equilibrium choice. The positive analysis may help explain the general causes of fighting, without resorting to the assumption of incomplete information or misperceptions.

This study aims to measure the contribution of health to economic growth using a panel of 91 countries over the period 1960-2005, and to compare the estimated impact of better health status on long-run per capita income under those two approaches, controlling for potential endogeneity.

However, empirical analysis failed to confirm the hypothesis. This study attempts to shed a new light on international capital mobility by incorporating the effect of the fiscal balance and the financial balance. Specifically, for a panel of 161 countries over the 1990-2013 period, the extended model is tested in comparison with the existing models of capital mobility. At the aggregate level, strong support is found for the extended model; while, at the region disaggregated level, compared to the existing models the hypothesis of capital mobility holds for a larger number of regions. Our model and estimates are additionally extended to account for the fact that the above mentioned relationships, are conditional on the country's level of financial development.","[Dzhumashev, Ratbek] Monash Univ, Econ, 1 Wellington Rd, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Cooray, Arusha] Univ Nottingham, Econ, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Monash University; University of Nottingham Malaysia,"Dzhumashev, R (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Econ, 1 Wellington Rd, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",ratbek.dzhumashev@monash.edu,"Dzhumashev, Ratbek/H-9207-2019; Cooray, Arusha/X-1507-2019","Dzhumashev, Ratbek/0000-0003-2428-2762; Cooray, Arusha/0000-0001-8809-9188",,,,,46,4,4,0,2,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-6116,1935-1690,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

Using a nonparametric method based on extreme value theory, we analyze interdependencies in downward risk in the banking sectors of the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, and Turkey during 1994-2013.

This period reflects a systematic upward movement along a Beveridge curve, so we can expect minor (if any) reallocation and efficiency changes. However, knowing that the trade process is time-and resource-consuming and that on average it depends on the number of agents in the labour market and other variables, the author expresses doubt if it is homogenous even along the UV curve. The author uses aggregate time series and estimates various matching functions models handling econometrically for temporal aggregation bias in the data, and employs the concept of augmented matching function. At the disaggregated level the assumption of agents homogeneity is tested and the values of several mismatch indices in occupational and regional perspectives are computed. The aggregate matching function models estimates are in line with theoretical indications and prove no changes in the efficiency of the labour market matching process. It is hard, however, to confirm the assumption of agents homogeneity. In general, the analysed time span is characterized by an increase of labour market tightness indices, a decrease of unemployment rates and, in fact, minor mismatch changes (a slight increasing tendency with negligible value changes). This set indicates a lower aggregate disequilibrium.","[Galecka-Burdziak, Ewa] Warsaw Sch Econ, Dept Econ 1, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics,"Galecka-Burdziak, E (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Dept Econ 1, Warsaw, Poland.",,,,National Science Centre Poland [UMO-2012/05/N/HS4/00194],"National Science Centre Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)","I acknowledge with thanks financial support from the National Science Centre Poland, project no.

The evaluation of the factors determining the risk of growing current account deficit to the country was performed in the groups of countries that experience economic slowdown and the ones that do not encounter it. Logistic regression is selected for a more accurate assessment of the growing current account deficit problem. It was set by the survey that the risk of growing current account deficit to the country depends on the factors, which determined it; whereas the reasons of the growing deficit identified in the groups of countries that experience the economic slowdown and the ones, which do not encounter it are different.

Governments have encouraged consumers to make healthier food choices and firms to reformulate food products. Evaluation of such policies has focused on the impact on consumer behaviour; firm behaviour has been less well studied. We show that the recent decline in dietary salt intake in the UK was entirely attributable to product reformulation; consumer switching between products worked in the opposite direction and led to a slight increase in grocery salt intensity. These findings point to the important role that firms can play in achieving public policy goals.,"[Griffith, Rachel] Univ Manchester, Inst Fiscal Studies, Manchester, Lancs, England; [O'Connell, Martin; Smith, Kate] UCL, Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England",University of Manchester; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University College London,"Griffith, R (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Inst Fiscal Studies, Manchester, Lancs, England.",,"Griffith, Rachel S/A-2583-2009; Smith, Kate/IZD-4956-2023","Griffith, Rachel S/0000-0002-8616-5820; Smith, Kate/0000-0003-3229-0439","European Research Council (ERC) [249529]; Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) under the Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy (CPP) [RES-544-28-0001]; Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) under Open Research Area (ORA) [ES/I012222/1]; European Research Council (ERC) [249529] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC); Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/M010147/1, ES/N018788/1, ES/I012222/1] Funding Source: UKRI",European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) under the Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy (CPP)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) under Open Research Area (ORA)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the European Research Council (ERC) under ERC-2009-AdG grant agreement number 249529, and the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) under the Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy (CPP), grant number RES-544-28-0001, and under the Open Research Area (ORA) grant number ES/I012222/1.",,52,42,49,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,JAN,2017,84.0,333,,,,,34,53,,10.1111/ecca.12192,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EO0FI,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000396373300003,0

The article looks at the role and importance of value-added tax (VAT) in a national taxation system. The author examines VAT rates in Russia and other countries and prerequisites for applying different rates of VAT to various goods and services. The article analyzes the system of VAT rates in Russia that includes a standard rate of 18%, a reduced rate of 10% and a special (zero) rate. The types of transactions that the reduced VAT rate is applicable to are analyzed. Positive and negative effects that occur as a result of charging different rates and a single positive rate of VAT are studied. The author proves the need to abolish the reduced VAT rate in Russia and switch over to a single positive rate of 18%. Mechanisms of compensating low-income citizens and producers of socially essential goods for the losses brought about by abolition of the reduced tax rate are proposed. The author concludes that the implementation of the reform will streamline the process of calculating and regulating the tax, reduce tax evasion, increase VAT revenue and improve the efficiency of VAT collection. The study aims to work out ways of improving the VAT collection system in Russia through the abolition of the reduced VAT rate of 10% in order to simplify the mechanism of tax calculation and administration and increasing the fiscal significance of the tax.","[Iadrennikova, Elena] Ural Fed Univ, 19 Mira St, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia",Ural Federal University,"Iadrennikova, E (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, 19 Mira St, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia.",elena.yadrennikova@mail.ru,"Iadrennikova, Elena/AAS-7661-2020","Iadrennikova, Elena/0000-0002-8530-3312",Russian Foundation for Basic Research [17-22-21001],Russian Foundation for Basic Research(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)Spanish Government),"The work was supported by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research, contract No 17-22-21001.",,11,1,1,0,3,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,587,594,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000455325300058,0

We expand the literature by adding the category of East Asian nonliberal capitalism to the established distinction of liberal market economies and nonliberal coordinated market economies. These three differ substantially not just in their fiscal policies, but also in monetary policies, degree of financial market orientation, exchange rate regime, and labor market organization. As in previous studies, we find that governments of liberal economies adopt more countercyclical fiscal policies. Departing from existing studies, however, among the nonliberal models of capitalism, (East Asian) state-led models have more countercyclical fiscal policies than (European) coordinated market economies, perhaps as countercyclical as liberal economies, both historically and during the 2007-9 crisis. This is due to less independent central banks, managed float of exchange rates, and limited financial market orientation and financial openness in East Asia, which allow for more active fiscal policy. Among political factors, left-of-center governments, fractionalized party systems, and election years are associated weakly with countercyclical fiscal policy, as expected. Labor market coordination and welfare generosity have unclear roles in regard to fiscal policy, a topic for future research.","[Kalinowski, Thomas] Ewha Womans Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Seoul, South Korea; [Hlasny, Vladimir] Ewha Womans Univ, Econ Dept, Seoul, South Korea",Ewha Womans University; Ewha Womans University,"Kalinowski, T (通讯作者)，Ewha Womans Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Seoul, South Korea.",,"Hlasny, Vladimir/AAI-9716-2020; Kalinowski, Thomas/ABI-4352-2020","Hlasny, Vladimir/0000-0002-6029-1634; Kalinowski, Thomas/0000-0002-8334-3337",,,,,40,0,0,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Meanwhile, we document that the effect of bullying is significantly attenuated in the presence of female teachers in the classroom.

First, public social expenditure related to unemployment and family as well as tax burden ratio significantly reduce income inequality. Second, corruption affects the efficiency of public social expenditure. This implies that even though two countries incur the same public social expenditure, a country with a low corruption index has higher efficiency of public social expenditure than that with a high corruption index.","[Kim, Taeyoung; Kim, Hongkyun] Sogang Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Sogang University,"Kim, H (通讯作者)，Sogang Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",isew@sogang.ac.kr,,,,,,,12,3,3,2,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Can an optimal tax system reinforce European countries in this respect? In this paper, we show that fiscal competition can be a welfare improving second best solution if the labour wedge is sufficiently large. Indeed, a sufficiently large labour wedge calls for an expansion of the production set in both countries, thus increasing global opportunities. For a small labour.wedge, this would not be the case, because the terms-of-trade externality would call for a fiscal policy that exacerbates a non-cooperative behaviour between countries. In a two-country world, we show that the symmetric Nash equilibrium can be Pareto-efficient, if employment subsidies are financed by a consumption tax. This is not the case when the former are financed by tariffs.","[Langot, Francois] Univ Le Mans, GAINS, TEPP, Le Mans, France; [Langot, Francois] IRA, Le Mans, France; [Langot, Francois] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Langot, Francois] Cepremap, Paris, France; [Langot, Francois] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Lemoine, Matthieu] Banque France, Paris, France",Le Mans Universite; Paris School of Economics; IZA Institute Labor Economics; European Central Bank; Bank of France,"Lemoine, M (通讯作者)，Banque France, Paris, France.",flangot@univ-lemans.fr; matthieu.lemoine@banque-france.fr,,"langot, francois/0000-0001-7737-5319; Lemoine, Matthieu/0000-0003-3423-6903",,,,,20,2,2,1,14,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0014-2921,1873-572X,,EUR ECON REV,Eur.

The findings indicate that factors that predominantly induce managerial unethical decision-making are the profits-only mindset of company owners, the unfair human resource management policies instilled in the workplace and the unethical behaviour of superiors. Results also show that the pressure to produce profits at any expense emphasised by company owners is strongly associated with managers' interest in results without considering the way they were achieved In addition, inconsistently with the previous theory, a revised categorisation of organisational factors eliciting unethical decisions is outlined based on empirical findings. This new classification introduces Prioritisation of economic results, violation of internal ethical guidelines, and situational tensions categories.

The two regime spatial autoregressive panel data model estimated in the Bayesian approach using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique was applied for both purposes. The model was evaluated in the small Monte Carlo simulation. The main analysis was performed at the NUTS3 level, which allowed delimitating the metropolitan areas according to the Larger Urban Zone definition. A balanced panel consisted of data for 31 European countries for the years 2000-2010. A significant catching up process was found for both metros and non metros. However, our evidence confirms the lower speed of convergence for metros than for non-metros. The significant parameter for spatial interactions was found only for the non metros. The results indicate the crucial role of national factors for identifying inequalities in the convergence and spatial dependence.","[Laszkiewicz, Edyta] Univ Lodz, Dept Spacial Econometr, Lodz, Poland; [Modranka, Emilia] Spatial Planning Off Lodzkie Voivodeship Lodz, Reg Terr Observ Lodzkie Voivodeship, Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Laszkiewicz, E (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Dept Spacial Econometr, Lodz, Poland.",,,"Kwiatkowska, Emilia/0000-0002-2712-480X; Laszkiewicz, Edyta/0000-0001-8833-3624",,,,,33,0,0,0,5,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,2720-5088,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

We find that CI, as a comprehensive platform for China's foreign cultural exchange, has a significant positive effect on China's tourist flows. The effects of CI on China's inbound tourism are transmitted through bridging cultural gaps and promoting Chinese language, which reduces psychic distance and transaction costs. CI also stimulates China's inbound tourist flows via reducing information asymmetry caused by different levels of institutional quality. Interestingly, we find that the heterogeneous effects of CI on China's inbound tourism depend on institutional quality, and the effects of CI to boost China's tourists are more prominent in departure countries with larger cultural difference.","[Lien, Donald] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Econ, San Antonio, TX USA; [Yao, Feng] Shenzhen Univ, China Ctr Special Econ Zone Res, Shenzhen, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Yao, Feng; Zhang, Fan] West Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, 1601 Univ Ave,POB 6025, Morgantown, WV 26505 USA; [Yao, Feng] Guangdong Univ Foreign Studies, Sch Econ & Trade, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA); Shenzhen University; West Virginia University; Guangdong University of Foreign Studies,"Yao, F (通讯作者)，West Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, 1601 Univ Ave,POB 6025, Morgantown, WV 26505 USA.",feng.yao@mail.wvu.edu,"Yao, Feng/O-1308-2013",,"Education Ministry Youth Foundation Project, China [15YJC630137]","Education Ministry Youth Foundation Project, China","The research of Feng Yao is supported by Education Ministry Youth Foundation Project, China [15YJC630137: Research on the influence and mechanism of political gene on the rent-seeking behavior of enterprises].",,27,10,11,4,69,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Because digital goods are typically traded via intermediaries like iTunes, Amazon, and Netflix, the question arises as to the optimal pricing mechanism for such club good intermediaries. We derive the direct Bayesian optimal mechanism for allocating club goods when the mechanism designer is an intermediary that neither produces nor consumes the goods, and we develop an indirect mechanism that implements this mechanism.

Potential of regional development is determined by exogenous and endogenous factors and it is necessary to use different indicators and methods to its evaluation.","[Melecky, Lukas] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept European Integrat, Sokolska Tr 33, Ostrava 70200 1, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Melecky, L (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept European Integrat, Sokolska Tr 33, Ostrava 70200 1, Czech Republic.",lukas.melecky@vsb.cz,"Melecky, Lukas/AAY-7847-2021; Melecky, Lukas/A-8078-2015","Melecky, Lukas/0000-0001-8889-6400; Melecky, Lukas/0000-0001-8889-6400",SGS project of Faculty of Economics [SP2017/111]; VSB-TUO; Operational Programme Education for Competitiveness [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0296],SGS project of Faculty of Economics; VSB-TUO; Operational Programme Education for Competitiveness,"The paper is supported by SGS project (SP2017/111) of Faculty of Economics, VSB-TUO and Operational Programme Education for Competitiveness (CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0296).",,27,3,3,0,0,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-349-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,78,86,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6CS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000426486500009,0

In the economic literature there are only few studies on the phenomenon of inflation persistence in Croatia. That is why we try to fill the gap in this area by analysing the phenomenon of inflation persistence in the Croatian economy, with particular emphasis of this phenomenon for different groups of goods and services. In this article we use a research method based on literature studies in the field of macroeconomics and international finance and econometric methods (Bayesian Vector Autoregression Model [BVAR]). All statistical data used in this article were monthly data and covered the period from January 2005 to December 2013 (108months) and their source was United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Statistical Division Database. It provides detailed statistical information on countries in Europe, North America and Central Asia. The calculated inflation persistence coefficient in Croatia stood at 0.88 in the period 2005-2013, which apparently confirmed the occurrence of high inflation persistence in this economy. High inflation persistence means a slow return of inflation to its long-run value after a shock. A high degree of inflation persistence should be a signal for the economic authorities of a country to initiate indispensable institutional and labour market reforms which usually increase flexibility of domestic economy and lead to a reduced degree of inflation persistence.","[Misztal, Piotr] Jan Kochanowski Univ Kielce, Dept Management & Adm, Kielce, Poland",Jan Kochanowski University,"Misztal, P (通讯作者)，Jan Kochanowski Univ Kielce, Dept Management & Adm, Kielce, Poland.",pmisztal@ujk.edu.pl,"Misztal, Piotr/AAR-6630-2020; Misztal, Piotr/V-2889-2018","Misztal, Piotr/0000-0003-2609-3439; Misztal, Piotr/0000-0003-2609-3439",,,,,28,2,2,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

The presence of substitution suggests that taxation can be a means of changing the energy input mix in a more environmental-friendly direction. For eight subsectors of the Danish economy, time series (1966-2011) are modeled by means of partial Cointegrated VARs. Long-run demand relations are identified for all subsectors and robust price elasticities are supported in five cases. The results are used in a small impulse-response experiment which suggests a potential for taxation to induce substitution of electricity for fossil-based energy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

An advantage of this approach is that the decision to join a union is treated as potentially endogenous, a function of the wage differential between union and non-union workers, rather than exogenous as is the case in virtually all previous Australian studies. The article finds that the decision to join a union is highly sensitive to the wage differential between union and non-union workers. The article also finds that male (female) union workers with average union characteristics earn 12% (18%) more than male (female) non-union workers with average non-union characteristics. However, a decomposition analysis finds that this difference is due to union workers having better human capital endowments than their non-union counterparts. In addition, they also receive a lower return for those endowments. These decomposition results suggest that union wage effects in Australia may be negative, rather than the small positive effects typically found in the Australian literature.","[Nahm, Daehoon; Dobbie, Michael; MacMillan, Craig] Macquarie Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia",Macquarie University,"Dobbie, M (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",michael.dobbie@mq.edu.au,"; Nahm, Daehoon/N-2759-2016","MacMillan, Craig/0000-0001-9692-5929; Nahm, Daehoon/0000-0003-0147-6425; Dobbie, Michael/0000-0003-4226-8745",Australian Government Department of Social Services,Australian Government Department of Social Services(Australian Government),The HILDA project was initiated and is funded by the Australian Government Department of Social Services and is managed by the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research.,,36,4,4,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The government collects income taxes and allocates tax revenue to primary and higher education. The tax rate and the allocation rule are both endogenously determined through majority voting. The tax rate is kept at a low level, and public funding for higher education is not supported unless the majority of individuals have human capital above some threshold. Although public support for higher education promotes aggregate human capital accumulation, it may create long-run income inequality because the poor are excluded from higher education.","[Naito, Katsuyuki] Asia Univ, Fac Econ, 5-24-10 Sakai, Musashino, Tokyo 1808629, Japan; [Nishida, Keigo] Fukuoka Univ, Fac Econ, Jonan Ku, 8-19-1 Nanakuma, Fukuoka 8140180, Japan",Fukuoka University,"Naito, K (通讯作者)，Asia Univ, Fac Econ, 5-24-10 Sakai, Musashino, Tokyo 1808629, Japan.",k.naito.71@gmail.com; knishida@fukuoka-u.ac.jp,"Nishida, Keigo/F-7380-2017","Nishida, Keigo/0000-0001-9697-3277; Naito, Katsuyuki/0000-0001-8894-6615",Global COE program of Osaka University; Central Research Institute of Fukuoka University [144002]; Joint Research Program of KIER,"Global COE program of Osaka University(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Central Research Institute of Fukuoka University; Joint Research Program of KIER","We are grateful to the editor, Giacomo Corneo, and two anonymous referees for their helpful comments and suggestions.

Traders with larger endowments, existing inconclusive information, lower risk aversion, and less experience in financial markets tend to acquire more information. Overall, we find that traders overacquire information, so that informed traders on average obtain negative profits net of information costs. Information acquisition and the associated losses do not diminish over time. This overacquisition phenomenon is inconsistent with predictions of rational expectations equilibrium, and we argue it resembles the overdissipation results from the contest literature. We find that more acquired information in the market leads to smaller differences between fundamental asset values and prices. Thus, the overacquisition phenomenon is a novel explanation for the high forecasting accuracy of prediction markets. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper we provide a different explanation for the occurrence of a top-dog equilibrium in exchange economies. We show that once heterogeneous complementarities (i.e. Scarf's preferences) are analysed with general endowment distributions, a variety of equilibria different from the well-known symmetric outcome with full utilisation of resources can emerge. Specifically, we show that stable corner equilibria with a winner-take-all (top dog) individual arise that are Pareto optima although the remaining individuals are no better off than with zero consumption and resources can be unused. Because of heterogenous complementarities, market mechanisms are weak and cannot overcome the top dog's power. Voting mechanisms or taxation policies can reduce the top dog's privileged position.","[Randon, Emanuela] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Str Maggiore 45, I-40125 Bologna, Italy; [Simmons, Peter] Univ York, Dept Econ, York Y010 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of Bologna; University of York - UK,"Randon, E (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Str Maggiore 45, I-40125 Bologna, Italy.",emanuela.randon@unibo.it; peter.simmons@york.ac.uk,,,,,,,19,1,1,0,5,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

The optimal content of the mineral materials of the asphalt mixture and a bituminous binder is selected employing calculation and experimental methods. The properties of the designed asphalt mixture must meet the requirements of technical specifications thus reducing its cost. The paper presents algorithms for simulating the composition of the asphalt mixture applying mathematical programming techniques. The algorithms allow designing the asphalt mixture with minimal bitumen content, a low cost of the mineral part and the densest gradation assessing technological requirements for producing the mixture. Optimal bitumen content is calculated considering bitumen capacities specified for different types of rock and determined employing the most recent standard sieves screening for narrow fractions. For verifying the new proposed algorithms, a numerical experiment on the materials most commonly used in asphalt mixing plants was done. The analysis of findings indicates that the application of the algorithms assist in comparing real results.","[Sivilevicius, Henrikas; Braziunas, Justas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Transport Technol Equipment, Plytines G 27, LT-10105 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Vislavicius, Kestutis] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Strength Mat & Engn Mech, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Vislavicius, K (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Strength Mat & Engn Mech, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",kestutis.vislavicius@vgtu.lt,"Bražiūnas, Justas/B-1432-2015","Sivilevicius, Henrikas/0000-0001-7523-0722; Braziunas, Justas/0000-0003-4860-7904",,,,,78,4,5,3,13,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

This article emphasizes the analysis of the people's opinions on current European system, especially on the subsidies. The work is divided into two parts. The first part contains an analysis of the current economic situation (inc.European funds) in the Czech Republic. The second part contains the survey results from two groups of people. The first group A is represented by ordinary people who are mostly employed. The people who own companies or people with high business status were in the second group B. All respondents had to meet two criteria - Czech nationality and at least Bachelor's degree. Results were obtained through questionnaires and deep interviews were compared with statistical numbers. Eurostat data and Czech statistical office show positive impacts on economic growth by using European funds. Research shows rising euroscepticism and poorly informed public. How it will continue?

We investigate to what extent the usual interpretation of the Lerner index remains valid in a setting where firms do not pursue profit maximization, but instead maximize revenues subject to a minimum-profit constraint. We show that a positive Lerner index still indicates market power, but that the magnitude of a positive Lerner index can no longer be used to determine how much market power there is. Furthermore, extra information would be required to draw conclusions about the presence or absence of market power when the Lerner index is zero or negative.

This paper is intended to provide a comprehensive literature review for marketing professionals and its purpose is to clarify the role of neuromarketing in the current research methods. Important concerns about the use of neuroscience research tools (fMRI, EEG, GSR, Oxytocin levels measurement through blood sampling and one commercial device - Emotiv EPOCH) are discussed in a way that can be understood by the wider public.

These factors are appropriately described in this article, and their consequences for corporate practice are presented here. The results, and their interpretations, can be useful, especially for those organizations which operate on the labour market and are characterized by a lack of qualified workers. The research is based on the analysis of the agency data from the MML-TGI Median Company. This data source is highly accepted in targeted marketing.

Robust regressions and panel data regressions are estimated in order to test the main determinants of infant mortality in the EU. Both the GDP and birth before the age of 20 influence infant mortality rate. It is likely that as mothers mean age at the first child increases, the rate of infant mortality decreases. The results found here contribute to the discussion on the factors explaining infant mortality in Europe and to future health policy.

The market is the meeting place of supply and demand. The supply side consists of sovereign producers whose product, as a result of the selected combinations of the factors of production, tries to win the interest of demand under the conditions of competition with other competing producers. The demand side is represented by consumers with differing behaviour. There is a relatively large number of decision alternatives and product selections. Consumers can behave rationally as well as irrationally. These facts influence the market and the competition. The competition benefits consumers in case they behave rationally and have information, which enables them to choose from the offered products. These issues include traditional as well as new approaches, that will be outlined in this paper. These are mainly related to behavioural economics, which, in the analysis of economic processes and their behaviour, is based on psychological knowledge. This is also important in the field of competition as it defines how behavioural economics and deviations from rational behaviour influence the behaviour of consumers.","[Tokarova, Maria] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235 5, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Tokárová, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235 5, Slovakia.",maria.tokarova@euba.sk,,,"VEGA [1/0001/16, 1/0277/04]",VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This paper is an output of the VEGA project No. 1/0001/16 The present and the prospects of employment changes and related processes in the context of fulfilling the targets of the European employment strategy and the VEGA project No. 1/0277/04 Innovations and competitiveness of the Slovak economy.,,11,0,0,0,0,NEWTON COLL AS,PRAHA 1,"POLITICKYCH VEZNU 10, PRAHA 1, 110 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87325-10-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,135,139,,,,,,5,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ1AP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000417344900015,0

Our 'Green Innovation' model includes three types of eco-investments to explain differences in the incidence of two types of eco-innovation, which are allowed to affect labor productivity. We allow for complementarity between the two types of eco-innovations.

The MSM was designated as United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization World Heritage Site in 1979, and is the most visited coastal site in France. The potential effects on consumer surplus (CS) estimates of some aspects of the ZTCM are considered, namely the treatment of the multiple purpose/destination (MP/D) trips, the inclusion of the opportunity cost of time (OCT) in the recreation demand model and the heterogeneity in the preferences. The heterogeneity in the preferences is examined through a random parameters Poisson model (RPPM). The RPPM generalizes the standard Poisson model (SPM) by allowing coefficients of explanatory variables to vary randomly across geographical units rather than being fixed. Our results show that (1) substantial CS values are associated with the MSM; (2) excluding/ignoring MP/D trips result in biased CS estimates; (3) omitting OCT does not substantially bias CS estimates; (4) the RPPM provides richer information about the impact of explanatory variables on the demand for trips than the SPM, but (5) leads to statistically similar CS estimates than the SPM.","[Voltaire, Louinord] ULCO, TVES, 21 Quai Citadelle,BP 35528, F-59383 Dunkerque 1, France; [Levi, Loic] Agrocampus Ouest, Rennes, France; [Alban, Frederique; Boncoeur, Jean] UBO, Brest 3, France",Universite du Littoral-Cote-d'Opale; Institut Agro; Agrocampus Ouest; Universite de Bretagne Occidentale,"Voltaire, L (通讯作者)，ULCO, TVES, 21 Quai Citadelle,BP 35528, F-59383 Dunkerque 1, France.",louinord.voltaire@univ-littoral.fr,,"ALBAN, Frederique/0000-0003-3388-8192","French Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy (LITEAU program)","French Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy (LITEAU program)","This work was supported by the French Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy (LITEAU program).",,44,18,21,1,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In the developing world, technology can facilitate these resources and address basic human needs in a variety of ways: from provision of farmer training and cloud-controlled clean water systems to health information and mobile money services. Some of these services expand access to resources in ways that particularly benefit women. In environments where women are disadvantaged socially and economically, information and communications technologies (ICT) can enable women to access valuable information, consider a broader range of business opportunities, access wider markets, partake in educational programs, and share experiences with and gain mentorship from other women. However, there are large gender gaps in the access to technology, particularly in rural areas. To begin, I briefly discuss the role of technology in development, and consider the extent and significance of technology gender gaps. Next, I review key barriers to reducing these gaps, and discuss the concept of social innovation as it applies to technology interventions. Examples from five social innovations in India - a country with large technology gender gaps - illustrate the range of possibilities for innovative access to and use of ICT for diverse target groups. I conclude with some suggestions for further improvement in this area.","[Warnecke, Tonia] Rollins Coll, Social Entrepreneurship & Business, Winter Pk, FL 32789 USA; [Warnecke, Tonia] Rollins Coll, Ctr India & South Asia, Winter Pk, FL 32789 USA",Rollins College; Rollins College,"Warnecke, T (通讯作者)，Rollins Coll, Social Entrepreneurship & Business, Winter Pk, FL 32789 USA.;Warnecke, T (通讯作者)，Rollins Coll, Ctr India & South Asia, Winter Pk, FL 32789 USA.",,,,,,,,28,8,13,3,61,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

This policy resulted in low graduation rates, while still enriching stock holders, giving them something for nothing. Addressing low graduation rates requires changing the accreditation of for-profit schools, a change that affects the allocation of federal funds, changes that the Obama administration tried to implement.

After summarising the regulatory basis, we identify three essential building blocks for further examination: the notion of matching liabilities to long-term (government) bonds, the use of standard deviation of return as a measure of risk and the idea that strategic asset allocation is the most important decision in portfolio management (this last one, the Brinson axiom). We examine these foundations individually and then collectively with the aid of two unobtrusive postulates-the first being the efficient markets hypothesis and the second that pension scheme assets should be used to purchase only those securities with minimal default risk. From the perspective of what we have elsewhere called the Keynes-Graham schema, we conclude that the foundations are unsound and that the conventional approach, adopted not only by both the Regulator and the Protection Fund but also by the major actuarial consultancies, induces, if not actually requires, pension schemes to engage in speculation rather than investment.","[Woods, J.

In the model, we consider new determinants (FDI, export and tourism) and use a two-period lagged debt-GDP ratio as the transition variable. The effects of determinants on growth vary across countries and with time, depending on the value of the transition variable. The threshold of the debt-GDP ratio (73.019%) is a referenced index to set the ceiling of debt-GDP ratio for the fiscal stability. For countries with high debt ratios, the policies to accumulate human capital and promote tourism are more effective in boosting growth than to stimulate domestic physical investment and export. For countries with low debt ratios, the conclusion is opposite. Thus, lowering debt ratio is not always favorable for the contributions of individual determinants to growth.","[Wu, Po-Chin; Liu, Shiao-Yen] Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Taoyuan, Taiwan; [Huang, Tsai-Yuan] Natl Pingtung Univ, Pingtung, Taiwan",Chung Yuan Christian University; National Pingtung University,"Wu, PC (通讯作者)，Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Taoyuan, Taiwan.",,,,,,,,39,0,0,0,4,INST ESTUDIOS FISCALES,MADRID,"AVDA CARDENAL HERRERA ORIA, 378, MADRID, 28035, SPAIN",0210-1173,,,HACIENDA PUBLICA ESP,Hacienda Publica Esp.,,2017,,222,,,,,43,63,,10.7866/HPE-RPE.17.3.2,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FT6OK,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000423273300002,0

Consequently, a stated preference survey needs to be designed so as to provide respondents with all the relevant information, and to help them process this information so they can perform the valuation exercise properly. In this paper, we study experimentally an elicitation procedure in which respondents are provided with a sequence of different types of information (social cues and objective information) that allows them to sequentially revise their willingness-to-pay (WTP) values. Our experiment was carried out in large groups using an electronic voting system which allows us to construct social cues in real time. To analyse the data, we developed an anchoring-type structural model that allows us to estimate the direct effect (at the current round) and the indirect effect (on subsequent rounds) of information. Our results shed new light on the interacted effect of social cues and objective information: social cues have little or no direct effect on WTP values but they have a strong indirect effect on how respondents process scientific information. Social cues have the most noticeable effect on respondents who initially report a WTP below the group average but only after receiving additional objective information about the valuation task. We suggest that the construction and the provision of social cues should be added to the list of tools and controls for stated preference methods.","[Ami, Dominique] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, EHESS, Cent Marseille,AMSE, 5 Blvd Maurice Bourdet CS50498, F-13205 Marseille 01, France; [Aprahamian, Frederic] Univ Toulon & Var, 5 Blvd Maurice Bourdet CS50498, F-13205 Marseille 01, France; [Aprahamian, Frederic] AMSE, 5 Blvd Maurice Bourdet CS50498, F-13205 Marseille 01, France; [Chanel, Olivier; Luchini, Stephane] Aix Marseille Univ, Cent Marseille, CNRS, EHESS,AMSE, 5 Blvd Maurice Bourdet CS50498, F-13205 Marseille 01, France; [Chanel, Olivier; Luchini, Stephane] IDEP, 5 Blvd Maurice Bourdet CS50498, F-13205 Marseille 01, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Aix-Marseille Universite; Universite de Toulon; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Aix-Marseille Universite,"Chanel, O (通讯作者)，AMSE, 5 Blvd Maurice Bourdet CS50498, F-13205 Marseille 01, France.",dominique.ami@univ-amu.fr; frederic.aprahamian@univ-amu.fr; olivier.chanel@univ-amu.fr; stephane.luchini@univ-amu.fr,"Chanel, Olivier/H-6500-2013","Chanel, Olivier/0000-0002-8221-7558",A*MIDEX grant AMSE - Investissements d'Avenir French Government program [ANR-11-IDEX-0 001-02]; French Research Ministry [04 5 666 ACI]; GREEN-Econ [ANR-16-CE03-0005]; Provence-Alpes-Cote-d'Azur (PACA) Regional Council,"A*MIDEX grant AMSE - Investissements d'Avenir French Government program; French Research Ministry(Ministry of Research, France); GREEN-Econ; Provence-Alpes-Cote-d'Azur (PACA) Regional Council","This research was carried out thanks to the support of the A*MIDEX grant AMSE (ANR-11-IDEX-0 001-02) funded by the Investissements d'Avenir French Government program, of French Research Ministry grant (no. 04 5 666 ACI Sante et Environment), of GREEN-Econ (ANR-16-CE03-0005) managed by the French National Research Agency and the technical and financial support from the Provence-Alpes-Cote-d'Azur (PACA) Regional Council.

We performed a critical literature review of both topics using meta-synthesis as method to identify, analyze and compare the two theories. Using a framework, this paper explores the elements belonging to each theory's domain, in order to identify the key factors necessary to compare the two theories. The results of this analysis show that both theories involve the assessment of three key aspects: the understanding of innovation activities, the role of the agents involved, and the interaction and resulting networks among them. A similarity was found showing that these two different theories are applications of System Thinking approach. Another finding, which has not been mentioned in previous research on the topic, is that the construction of the initial concepts of the IE theory was originally rooted in several SI elements. Finally, we found key factors that may be the cross-fertilization link between the two communities that represent each theory.","[Bassis, Nihad Faissal; Armellini, Fabiano] Polytech Montreal, Dept Math & Ind Engn, 2900 Blvd Edouard Montpetit, Montreal, PQ H3T 1J4, Canada",Universite de Montreal; Polytechnique Montreal,"Bassis, NF (通讯作者)，Polytech Montreal, Dept Math & Ind Engn, 2900 Blvd Edouard Montpetit, Montreal, PQ H3T 1J4, Canada.",nihad.bassis@polymtl.ca; fabiano.armellini@polymtl.ca,"Armellini, Fabiano/AAN-7359-2021; Bassis, Nihad Faissal/K-7405-2019; Armellini, Fabiano/B-8019-2012","Bassis, Nihad Faissal/0000-0001-9011-9256; Armellini, Fabiano/0000-0002-4671-7897",,,,,131,26,27,6,89,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

The study takes from a recent SADC microfinance survey which recommended financial rescue packages for ailing MFIs to proffer financial sustainability. This survey failed to specify the form of financing which supports financial sustainability in addition to the inconclusive and little evidence in this regard. We note that though the financing structure and the level of financial sustainability varies with countries, MFIs are generally financially unsustainable. A robust probit model framework affirms the role of financing structure on financial sustainability. Portfolio at risk, cost efficiency and costs linked to deposit attraction explain financial sustainability. We suggest the availing of more donations, upgrading risk management and improving cost efficiency to induce financial sustainability.","[Bayai, Innocent] Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Bulawayo, Zimbabwe; [Ikhide, Sylvanus] Stellenbosch Univ, Business Sch, Stellenbosch, South Africa",National University of Science & Technology - Zimbabwe; Stellenbosch University,"Bayai, I (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Bulawayo, Zimbabwe.",nncntb9@gmail.com,"Ikhide, Sylvanus/AAH-7873-2021",,,,,,70,17,17,1,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1370-4788,1467-8292,,ANN PUBLIC COOP ECON,Ann.

The period 2003-2016 is used to study the likelihood of financial distress in different scenarios. Various factors are utilized, including (1) accounting factors in the emerging market score model; (2) market factors in the distance-to-default model; and (3) macroeconomic indicators. The area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUC) curve is used to compare the usefulness of various models that predict financial distress and bankruptcy. Empirical findings from this study show that accounting and market factors, together with macroeconomic fundamental factors, both affect financial distress when they are considered in isolation. However, in a comprehensive model, the effects from accounting factors appear to be more significant than those from market based factors. The default prediction model, which includes accounting factors with macroeconomic indicators, appears to perform much better than the model comprising market-based factors with macroeconomic fundamentals.","[Binh Pham Vo Ninh] Vietnam Netherlands Econ Program, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Trung Do Thanh; Duc Vo Hong] Ho Chi Minh City Open Univ, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Ho Chi Minh City Open University,"Hong, DV (通讯作者)，Ho Chi Minh City Open Univ, Business & Econ Res Grp, 97 Vo Van Tan St,Dist 3, Ho Chi Minh City 7000, Vietnam.",duc.vhong@ou.edu.vn,"Vo, Duc Hong/R-1419-2019","Vo, Duc Hong/0000-0001-7823-0349",,,,,36,35,40,4,33,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0939-3625,1878-5433,,ECON SYST,Econ.

Instead, data suggests that bureaucratic and political opposition to the contract reform led to implementation delays and a differential interpretation of identical contract terms.

For that purpose, we develop a Generational Accounting Model applied to the French economy. Using the conventional methodology of generational accounting, we first estimate the adjustments that will be necessary to ensure the sustainability of French fiscal policy in the long term under the assumption that individual taxes and transfers grow at the same rate as labor productivity. However, this assumption does not account for the explicit determinants of individual productivity. Therefore, we then explain how productivity growth is partly due to the French population's skill level and its health level, which is approximated by the survival rate of adults. We estimate that the increased educational attainment and improved adult survival rate in France generate potentially important productivity gains that could significantly challenge the weight of the burden induced by aging. Therefore, we estimate that this change could reduce the tax burden bequeathed to future generations by 79 percent. Our results are robust to the main assumptions.","[Chojnicki, Xavier; Rabesandratana, Paul Eliot] Univ Lille, LEM CNRS UMR 9221, Lille, France",Universite de Lille; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Chojnicki, X (通讯作者)，Univ Lille 3, LEM CNRS UMR 9221, Maison Rech, Domaine Univ Pont de Bois,BP 60149, F-59653 Villeneuve Dascq, France.",xavier.chojnicki@univ-lille3.fr,"Chojnicki, Xavier/AFQ-5884-2022",,,,,,35,3,3,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Given the important role that national defense has played in the development of the state, it seems as though this would imply some relationship between military expenditures and economic development. However, there is no consensus on the direction of the relationship between military expenditures and economic growth. In this paper, we propose a resolution to this puzzle. We argue that military technology is a limiting factor for wealth (and therefore capital) accumulation. Since wealth must be protected from plunder and/or destruction, the amount of wealth that can be accumulated is constrained by a society's ability to adequately defend it. We present a theoretical model consistent with this idea and perform a Monte Carlo experiment to determine the implications of this hypothesis for empirical work. We fmd that the long-run relationship between military expenditures and private production is positive. However, in sample sizes consistent with existing data, the relationship is ambiguous. As a result, we provide support for this idea by relying on historical examples consistent with our hypothesis. Finally, we consider the implications of our hypothesis for the development of state capacity.","[Hendrickson, Joshua R.] Univ Mississippi, Dept Econ, 229 North Hall, University, MS 38677 USA; [Salter, Alexander William] Texas Tech Univ, Rawls Coll Business, 703 Flint Ave, Lubbock, TX 79410 USA; [Albrecht, Brian C.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, 1925 Fourth St South, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Mississippi; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Hendrickson, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Mississippi, Dept Econ, 229 North Hall, University, MS 38677 USA.",jrhendr1@olemiss.edu; alexander.w.salter@ttu.edu; albre155@umn.edu,,,,,,,71,16,17,0,10,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0164-0704,1873-152X,,J MACROECON,J.

This issue is particularly timely for national statistical institutes (NSIs) in the European Union, which are now required by Eurostat to produce official house price indexes. Our solution combines the hedonic imputation method with a flexible hedonic model that captures geospatial data using a non-parametric spline surface. For Sydney, Australia, we find that the extra precision provided by geospatial data as compared with postcode dummies has only a marginal impact on the resulting hedonic price index. This is good news for resource-stretched NSIs. At least for Sydney, postcodes seem to be sufficient to control for locational effects in a hedonic house price index.","[Hill, Robert J.; Scholz, Michael] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Dept Econ, Univ Str 15-F4, A-8010 Graz, Austria",University of Graz,"Hill, RJ (通讯作者)，Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Dept Econ, Univ Str 15-F4, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",robert.hill@uni-graz.at,,"Hill, Robert/0000-0002-7483-9701; Scholz, Michael/0000-0002-6766-7497",Austrian National Bank (Jubilaumsfondsprojekt) [14947],Austrian National Bank (Jubilaumsfondsprojekt),"This project has benefited from funding from the Austrian National Bank (Jubilaumsfondsprojekt 14947).

First, the steady-state welfare-maximizing level of basic research is below the steady-state growth-maximizing level. Second, a consideration of the welfare effects during the transition path suggests that marginal changes in the level of basic research can increase household welfare even at its steady-state welfare-maximizing level.

In Chinese counties which accommodated around 195 million urban population in 2012, private sector participation (PSP) has progressed slowly but steadily among the county-level water utilities. Using a panel data set extracted from the annual surveys conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics of China (1998-2006), we exploit the changes in the PSP status of water utilities and apply a fixed-effects model to identify the causal effects of PSP on 12 performance indicators. We find that utilities with private investment enjoyed significant performance improvement in three areas: output, financial performance and profitability, and efficiency. Using supplementary data from population censuses and statistical yearbooks, we find that water quality is slightly lowered under PSP, while no significant effect is detected for the other service outcomes. The findings suggest that a greater role of PSP in the urban water supply sector of Chinese counties could be promoted.","[Li, Li] East China Normal Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Li, Li] Natl Univ Singapore, Inst Water Policy, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, Singapore 259770, Singapore",East China Normal University; National University of Singapore,"Li, L (通讯作者)，East China Normal Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.",liliecon10@gmail.com,"Li, Li/GYR-2620-2022","Li, Li/0000-0001-7441-9523",Staff Research Support Scheme (SASS) FY2016 of Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy,Staff Research Support Scheme (SASS) FY2016 of Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy,"I acknowledge the financial support from Staff Research Support Scheme (SASS) FY2016 of Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.

Adopting a spatial econometric approach along with a gravity model set-up, we account for the role of ethnic communities in neighbouring countries on trade, and we propose a new way to define neighbours based on the intensity of links in the migration network. Our approach is particularly well suited to measure the indirect effect stemming from the presence of significant ethnic communities on trade through a market familiarization effect. Using data covering all countries between 1970 and 2000, we find a significant indirect effect of migration on trade, that depends on the chosen weight matrix.","[Metulini, Rodolfo] Univ Brescia, Dept Econ & Management, Contrada Santa Chiara 50, I-25122 Brescia, Italy; [Sgrignoli, Paolo] Unipol Financial Grp, Bologna, Italy; [Riccaboni, Massimo] IMT Sch Adv Studies Lucca, Lab Anal Complex Econ Syst, Lucca, Italy; [Schiavo, Stefano] Univ Trento, Sch Int Studies, Dept Econ & Management, Trento, Italy; [Schiavo, Stefano] Observ Francais Conjonctures Econ, Dept Rech Innovat & Concurrence, Paris, France; [Riccaboni, Massimo] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Management Stategy & Innovat, Leuven, Belgium",University of Brescia; IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca; University of Trento; KU Leuven,"Metulini, R (通讯作者)，Univ Brescia, Dept Econ & Management, Contrada Santa Chiara 50, I-25122 Brescia, Italy.",rodolfo.metulini@unibs.it,"SCHIAVO, Stefano/B-6147-2012; Metulini, Rodolfo/AAF-5207-2020; metulini, rodolfo/HNQ-6356-2023; Riccaboni, Massimo/D-4102-2009","SCHIAVO, Stefano/0000-0001-9740-5167; Metulini, Rodolfo/0000-0002-9575-5136; RICCABONI, Massimo/0000-0003-4979-8933",,,,,63,6,8,1,31,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

In this paper we explore whether individual belief updating is affected by the cost of information. Our conjecture is that this effect should be observed if individuals are prone to the sunk cost fallacy. We design an experimental environment where subjects perform a belief updating task after receiving useful and identical information on the state of the world. Our treatments vary the way in which information is made available to subjects. We find a systematic effect of the cost of information on belief updating. Subjects overweigh costly information relative to free information, which results in a 'push' of beliefs towards the extremes. The cost-driven shift can lead to posterior beliefs more attuned with Bayesian updating. We argue that an intensification of the representativeness bias is the most likely explanation of our results.

The ultimate goal of MDS techniques is to produce a geometric map that illustrates the underlying structure of complex phenomena such as the innovation performance of the EU countries. Cluster analysis, conducted with the use of Ward's method provided an objective view of the division of the EU countries based on their selected characteristics. The final result is a two-dimensional map illustrating the structure of innovation performance. The main conclusion drawn from the analysis is the explanation of distance between single indices in a spatial map and their role in distinguishing specific groups of the EU countries from the perspective of innovation performance.","[Roszko-Wojtowicz, Elzbieta] Univ Lodz, Fac Econ & Sociol, Dept Econ & Social Stat, Lodz, Poland; [Bialek, Jacek] Univ Lodz, Dept Stat Methods, Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz; University of Lodz,"Roszko-Wójtowicz, E (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Fac Econ & Sociol, Dept Econ & Social Stat, Lodz, Poland.",elzbieta.roszko@uni.lodz.pl; jbialek@uni.lodz.pl,"Białek, Jacek/AAX-5756-2020; Białek, Jacek/S-6879-2018; Roszko-Wójtowicz, Elżbieta/AAD-4218-2019","Białek, Jacek/0000-0002-0952-5327; Białek, Jacek/0000-0002-0952-5327; Roszko-Wójtowicz, Elżbieta/0000-0001-9337-7218",,,,,38,8,8,0,9,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

Patient selection, physician price sensitivity, and prices",JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Health insurance; HMOs spending; Prescription drug demand,CARE; HEALTH; INCENTIVES,"Cost-control incentives have become an important part of the health insurance landscape in the United States. These incentives are the strongest in capitated managed care organizations, especially HMOs, because such organizations are paid a fixed amount regardless of the spending they generate. Using a sample of insurance claims from about 500 plans, I find that in HMOs, spending on anti-cholesterol drugs is 19% lower than in other insurance plans. This spending difference could reflect the strong cost-control incentives generated by capitation, but it could also reflect the selection of healthy, price-sensitive patients into HMOs, or it could simply reflect lower prices. To understand the difference, I estimate a model of physician prescribing and patient refill decisions. Patients in HMOs are nearly twice as sensitive to copays as are other patients, consistent with selection of healthy patients into HMOs. Even after adjusting for this selection, however, HMO physicians remain highly sensitive to drug procurement costs. This high sensitivity explains about a 20% of the spending difference; combined with lower prices, it explains about 25-55% of the difference. I find no evidence that these spending reductions result in fewer patient refills or the prescribing of less effective statins. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This study exploits the fact that, in India, people are assigned a caste from birth. Two similar surveys of household heads (each with N= 1000) in rural Punjab and Andhra Pradesh show an increasing pattern of economic welfare with caste hierarchy. This illustrates that, in the rural regions under study, one's caste is still an important determinant of opportunities in life. Subsequently, we find that the castes at the top are clearly more satisfied than the lower and middle castes. This result, which is in line with the predictions of all major social comparison theories, is robust across the two case studies. The pattern across low and middle castes, however, is less clear, reflecting the complex theoretical relationship between being of middle rank, on the one hand, and behaviour, aspirations, and well-being, on the other hand. In the Punjab sample, we even find a significant U-shaped pattern, with the middle castes being the least happy. Interestingly, these patterns resemble those found for Olympic medallists (first documented by Medvec et al., 1995).","[Van Landeghem, Bert] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Van Landeghem, Bert] Univ Maastricht, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Van Landeghem, Bert] Inst Study Labour IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Vandeplas, Anneleen] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Inst & Econ Performance LICOS, Leuven, Belgium; [Vandeplas, Anneleen] European Commiss, Brussels, Belgium",University of Sheffield; Maastricht University; IZA Institute Labor Economics; KU Leuven,"Van Landeghem, B (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.;Van Landeghem, B (通讯作者)，Univ Maastricht, Maastricht, Netherlands.;Van Landeghem, B (通讯作者)，Inst Study Labour IZA, Bonn, Germany.",b.vanlandeghem@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Vandeplas, Anneleen/0000-0001-7629-578X",,,,,82,5,6,1,24,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",2214-8043,2214-8051,,J BEHAV EXP ECON,J.

While all cryptocurrencies can theoretically and practically serve as a medium of exchange, they are unlikely to become common and liquid media of exchange unless they can illustrate utility in one of the other functions of money. Digital currencies' rigidly inflexible supply and wildly fluctuating demand make them too unstable to be used as a unit of account for the foreseeable future. Of the five, only Bitcoin has the potential to serve as a store of value, due to its strict commitment to low supply growth, credibly backed by the network's distributed protocol and credible demonstration of the absence of any authority capable of altering the supply schedule. Other cryptocurrencies' centralized control, and use as tokens for specific applications make them unlikely to fulfil monetary functions. (C) 2018 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.

The analysis focuses on a specific intersectoral demand-side channel for structural change: the forward linkage established by foreign manufacturing multinational enterprises (MNEs) with service providers through outsourcing in the UK local labour markets. Descriptive evidence shows that service outsourcing by foreign manufacturing plants is notably larger than that of their domestic counterparts. On this basic premise, we estimate the local multiplier effect that foreign manufacturing activity has on service employment. To test our hypotheses, the methodology adopts an instrumental variable approach. Our findings suggest that foreign MNEs in manufacturing can act as a catalyst for regional structural change by stimulating employment in intermediate services via demand linkages. While the composition of this effect seems to be homogeneous in terms of the knowledge content of services, differences are found once the degree of their spatial concentration is accounted for.","[Ascani, Andrea; Iammarino, Simona] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Ascani, Andrea] Univ Utrecht, Dept Human Geog & Spatial Planning, Utrecht, Netherlands",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Utrecht University,"Iammarino, S (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",s.iammarino@lse.ac.uk,"Ascani, Andrea/T-7092-2019","Ascani, Andrea/0000-0003-4738-3144; Iammarino, Simona/0000-0001-9450-1700",Economic and Social Research Council/Joint Programming Initiative Urban Europe [ES/M008436/1]; ESRC [ES/M008436/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council/Joint Programming Initiative Urban Europe; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Department of Human Geography and Spatial Planning, Utrecht University (AA); and Department of Geography and Environment, London School of Economics (AA, SI).

This paper provides a new explanation for this variation in impacts by focusing on behavioral aspects such as the role of the supply elasticity of labor and the elasticity of exports. The novelty of this explanation is that to reduce wage inequality, behavior of workers or exporters can be influenced with less complicated policy measures compared to changing the immigration policy or the policy of fragmentation or changing the capital intensities of the industries suggested in the literature. It shows that trade liberalization in the form of a favorable change in the price of an exported intermediate good can have different effects on wage gaps, skill formation and unemployment for different developing economies depending on behavioral choices.","[Basu, Bharati] Cent Michigan Univ, Dept Econ, 313 Sloan, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA",Central Michigan University,"Basu, B (通讯作者)，Cent Michigan Univ, Dept Econ, 313 Sloan, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA.",basu1b@cmich.edu,"Basu, Bharati/HWQ-5295-2023",,,,,,37,3,3,2,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Results show that while overall employment in polluting industries declines, this decline is driven entirely by incumbent firms and that new firm activity increased following the NBP.

Can frictions generated by this type of financial complexity be so severe that they lead to a complete market freeze, like that of the recent financial crisis? Starting from an allocation that is not Pareto optimal, we find that whether complexity impedes trade depends on how investors perceive risk and uncertainty. For smooth convex preferences, such as subjective expected utility, complexity cannot halt trade, even in the extreme case where each investor is so unsophisticated that he can only trade up to one Arrow-Debreu security, without being able to combine two or more in order to construct a complex trade. However, for non smooth preferences, which allow for kinked indifference curves, such as maxmin expected utility, complexity can completely shut down trade. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

While there may be several explanations for this puzzle, we consider corporate PAC contributions as an insurance-like instrument that induces firms' expectations of safeguard at times of grave need, with the 2008 credit crunch as a case in point. Given the unlikely occurrence of a credit crunch, few financial firms invest in PAC contributions. However, we find firms that make PAC contributions may gain ex ante benefits of corporate PACs as protection from financial distress by undertaking profitable but risky projects that later become illiquid assets while requiring the bailout money during the 2008 credit crunch. We also find that both consistent PAC investments over election cycles and subsequent lobbying activity to corporate PACs further allow firms to utilize their political ties as safeguard and demand additional bailout money. Our instrumental variable analysis confirms that firms with prior experience in political investments are found to enhance the likelihood and effectiveness of PAC contributions and related political investments.","[Lee, Seung-Hyun] Univ Texas Dallas, Jindal Sch Management, POB 830688,SM 43, Richardson, TX 75083 USA; [Ozer, Mine] SUNY Coll Oneonta, Sch Business & Econ, Netzer 322A, Oneonta, NY 13820 USA; [Baik, Yoon-Suk] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, KAIST Coll Business, 82 Heogi Ro, Seoul 02455, South Korea",University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas; State University of New York (SUNY) System; Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST),"Baik, YS (通讯作者)，Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, KAIST Coll Business, 82 Heogi Ro, Seoul 02455, South Korea.",ysbaik@business.kaist.ac.kr,"Baik, Yoon-Suk/C-1645-2011; Lee, Seung-Hyun/A-6106-2013","Baik, Yoonsuk/0000-0003-2212-6993",,,,,31,3,3,0,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,1435-8131,,ECON GOV,Econ.

Committee members disagree about the appropriate value of the pure rate of time preference, but must nevertheless reach a decision. If each committee aggregates its members' preferences in a utilitarian manner, the collective preferences of successive committees will be time inconsistent, and they will implement inefficient consumption plans. If however committees decide on the level of consumption by a majoritarian vote in each period, they may improve on the consumption plans implemented by utilitarian committees.

We develope a model that analizes the relationship between decentralization and corruption and show how cost-benefit calculations can lead public administrations to tolerate a certain degree of corruption. In the model economy, the centralized provision of public goods might be more efficient than their decentralized provision, but under very restrictive conditions. Decentralization, on the other hand, is more efficient where there exists heterogeneity across jurisdictions. In this scenario, the descentralized provision of public goods would be more efficient because regional governments would dedicate optimal amounts of funding to fighting corruption, while their centralized provision might lead to the over or under-allocation of resources.","[Rossello Villalonga, Joan] Univ Balear Isl, Dept Appl Econ, Palma De Mallorca, Spain",Universitat de les Illes Balears,"Villalonga, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Balear Isl, Dept Appl Econ, Palma De Mallorca, Spain.",joan.rossello@uib.es,,"Joan, Rossello/0000-0002-1933-6191",,,,,27,4,4,0,3,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,1869-4195,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

The model is empirically tested for 32 developed and emerging economies between 2004 and 2014. Using panel fixed effects, difference generalized method of moments (GMM) and instrumental variable estimation methods, and two measures of the control of corruption (Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index and the World Bank's Control of Corruption Index), the results show that higher levels of control of corruption decrease luxury spending. This relationship is stronger in countries with higher levels of press freedom and information transparency. These findings offer some important implications. Governments and policymakers may develop and implement regulations that increase transparency in luxury gifting and limit corruption practices. Luxury brand companies should further enhance their due diligence obligations to minimise reputational risks in the long term.","[Tajaddini, Reza; Gholipour, Hassan F.] Swinburne Univ Technol, Swinburne Business Sch, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Swinburne University of Technology,"Gholipour, HF (通讯作者)，Swinburne Univ Technol, Swinburne Business Sch, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",rtajaddini@swin.edu.au; hgholipour@swin.edu.au,"Gholipour, Hassan F./K-5965-2019","Gholipour, Hassan F./0000-0003-4714-8144",,,,,95,10,11,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,NOV,2018,71.0,4,,,,,613,641,,10.1111/kykl.12188,0.0,,,29,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GW5QR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000446991700005,0

Evidence from an Experiment on Bundling Microcredit and Insurance,ECONOMICA,,,English,Article,,,,,,,HEALTH-INSURANCE; IMPACTS,"Randomized controlled trials have found only modest effects of microfinance, but these studies focus on new clients. Existing estimates may thus understate ongoing gains for more experienced borrowers and the longer-run potential of microfinance. We estimate impacts of microfinance on experienced borrowers, using an episode when a microfinance institution modestly increased existing clients' fees in randomly selected villages (in exchange for a mandatory health insurance policy that turned out to be useless). This increase in fees led to a 22 percentage point decline in loan renewal in treatment villages (95% confidence interval: 16 to 27), compared to control villages where the policy was not introduced. Using this randomly generated variation in microfinance participation among experienced borrowers, we find impacts of microfinance that are strikingly similar to previous estimates for new clients: neither business outcomes nor household consumption were affected, on average. Also, consistent with prior studies, we find significant impacts on business outcomes among clients who had started their businesses before microfinance entered the village (0.06 standard deviation decline in an index of business outcomes from the loss of microfinance, 95% confidence interval: -0.002 to -0.12). However, despite these measured losses, these clients were just as willing to give up microfinance.","[Banerjee, Abhijit; Duflo, Esther] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Hornbeck, Richard] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Chicago,"Banerjee, A (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,,,National Institutes of Health [PO1 HD061315-04]; MIT [0609001924]; Harvard University [F18180-104],National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); MIT; Harvard University,"This project received funding from the National Institutes of Health (grant PO1 HD061315-04), and received IRB approval from MIT (#0609001924) and Harvard University (#F18180-104).

Simultaneously, there are a number of tools in psychology and behavioral economics, i.e. framing stimuli, which can increase the efficiency of knowledge transfer processes and level of solving new problems in a simple manner. During a basic statistics test on a group of 284 economics students, it was shown that the method of informing students that a specific problem was very simple, increased their efficiency to solve problems, compared to those who were informed that the problem was very difficult. Using 4 x 2 ANCOVA, with the level of prior knowledge in statistics as the covariant and including gender analysis into the homogeneity-of-slopes model, it was also revealed that the impact of individual framing stimuli is universal and does not depend on the level of prior knowledge of statistics.","[Bizon, Wojciech] Gdansk Univ, Fac Econ, Gdansk, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; University of Gdansk,"Bizon, W (通讯作者)，Gdansk Univ, Fac Econ, Gdansk, Poland.",w.bizon@ug.edu.pl,"Bizon, Wojciech/B-3663-2019","Bizon, Wojciech/0000-0002-1470-3917",,,,,71,1,1,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",2214-8043,2214-8051,,J BEHAV EXP ECON,J.

Following the model specification for altruism and spitefulness in experiments proposed by Levine (1998), we also explore the stability of reciprocity and reciprocal preferences. In particular, we study how individuals equipped with intrinsic preferences such as altruism, selfishness or spitefulness adjust their behavior depending on who they interact with. The key aspect of our method is that behavioral preferences are choice variables that optimally evolve, accounting for strategic interaction. Our model predicts that in a specific economic framework characterized by negative externalities and strategic substitutes, there is a continuum of evolutionary stable interdependent preference profiles: At least one player behaves spitefully, and at most one acts selfishly. The emergence of altruism as an evolutionarily stable preference crucially depends on how large the support for preferences is. When players have reciprocal preferences, altruism might arise even in meetings where one player is intrinsically spiteful, but not necessarily from the intrinsically altruistic player.","[Carrasco, Jose A.] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Fac Ingn & Ciencias, 2640 Diagonal Las Torres, Santiago, Chile; [Harrison, Rodrigo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Econ, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile; [Villena, Mauricio] Minist Hacienda, Direcc Presupuestos, Santiago, Chile; [Villena, Mauricio] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Escuela Negocios, 2700 Diagonal Las Torres, Santiago, Chile",Universidad Adolfo Ibanez; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Universidad Adolfo Ibanez,"Villena, M (通讯作者)，Minist Hacienda, Direcc Presupuestos, Santiago, Chile.;Villena, M (通讯作者)，Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Escuela Negocios, 2700 Diagonal Las Torres, Santiago, Chile.",jose.carrasco@uai.cl; harrison@uc.cl; mauricio.villena@uai.cl,"Villena, Mauricio G/I-7351-2019","Villena, Mauricio G/0000-0001-6573-9736",,,,,36,2,3,0,15,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",2214-8043,2214-8051,,J BEHAV EXP ECON,J.

Using a control function approach in a quantile regression framework, we attempt to establish the causal impact of social capital on firm performance.

During a period of international deleveraging, world consumption demand is depressed and the world interest rate is low, reflecting a high propensity to save. If exchange rates are allowed to float, deleveraging countries can rely on depreciations to increase production and mitigate the fall in consumption associated with debt reduction. The key insight of the paper is that in a monetary union this channel of adjustment is shut off, because deleveraging countries cannot depreciate against the other countries in the monetary union, and therefore the fall in the demand for consumption and the downward pressure on the interest rate are amplified. As a result, deleveraging in a monetary union can generate a liquidity trap and an aggregate recession. For instance, the model predicts that international deleveraging by peripheral euro area countries can account for around 24% of the output loss experienced by the euro area in the two years following the 2008 financial crisis.

We find the following. An increase in the nominal interest rate leads to a decrease in human capital investment, which in turn reduces long-run growth and welfare. Calibration shows that long-run growth increases 0.61% by reducing the nominal interest rate from 9.9% (the sample mean of the U.S.) to 0%. The corresponding welfare gain is equivalent to a permanent increase in consumption of 15.98%. The growth and welfare effects depend on the strength of the CIA constraint on human capital investment.

Moreover, we show that under an additional assumption of stationarity, this combination of strategies is essentially the unique mechanism to support full cooperation, and it is robust to various perturbations.

By employing different matching methods, we found that receiving a student loan did not improve student academic performance, but slightly increased students' likelihood of doing a part-time job. Likewise, receiving a need based grant had no significant effect on student academic performance.

We explore this question in rural Pakistan, showing that greater political competition in a Provincial Assembly (PA) constituency predicts significantly better access to publicly-provided infrastructure and amenities, but no changes in other public goods including perceived access to justice and security. Nonetheless, overall welfare effects appear to be positive: higher political competition predicts higher expenditures per capita, especially among land-poor households. It also predicts higher land values, greater land wealth, and lower land wealth inequality. Further, political competition increases land rental, possibly indicating improved functionality of land markets. Sensitivity analyses suggest that our estimates are unlikely to be substantially affected by omitted variable bias, and they are further similar to instrumental variables estimates. The findings are also robust to use of alternate measures of political competition.

Job match and job turnover,CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Guanxi; Job match; Job turnover; China,OLD BOY NETWORKS; SOCIAL NETWORKS; STRONG TIES; LABOR-MARKET; MOBILITY; INFORMATION; STRENGTH; RESOURCES; REFERRALS; QUALITY,"Using a social network is an effective way to carry out a job search. This study examines whether Chinese social network, guanxi, leads to better job-worker match and less job turnover. Using a two-dimensional measurement of guanxi, the results of logistic regressions indicate that guanxi is actively used by job seekers who do not match to the employers' requirements. This finding implies that guanxi may be unfairly used during job searches. Meanwhile, survival analysis shows that guanxi does not lead to less job turnover. The implication of this study is that guanxi should be used for informational purposes, which would enable job seekers and potential employers to avoid information asymmetry in the job search process.","[Weng, Yulei] Northwest Univ, Sch Econ & Management, 1 XueFu DaDao, Xian 710127, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Xu, Hao] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Wenlan Sch Business, 182 Nanhu Dadao, Wuhan 430073, Hubei, Peoples R China",Northwest University Xi'an; Zhongnan University of Economics & Law,"Xu, H (通讯作者)，Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Wenlan Sch Business, 182 Nanhu Dadao, Wuhan 430073, Hubei, Peoples R China.",weng_yulei@nwu.edu.cn; xuhao.econ@outlook.com,,"Xu, Hao/0000-0002-4018-1112; Weng, Yulei/0000-0002-2138-773X",Northwest University Research Funding [338050086]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J500215/1],Northwest University Research Funding; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work was supported by the Northwest University Research Funding (338050086); Economic and Social Research Council (ES/J500215/1).,,41,13,13,2,37,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

To empirically examine how interpersonal comparisons affect productivity, this study utilizes a lab-in-the-field experiment that was conducted in Bolivia among 285 dairy farmers. The experiment consists of a baseline effort-elicitation and three treatments. The first treatment reveals to participants their baseline rankings; the second treatment allows participants to pay to destroy the output of others in their group; and the third treatment introduces inequity by placing a randomly-chosen group member into a more favorable production setting. This paper reports three main findings. First, in the absence of destructive actions, low-productivity participants increase their productivity whereas high-productivity participants decrease their productivity. Second, more than half of the participants are willing to give up their earnings to destroy the output of their peers. Finally, those who were placed into a more favorable production setting have a 29% higher probability of being destroyed by somebody in their group, showing evidence of destructive actions being motivated by a sense of fairness.","[Zeballos, Eliana] USDA, ERS, 355 E St SW, Washington, DC 20024 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Zeballos, E (通讯作者)，USDA, ERS, 355 E St SW, Washington, DC 20024 USA.",eliana.zeballos@gmail.com,"Zeballos, Eliana/IAP-5174-2023","Zeballos, Eliana/0000-0002-5229-7948","Hemispheric Institute of the Americas Field Research Grant; Henry A.

We examine the differential impact of the global financial crisis on interest rate spreads by dividing the sample period into two, i.e. the period prior to and after the crisis. Having identified and estimated the impact of a number of drivers on interest rate spreads, the findings document that after the 2008 financial crisis, the sensitivity of spreads to its determinants turn out to be statistically significant and incorporate credit risk to a greater extent. The findings survive a number of robustness checks.

The largest industry, which accounts for more than 25% of the trade, is found to benefit from ringgit depreciation while not being hurt by appreciation.

The management aims at winning the highest valued licenses whereas the board wants to maximize profit and limits exposure. If efficiency requires multiple firms to coordinate on winning smaller sets of objects, we demonstrate that principals would do so while agents would not and inflate demand to larger sets. We first show that even if the principal has complete information about the valuations she cannot generally incentive-align the agent with only budgets constraints in first-price sealed-bid package auctions. With hidden information the principal needs to determine contingent transfers, which can be impossible with strong value-maximizing motives of the agent. Contrary, in ascending package auctions this is straightforward. The second-price payment rule of the ascending auction enables the principal to overcome the agency problem and the dynamic mechanism further facilitates coordination. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

These initiatives are meant to reduce trade deficits and increase employment and incomes in the US manufacturing sector. Economic analysis tells us that the result will be larger trade deficits, and weaker total tradeables, including manufacturing employment. There may or may not be a net gain for employment and incomes in those industries which have been the greatest beneficiaries of protection. Trump's protection policies will damage incomes in the United States and the rest of the world; the damage will be greater if other countries retaliate or emulate. Alternative policies that compensate losers from free trade would give better results.","[Corden, Max; Garnaut, Ross] Univ Melbourne, Fac Business & Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Garnaut, R (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Fac Business & Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",ross.garnaut@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,1,5,6,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-9018,1467-8462,,AUST ECON REV,Aust.

The main objective of our paper is to test if the dominant world religions (Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Islamic, and Judaic), and, moreover, some Christian denominations (Catholicism, Protestantism and Eastern Orthodox Christianity) are related to some patterns in capital structure. Our paper considers distinctly the category of countries in which Agnostics, Atheists and non-religious people are predominant. The results are promising. Companies located in the states with predominance of Islamic religion have a lower leverage, while the ones from predominantly Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Hindu and Judaic countries, as well as those in mainly Agnostic, Atheist and non-religious ones, are indebted more than those from mainly Protestant countries. The debt maturity seems to be correlated to the dominant religions or denominations, with companies in the predominantly Eastern Orthodox, Buddhist and Agnostic, Atheist and non-religious countries relying more on short term debt, and those in the majority Catholic, Judaic and Hindu countries on long term debt.","[Dragota, Ingrid-Mihaela; Dragota, Victor; Curmei-Semenescu, Andreea] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Finance, Bucharest, Romania; [Dragota, Victor; Curmei-Semenescu, Andreea] Ctr Financial & Monetary Res CEFIMO, Bucharest, Romania; [Pele, Daniel Traian] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Stat & Econometr, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Dragota, IM (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Finance, Bucharest, Romania.",mihaela.dragota@fin.ase.ro; victor.dragota@fin.ase.ro; andreea.semenescu@fin.ase.ro; danpele@ase.ro,"Dragota, Ingrid-Mihaela/C-6609-2011; Pele, Daniel Traian/G-2059-2011; Curmei-Semenescu, Andreea/AAI-9627-2021; Dragota, Victor/B-9076-2011","Dragota, Ingrid-Mihaela/0000-0002-4864-7503; Pele, Daniel Traian/0000-0002-5891-5495; Dragota, Victor/0000-0001-7284-5297; Curmei-Semenescu, Andreea/0000-0001-9367-3965","Executive Agency for Higher Education, Research, Development and Innovation Funding (UEFISCDI) [86/2007]; Center of Financial and Monetary Research (CEFIMO)","Executive Agency for Higher Education, Research, Development and Innovation Funding (UEFISCDI); Center of Financial and Monetary Research (CEFIMO)","This work was partially supported by the Executive Agency for Higher Education, Research, Development and Innovation Funding (UEFISCDI), project number AT code 86/2007, and co-financed by the Center of Financial and Monetary Research (CEFIMO).

The government randomly assigned three forms of delivering program benefits across targeted municipalities: demand (vouchers), supply (clinic and school subsidies), and a combination of both. This program provides an opportunity to explore if and how differential exposure to incentives produces longer term effects. Using municipal-level panel data, these effects are estimated using difference-in-differences. We find that the form of delivering cash transfers influences the degree to which these programs make progress towards their objective of reducing future poverty. Compared to municipalities receiving support from the Honduran Poverty Reduction Strategy, our study indicates that exposure to demand-side incentives individually has no lasting impact. However, joint exposure to both demand and supply-side incentives does lead to measurable improvements in schooling and labor market participation.","[Ham, Andres] Univ los Andes, Sch Govt, Cra 1 19-27 Bloque Aulas AU,Piso 3, Bogota 111711, Colombia; [Michelson, Hope C.] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, 314 Mumford Hall, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",Universidad de los Andes (Colombia); University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Ham, A (通讯作者)，Univ los Andes, Sch Govt, Cra 1 19-27 Bloque Aulas AU,Piso 3, Bogota 111711, Colombia.",a.ham@uniandes.edu.co; hopecm@illinois.edu,,,,,,,55,8,10,2,18,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

When setting non-binding goals for a multi-stage project, an agent must decide how to group, or bracket, such goals for evaluation. He can bracket broadly by setting an aggregate goal for the entire project, or narrowly by setting incremental goals for individual stages. A loss averse agent brackets optimally by trading off motivation and risk pooling, which interacts non-trivially with time discounting. An aggregate goal becomes more attractive as early-stage uncertainty increases, while incremental goals become more attractive when later-stage uncertainty increases. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This paper investigates sovereign debt sustainability in a model where domestic and foreign investors optimally select their portfolios and the sovereign decides over its default and bailout policies. It shows that internal bailouts do not preclude sovereign borrowing when domestic private exposures to sovereign debt, direct or indirect, cannot be observed or inferred by the sovereign. In equilibrium, when these exposures are correlated with future liquidity needs, bailouts are less efficient to compensate domestic losses making repayment more desirable. Opacity on financial exposures is then a commitment device for sovereigns to honor their debts and thus may be welfare improving. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Countries differ in their institutional aspects and need to be considered at the forefront of expatriation decisions, particularly in emerging markets. However, the relationship between institutional aspects and expatriate assignments is a relatively unexplored topic in the literature on international business. In response, we investigated the impact of formal and informal institutional aspects on expatriate assignments of foreign subsidiaries in emerging markets. To test our hypotheses, we formed a sample of 147 Japanese subsidiaries operating in Latin America, which we analyzed longitudinally from 2007 to 2012 for a total of 882 observations. Regression analyses of panel data showed that when the formal institutional environment is strong, there is an increase of assignment of expatriates to assist the management and control of the subsidiary. While when the informal institution aspects are high, it tends to decrease the expatriation assignment. Moreover, the effect is contingent upon the firm size and the general management of the subsidiary. In sum, different institutional conditions need to be considered in international assignments.

The model captures the dynamic interaction of the key sectors in the economy and it accounts for the fact that the banking system in those countries is characterized by high levels of excess reserves. Also, the study assumes that the central bank conducts monetary policy using a Taylor-type rule, and it evaluates the effects of a reserve requirement policy. The results show that although a positive shock to the policy interest rate has a direct effect on commercial banks' interest rates, there is a weak transmission to the real variables. Furthermore, an increase in the required reserve ratio is successful in reducing private sector credit and excess reserves, while at the same time alleviating pressures on the exchange rate. The findings therefore indicate that central banks in small open economies should consider using reserve requirements as a complement to interest rate policy, to achieve their macroeconomic objectives.

Descriptive evidence suggests that teen birth-induced reductions in educational attainment and the time-intensive nature of childcare are important mechanisms.

Within a setting characterized by an endogenous audit process and taxpayer uncertainty, this study uses theory and laboratory experiments to investigate the effects of taxpayer assistance services that better inform taxpayers about their tax liability and the audit process. The endogenous audit rule we study is simple, yet relative to existing work is more likely to characterize the actual incentives facing taxpayers. Among our findings, and in contrast to the case of purely random audits, in theory the effect of providing more accurate information on tax liability is ambiguous, and we find support empirically for increased tax underreporting even in a setting where theory predicts the opposite.

In this paper we characterize surplus-maximizing (efficient) and revenue-maximizing (optimal) mechanisms in a spectrum sharing context where a principal allocates transmitted power among a group of potentially interested users (transmitter-receiver pairs). Under regularity conditions about value distributions and non-interference constraints, we show that efficiency (optimality) typically involves spectrum sharing by multiple users, and the exact allocation of transmitted power is determined such that the ratio of marginal value (virtual value) over marginal cost (in terms of the cost to the interference generated) is equal among all shared users. We show that efficient and optimal mechanisms in our setting are actually dominant-strategy incentive compatible, and that they can also be implemented by well-designed all-pay or discriminatory-price auctions.

The sample is of particular interest as it contains periods with average inflation rates that are close to zero as well as two sharp deflations. Results from a variety of different tests indicate that wage change distributions are consistent with the presence of downward nominal wage rigidity.

This suggests that downwards adjustments did occur during times of severe depression and deflation. ResumeRigidite des salaires nominaux a la baisse: resultats pour le Canada 1901-1950.

In the last six decades, and unlike China and East Asian countries, African countries failed to successfully transform their economies and thus upgrade their industrial capabilities to move up the ladder of value addition. There is, however, renewed efforts by African countries to industrialise as one of the ways to structurally transform their economies. African countries should 'leverage their backwardness' to attract industries and technologies that are consistent with their comparative advantages (Lin, 2018). Indeed, there appears to be growing interest in Africa from the Chinese labour-intensive manufacturing, who see Africa as a low cost production region, especially given the rising labour costs in China. With clear strategic policy direction, African countries can take advantage of the imminent relocation of a substantial share of China's 85 million manufacturing jobs. This is not a foregone conclusion, since other regions are also trying to exploit this opportunity, and hence requiring African countries to solidify their competitive advantage for the imminent relocation. The studies, in this issue, while cautiously optimistic about the potential positive contribution of China for Africa's structural transformation, underscore that such success is conditional on African capability and informed strategic policy making and implementation in a pragmatic manner.","[Geda, Alemayehu] African Econ Res Consortium, Nairobi, Kenya; [Senbet, Lemma W.; Simbanegavi, Witness] Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Econ, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",African Economic Research Consortium (AERC); Addis Ababa University,"Simbanegavi, W (通讯作者)，African Econ Res Consortium, Nairobi, Kenya.",Witness.Simbanegavi@aercafrica.org,,"Simbanegavi, Witness/0000-0003-3109-9528",,,,,33,5,6,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

Instead, a genuine monetary constitution must also be a financial constitution: it must take into account the natural and evolved links between money and banking, treating them as a single institution. We present a unified conception of money and banking, show how modern monetary institutions have severed the traditional links between money and banking, and discuss how macroeconomic stability is an unintended result of a self-enforcing constitution for the money-and-banking system. Finally, we conclude by discussing the implications of our argument for re-orienting the conversation on post-financial crisis stability towards genuinely institutional solutions.

This paper uses national parcel-level land transaction data to examine the causes and consequences of LGFVs' land purchasing behavior in China. We found that LGFVs overbid significantly in terms of land prices. We explore channels through which LGFVs bid high prices for land. The stimulus plan induced local government to increase debt and rely more on land-based mortgages and land leasing revenue. Fiscal pressure led to an increase in LGFVs bidding for land. We found that the stimulus plan changed local governments' control over land leasing and land finance. Local governments hold more of the land market and inflate land prices following implementation of the stimulus plan.,"[Huang, Zhonghua] Zhejiang Univ Technol, Coll Econ & Management, Hangzhou 310023, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Du, Xuejun] Zhejiang Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Hangzhou 310023, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University of Technology; Zhejiang University of Science & Technology,"Du, XJ (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Hangzhou 310023, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",zhonghuahuang2006@aliyun.com; duxuejun@aliyun.com,"Huang, Zhonghua/HHC-0946-2022","Huang, Zhonghua/0000-0002-2798-2361","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71774143, 71373243]; National Social Science Foundation of China [17BGL130]; Key Project of Philosophy and Social Science of Zhejiang Province [18NDJC030Z]; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation [LY17G030016]; Project of Philosophy and Social Science of Zhejiang Province [15NDJC185YB]; Advance Project of Humanities and Social Sciences of Zhejiang University of Technology; Research Center of Technology Innovation and Enterprises Internationalization, Key Research Base of Philosophy and Social Science of Zhejiang Province","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Key Project of Philosophy and Social Science of Zhejiang Province; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); Project of Philosophy and Social Science of Zhejiang Province; Advance Project of Humanities and Social Sciences of Zhejiang University of Technology; Research Center of Technology Innovation and Enterprises Internationalization, Key Research Base of Philosophy and Social Science of Zhejiang Province","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71774143; No. 71373243), National Social Science Foundation of China (No. 17BGL130), Key Project of Philosophy and Social Science of Zhejiang Province (No. 18NDJC030Z), Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation (No. LY17G030016), Project of Philosophy and Social Science of Zhejiang Province (No. 15NDJC185YB), the Advance Project of Humanities and Social Sciences of Zhejiang University of Technology and the Research Center of Technology Innovation and Enterprises Internationalization, Key Research Base of Philosophy and Social Science of Zhejiang Province.",,40,57,61,13,96,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

Fragmentation is potentially inefficient since separate insurers optimize over only one component of healthcare spending, despite complementarities and substitutabilities between healthcare types. Fragmentation of only some plans can also lead to market distortions due to differential adverse selection, as integrated plans may use drug formularies to induce enrollment by patients that are profitable in the medical insurance market. We study the design of insurance plans in Medicare Part D and find that formularies reflect these two differences in incentives.

Hoernig (2012) extends their analysis to environments with network effects and finds that, when network effects are strong enough, the result is reversed and that optimal delegation contracts incentivize managers to behave more aggressively. This paper revisits Hoernig (2012) by assuming that consumers form expectations about network sizes before owners choose delegation contracts, in contrast with Hoernig's (2012) assumption that expectations are formed after the contracts are chosen. That is, the current study employs fulfilled (or passive) expectations, while Hoernig (2012) uses rational (or responsive) expectations. We show that under the fulfilled expectations, Fershtman and Judd's (1987) results hold, regardless of the strength of the network effect. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

With a two-state volatility model, the study finds the co-dependence, co-movement and synchronization of volatility regime at the high volatility state are stronger between the US and European securitized real estate markets. Although correlations among the markets are higher in a high volatility regime than in a low volatility regime, there is limited evidence of contagious effects during the high volatility periods between some markets. Moreover, the unsecuritized real estate markets are different from their securitized equivalent in the volatility regime characteristics, correlation pattern and level, as well as the extent of correlation change and contagion effect in high volatility state. Thus, the regime-switching results from stock markets may not be automatically extended to the corresponding public real estate markets, and requires rigorous empirical scrutiny.","[Liow, Kim Hiang; Ye, Qing] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Real Estate, 4 Architecture Dr, Singapore 117566, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Liow, KH (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Real Estate, 4 Architecture Dr, Singapore 117566, Singapore.",rstlkh@nus.edu.sg; yeqing@gmail.com,"Liow, KimHiang/K-7295-2013",,"Ministry of Education, Singapore [R-297-000-119-112]","Ministry of Education, Singapore(Ministry of Education, Singapore)","The first author wishes to acknowledge the funding support given by the Ministry of Education, Singapore, in respect of the research project R-297-000-119-112 to which this paper is related to.

In this endeavour, we employ the novel SOR (Shahbaz et al. 2017) unit root test on French time series data over the period 1955-2016 to examine the order of integration in the presence of sharp and smooth structural breaks in the variables. We also apply the bootstrapping bounds testing approach, recently developed by McNown et al. (2018), to investigate the presence of cointegration and the empirical findings underscore the presence of cointegration among the time series. Moreover, we find that FDI has a positive impact, while energy research innovations have a negative impact, on French carbon emissions. Financial development lowers carbon emissions, thereby improving the French environmental quality. FDI degrades the environment, and thus supports the pollution-haven hypothesis in France. Similarly, financial development suggests that financial stability is a required condition for improving environmental quality, so are energy research innovations. Contrarily, energy consumption is positively linked with carbon emissions. However, the relationship between economic growth and CO2 emissions is an inverted-U, which is a validation of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Since then, most new biogas production plants have chosen to upgrade their biogas. In this study, a mixed integer programming model is used to find the optimal biogas value chain, and cooperative game theory is used to understand real world observations compared to this study's results. Specifically, three profit allocation mechanisms are applied to allocate the profit between the heterogeneous owners in the value chain. It is found that Danish biogas plants should use large shares of manure combined with deep litter. Furthermore, it is found that input suppliers have relatively poor bargaining power in the profit allocation negotiations due to poor alternatives. This may explain why livestock farmers tend to receive little payment for their manure, and why they are hesitant to join biogas projects. Finally, it is found that biogas plants prefer to upgrade their biogas for several reasons. First, if the natural gas price is expected to be high, it is preferable to upgrade biogas than to use it directly in a local combined heat and power plant (CHP). Second, if the natural gas price is expected to be low, it is preferable to upgrade because the CHPs have better alternatives and therefore better bargaining power before investments (ex ante). Third, when the value chain contains an upgrading plant, the biogas plant has a greater bargaining power in particular ex post. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Given the current tax structure and the system of tax expenditures, income shifting and tax avoidance behaviour are an important determinant of the personal income tax base. The estimated regression models also show, that labour market developments have contributed to decrease inequality in the 2000-2012 sample period.

The frequency of trading contributes to these attributes. The Taiwan Stock Exchange uses a periodic call auction as its main trading mechanism. From 2010 to 2014 the call auction interval was reduced four times, from 25 to 5 s, providing a natural experiment to test the impact on market quality. Using multiple measures of efficiency, liquidity, and stability we provide evidence that the reductions in call auction interval have improved overall market quality. We find that higher auction frequencies are associated with a lower trade-to-auction ratio and less aggressive trading behaviour. The evidence suggests that there are more gains to be made through further reduction in the call auction interval to around 2 s. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.

In order to resolve overdemands for a given school, most often priority is given to families living in the neighborhood of the school. Using a very rich data set on school applications for the case of the Boston mechanism in Barcelona, we exploit an unexpected change in the definition of neighborhood. This change allows us to identify that a large fraction of families systematically ranks first high priority schools, neighborhood schools in this case. Additional data on school enrollment decisions and census data shows that some seemingly unsophisticated parents are high income families that can rank hard-to-get schools because they can afford the outside option of a private school in case they do not get in. This sheds light on important inequalities beyond parents' lack of sophistication found in the literature. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Using geographically disaggregated data at the level of grid cells the analysis provides empirical evidence for a hump-shaped relationship between the long run stability and force malaria transmission and the incidence of civil violence. In line with epidemiological predictions about the acquired immunity to malaria, cells that are characterized by intermediate malaria exposure exhibit higher conflict incidence than cells with very low or very high malaria exposure. We explore the role of the expansion of anti-malaria policies after 2005 in the context of the Roll Back Malaria programme. The results provide suggestive evidence that anti-malaria interventions reduced the incidence of civil violence, but only in areas where adults lack acquired immunity to malaria.","[Cervellati, Matteo] Univ Bologna, Bologna, Italy; CEPR London, London, England; CESIfo, Munich, Germany; HEC, Lausanne, Switzerland; Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Munich, Germany; Ifo, Munich, Germany",University of Bologna; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Ifo Institut; University of Munich,"Cervellati, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Bologna, Italy.",m.cervellati@unibo.it; Elena.Esposito@unil.ch; uwe.sunde@lmu.de; simona.valmori@unibo.it,"Esposito, Elena/IXD-3753-2023","esposito, elena/0000-0001-5331-4992; Sunde, Uwe/0000-0002-2110-7822",European Union through the Career Integration Grant [618641]; MIUR project [PRIN2015-2015T9FYZZ],"European Union through the Career Integration Grant; MIUR project(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","Prepared for Economic Policy Special Issue 'What economics can do for peace'.

However, theoretical works have not provided a unique explanation to the issue. In this paper, therefore, we propose a framework that is able to describe the long-run effects of different kinds of debt. We introduce a stock-flow consistent dynamic model where the economy is represented as a network of trading relationships among agents. Debt contracts are one of such relationships. The model is characterized by a unique and stable steady-state and predicts that: (i) aggregate income is always limited from the above by the money supply; (ii) debts cause in the long-run a redistribution of borrowers' wealth and income in favor of lenders; (iii) the redistribution is magnified by the level of the interest rate and (iv) by the degree of debt persistence. In the aggregate this may also lower the average marginal propensity to spend and nominal income, providing therefore a clear-cut explanation to the empirical evidence.","[Chen, Siyan; Desiderio, Saul] Shantou Univ, Sch Business, 243 Daxue Rd, Shantou 515063, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Shantou University,"Desiderio, S (通讯作者)，Shantou Univ, Sch Business, 243 Daxue Rd, Shantou 515063, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",saul@stu.edu.cn,,,"STU Scientific Research Foundation for Talents [NTF12013, NTF12014]; Foundation for Young Talents in Higher Education of Guangdong, China [2014WQNCX055]","STU Scientific Research Foundation for Talents; Foundation for Young Talents in Higher Education of Guangdong, China","This work is financially supported by the STU Scientific Research Foundation for Talents under Grant No. NTF12013 and No. NTF12014, and by the Foundation for Young Talents in Higher Education of Guangdong, China, under Grant No. 2014WQNCX055.

In late 2005, the Chinese central government made cutting sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions the main performance evaluation criterion for prefectural city mayors and Party secretaries. Using a difference-in-differences framework, we find that the performance evaluation system caused a significant decrease in SO2 emissions, as well as in the GDP growth rate. Our mechanism analyses further corroborate that local bureaucrats in Two Control Zone cities were willing to trade off GDP growth to achieve the more stringent emissions reductions goal. Our findings contribute to the understanding of multitasking agency problems for government agents.","[Chen, Yvonne Jie] Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, 469C Bukit Timah Rd, Singapore 259772, Singapore; [Li, Pei] Xiamen Univ, Dept Publ Finance, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China; [Li, Pei] Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China; [Lu, Yi] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Lu, Yi] Natl Univ Singapore, Sch Econ, Singapore 117570, Singapore",National University of Singapore; Xiamen University; Xiamen University; Tsinghua University; National University of Singapore,"Li, P (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Dept Publ Finance, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.;Li, P (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.",sppcj@nus.edu.sg; bengcome@gmail.com; luyi@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn,"Lu, Yi/A-4448-2010","Chen, Yvonne/0000-0003-4755-6025; Li, Pei/0000-0001-9547-7589; Lu, Yi/0000-0002-3544-7131","National University of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy (FRC); Xiamen University; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [20720161068]; Tsinghua University; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China","National University of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy (FRC); Xiamen University(Xiamen University); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Tsinghua University; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)","This research is supported by the National University of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy (FRC research grant), Xiamen University and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (20720161068), Tsinghua University and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China.

Many prominent economists participated in the Committee's works, which ended with the publication of the Radcliffe Report in 1959. Making an exception to the rule of not mentioning individual contributions, the Radcliffe Report claims to ` follow Professor Kahn. in insisting upon the structure of interest rates rather than some notion of the  supply of money as the centrepiece of monetary action'. As we reconstruct in the paper, Kahn based his proposals on a conceptual framework, emphasising the link between inflation, wages and aggregate demand and the importance of combining incomes policy and term-structure control in view of achieving external equilibrium, full employment and price stability. One finding of our research is that Kahn's recommendations regarding term-structure control-with their relevance to the present day-are best understood in connection with his theory of liquidity preference as presented in Kahn (1954). We also find that the Radcliffe Committee, while espousing Kahn's policy recommendations, surrounded them with so many caveats as to render them de facto inoperative. As we suggest in our reconstruction, this depends partly on institutional considerations and partly on differences of opinion between Kahn and the Radcliffe Committee regarding monetary policy transmission and the causes of inflation.","[Cristiano, Carlo] Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Giurisprudenza, Via Coll Ricci 10, I-56126 Pisa, Italy; Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dipartimento Econ & Finanza, Rome, Italy",University of Pisa; University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Cristiano, C (通讯作者)，Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Giurisprudenza, Via Coll Ricci 10, I-56126 Pisa, Italy.",carlo.cristiano@unipi.it,"Cristiano, Carlo/JDM-4376-2023","Cristiano, Carlo/0000-0002-8657-6187",ESHET (European Society for the History of Economic Thought) through the 'ECB Grants' programme 2015 - European Central Bank,ESHET (European Society for the History of Economic Thought) through the 'ECB Grants' programme 2015 - European Central Bank,"Dipartimento di Giurisprudenza, Universita di Pisa; and Dipartimento di Economia e Finanza, Universita degli Studi di Roma 'Tor Vergata', respectively.

Evidence in the Northern Ireland context has further suggested that applying these models to property markets may be inappropriate given the underlying statistical properties of these time series (Gallagher et al., 2015). These issues combined suggest that there may be merit in examining cases of financial crises through alternative theoretical frameworks and in adopting a more pluralist approach. With this in mind, this paper investigates whether Minsky's (1975, 1986, 1992) Financial Instability Hypothesis can assist in understanding the recent property market crisis in Northern Ireland, which was severe by both national and international standards. Using qualitative evidence to analyse the behaviours of borrowers represented by property developers and lenders represented by banks over the course of the business cycle, this paper assesses the relevance of Minsky's arguments. The findings show that Minsky's Financial Instability Hypothesis explains the incidents observed in Northern Ireland's property market in recent years.","[Gallagher, Emer Marie] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Liverpool Business Sch, Liverpool L3 5UG, Merseyside, England; [Ramsey, Elaine] Ulster Univ, Business Sch, Coleraine Campus,Cromore Rd, Coleraine BT52 1SA, Londonderry, North Ireland; [Bond, Derek] Hubei Normal Univ, Int Off, Huangshia, Peoples R China",Liverpool John Moores University; University of Liverpool; Ulster University; Hubei Normal University,"Gallagher, EM (通讯作者)，Liverpool John Moores Univ, Liverpool Business Sch, Liverpool L3 5UG, Merseyside, England.",e.m.gallagher@ljmu.ac.uk; e.ramsey@ulster.ac.uk; d.bond.esq@gmail.com,"Bond, Derek/S-3169-2019","RAMSEY, ELAINE/0000-0003-4043-763X",,,,,42,0,0,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The number of deposits grows 3.7-fold and the average balance almost doubles. In contrast, a more classical measure, a substantially increased interest rate, has no effect for most participants and raises the savings balance only for the very top of the distribution.

Accordingly, it is based on the well-known Kaleckian model which is combined with a modeling strategy of a sentiment index that was proposed by Franke (2012, 2014). The sentiment influences firms' subjective sales expectations and thus their planned level of investment. As it turns out, the non-linear model set-up appears to be flexible in the sense that it is able to generate different interesting dynamic scenarios. It is shown that it may produce (a) sentiment-driven business cycle fluctuations, including endogenously determined Minsky-Koo-kind recessions, and, more interestingly, (b) two distinct economic environments that exist contemporaneously: a low-' and high-indebted' regime.","[Lojak, Benjamin] Otto Friedrich Univ Bamberg, Bamberg, Germany",Otto Friedrich University Bamberg,"Lojak, B (通讯作者)，Otto Friedrich Univ Bamberg, Empir Econ, Bamberg, Germany.",benjamin.lojak@uni-bamberg.de,,,,,,,32,6,6,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,JUL,2018,69.0,3,,,,,526,545,,10.1111/meca.12199,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GL0TN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000436803900001,0

We focus on a model where firms first seek financing from banks, then bid for the licenses, and the winning firms set prices in a product market with uncertain demand. In a model of one license, the winning firm becomes a monopoly. A higher bid induces a higher product price. In a model of two licenses, a higher bid provides a positive externality to all other firms. In both models, bids are extremely high in the English auction, and the English auction always generates more revenue than the first-price/discriminatory auction.","[Wang, Tao; Wang, Ruqu] Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Wang, Tao; Wang, Ruqu] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Queens University - Canada; Zhejiang University,"Wang, RQ (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.;Wang, RQ (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",wangt@econ.queensu.ca; wangr@queensu.ca,,,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in China; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in China; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"An earlier version of this paper was circulated under the title Bids in License Auctions - Sunk Costs that Matter.

The results indicate that house price developments are partly driven by sentiments decoupled from underlying economic fundamentals. This seems especially to have been the case during the strong house price booms in the mid-1980 s and the mid-2000 s, where overoptimism might have accounted for 15-20% of the house prices' deviation from a constant growth trend. Furthermore, overoptimistic households were more likely to purchase real estate in the 2000 s compared to other households, and they leveraged more when purchasing real estate. There seems thus to be a separate confidence channel in the determination of house prices in addition to the variables usually found in standard macroeconomic house-price models.","[Abildgren, Kim; Hansen, Niels Lynggard; Kuchler, Andreas] Danmarks Natl Bank, Havnegade 5, DK-1093 Copenhagen K, Denmark",,"Abildgren, K (通讯作者)，Danmarks Natl Bank, Havnegade 5, DK-1093 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",kpa@nationalbanken.dk; nlh@nationalbanken.dk; aku@nationalbanken.dk,"Abildgren, Kim/M-1534-2016","Abildgren, Kim/0000-0003-1548-8347; Kuchler, Andreas/0000-0002-9769-0276",,,,,38,16,17,1,34,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0164-0704,1873-152X,,J MACROECON,J.

In this paper we provide new evidence about the long-run evolution of top wealth shares for the United Kingdom. The new series covers a long period - from 1895 to the present- and has a different point of departure from the previous literature: we start with the analysis of the distribution of estates left at death. We find that the application to the estate data of mortality multipliers to yield estimates of wealth among the living does not substantially change the degree of concentration over much of the period both in the UK and US, allowing inferences to be made for years when this method cannot be applied. The results show that wealth concentration in the UK remained relatively constant during the first wave of globalization, but then decreased dramatically in the period from 1914 to 1979. The UK went from being more unequal in terms of wealth than the US to being less unequal. However, the decline in UK wealth concentration came to an end around 1980, and since then there is evidence of an increase in top shares, notably in the distribution of wealth excluding housing in recent years. We investigate the triangulating evidence provided by data on capital income concentration and on reported super fortunes.","[Alvaredo, Facundo] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Alvaredo, Facundo] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Alvaredo, Facundo; Atkinson, Anthony B.] INET, Oxford, England; [Alvaredo, Facundo; Atkinson, Anthony B.] Oxford Martin Sch, Oxford, England; [Atkinson, Anthony B.] London Sch Econ, Nuffield Coll, London, England; CUNY, Grad Ctr, New York, NY USA; [Morelli, Salvatore] CUNY, Stone Ctr Socioecon Inequal, New York, NY USA",Paris School of Economics; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University of Oxford; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; City University of New York (CUNY) System; City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Alvaredo, F (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France.;Alvaredo, F (通讯作者)，Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.;Alvaredo, F (通讯作者)，INET, Oxford, England.;Alvaredo, F (通讯作者)，Oxford Martin Sch, Oxford, England.",alvaredo@pse.ens.fr,"Morelli, Salvatore/AAA-6202-2021","Morelli, Salvatore/0000-0002-1935-3565",Institute for New Economic Thinking [INO14-00023]; European Research Council [340831]; ESRC/DFID [ES/I033114/1]; University of Venice Ca Foscari Guido Cazzavillan Fellowship; ESRC [ES/I033114/1] Funding Source: UKRI; European Research Council (ERC) [340831] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),Institute for New Economic Thinking; European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); ESRC/DFID(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); University of Venice Ca Foscari Guido Cazzavillan Fellowship; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"We acknowledge financial support, at different stages, from the Institute for New Economic Thinking (F.

We show that adaptive learning imposes a more restrictive constraint on monetary policy robustness to ensure the dynamic stability of the equilibrium than under rational expectations but strengthens the argument in favor of a more aggressive monetary policy when the central bank fears for model misspecifications.","[Andre, Marine Charlotte] Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, BETA UMR 7522, 61 Ave Foret Noire, F-67085 Strasbourg, France; [Dai, Meixing] Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, BETA UMR 7522, F-67000 Strasbourg, France",Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"André, MC (通讯作者)，Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, BETA UMR 7522, 61 Ave Foret Noire, F-67085 Strasbourg, France.",andrem@unistra.fr,,"Andre, Marine Charlotte/0000-0003-4554-7598",,,,,54,3,3,0,2,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

Subjects choose between two alternatives, a sophisticated and stabilizing, but costly, heuristic, and a destabilizing, but cheap, heuristic, and are paid according to the performance of the chosen heuristic. Aggregate choices determine the evolution of a state variable and, consequently, the performance of both heuristics. Theoretically, an increase in the costs for the stabilizing heuristic generates instability and leads to endogenous fluctuations in both the state variable and the fraction of agents using that heuristic. We vary the costs of the stabilizing heuristic in the experiment and find that the predictions of the heuristic switching model are partially confirmed. For low costs the dynamics are stable. For high costs, the dynamics initially are unstable and exhibit the type of bubbles and crashes emblematic for the heuristic switching model. However, over time the pattern of bubbles and crashes disappears and the dynamics become more stable.

Every agent owns a technology which allows them to produce the good, with these technologies varying in their effectiveness. If all technologies exhibit increasing returns to scale (IRS) then it is always efficient to centralize production of the good, whereas efficiency in the case of decreasing returns to scale (DRS) typically requires to spread production. We search for stable cost allocations while differentiating allocations with homogeneous prices, in which all units produced are traded at the same price, from allocations with heterogeneous prices. For the respective cases of IRS or DRS, it is shown that there always exist stable cost sharing rules with homogeneous prices. Finally, in the general framework (under which there may exist no stable allocation at all) we provide a sufficient condition for the existence of stable allocations with homogeneous prices. This condition is shown to be both necessary and sufficient in problems with unitary demands.","[Bahel, Eric] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Trudeau, Christian] Univ Windsor, Dept Econ, 401 Sunset Ave, Windsor, ON, Canada",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; University of Windsor,"Trudeau, C (通讯作者)，Univ Windsor, Dept Econ, 401 Sunset Ave, Windsor, ON, Canada.",erbahel@vt.edu; trudeauc@uwindsor.ca,,"Trudeau, Christian/0000-0003-4195-4153",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [435-2014-0140],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"The authors would like to thank two anonymous reviewers and the Editor for their useful comments and suggestions, which have helped improve the paper.

While there is abundant evidence that remittances facilitate consumption smoothing, the literature has not considered whether this effect varies with the fiscal stance and during fiscal shocks. Our focus is therefore on whether the consumption-smoothing effect changes with fiscal policy phases and whether remittances and government support are substitutes or complements in stabilizing household consumption. We take a holistic approach to investigating this relationship combining cross-country and household-level analysis. We find that remittances help smooth consumption, and hence improve welfare, more during fiscal consolidation episodes, while this impact is insignificant during fiscal expansions. The results also indicate that the effect is more pronounced in countries with greater reliance on remittances.","[Beaton, Kimberly] Int Monetary Fund, Western Hemisphere Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Cevik, Serhan; Yousefi, Seyed Reza] Int Monetary Fund, Fiscal Affairs Dept, 1900 Penn Ave NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund; International Monetary Fund,"Yousefi, SR (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Fiscal Affairs Dept, 1900 Penn Ave NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",syousefi@imf.org,,,,,,,54,1,1,0,3,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

We show that differentiating medical fees by quality increases social welfare relative to uniform pricing (i.e. quality-invariant fee schedules) whenever hospitals and doctors have private information about their own ability. We also show that by moving from uniform to differentiated medical fees, the public healthcare system can effectively incentivise good doctors and hospitals (i.e. low-cost-types) to provide even higher levels of quality than they would under complete information. In the socially optimal quality-differentiated medical fee system, low-cost-type medical-service providers enjoy a rent due to their informational advantage. Informational rent is socially beneficial because it gives service providers a strong incentive to invest in the extra training required to deliver high-quality services at low cost, providing yet another efficiency gain from quality-differentiated medical fees.","[Berg, Nathan] Univ Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Kim, Jeong-Yoo] Kyung Hee Univ, Seoul, South Korea",University of Otago; Kyung Hee University,"Berg, N (通讯作者)，Univ Otago, Dept Econ, POB 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand.",nathan.berg@otago.ac.nz,,"Berg, Nathan/0000-0002-1686-1281",Australian Research Council (ARC) [DP150100242]; Kyung Hee University in 2016 [KHU20160685]; University of Otago Research Grant 2018,Australian Research Council (ARC)(Australian Research Council); Kyung Hee University in 2016; University of Otago Research Grant 2018,"Funding support for this research is gratefully acknowledged from the following sources: Australian Research Council (ARC), award number DP150100242; a grant from Kyung Hee University in 2016, KHU20160685; and a University of Otago Research Grant 2018.",,28,3,3,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

In such a context, this article studies the effects of uncertainty about the future state of the economy on the performance of strict-price-level targeting versus nominal-GDP-level targeting. These targeting frameworks are compared in a small New Keynesian model, which offers a clear illustration of the tradeoffs faced by the central bank. The analysis shows that uncertainty about the future hampers economic performance to a greater extent under nominal-GDP-level targeting, relative to strict-price-level targeting. The reason is that strict-price-level targeting induces greater policy inertia and, therefore, improves the tradeoffs faced by the central bank during ZLB episodes.","[Billi, Roberto M.] Sveriges Riksbank, Monetary Policy Dept, SE-10337 Stockholm, Sweden",Sveriges Riksbank,"Billi, RM (通讯作者)，Sveriges Riksbank, Monetary Policy Dept, SE-10337 Stockholm, Sweden.",Roberto.Billi@riksbank.se,,"Billi, Roberto/0000-0002-3949-8948",,,,,44,2,2,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

During the 2016 presidential campaign, we conducted three list experiments to test the effect SDR has on polls of agreement with presidential candidates. We elicit a subject's agreement with either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump using explicit questioning or an implicit elicitation that allows subjects to conceal their individual responses. We find evidence that explicit polling overstates agreement with Clinton relative to Trump. Subgroup analysis by party identification shows that SDR significantly diminishes explicit statements of agreement with the opposing party's candidate driven largely by Democrats who are significantly less likely to explicitly state agreement with Trump. We measure economic policy preferences and find no evidence that ideological agreement drives SDR. We find suggestive evidence that local voting patterns predict SDR.","[Brownback, Andy; Novotny, Aaron] Univ Arkansas, Dept Econ, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Brownback, A (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas, Dept Econ, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",abrownback@walton.uark.edu; anovotny@walton.uark.edu,"Brownback, Andy/R-5687-2019",,,,,,61,19,24,1,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",2214-8043,2214-8051,,J BEHAV EXP ECON,J.

The latter, in turn, are essential to the generation of additional household goods. Thus, customers' willingness to pay to avoid power interruptions will reflect both aspects of foregone household production. We recognize this as an opportunity to value infrastructure services via stated preference methods based on power outage scenarios. We motivate our model using household production theory, and implement it empirically within a Random Utility framework to derive European households' willingness to-pay to avoid disruption of electricity provision to the front door, as well as the loss of important public services. We find that a considerable portion of total willingness-to-pay, to the order of 20-80%, relates to the public service component. This stresses the importance of explicitly specifying the scale of outages and their effect on public services in stated preference elicitation. Failure to so will produce welfare estimates that are unfit to inform policy, and normalized outage cost estimates that are biased-potentially by a very large margin. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This paper reviews research which shows that the Phillips curve model prevails over an extended sample, provided that the benchmark specifications include major structural changes in the balance-of-payments and labour market, and account for shifts in the root causes of inflation. When this is done, a linear specification with an output gap in levels correctly predicts the non-trended inflation pattern over the period 1971(Q1)-1984(Q4), whereas a piecewise concave curve with an output gap in growth rates accurately forecasts the decelerating inflation pattern during 1986(Q1)-2001(Q2). A novel feature of the concave model is that it remains statistically robust and structurally stable when it is estimated until 2015(Q4). The concave model imparts a disinflationary bias, which suggests that monetary policy should be more expansionary during downswing phases of the business cycle and neutral during upswing phases. The analysis also considers how the shape of the Phillips curve might change if the balance-of-payments constraint on demand is relaxed in a significant way.","[Nell, Kevin S.] Univ Johannesburg, Coll Business & Econ, Sch Econ, Corner Kingsway & Univ Rd, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Johannesburg,"Nell, KS (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, Coll Business & Econ, Sch Econ, Corner Kingsway & Univ Rd, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa.",knell@uj.ac.za,,"Nell, Kevin/0000-0001-9243-476X",,,,,60,4,5,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

Domestic manufacturing industry has been experiencing certain pressure on behalf of foreign direct investment bringing new technologies and higher labor requirements. Purpose of the article: The aim of this paper is to investigate differences in employment strategies and labor indicators in the case of enterprises in foreign and joint ownership (FJO) and domestic enterprises in Russian ownership (RO). We analyze the manufacturing industry in Russia and its regions under conditions of stable and crisis periods. Methods: The study enhances the analysis of Rosstat's statistical data for 2005-2016 and applies ANOVA method to compare the employment results for companies with different ownership patterns. The research is carried out both at the national level of the Russian Federation and at the regional level according to the regions. Findings & Value added: The study identifies significant decline in employment and increase in productivity for the period of 2005-2016. In contrast to the crisis of 2008-2009, in 2014-2016 there has been no sharp drop in employment. However, there is a substantial decline in real salaries which is comparable to the crisis of 2008-2009. According to ANOVA, statistically significant differences in labor indicators between FJO and RO companies are manifested. RO companies dominate in employment and payroll funds, while FJO enterprises have better productivity results with a higher average salary. FJO companies demonstrated faster growth in employment and payroll fund in relatively stable conditions (20122013). However, they reacted with a significant reduction in employment for a new crisis (2014-2016), although the creation of new FJO enterprises continued in separate regions of Russia. The results can be used in social policy to regulate the employment and earnings of industrial workers in the current economic conditions.","[Mikhalchuk, Alexander; Spitsina, Lubov] Tomsk Polytech Univ, Lenina Ave 30, Tomsk 634050, Russia; [Spitsin, Vladislav] Tomsk State Univ Control Syst & Radioelect, Tomsk Polytech Univ, Tomsk, Russia; [Pavlova, Irina] Tomsk State Univ, Tomsk Polytech Univ, Tomsk, Russia",Tomsk Polytechnic University; Tomsk State University of Control Systems & Radioelectronics; Tomsk Polytechnic University; Tomsk State University; Tomsk Polytechnic University,"Spitsin, V (通讯作者)，Tomsk Polytech Univ, Lenina Ave 30, Tomsk 634050, Russia.",spitsin_vv@mail.ru,"Spitsina, Lubov/AAL-3407-2021; Spitsin, Vladislav V/B-3960-2016; Pavlova, Irina A/C-8706-2017",,Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) [17-06-00584],Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)),"The research is conducted with financial support from Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) in the frames of scientific and research project of RFBR named Dynamic modeling of Russian, foreign and joint industrial enterprises development in situation of economic sanctions, project No 17-06-00584(a).",,42,5,5,0,6,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

Normative conflict is measured by the number of rejected offers in a dynamic bargaining game. We find that more alternative normative principles lead to more persistent normative conflict. Furthermore, we show that, in either simple or complex situations, the convergence towards a simple and widely shared norm is likely. In contrast, in moderately complex situations, convergence is unlikely and several equally reasonable norms co-exist.","[Winter, Fabian] Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, MPRG Mech Normat Change, Kurt Schumacher Str 10, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Rauhut, Heiko] Univ Zurich, Inst Sociol, Andreasstr 15, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland; [Miller, Luis] Univ Basque Country, Sch Econ, Av Lehendakari Aguirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain",Max Planck Society; University of Zurich; University of Basque Country,"Winter, F (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, MPRG Mech Normat Change, Kurt Schumacher Str 10, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",winter@coll.mpg.de,"Winter, Fabian/AAJ-7546-2020; Rauhut, Heiko/F-6409-2012; Miller, Luis/N-9669-2019; Winter, Fabian/H-1861-2012","Miller, Luis/0000-0002-7447-2313; Winter, Fabian/0000-0002-4838-4504",,,,,49,2,2,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",2214-8043,2214-8051,,J BEHAV EXP ECON,J.

Our empirical investigation suggests that the intertemporal dynamics of China's central parity shifted after this policy change, although the deviation of the RMB offshore rate from the central parity and the US dollar index remained the two significant determinants of central parity after the policy change. In contrast, the VIX index only offered explanatory power up to August 2015. Thereafter, the onshore RMB rate and the difference between the 1-month offshore and onshore RMB forward points have significant impacts on the central parity. While the US dollar index effect remains, we find no evidence of a rate-fixing role for the RMB exchange rate against the currency basket announced by China in December 2015.","[Cheung, Yin-Wong] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ & Finance, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Hui, Cho-Hoi] Hong Kong Monetary Author, Dept Res, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Tsang, Andrew] Hong Kong Monetary Author, Hong Kong Inst Monetary Res, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",City University of Hong Kong; Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA); Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA),"Cheung, YW (通讯作者)，City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ & Finance, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",yicheung@cityu.edu.hk,,"Tsang, Andrew/0000-0002-5320-4002; CHEUNG, Yin-Wong/0000-0002-7564-7402",Hung Hing Ying and Leung Hau Ling Charitable Foundation,Hung Hing Ying and Leung Hau Ling Charitable Foundation,"We would like to thank Menzie Chinn, Pietro Cova, Robert Dekle, Michael Funke, Eleonora Granziera, Xinhua Gu, Iikka korhonen, Daniela Marconi, Eli Remolona, Brad Setser, Kang Shi and Giovanni Veronese for comments and suggestions.

Credence-good markets are characterized by information asymmetry about the value of sellers' services to consumers who must rely on sellers for diagnosis and treatment provision. Liability refers to the legal environment in which the seller is liable for fixing consumers' problems after charging them the price for his treatment. When the seller is short-lived, liability mitigates information asymmetry and facilitates trade. Nevertheless, liability may undermine a long-lived seller's incentive to maintain a good reputation and reduces market efficiency.

It is shown that the ratio of variances is equivalent theoretically to the concept of residual income progression (squared). The fiscal system became less stabilizing beginning in the late 1990s, especially for families headed by main earners with less than high school education.

In our experiment, the players endogenously negotiate contracts. In line with contract theory, the contractibility of the outcome plays a crucial role when effort is a hidden action. If the outcome is contractible, most players overcome the hidden action problem by agreeing on incentive-compatible contracts. Communication is helpful, since it may reduce strategic uncertainty. If the outcome is non-contractible, in most cases low effort is chosen whenever effort is a hidden action. However, communication leads the players to agree on larger wages and substantially mitigates the underprovision of effort. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

An evaluation of the performance of these mechanisms showed that, (1) while truth-telling is a dominant strategy in both mechanisms, the rate of its occurrence was less than 60%; (2) the average payoff was significantly higher with DA-Reserve than with DA-Quota, as theoretically predicted; (3) surprisingly, the proportion of students exhibiting justified envy was higher with DA-Reserve than with DA-Quota; and (4) a systematic pattern of deviation from the dominant strategy (referred to as skipping-down) was observed, and it was theoretically proven that this constituted Nash equilibrium with DA-Quota in some environments but not with DA-Reserve. More generally, the set of stable matchings was found to be larger with DA-Quota than with DA-Reserve, which explains the matching instability observed with the latter. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

I consider a dynamic general equilibrium model of asset trading with private information and collateral constraints. Investors differ in their aversion to Knightian uncertainty: When uncertainty is high, some investors exit the market. Since exiting investors' information is not fully revealed by prices, conditional return volatility and risk premia both increase. The model also implies that exit is more likely when wealth is more concentrated in the hands of less uncertainty-averse investors. The model thus predicts less informative prices toward the end of a long boom. Moreover, economies with looser collateral constraints should see more volatility due to exit and partial revelation. Higher capital requirements potentially improve welfare by inducing more information revelation by prices. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This article provides an alternative definition, or characterization, of ESR as the unique most ordinally egalitarian one. Specifically, given a lottery p over alternatives, for each agent i the author considers the total probability share in p of objects from her first k indifference classes. ESR is shown to be the unique one which leximin maximizes the vector of all such shares (calculated for all i, k). Serial rule is known to be characterized by the same property. Thus, the author provides an alternative way to show that ESR, indeed, coincides with Serial rule on the assignment domain. Moreover, since both rules are defined as the unique most ordinally egalitarian ones, the result shows that ESR is the right way to think about generalizing Serial rule.","[Bogomolnaia, Anna] Univ Glasgow, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Bogomolnaia, Anna] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, St Petersburg, Russia",University of Glasgow; HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Bogomolnaia, A (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.;Bogomolnaia, A (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, St Petersburg, Russia.",anna.bogomolnaia@glasgow.ac.uk,,"Bogomolnaia, Anna/0000-0003-0377-862X",Basic Research Program of the National Research University Higher School of Economics,Basic Research Program of the National Research University Higher School of Economics,Support by the Basic Research Program of the National Research University Higher School of Economics is gratefully acknowledged.,,10,5,5,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Although the Between-subjects Random Incentivized System (BRIS) is increasingly utilized in experimental economics, its use could be contested from a purely theoretical point of view. In the BRIS, all subjects play the Dictator game, but only a percentage of subjects (e.g., 1 out of 10) are paid. The aim of this article is to test whether the results obtained using this system are consistent with those obtained using a conventional full payment system in which every subject receives payment. An additional, hypothetical treatment is also run. Results show a very similar pattern between the BRIS and the full payment treatment, whereas the hypothetical payment mechanism leads to far fewer egoistic players and far more egalitarians. These findings lend support to the use of BRIS as a valid experimental methodology.","[Clot, Sophie] Univ Reading, Whiteknights St, Reading, Berks, England; [Grolleau, Gilles] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Univ Montpellier, Burgundy Sch Business CEREN, CEE M,Montpellier SupAgro,INRA,CNRS, Montpellier, France; [Ibanez, Lisette] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, Montpellier SupAgro, CEE M,INRA, Montpellier, France",University of Reading; INRAE; Universite de Montpellier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); INRAE; Universite de Montpellier; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro,"Clot, S (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Whiteknights St, Reading, Berks, England.",s.clot@reading.ac.uk; grolleau@supagro.inra.fr; lisette.ibanez@inra.fr,,,,,,,36,23,24,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",2214-8043,2214-8051,,J BEHAV EXP ECON,J.

We take data from banks from 66 countries for the period of 1998-2014 and compare how institutional quality as perceived by the national population impacts financial stability in countries that adopted IT with those that did not. We find that, while banks from IT countries with high quality of institutions do not have their stability significantly enhanced by this policy (the paradox of credibility), countries with average levels of quality of institutions seem to benefit from it. In addition, in the estimations, IT and financial stability are negatively associated in countries with low levels of institutional quality, which is consistent with the fact that governments must have at least some trust of their population in order to conduct effective economic policies. This inverted U-shaped relationship between IT and financial stability as function of the institutional quality reflects the two opposing views in the literature regarding this topic.","[Fazio, Dimas Mateus] Univ London, London Business Sch, 26 Sussex Pl, London NW1 4SA, England; [Silva, Thiago Christiano] Cent Bank Brazil, Res Dept, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Silva, Thiago Christiano] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Philosophy Sci & Literatures Ribeirao Preto, Dept Comp & Math, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil; [Tabak, Benjamin Miranda] FGV, EPPG, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Cajueiro, Daniel Oliveira] Univ Brasilia, Dept Econ, Brasilia, DF, Brazil",University of London; London Business School; Central Bank of Brazil; Universidade de Sao Paulo; Getulio Vargas Foundation; Universidade de Brasilia,"Fazio, DM (通讯作者)，Univ London, London Business Sch, 26 Sussex Pl, London NW1 4SA, England.",dfazio@london.edu; thiago.silva@bcb.gov.br; benjamin.mtabak@gmail.com; danielcajueiro@gmail.com,"Cajueiro, Daniel Oliveira/R-2694-2019; Tabak, Benjamin M/F-9952-2018; Fazio, Dimas/AAP-7277-2020; Silva, Thiago Christiano/B-8828-2012","Silva, Thiago Christiano/0000-0003-2631-4393; CAJUEIRO, DANIEL/0000-0001-5898-1655","CNPq foundation [302808/2015-9, 302518/2015-0, 305427/2014-8]",CNPq foundation(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"Thiago C.

In this paper we connect the two views and argue that tight business relationships can create dynamic inefficiencies and reduce broad innovations. In particular, we consider the repeated interaction between final good producers and intermediate input suppliers, where the provision of the intermediate input is noncontractible. We build a cooperative equilibrium where producers can switch suppliers and start cooperation immediately with new suppliers. We first consider broad innovations: every period, one supplier has the opportunity to create a higher quality input that can be used by all producers. Since relationships are harder to break in the cooperative equilibrium the market size for potential innovators is smaller and the rate of innovation might be lower than in the noncooperative equilibrium. We contrast this with a setting with relationship-specific innovations that we show are encouraged by the establishment of relational contracts. We illustrate the predictions of the model using the recent business history of the United States and Japan and further use patent data to show that U.S. patents are more general than Japanese and even more so in sectors using more differentiated inputs.","[Hemous, David] Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Olsen, Morten] Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Zurich; University of Copenhagen,"Hémous, D (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.",david.hemous@econ.uzh.ch; mo@dce.au.dk,,"Hemous, David/0000-0001-6024-5294",European Commission under the Marie Curie Research Fellowship program [PCIG11-GA-2012-321693]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2012-38134],European Commission under the Marie Curie Research Fellowship program; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"We are grateful to Daron Acemoglu, Philippe Aghion, Alberto Alesina, George-Marios Angeletos, Pol Antras, Emmanuel Farhi, Oliver Hart, David Laibson, Jacob Leshno, Claire Lelarge, James Malcomson, Massimo Maoret, Nathan Nunn, Jennifer Page, Daniel Trefler and Timothy Van Zandt for their thoughtful comments.

We estimate hedonic price regressions using data on tariff plans offered by the main mobile telecommunications operator in France between May 2011 and December 2014. In this time period, the obtained quality-adjusted price index decreased by about 42.8% as compared to a decline in weighted average prices without quality-adjustment of 8.7%. In a second step, we relate the quality-adjusted prices to a set of competition, investment, and regulation variables and find that the launch of 4G networks by mobile operators was the main driver of price reductions for classic tariffs with commitment. Low-cost tariffs without commitment which were introduced to pre-empt the entry of low-cost competitor declined at the time of entry. Moreover, we find that regulation, which is approximated by the level of mobile termination charges and international roaming price caps for voice and data, has a joint significant impact on quality-adjusted prices. In percentage terms, competition is responsible for about 23.4% of total price decline and investments in 4G for 56.1%. We conclude that the reduction in quality-adjusted prices in the last years was largely caused by competition between operators for a new 4G technology and by entry of a fourth low-cost operator.

As common to the developmental context, catching-up capabilities have been both absorbed from external sources and generated by indigenous activities. These also represent exogenous and endogenous seeds of innovative activities respectively. The relative emphasis on the two has evolved over progressive industrialization-transition stages in China, leading the country to grow a global manufacturing hub. The volume and quality of innovative activities has however resulted unevenly distributed at a local level. Literature considers embeddedness, in particular, as one of the key features in the development of the local innovative environment. This paper investigates if the mixes of seeds may have delayed the innovative activities to gain embeddedness along their diffusion in the Chinese prefectural cities. In a great deal of stylization and methodological design, innovative activities are here approximated by the applications to the European Patent Office from China collected in the OECD REGPAT database as originally rearranged by the applicant's and inventor's prefectural locations. These locations are taken to build three indicators to be combined in a clustering procedure set to measure separate levels of embeddedness. The results suggest a growing diffusion and embeddedness of the innovative activities in the Chinese prefectural cities since the early-2000s, despite they remain highly concentrated in some regions, that is, mainly those having historically hosted the Special Economic Zones where more exogenous seeds appear to have actually delayed the innovative activities to gain embeddedness.","[Prodi, Giorgio; Frattini, Federico] Univ Ferrara, Dept Econ & Management, Via Voltapaletto 11, I-44121 Ferrara, FE, Italy; [Nicolli, Francesco] CNR, Res Inst Sustainable Econ Growth, Milan, Italy",University of Ferrara; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Ricerca sulla Crescita Economica Sostenibile (IRCRES-CNR),"Prodi, G (通讯作者)，Univ Ferrara, Dept Econ & Management, Via Voltapaletto 11, I-44121 Ferrara, FE, Italy.",giorgio.prodi@unife.it,"prodi, giorgio/AAE-4838-2020; Frattini, Federico/I-4935-2019","Frattini, Federico/0000-0002-8490-4159; nicolli, francesco/0000-0001-8109-5969; prodi, giorgio/0000-0002-3957-4939",,,,,95,5,6,0,32,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

Interpreting greater contributions as generosity, this has been seen as evidence of generosity being intuitive. We caution that fast decisions are more prone to error, and that mistakes, rather than preferences, may drive the observed comparative static. Varying the location of the equilibrium in public-good games with a unique dominant strategy, we show that the location of the equilibrium determines whether contributions are larger for fast decision-makers than for slow decision-makers. Replicating previous results, we find that fast decision-makers give more than slow decision-makers when the equilibrium is below the mid-point of the strategy set, but that this result is reversed when the equilibrium is above the mid-point. Consistent with fast decisions being more prone to error, we find that individuals who make (or have to make) fast decisions are insensitive to incentives, more often make mistakes, and are less likely to make equilibrium contributions. These findings make clear that we must control for the rate of errors if we are to draw inference on preferences from response time.","[Recalde, Maria P.] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Riedl, Arno] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Vesterlund, Lise] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Vesterlund, Lise] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Melbourne; Maastricht University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Vesterlund, L (通讯作者)，Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",vester@pitt.edu,,"Recalde, Maria P/0000-0001-7127-1607",,,,,82,31,31,3,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",0047-2727,,,J PUBLIC ECON,J.

With strongly diminishing marginal utility of wealth and in the presence of a gender wage gap, single women have a greater incentive than single men to invest in education. Marriage-market distortions tend to depress the overall benefit of education for women relative to men. I develop a tractable two-period model and parameterize it using US census data for the cohort born in 1950. I then show that it can generate a reversal and that the most important driving force for this is the decline in marriage rates.","[Reijnders, Laurie S.

To account for the possibility that immigrant and native teachers may be assigned to different types of schools, and even within schools, to different types of students, two estimation strategies are employed. The first estimates the immigrant teacher impact by comparing the achievements of students with immigrant teachers to the achievements of observationally similar students with native teachers, within schools. The second compares the achievement of a student with an immigrant teacher in one subject to the achievement of the same student with a native teacher in another subject. Contrary to popular perception, the results suggest that, overall, immigrant teachers do not have a negative impact on the educational achievements of native students. (C) 2017 The Author.

The promotion of business, facilitation of production, and rewards of economic returns are highly correlated stages for efficiency performance. The results suggest that Beijing's government should expend more effort developing the potential to generate outputs given current land and investment inputs. In addition, it provides a tool to strengthen the organisational capacity development of industrial parks by emphasising their multi-dimensions in inputs and outputs, selecting the right competitors at the right organisational stage, locating sources of efficiency and inefficiency, and understanding progression and balance of internal stages during operation.","[Yang, Zhenshan] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Reg Sustainable Dev & Modelling, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yang, Zhenshan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yang, Zhenshan] Univ Cambridge, Land Econ, Cambridge, England; [Hao, Gaojian] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Coll Tourism & Environm Sci, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Zhe] Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; University of Cambridge; Shaanxi Normal University; Peking University","Cheng, Z (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",cz1251@pku.edu.cn,"Cheng, Zhe/AHE-3742-2022","Cheng, Zhe/0000-0002-3777-3934; Yang, Zhenshan/0000-0002-3697-7396","Natural Sciences Foundation of China [41530751, 41371008]; Early Career Talent Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences 'Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS' [2014042]; Shaanxi Normal University",Natural Sciences Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Early Career Talent Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences 'Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS'; Shaanxi Normal University,"The research is sponsored by a grant of the Natural Sciences Foundation of China [grant number 41530751], [grant number 41371008], the support from Early Career Talent Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences 'Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS' [grant number 2014042]; and the support of Shaanxi Normal University.",,54,11,11,1,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Whether there is price convergence between regions in one country is an important economic issue according to the Law of One Price (LOP) theory. Compared to previous studies, this article operates with the Sequential Panel Selection Method (SPSM) to explore the non-stationary properties of the LOP in China's regions. We provide robust evidence to specify that the LOP holds true for two-thirds of the provinces in China, mainly in the Western and Central regions. This means that the Eastern region's price fluctuation is non-stationary and that the consumer price index (CPI) levels of the Western, Central and Northeastern regions are relatively convergent in China. The conduction path of the CPI level is from the Eastern region to the other regions. It shows that prices can converge with each other by LOP and the values of the same goods in the Western and Central regions are equal and if there is a price difference, then it can be eliminated by interregional trade.","[Liu, Tie-Ying] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Su, Chi-Wei] Ocean Univ China, Dept Finance, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Chang, Hsu-Ling] Ling Tung Univ, Dept Accounting & Informat, Taichung, Taiwan; [Xiong, De-Ping] Yunnan Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Su, Chi-Wei] Qingdao Univ, Sch Econ, Qingdao, Peoples R China",Beijing Jiaotong University; Ocean University of China; Yunnan University of Finance & Economics; Qingdao University,"Xiong, DP (通讯作者)，Yunnan Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",xiondeping@126.com,"Su, Chi Wei/ABE-4976-2021","Lin, Ren/0000-0001-9854-0483","Ministry of Education, Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Fund [16YJC790064]","Ministry of Education, Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Fund","This work was supported by Ministry of Education, Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Fund [Grant No. 16YJC790064].",,52,4,4,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We call it the proportional Shapley value since it distributes the Harsanyi dividend (Harsanyi, 1959) of all coalitions in proportion to the stand-alone worths of its members. We show that this value recommends appealing payoff distributions in several applications among which a land production economy introduced in Shapley and Shubik (1967). Although the proportional Shapley value does not satisfy the classical axioms of linearity and consistency (Hart and Mas-Colell, 1989), the main results provide comparable axiomatic characterizations of our value and the Shapley value by means of weak versions of these two axioms.

The paper considers the two sharply contrasting cases of East and West German convergence following reunification and the enduring poverty of the Italian Mezzogiorno since Italian unification a century and a half ago. In both countries, political integration delivers much higher consumption in the lagging relative to the leading region than of per capita GDP. Consumption convergence can be supported by transfers but 'production' convergence ultimately requires catch-up in the production of tradeables. The paper demonstrates the radically different performance of the tradeable sector in the two cases, and suggests that this may be the result of differences in labour market flexibility, in investment performance and in the social norms required for the production of complex manufacturing.","[Boltho, Andrea] Univ Oxford, Magdalen Coll, Oxford, England; [Carlin, Wendy] UCL, London, England; [Carlin, Wendy] CEPR, London, England; [Scaramozzino, Pasquale] SOAS Univ London, London, England; [Scaramozzino, Pasquale] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy",University of Oxford; University of London; University College London; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Carlin, W (通讯作者)，UCL, London, England.;Carlin, W (通讯作者)，CEPR, London, England.",w.carlin@ucl.uk,,"Scaramozzino, Pasquale/0000-0003-4917-6560",,,,,67,13,13,0,5,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0147-5967,1095-7227,,J COMP ECON,J.

The log-likelihood of an ICLV model cannot be evaluated analytically, and can only be evaluated by a simulation that requires large numbers of sample draws. While conducting simulation-based model estimations, researchers often encounter an estimation failure. Sohn (2017) suggests a novel estimation method to circumvent the problem by using an expectation-maximization algorithm (EM). However, a drawback of this method continues to be the requirement of a huge amount of computer memory to deal with an augmented covariance matrix. In the present study, this problem was overcome by connecting each latent variable in a structural equation to all individual specific variables. This restriction did not hamper the utility of an ICLV model during empirical experimentation. The main contribution of this study is to introduce a simple method devised to solve large-scale ICLV models.","[Chae, Dasol; Jung, Jaeyoung; Sohn, Keemin] Chung Ang Univ, Dept Urban Engn, 84 Heukseok Ro, Seoul 06974, South Korea",Chung Ang University,"Sohn, K (通讯作者)，Chung Ang Univ, Dept Urban Engn, 84 Heukseok Ro, Seoul 06974, South Korea.",kmsohn@cau.ac.kr,"Sohn, Keemin/AAZ-3506-2021","Sohn, Keemin/0000-0002-7270-7094",Chung-Ang University Research Scholarship; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant - Korean Government (MSIP) [2015005843],Chung-Ang University Research Scholarship; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant - Korean Government (MSIP)(National Research Foundation of Korea),"This research was supported by the Chung-Ang University Research Scholarship Grants in 2016, and also supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean Government (MSIP) (2015005843).",,13,1,1,0,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-5345,,,J CHOICE MODEL,J.

Using the methodology developed in Kehoe and Ruhl (2013), we define the set of least-traded goods as those that account for the lowest 10% of total exports and imports in 1995, and then trace its growth in several markets including the Baltics' main trade partners, the European Union and Russia. We find that, on average, by 2008 least-traded goods accounted for nearly 50% of total Baltic exports to their main trade partners. Moreover, we find that increases in the share of least traded exports coincided with the timing of the trade liberalization reforms implemented by the Baltic countries. Least-traded imports also grew at robust rates, but their growth was lower than that of exports, accounting for slightly less than a quarter of total imports, that is, about half of the exports value. Moreover, we find that the shares of least traded imports from the EU 15 and from Russia started diverging around the time the Baltic countries joined the EU, with the EU 15 share increasing and the Russian one declining. We also find that the Baltics' share of least-traded exports outpaced that of other economies in Central and Eastern Europe. Finally, exports of new goods from the Baltic countries suffered noticeably during the Global Financial Crisis. After the crisis ended, the restart in new goods exports growth displayed mixed patterns.

One focuses on the systemic level, whereas the other is concerned with the individual level. They therefore analyse relatively distinct causal mechanisms. Thus, an important question is whether these approaches can be reconciled. Another related question is how FAD- and FED-based explanations relate to classical Malthusian views about rapid food requirement increase (FRI). This paper analyses these questions and argues that these three approaches can indeed be reconciled within a single framework by outlining the causal sources of FAD, FED and FRI. This task requires, among other things, the separation of ontological categories and empirical measures. As a consequence of this argument, the paper suggests that there are only seven possible ontological combinations of how a famine situation can arise as a direct cause. Simultaneously, it maintains that there are virtually an infinite number of ways in which these combinations may act as indirect causes (rooted in economic, political and social conditions). The analysis is exemplified by the Bengal famine of 1943 because that famine is a well-known case. The wider research and policy applicability of this general account are discussed but have yet to be tested in relation to other scarcity cases (water, land, fish). This synthesis is made possible by the incorporation of critical realist interventions into economic theory.","[Daoud, Adel] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England; [Daoud, Adel] Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Cambridge; University of Gothenburg,"Daoud, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Judge Business Sch, Ctr Business Res, Trumpington St, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England.",ad836@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,107,9,9,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

In this article, we employ notions of self-enforceability and learnability to motivate and identify equilibria of particular interest in discretionary policy problems exhibiting multiple equilibria. Central among these criteria are whether an equilibrium is robust to the formation of coalitions, and whether it is learnable by private agents and jointly learnable by private agents and the policy maker. Unless the Pareto-preferred equilibrium is learnable by private agents, we find little reason to expect coordination on that equilibrium.","[Dennis, Richard; Kirsanova, Tatiana] Univ Glasgow, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow,"Dennis, R (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Dept Econ, Adam Smith Business Sch, Gilbert Scott Bldg, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",richard.dennis@glasgow.ac.uk,"Dennis, Richard/AAZ-5973-2020","Dennis, Richard/0000-0002-4972-1509; Kirsanova, Tatiana/0000-0002-1470-4311",,,,,25,1,1,2,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0133,1468-0297,,ECON J,Econ.

Is the corresponding Shapley value mechanism optimal in some sense? We consider the objective of minimizing worst-case inefficiency subject to a revenue constraint, and prove results in three different regimes. First, for the public excludable good problem, the Shapley value mechanism minimizes the worst-case efficiency loss over all truthful, deterministic, and budget-balanced mechanisms that satisfy equal treatment. Second, even with randomization and approximate budget-balance allowed and dropping equal treatment, the worst-case efficiency loss of the Shapley value mechanism is within a constant factor of the minimum possible. Third, for no-deficit mechanisms, we prove a general positive result: for every monotone cost function, a suitable blend of the VCG and Shapley value mechanisms is no-deficit and enjoys good approximate efficiency guarantees.

In regional innovation systems, KIBS play a crucial role in distributing innovations and improving the region's overall innovative capacities. While the specific properties and effects on client firms and sectors have been comprehensively discussed, the internal perspective of client firms, i.e., the processes and problems in selecting, using, evaluating, and recommending KIBS, has been neglected to date. Using a qualitative approach, we describe the internal mechanisms and problems of SMEs cooperating with various KIBS and discuss the implications for regional innovation systems from a policy-making perspective. We find that all stages of cooperation of SMEs and KIBS are characterized by strong information asymmetries, distrust, and uncertainty about the effects of using external know-how, which yields the interpretation that SMEs perceive KIBS as credence goods. While informal networks are used to reduce information barriers, they regularly prove counterproductive by disseminating worst-case examples. Regional policy aiming at developing instruments for fostering innovative cooperation could thus strengthen formal networks that primarily create trust between KIBS and SMEs to systematically reduce mutual suspicions and information asymmetries.","[Feser, Daniel; Proeger, Till] Univ Goettingen, Fac Econ Sci, Chair Econ Policy & SME Res, Pl Goettinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Proeger, T (通讯作者)，Univ Goettingen, Fac Econ Sci, Chair Econ Policy & SME Res, Pl Goettinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",Till.Proeger@wiwi.uni-goettingen.de,,"Feser, Daniel/0000-0002-2591-4488",PraxisResearcher program - University of Goettingen; iENG project - German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [03EK3517A],PraxisResearcher program - University of Goettingen; iENG project - German Federal Ministry of Education and Research,"Financial support for conducting the interviews from the PraxisResearcher program funded by the University of Goettingen and the iENG project (grant number 03EK3517A), funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, is gratefully acknowledged.",,71,5,5,1,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1868-7865,1868-7873,,J KNOWL ECON,J.

We characterize the equilibrium for 2 x 2 games. When the component game min-max and max-min differ, the revision game equilibrium have a wait-and-wrestle structure: far form the deadline, players stay put at sur-place action profile, close to the deadline, they take best responses to the action of the opponent.

It has been possible to collect data for 89 universities, by means of a survey sent by e-mail to all 95 Italian universities and by visiting all their websites. Based on the international literature, a number of variables have been identified for the analysis: main missions (education, research and third mission), internationalization, role of the host territory, competitive and cooperative categories. The data collected through the survey (23 answers) allowed a further investigation into their views regarding strengths and weaknesses of the Italian higher education system, their strategic planning process, the role of internal actors and external stakeholders. Results are mixed and show that one sub-group of Italian universities is very pro-active and innovative in its strategic planning; another sub-group interprets strategic planning as nothing more than a legal compliance.","[Giusepponi, Katia] Univ Macerata, PLe Luigi Bertelli 1-C Da Vallebona, Macerata, Italy; [Tavoletti, Ernesto] Univ Macerata, Pzza Strambi 1, I-62100 Macerata, Italy",University of Macerata; University of Macerata,"Tavoletti, E (通讯作者)，Univ Macerata, Pzza Strambi 1, I-62100 Macerata, Italy.",katia.giusepponi@unimc.it; ernesto.tavoletti@unimc.it,"Tavoletti, Ernesto/M-7663-2015","Tavoletti, Ernesto/0000-0002-2225-7574",,,,,75,11,14,3,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1868-7865,1868-7873,,J KNOWL ECON,J.

Criticism has been levelled at the assumptions employed in the dominant models, particularly that economic agents are homogeneous and optimizing and that the economy is equilibrating. This paper seeks to explore an interdisciplinary approach to macroeconomic modelling, with techniques drawn from other (natural and social) sciences. Specifically, it discusses agent-based modelling, which is used across a wide range of disciplines, as an example of such a technique. Agent-based models are complementary to existing approaches and are suited to answering macroeconomic questions where complexity, heterogeneity, networks, and heuristics play an important role.","[Haldane, A.

Economic reforms have, therefore, been carried out throughout various parts of the world to improve the performance of the economies. Using data from 94 low- and middle-income nations for the period 1996-2015, this study employs static and dynamic panel analysis to examine whether economic reform undertaken in accordance with the World Bank's reform programs negatively affects corruption. Our findings suggest that enhancing government effectiveness (i.e. independence of civil service from political pressure, provision of quality public services, effective policy formulation and the government's commitment to such policies) and improving public rights and civil liberties could be some of the most promising policies in terms of fighting corruption. The role of economic development and growth in real per capita income is also found to be significant in some of the specifications. However, the assertion that economic reform can reduce corruption is rejected in all the specifications. We rather find evidence that economic reforms negatively affect the ability of democracy to fight corruption, although on a slim margin. The central theme of the implications of our findings is that in combating corruption, social, institutional and legal means are far more important than economic means. The finding thus is compatible with the World Bank's effort in the later years to introduce governance and democracy as effective tool against corruption.","[Kamal, Mustafa] Unnayan Onneshan, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Rana, Ebney Ayaj] Univ Dhaka, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Wahid, Abu N.

The model yields empirically realistic distributions of wealth and marginal propensities to consume because of two features: uninsurable income shocks and multiple assets with different degrees of liquidity and different returns. In this environment, the indirect effects of an unexpected cut in interest rates, which operate through a general equilibrium increase in labor demand, far outweigh direct effects such as intertemporal substitution. This finding is in stark contrast to small- and medium-scale Representative Agent New Keynesian (RANK) economies, where the substitution channel drives virtually all of the transmission from interest rates to consumption. Failure of Ricardian equivalence implies that, in HANK models, the fiscal reaction to the monetary expansion is a key determinant of the overall size of the macroeconomic response.","[Kaplan, Greg] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Saieh Hall,5757 S Univ Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Kaplan, Greg; Violante, Giovanni L.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Moll, Benjamin; Violante, Giovanni L.] Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Julis Romo Rabinowitz Bldg, Princeton, NJ 08542 USA; [Violante, Giovanni L.] CEPR, Washington, DC USA",University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research; Princeton University; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Kaplan, G (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Saieh Hall,5757 S Univ Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.;Kaplan, G (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",gkaplan@uchicago.edu; moll@princeton.edu; glv2@princeton.edu,"Violante, Giovanni L./F-1872-2017",,,,,,70,323,425,19,136,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,1944-7981,,AM ECON REV,Am.

The present study suggests that improvements in access to finance and financial development (increases in the reach of the banking sector) enable firms operating away from capital or major cities to enter export markets easily.

The first is a pure banking regime, in which firms borrow from banks for financing costs of labor, investment and intermediate goods for both the relatively riskless natural-resource traded sector and the non-traded sector. The second regime is more financially-inclusive banking/crowdfunding (BCF) regime, in which the households directly receive returns to capital from pooled lending to home-goods firms. Simulation results show that the banking regime better insulates the economy from negative shocks but limits the upside gain from positive shocks which would take place in the banking-crowdfunding regime.","[McNelis, Paul D.] Fordham Univ, Gabelli Sch Business, New York, NY 10023 USA; [Yoshino, Naoyuki] Asian Dev Bank Inst, Tokyo, Japan; [Yoshino, Naoyuki] Keio Univ, Tokyo, Japan",Fordham University; Keio University,"McNelis, PD (通讯作者)，Fordham Univ, Gabelli Sch Business, New York, NY 10023 USA.",mcnelis@fordham.edu; nyoshino@adbi.org,,"McNelis, Paul D./0000-0001-9519-2372; Yoshino, Naoyuki/0000-0001-8060-5314",,,,,25,2,2,0,19,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

No area of social choice has failed to benefit from Suzumura's penetrating analyses. Among the many important contributions made by Suzumura is the use of the idea of incompleteness of evaluation in his analysis of consistency, particularly in the form of what has come to be called Suzumura consistency. In this paper I explore the need for allowing - and incorporating - incompleteness of preferences in choice theory in general and social choice in particular. This is followed by a number of critical enquiries. Why is incompleteness important? How does it arise as an essential part of rational reflections? What are its implications (i) for prudential decisions, and (ii) for ethical judgments? Finally, how should making room for incompleteness influence theories of justice?","[Sen, Amartya] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Sen, A (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",asen@fas.harvard.edu,,,,,,,22,10,10,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1742-7355,1742-7363,,INT J ECON THEORY,Int.

We consider centralised decision and decentralised decision cases where supply chain partners have different market power structures, including the Manufacturer-Stackelberg, Retailer-Stackelberg and Nash Game. We find that the direct sale price and added value are unchanged under different power structures. However, dominating power structures always lead to inefficiency for the whole dual-channel supply chain.

To attain this objective, 1150 surveys of retail distribution professionals were conducted. These surveys aid in distinguishing retail formats and indicate their competitive position allowing us to generate positioning maps of the Spanish retailing. In addition, Cramer's coefficient V was used as an association measure between qualitative variables and latent class analysis (LCA) modelling was used to build a segmentation analysis of the competing offer. This analysis shows how retail formats evolve and adapt their competitive variables, even adopting characteristics from different formats (competitive convergence). Supermarkets dominate the Spanish retailing and a hybrid retail format's better competitive position in aspects commonly associated with other formats supports. Spanish retailing provides an example of the non-static nature of retail formats and business models.","[Aranda, Evangelina] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Appl Econ, Toledo, Spain; [Martin, Victor J.] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Appl Econ, Madrid, Spain; [Santos, Jesus] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Stat, Toledo, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Complutense University of Madrid; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,"Santos, J (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Stat, Toledo, Spain.",jesus.scerro@uclm.es,"Aranda, Evangelina/R-3436-2017; Martin, Victor J/AAG-9790-2020; JESUS, SANTOS/F-1188-2015","Aranda, Evangelina/0000-0002-4438-7134; Martin, Victor J/0000-0002-2021-6138; JESUS, SANTOS/0000-0002-1384-6334",,,,,75,3,3,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Wholesalers are assumed to possess a technology such that they can buy manufacturing goods domestically and sell in foreign markets and they can, unlike manufacturers, export more than one good. A wholesaler therefore faces an additional fixed cost, which increases in the number of goods it handles. The presence of wholesale firms leads to productivity sorting. The most productive firms export on their own by paying a fixed cost, but a range of firms with intermediate productivity levels export through international wholesalers. A higher fixed cost of exporting to a destination means that wholesalers handle: (i) a higher share of total export volumes to this destination and (ii) a higher share of the exported product scope (i.e., the number of exported products) to this destination. A higher fixed cost of exporting gives wholesalers a larger role, since these can spread the fixed cost across more than one good. The wholesale technology therefore exhibits economies of scope. An empirical analysis using Swedish firm-level data supports the main assumption and predictions of the model.","[Akerman, Anders] Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ, Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Akerman, A (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ, Stockholm, Sweden.",anders.akerman@ne.su.se,"Akerman, Anders/AAS-6266-2020; Akerman, Anders/T-9358-2017",,Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Research Foundation; Torsten Soderberg Foundation,Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Research Foundation; Torsten Soderberg Foundation,"I am grateful for helpful comments and suggestions from two anonymous referees, Andrew Bernard, Gregory Corcos, Matthieu Crozet, Jonathan Eaton, Gabriel Felbermayr, Harry Flam, Rikard Forslid, Benjamin Jung, Sebastian Krautheim, James Markusen, Lindsay Oldenski, Horst Raff, Peter Schott, Anson Soderbery, Heiwai Tang and Stephen Yeaple as well as seminar participants at the Midwest International Trade Meetings in Chicago, NOITS in Helsinki, RIEF in Kiel, Uppsala International Trade Workshop, the EEA Meetings in Glasgow, the ETSG in Lausanne and the EITI in Tokyo.

Using a Bayesian framework, we show how the individual direct and indirect impacts associated with an exogenous variable introduced in a nonlinear way in such models can be computed, theoretically and empirically. Rather than averaging the individual impacts, we suggest to graphically analyze them along with their confidence intervals calculated from Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). We also explicitly derive the form of the gap between individual impacts in the spatial autoregressive model and the corresponding model without a spatial lag and show, in our application on the Boston dataset, that it is higher for spatially highly connected observations.

They show that as agents become patient enough, for any prior belief about the type of the privately informed seller, in any stationary equilibrium, prices in all transactions converge to the highest possible valuation of the informed seller. In the model, it was assumed that the privately informed seller's type is distributed on a two-point support.

After Medicaid, public insurance utilization increased and mortality fell more rapidly among children and infants in high-Medicaid-eligibility states. Mortality among nonwhite children on Medicaid fell by 20 percent, leading to a reduction in aggregate nonwhite child mortality rates of 11 percent.","[Goodman-Bacon, Andrew] Vanderbilt Univ, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA",Vanderbilt University,"Goodman-Bacon, A (通讯作者)，Vanderbilt Univ, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.",,,,National Institute of Child Health and Human Development University of Michigan Population Studies Center [T32 HD0007339]; University of California Berkeley's Center on the Economics and Demography of Aging (National Institute on Aging) [2P30AG012839]; Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Health Policy Scholars program,National Institute of Child Health and Human Development University of Michigan Population Studies Center; University of California Berkeley's Center on the Economics and Demography of Aging (National Institute on Aging); Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Health Policy Scholars program,"This project was generously supported by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (T32 HD0007339) University of Michigan Population Studies Center Traineeship, the University of California Berkeley's Center on the Economics and Demography of Aging (National Institute on Aging 2P30AG012839), and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Health Policy Scholars program.

We look at spending-based and tax-based consolidations and analyze their effects separately. We find that the effects of consolidations and the output multipliers are sensitive to heterogeneity in expectations before and after implementation of a specific fiscal plan. Depending on the beliefs about the type of consolidation prior to implementation, we show that heterogeneity in expectations may lead to optimism in the economy, improving thus the performance of a specific fiscal plan, or can work towards the opposite direction leading to pessimism, amplifying the contractionary effects of the consolidation. In general, we find that spending-based consolidations last longer and lead to deeper recessions when agents are boundedly rational compared to the rational expectations benchmark, while the opposite holds for tax-based consolidations.

In contrast to most of the previous literature, our specification differentiates between electricity and heating demand and still models other consumption goods in realistic detail. We use a yet unexplored data-set on household expenditures in Germany and extend the recently developed EASI demand system for the analysis of inequality and welfare at the individual and social level. The EASI system reveals non-linearity of Engel curves which when neglected- can lead to biased estimates of distributional effects. We find that increases in heating prices are more regressive than those in electricity. Furthermore, current proposals for social tariffs are found to be less effective than targeted compensation schemes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Reanos, Miguel A.

Event study analysis of investment in both conventional and unconventional resources is made to answer this question. Using a sample of 1282 acquisition and 1503 divestiture announcements over the period 1989 to 2011 we find that resource acquisition increases equity value consistent with information asymmetry arguments while resource divestiture also increases value consistent with portfolio arguments. The technological innovation literature suggests that investment in (divestment of) technologically complex assets could result in losses (gains) relative to simpler assets. On the assumption that exploitation of unconventional resources requires more innovative technology than conventional resources, we compare returns to conventional versus unconventional but find little evidence to support this prediction. Further, we find positive total wealth effects associated with these transactions, where both buyer and seller benefiting from the transactions on average. Finally, longer term analysis of returns to buy and hold transactions shows little evidence to support market biases in reaction to acquisition or divestiture announcements. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Estimation results suggest that the expansion has increased migrants' employment chances and income. The probability of having a full-time employment for a male migrant in the post expansion period increases by about 7.7 percentage points. The increase in income for male migrants is higher than that of their female counterparts after the expansion. When the income distribution is broken down into quantiles, estimation results show that male migrants at lower ends of the income distribution experience higher increase in income. At the highest end of the income distribution, there is no evidence that the expansion has any significant effect on either male or female migrants' income.","[Soon, Jan-Jan] Univ Utara Malaysia, Sch Econ Finance & Banking, Changlun, Malaysia",Universiti Utara Malaysia,"Soon, JJ (通讯作者)，Univ Utara Malaysia, Sch Econ Finance & Banking, Changlun, Malaysia.",soon@uum.edu.my,"Soon, Jan-Jan/I-7079-2018","Soon, Jan-Jan/0000-0003-0647-8833",,,,,22,2,2,0,3,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

Using a nested logit model, we find that overall, higher wage differentials, larger population size, higher GDP per capita, and faster employment growth rate are the attributes of a city that attract rural-to-urban migrants. In addition, moving beyond one's home province has a strong deterrent effect on migration, analogous to the border effect identified in international migration studies.

This paper proposes an integrated decomposition approach, combining production-theoretical decomposition analysis (PDA), index decomposition analysis (IDA) and attribution analysis (AA). The proposed approach can decompose sector-level carbon intensity change into nine driving factors, including two new pre-defined factors (i.e. the potential regional output structure effect and the output gap effect). This provides more detailed information about the influence of production technology related components, i.e. technical efficiency and technological change, and the contribution of each region to the individual driving factor. Industrial sectors across 30 provinces in China are used to demonstrate the integrated decomposition approach. The decomposition and attribution results show that the desirable output technological change effect is the dominant factor in decreasing industrial carbon intensity, of which Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Liaoning and Henan are the main contributors. The potential energy intensity effect reduces industrial carbon intensity remarkably as well, mainly due to Henan, Liaoning, Shandong, Hunan and Inner Mongolia. Provinces are classifies into four performance groups based on the attribution results. Targeted industrial carbon intensity reduction policies should be implemented in different groups of provinces.

Measuring domestic value added in China's exports of manufactures,CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Global value chains; Value-added exports; Domestic value-added in exports,TRADE,"This paper aims to investigate China's gains of participating in global value chains (GVCs) in terms of GDP in exports (DVA - domestic value added) and the factors affecting China's gains. The paper decomposes the gross exports of China so as to get the components that make up total GDP in the exports of the country, namely the value-added exports and DVA that are returned from abroad. Then the two components are measured to obtain the scale of GDP in China's exports both on country and sector level. The results show that, firstly, both value-added exports and the GDP in China's exports are less than the traditional gross trade statistics, indicating that there is a gap of real trade gains under GVCs. Secondly, comparing whether the proportion of DVA in total exports, the proportion of DVA in exports of manufactures or the proportion of RDV in total DVA, the gaps between China and the developed countries such as the United States, Germany and Japan do exist. Especially, considering the RDV of China, the proportion is significantly lower than that of major developed countries such as the United States and Germany, indicating that China lags far behind developed countries in the capabilities of supplying high value-added intermediate goods. Lastly, the empirical results suggest that DVA in China's exports has progressively increased in response to the productivity enhancement; research and development (R & D) inputs and capital formation, and the synergies between R & D and vertical specialization affect China's DVA growth in exports positively.","[Yu, Chunjiao; Luo, Zhechong] Hubei Univ, Sch Business, Dept Int Trade & Econ, Wuhan 430062, Hubei, Peoples R China",Hubei University,"Yu, CJ (通讯作者)，Hubei Univ, Business Sch, Wuhan 430062, Hubei, Peoples R China.",yuchunjiao@aliyun.com,"liping, sun/AAW-1808-2021","liping, sun/0000-0002-4711-3518; Luo, ZheChong/0009-0008-9707-0668","National Social Science Foundation of China [16ZDA039, 16BJL102]; Humanities Social Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China [15YJA790078]","National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Humanities Social Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China)",We are deeply grateful to the anonymous referees and the editors for their extremely constructive instructions.

The unemployment rate by age and gender-useful information for estimating Okun's relationship-is not available for Italy from official statistics. Therefore, we provide an estimation of the indicator using microdata for the 2005-2014 period from ISTAT, the Italian labour force survey. Okun's law is investigated using two measures of the unemployment rate: a traditional measure based on a labour force with and without work experience, and a new measure restricted to the labour force with experience. When Okun's relationship is estimated using the unemployment rate restricted to the labour force with experience, the young population is less sensitive to business cycles. As the workforce ages, this gap in sensitivity tends to shrink. We also found that there are no significant differences by gender in the magnitude of Okun's coefficient among the youngest population when considering the unemployment rate restricted to the labour force with experience.","[Zanin, Luca] Prometeia, G Marconi 43, I-40122 Bologna, Italy",,"Zanin, L (通讯作者)，Prometeia, G Marconi 43, I-40122 Bologna, Italy.",luca.zanin@studio.unibo.it,"Zanin, Luca/AAT-9176-2020; Zanin, Luca/F-9439-2010","Zanin, Luca/0000-0001-5426-0017; Zanin, Luca/0000-0001-5426-0017",,,,,22,12,12,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,FEB,2018,45.0,1,,,,,17,28,,10.1007/s10663-016-9343-5,0.0,,,12,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FT2QF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000422990400002,0

We find that higher relative illiquidity of H-shares is associated with a higher H-share discount, relative to A-shares. In addition, more actively traded A-shares and infrequently traded H-shares are associated with a higher H-share discount. We also find that an increase in the number of analysts following a firm, firms with a higher percentage of A-share holdings by mutual funds, as well as firms audited by the Big 4 accounting firms are all associated with a smaller H-share discount. Overall, the results provide support for the notion that liquidity and transparency affect the relative pricing of A-and H-shares. (C) 2017 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.

It focuses on estimators that are readily available in statistical software packages such as Stata and Eviews, and for which the number of cross-sectional units (N) and time periods (T) are small to moderate in size. The goal is to develop practical guidelines that will enable researchers to select the best estimator for a given type of data. It extends a previous study on the subject (Reed and Ye, Which panel data estimator should I use? 2011), and modifies their recommendations. The new recommendations provide a (virtually) complete decision tree: When it comes to choosing an estimator for efficiency, it uses the size of the panel dataset (N and T) to guide the researcher to the best estimator. When it comes to choosing an estimator for hypothesis testing, it identifies one estimator as superior across all the data scenarios included in the study. An unusual finding is that researchers should use different estimators for estimating coefficients and testing hypotheses. The authors present evidence that bootstrapping allows one to use the same estimator for both.","[Moundigbaye, Mantobaye; Rea, William S.] Univ Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Reed, W.

Analysis and summary of previous research results showed that there are a lot of studies testing semi-strong form efficiency in various stock markets, but only a few analysed Baltic stock markets, especially under changing economic situation. This research employed event study methodology - Patell 's, BMP and cumulative abnormal return tests. The chosen research period of 2000-2016 was divided into two sub periods based on changes of 011/IX Baltic Benchmark index: January 2000 - March 2009 and April 2009 - December 2016. The research results showed that Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian stock markets were not efficient in semi-strong form in neither of the sub-periods. The proposition, that thin stock markets are not efficient was confirmed, allowing investors in the Baltic stock markets to earn abnormal returns. In the second sub period the average abnormal returns increased in all analysed markets, potentially due to increased distrust and precaution of investors. Nevertheless, significance of the difference between the levels of inefficiency in both sub periods was partly approved in the Baltic stock markets.","[Alekneviciene, Vilija; Kviedaraitiene, Lauryna] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Univ St 10, LT-53361 Akademija, Lithuania; [Alekneviciute, Egle] Vytautas Magnus Univ, S Daukanto G 28, LT-44246 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University; Vytautas Magnus University,"Alekneviciene, V (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Univ St 10, LT-53361 Akademija, Lithuania.",vilija.alekneviciene@asu.lt; lauryna.kviedaraitiene@gmail.com; egle.alekneviciute@gmail.com,,"Alekneviciene, Vilija/0000-0002-6501-8792",,,,,61,3,7,0,9,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

In addition, household consumption within the same proximity to the camp is 25% higher than in areas farther away.

We employ a Durbin panel model with spatial error. Results prove that spatial interactions affect matching and that the stock-flow model is in some respects superior to others in explaining the job creation process. Unemployment affects matching more than vacancies. The newly unemployed may seek jobs in adjacent regions and can cause congestion there, but vacancies tend to attract workers from adjacent markets and exert positive externalities. Policy actions should be aimed at exploiting spatial interdependencies to improve matching at the regional level by increasing the number of available job offers, improving information, and increasing labour force mobility.","[Antczak, Elzbieta] Univ Lodz, Fac Econ & Sociol, Dept Spatial Econometr, Lodz, Poland; [Galecka-Burdziak, Ewa] Warsaw Sch Econ, Dept Econ 1, Warsaw, Poland; [Pater, Robert] Univ Informat Technol & Management Rzeszow, Dept Econ, Rzeszow, Poland",University of Lodz; Warsaw School of Economics; University of Information Technology & Management Rzeszow,"Galecka-Burdziak, E (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Dept Econ 1, Warsaw, Poland.",ewa.galecka-burdziak@sgh.waw.pl,"Pater, Robert/AAC-7854-2021; Antczak, Elżbieta/K-4872-2019","Pater, Robert/0000-0001-7619-9843; Antczak, Elżbieta/0000-0002-9695-6300",CERGE-EI,CERGE-EI,This work was supported by the CERGE-EI.,,40,4,4,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

We propose a two-way taxonomy based on (a) whether the social group is horizontal (peers at the same level of the hierarchy) or vertical (individuals at different levels within or outside of the organization) and (b) whether the agent's effort creates externalities for the other members of their social group. We show settings in which social incentives improve productivity and settings in which they reduce it. In most cases, the size of the effect is approximately 10%, which is half of the typical effect of performance pay. We also show that social incentives can interfere with financial incentives, making them ineffective or even detrimental. We conclude that social incentives are a powerful motivator that must be taken into account in the design of organizational policies and that more research is needed to understand how policies can shape the preferences that underpin these incentives.","[Ashraf, Nava; Bandiera, Oriana] London Sch Econ, Dept Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Ashraf, Nava; Bandiera, Oriana] Suntory & Toyota Int Ctr Econ & Related Disciplin, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Ashraf, N (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England.;Ashraf, N (通讯作者)，Suntory & Toyota Int Ctr Econ & Related Disciplin, London WC2A 2AE, England.",n.ashraf1@lse.ac.uk; o.bandiera@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,57,46,48,0,36,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4610-2,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

Credit and liquidity risk, as well as supply and demand have often been cited as general factors driving cross-currency basis spreads, however, these spreads may widen beyond what is normally explained by such variables. We suggest market proxies for EUR/USD basis swap spread drivers and build a multiple regression and a cointegration model to explain their significance during three different historical periods of basis widening. The most important drivers of the cross-currency basis spreads appear to be short- and long-term EU.financial sector credit risk indicators, and to a slightly lesser extent, short- and long-term US financial sector credit risk indicators. Another important driver is the market volatility for the short-end basis spread, and the EUR/USD exchange rate for the long-term basis spread, and to a lesser extent, the Fed/ECB balance sheet ratio.","[Baran, Jaroslav] European Stabil Mech, 6a Circuit Foire Int, L-1347 Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Witzany, Jiri] Univ Econ, Fac Finance & Accounting, Dept Banking & Insurance, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Baran, J (通讯作者)，European Stabil Mech, 6a Circuit Foire Int, L-1347 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.",j.baran@esm.europa.eu; witzanyj@vse.cz,"Witzany, Jiri/ABF-4362-2020","Witzany, Jiri/0000-0001-6886-5236",Czech Science Foundation [18-05244S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),The research has been supported by the Czech Science Foundation Grant 18-05244S Innovation Approaches to Credit Risk Management.,,15,1,1,0,0,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

However, attitudes towards working, expectations from a good job and centrality of working are also important determinants in this process. This paper examines the profile of juveniles who seek a career as gendarmerie non-commissioned officers (NCO) in the Turkish Armed Forces and their attitudes and expectations towards working in general within the framework of Meaning of Working (MOW) researches. According to the results of the survey conducted with 500 NCO candidates in Turkey, learning something new, good relations with colleagues and employment guarantee are detected as the main expectations of juveniles who seek a career in military. Results also show that having a job is so important for these young people that they consider having a job even prior to their families.","[Berk, Ugur] Turkish Mil Acad, Def Sci Inst, Ankara, Turkey",Milli Savunma University,"Berk, U (通讯作者)，Turkish Mil Acad, Def Sci Inst, Ankara, Turkey.",ugurberk@gmail.com,,,,,,,48,2,2,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

In order to answer this question we characterize constrained-efficient allocations in an infinite horizon, two-good economy with limited commitment for two market structures, random pairwise meetings and centralized meetings. If agents meet bilaterally, then constrained-efficient allocations specify the highest stationary output level that is incentive feasible, and it is implemented with take-it-or-leave-it offers and not-too-tight solvency constraints. If agents meet in a centralized location, constrained-efficient allocations can be non-stationary, in which case they feature a credit boom followed by stagnation due to too-tight solvency constraints. We also characterize constrained-efficient allocations under partial commitment by the planner. If commitment is low, the economy experiences rare but pronounced credit crunches. If commitment is high, the economy experiences infrequent but large credit booms. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The pattern of decreasing hours with aggregate income holds for both men and women, for adults of all ages and education levels, and along both the extensive and intensive margin. Within countries, hours worked per worker are also decreasing in the individual wage for most countries, though in the richest countries, hours worked are flat or increasing in the wage. One implication of our findings is that aggregate productivity and welfare differences across countries are larger than currently thought.

While the concept of regional resilience to economic shocks is still at the development stage, and the method of measuring regional resilience, which is grounded methodologically and is generally accepted, is still missing, the article presents a unique approach of the authors to the concept of regional resilience to economic shocks including the elaboration of the definition of regional resilience to economic shocks, the description of the capabilities to determine the regional resilience in the Resilio model, the specification of their quantitative and qualitative characteristics, and the introduction of the index of the resilience of regions to economic shocks (Resindicis). The rapid development of the globalization processes poses new challenges to the instruments of economic analysis and strategic planning. Different techniques can be used for obtaining the required information on building the regional resilience-enhancing strategies. Each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages. In order to find out the strengths and the weaknesses of measuring resilience by Resilio, the newly developed index was empirically tested with regard to the data of 10 Lithuanian districts in the period of 2006-2015. The assessment results, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of using the Resilio model are presented in this article. The newly developed Resindicis, introduced in the article, represents an objective for having a convenient tool which could be used for economic analysis, strategic planning and justification of solutions aimed at enhancing regional resilience.","[Bruneckiene, Jurgita; Palekiene, Oksana; Rapsikevicius, Jonas] Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Simanaviciene, Zaneta] Mykolas Romeris Univ, Ate St 20, LT-08303 Vilnius, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology; Mykolas Romeris University,"Bruneckiene, J (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",jurgita.bruneckiene@ktu.lt; oksana.palekiene@ktu.lt; zaneta.simanaviciene@gmail.com; j.rapsikevicius@gmail.com,"Simanaviciene, Zaneta/W-3675-2019; Rapsikevicius, Jonas/AAQ-6215-2020; Simanaviciene, Zaneta/U-7817-2019; Bruneckiene, Jurgita/AAE-4948-2020","Simanaviciene, Zaneta/0000-0001-6008-2405; Bruneckiene, Jurgita/0000-0002-8281-1813",,,,,45,11,11,17,102,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Highspeed internet access via broadband infrastructure has undergone rapid development since the end of the 1990s, thanks to the deployment of both fixed and mobile technologies. The present study investigates the impact of fixed broadband diffusion as a technological determinant of economic growth on the basis of a panel of 23 OECD countries over 15 years (1996-2010). The time horizon chosen is suitable for verification of the causal effect on growth of the transition from traditional copper to partially fibre networks. Through implementation of a dynamic panel by using the generalized method of moments (GMM) combined with an instrumental variable (IV) two-stage approach, we found a positive correlation between broadband diffusion and economic growth, even after controlling for countries initial endowment of information and communication technologies (ICT) and for the years of economic crisis. Our main finding provides evidence, through a continuous time interpretation of our estimations, of a quantitatively relevant relationship between broadband diffusion and economic dynamics in the short, medium and long runs. Our findings may be useful to policy makers in that they permit forecasting of the benefits of further transition from broadband to ultra-wide broadband networks.","[Castaldo, Angelo; Fiorini, Alessandro] Sapienza Univ Rome, Fac Law, Dept Law Philosophy & Econ Studies, Rome, Italy; [Maggi, Bernardo] Sapienza Univ Rome, Fac Engn Informat Informat & Stat, Dept Stat Sci, Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; Sapienza University Rome,"Castaldo, A (通讯作者)，Sapienza Univ Rome, Fac Law, Dept Law Philosophy & Econ Studies, Rome, Italy.",angelo.castaldo@uniroma1.it,,"Castaldo, Angelo/0000-0002-7586-5100",University of Rome La Sapienza; MIUR,"University of Rome La Sapienza; MIUR(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))",We are grateful to the University of Rome La Sapienza and MIUR for funds provided to support this research,,57,26,29,2,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Then, the time-varying conditional correlations are constructed to offer a deeper insight for the relationship of crude oil futures market and Chinese new energy stock market. In addition, a dollar long position of new energy stock could be a hedge with twelve cents short position of crude oil. These empirical findings can be useful to both investors and policy-makers for the current and especially future economic and financial environments.","[Chen, Yufeng] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Coll Business Adm, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yufeng; Li, Wenqi] Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yufeng] Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Ctr Studies Modern Business, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Jin, Xi] NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10044 USA",Capital University of Economics & Business; Zhejiang Gongshang University; Zhejiang Gongshang University; New York University,"Chen, YF (通讯作者)，Capital Univ Econ & Business, Coll Business Adm, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China.;Chen, YF (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.;Chen, YF (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Ctr Studies Modern Business, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",chenyufeng@gmail.com; li.wenqi@outlook.com; jinxi12s@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71673250]; Zhejiang Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars [LR18G030003]; MOE Major Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences in Universities [14JJD770019]; New Century Excellent Talents in University [NCET-13-0996],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Zhejiang Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars; MOE Major Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences in Universities; New Century Excellent Talents in University(Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET)),"The authors are very grateful to the Editor Corina Saman and two anonymous reviewers for their constructive and helpful comments on the earlier version of this research.

Then, we demonstrate how various types of equilibriums may emerge in the short run and the long run depending on various combinations of the parameters of the model. Our model predicts that in the short run equilibriums the levels of output supplied by the home (foreign) firm to the home country market are bigger (smaller) compared to the long-run equilibriums. Therefore, the first mover advantage should be gradually disappearing over time. In addition, our model suggests several empirically testable hypotheses concerning the behavior of total output and prices in the industry after trade and investment liberalization.","[Cieslik, Andrzej] Univ Warsaw, Dept Macroecon & Int Trade Theory, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Cieslik, A (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Dept Macroecon & Int Trade Theory, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw, Poland.",,"Cieslik, Andrzej/AAJ-7497-2020","Cieslik, Andrzej/0000-0002-7834-7384",,,,,36,8,8,1,7,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,2720-5088,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

The deployment experiences of any individual Marine are plausibly random conditional on the observable characteristics which are used to assign Marines into units. Leveraging this exogenous variation, we compare the incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and suicide deaths among Marines who deployed to either Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) or HA/DR missions between 2001 and 2011. We find that the hazard of PTSD is close to eight times higher among Marines returning from OEF/OIF compared to those never deployed, and just 1.33 times higher among those returning from HA/DR (and never participated in OEF/OIF). Those returning from OEF/OIF missions are 1.81 times more likely than those never deployed to die by suicide when they were still active duty, and the hazard increases to almost 3 after they have left the military. In contrast, we find no difference in the hazards of suicide death between those that deployed to only HA/DR missions and non-deployed Marines.","[Cunha, Jesse M.; Shen, Yu-Chu] Naval Postgrad Sch, Monterey, CA 93943 USA; [Cunha, Jesse M.] UC Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA USA; [Shen, Yu-Chu] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Burke, Zachary R.] US Marine Corps, Washington, DC USA",United States Department of Defense; United States Navy; Naval Postgraduate School; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Cunha, JM (通讯作者)，Naval Postgrad Sch, Monterey, CA 93943 USA.",jcunha@nps.edu,,,,,,,23,4,5,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

The authors have developed a macroeconomic model which explains these relations and confirms the occurrence of market failures in agriculture in Poland. The developed model proves the existence of a puzzling exchangeable relation between the real productivity of production factors in agriculture, and agricultural incomes, under conditions of adaptive expectations. It also proves that it is price scissors, not the efficiency of production, that have a dominating influence on incomes in the sector. The authors propose the hypothesis that correction of market mechanisms by government intervention in agriculture is an objective necessity. However, direct subsidies (area payments) do not have a correcting role, but reinforce King's effect.","[Czyzewski, Bazyli; Majchrzak, Adam] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Fac Econ, Dept Educ & Personnel Dev, Al Niepodleglosci 10, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Czyzewski, B (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Fac Econ, Dept Educ & Personnel Dev, Al Niepodleglosci 10, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland.",b.czyzewski@ue.poznan.pl,"Majchrzak, Adam/JEO-9607-2023; Czyżewski, Bazyli/Y-4679-2019","Majchrzak, Adam/0000-0001-6486-0585; Czyzewski, Bazyli/0000-0002-6324-2723",National Science Centre (Poland) [DEC-2013/11/B/HS4/00572],National Science Centre (Poland),"The article was founded under a grant from the National Science Centre (Poland), awarded on the basis of decision no.

What does affect the quality of market information in new product development projects, and how does this quality influence the financial performance of new products? In this paper, we address these questions and hypothesize that sources of information (e.g. customers, competitors) influence the quality of market information, and this quality affects new product financial performance through market predictability as a mediator. We test these hypotheses using data of about 287 new product projects of medium-high and high technology firms from Poland. Our findings indicate that the key sources that influence market information quality are customers and competitors. More intensive collection of market information from these two sources, and especially from customers, will result in this information being of a higher quality. Surprisingly, gathering market information from other market entities (e.g. suppliers, distributors) has no effect on the quality of market information. We also find that an important consequence of high quality market information available in NPD is high new product financial performance. Additionally, market information quality positively influences market predictability that, in turn, has a positive impact on new product performance. Our results support a partial mediation effect of market predictability between the quality of market information and NPD financial performance. Based on these findings, the author discusses the theoretical and managerial implications of this work and proposes paths for future research.","[Dabrowski, Dariusz] Gdansk Univ Technol, Ul G Narutowicza 11-12, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; Gdansk University of Technology,"Dabrowski, D (通讯作者)，Gdansk Univ Technol, Ul G Narutowicza 11-12, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland.",ddab@zie.pg.gda.pl,"Dabrowski, Dariusz/D-9987-2013","Dabrowski, Dariusz/0000-0002-2045-2683","Faculty of Management and Economics, Gdansk University of Technology [DS/020352]","Faculty of Management and Economics, Gdansk University of Technology","This study was performed under the research project 'Sources of market information and its quality and new product success.'

We applied the SYS-GMM estimator to a dynamic standard endogenous growth model which relates economic openness to real per capita income growth. A few key findings emerged from this study. First, economic openness led to increase in real per capita GDP growth in HPAEs and SSA, but not in LAC and SEA. Second, openness to trade accelerated income convergence among countries in SSA, SEA, and HPAEs, however, whereas foreign direct investment inflows accelerated income convergence only in SSA, it rather de-accelerated income convergence in HPAEs. Thirdly, the HPAEs recorded higher positive effect of openness on real per capita GDP growth than any of the other developing regions because they created sufficient stock of human capital that enhanced their absorptive capacity of imported advanced technology. They also created a more stable macroeconomic environment which consolidated the income growth gains from openness. The results of this study highlight the importance of the implementation of policies that are complementary to economic openness in promoting economic growth in the developing world.","[Darku, Alexander Bilson] Univ Lethbridge, Prentice Inst Global Populat & Econ, Lethbridge, AB, Canada; [Darku, Alexander Bilson] Univ Lethbridge, Econ Dept, Lethbridge, AB, Canada; [Yeboah, Richard] Univ Lethbridge, Lethbridge, AB, Canada",University of Lethbridge; University of Lethbridge; University of Lethbridge,"Darku, AB (通讯作者)，Univ Lethbridge, Prentice Inst Global Populat & Econ, Lethbridge, AB, Canada.;Darku, AB (通讯作者)，Univ Lethbridge, Econ Dept, Lethbridge, AB, Canada.",alexander.darku@uleth.ca,"Darku, Alexander B/E-8516-2017",,,,,,54,31,36,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In this paper, we re-evaluate the macroeconomic effects of non-zero trend inflation. Building on the model of Ascari (2004) as one of the most-cited papers in the literature on the effects of trend inflation, we show that the omission of some important theoretical ingredients significantly distorts the results obtained to date. We propose a refinement of this model by introducing two theoretical important ingredients, namely investment adjustment costs, and a roundabout production structure. Once we add these features to make the model more realistic, as commonly for medium-scale models, we find that the standard New Keynesian model without real frictions overestimates the short-term macroeconomic effects of a positive trend inflation rate and underestimates those of the long term.

The transition has mainly been reflected in three dimensions: agriculture, rural areas and farmers. First, agricultural versatility has gradually increased, and the number of participants in leisure agriculture and rural tourism has grown rapidly since 2010. Second, the rural employment rate has risen gradually, and the share of rural employees in the tertiary sector has grown markedly.

Our results indicate that winning a match is not associated with significant return effects for both national teams and individual clubs. In the case of lost matches, we find strong evidence for publication bias, i.e. negative returns are systematically overrepresented causing a biased picture of the true soccer match effect. After correcting for this bias, the mean return after losses by national teams becomes statistically insignificant and accounts for only basis points. In the case of individual clubs, the corrected impact of a loss is a significant basis points effect. In a further analysis, we identify various aspects of study design like regional differences, time period under examination and the design of empirical analysis to be responsible for the wide variation in previous study outcomes. Overall, our findings provide evidence against the hypothesis that stock markets are driven by sports sentiment in the case of national teams. Due to the existence of strong asymmetry in the returns after wins and losses of individual clubs, behavioural explanations cannot be fully ruled out.","[Geyer-Klingeberg, Jerome; Hang, Markus; Rathgeber, Andreas] Univ Augsburg, Inst Mat Resource Management, Augsburg, Germany; [Walter, Matthias] Univ Augsburg, FIM Res Ctr, Augsburg, Germany",University of Augsburg; University of Augsburg,"Geyer-Klingeberg, J; Rathgeber, A (通讯作者)，Univ Augsburg, Inst Mat Resource Management, Augsburg, Germany.",jerome.geyer-klingeberg@mrm.uni-augsburg.de; andreas.rathgeber@mrm.uni-augsburg.de,"Geyer-Klingeberg, Jerome/I-7637-2019","Geyer-Klingeberg, Jerome/0000-0001-6615-7439; Hang, Markus/0000-0003-0204-400X",,,,,87,12,14,2,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The findings indicate that labour linkages weakened between 2002 and 2009, while import linkages became slightly stronger.

The parties differ only in their redistributive preferences, with the left-wing party having a stronger preference for redistribution. Our analysis explicitly considers the possibility that society's preference for redistribution may change, as reflected in its future voting behaviour. The incumbent government respects the possibility that society's preference may change, and sets taxes to maximize expected social welfare. Our main result is that an incumbent left-wing (resp. right-wing) government will implement a regressive ( resp. progressive) savings tax policy. The incumbent government implements this policy not out of self-interest, but to accommodate the redistributive goals of the opposing party.","[Guo, Jang-Ting] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Econ, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Krause, Alan] Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of California System; University of California Riverside; University of York - UK,"Guo, JT (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Econ, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",guojt@ucr.edu; alan.krause@york.ac.uk,"Guo, Jang-Ting/AAY-8365-2021","Guo, Jang-Ting/0000-0001-9948-9691",,,,,44,1,1,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

This paper investigates whether deregulation can be structured through a controlled Mergers and Acquisitions (M&As) process by means of government intervention, and how this promotes the performance of the players in the industry. We study this in the context of the Chinese aviation industry as an ideal microcosm of our problem statement. This is because China's civil aviation industry has witnessed many of the above challenges since its deregulation and economic reforms in 1979, which saw the beginning of a transformation from a fully state-owned machinery to a rent-seeking private sector. The post controlled deregulation process through M&As led to three dominant carriers: Air China Limited (AC), China Southern Airlines (CS), and China Eastern Airlines (CE). Using a 3-player non-cooperative perfect information Cournot oligopoly game model, the strategic efficacy of the government intervention to consolidate the industry based on operating expenses, air passenger revenue, and profit data are investigated respectively. All three airlines are better off after the exercise, with the industry facing a more sustainable growth by the intervention.","[Ignatius, Joshua; Dhamotharan, Lalitha] Univ Warwick, WMG, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Ignatius, Joshua; Tan, Tian Siang] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Math Sci, George Town, Malaysia; [Dhamotharan, Lalitha] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Management, George Town, Malaysia; [Goh, Mark] Natl Univ Singapore, NUS Business Sch, Singapore, Singapore; [Goh, Mark] Natl Univ Singapore, Logist Inst Asia Pacific, Singapore, Singapore",University of Warwick; Universiti Sains Malaysia; Universiti Sains Malaysia; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore,"Ignatius, J (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, WMG, Coventry, W Midlands, England.",joshua_ignatius@hotmail.com,"goh, mark/GQO-8860-2022; Tan, Tian Siang/AAR-1442-2020; goh, mark/AAC-4268-2022","goh, mark/0000-0002-3620-7658; Tan, Tian Siang/0000-0003-3995-1519; goh, mark/0000-0002-3620-7658; Dhamotharan, Lalitha/0000-0001-6367-0819",,,,,37,4,4,2,13,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

The study captures the nature of the socio-economic threats of the climate change and natural disasters, and unearths the process and underlying causes of livelihood resilience among the local communities in the South-East Asian region. Based on a qualitative interpretative meta-synthesis, it finds that a huge number of people in the South-East Asian countries are displaced and migrated from place of origin, and subjected to resettlement elsewhere with manifestly low level of livelihood resilience. This displacement is largely determined by the underlying vulnerability of people to shocks that compel them to leave their homes and livelihoods for mere survival. The article concludes by offering selected policy lessons, and with an exhortation for further research on this relatively less explored subject.","[Islam, M.

Multi-stage models assume that all or at least a certain part of outputs of a stage s serve as the inputs of the next stage s+1. The outputs of the last stage of the model are final outputs of the production process. It is possible to derive the efficiency scores in all particular periods but there are proposed several models attempting to compute aggregated efficiency characteristics over all periods considered.

Economists would abandon instrumentalist orientation where means get all our attention and the ends virtually none, and focus on what is the good life and the good society. The paper advances to that end the value based approach. It focuses on two interventions that seem to be necessary to realize economics as a moral science. One is to redefine economics and the second is to expand the economic understanding of goods. Defining economics as the discipline that studies the realization of values is the first step to perceive economics as a moral science. The next step is the inclusion of shared goods as an economic category. The result is a broader scope of economics, one that allows us to consider the goods and values that are of ultimate importance to people, groups, organizations and societies. The notion of shared good, combined with the notion willingness to contribute furthermore addresses the problem that standard economics has with altruistic behavior. The paper argues that most of our actions are not directed at private gain, or the acquisition of private goods, but at the realization of shared goods.","[Klamer, Arjo] Erasmus Univ, Econ Art & Culture, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Klamer, A (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Econ Art & Culture, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",klamer@eshcc.eur.nl,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,2,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2520-1794,2520-1808,978-3-319-94529-3; 978-3-319-94528-6,VIRTUES ECON,Virtues Econ.,,2018,3.0,,,,,,169,181,,10.1007/978-3-319-94529-3_13,0.0,,,13,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL9EL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000457322400013,0

The respective changes in the rate of convergence and its sensitivities to the central model parameters are derived both analytically and numerically. By normalizing the constant elasticity of substitution (CES) production functions both outside the steady state and within the steady state, it is possible to distinguish between an efficiency and a distribution effect of a change in the elasticity of substitution. We show that monetary policy is the more effective, the lower is the elasticity of substitution, and that the impact of monetary policy on the speed of convergence is mainly channeled via the efficiency effect.","[Klump, Rainer] Univ Luxembourg, 162a Ave Faiencerie, L-1511 Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Jurkat, Anne] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany",University of Luxembourg; Goethe University Frankfurt,"Klump, R (通讯作者)，Univ Luxembourg, 162a Ave Faiencerie, L-1511 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.;Klump, R (通讯作者)，CFS SAFE, House Finance,Theodor W Adorno Pl 3, D-60353 Frankfurt, Germany.",rainer.klump@uni.lu,,,,,,,21,1,1,1,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Towards this end, this study aimed to develop the life-cycle economic and environmental assessment model for establishing the optimal implementation strategy of the rooftop PV system. The robustness and reliability of the developed model were evaluated in terms of two perspectives: (i) for the effectiveness of the optimal solution, the optimization results were generated by considering the regional climate factors and building characteristics. Namely, the results for SIR25 (saving to investment ratio at year 25), which was set at the optimization goal, were 2.540 (Busan, southern part of South Korea), 2.485 (Daejeon, central part of South Korea), and 2.266 (Seoul, northern part of South Korea), respectively; and (ii) for the efficient computation time, the time required for determining the optimal solution was only 27 seconds.

Our findings accord with the market power hypothesis. State ownership strengthens the negative impact of bank competition on the cost of debt, but firm size tends to weaken it.

Existing studies suggest that the marginal revenue product (MRP) of elite collegiate players later drafted into the National Football League (NFL), significantly exceeds their compensation. These comparisons overstate monopsony rents because schools don't know ex ante which prospects will become these elite performers. Using financial data spanning 2004-2011 from 114 major schools, I estimate the MRP of players sorted into three ex post quality tiers, and find that while eventual NFL draftees generate revenue that significantly exceeds their compensation, a majority of scholarship players do not. Then, using Rivals.com talent ratings of 6,604 prospective players recruited from 2002-2008, I estimate the probability that prospects will reach each ex post quality tier given their ex ante ratings. MRP estimates are adjusted by these conditional probability estimates to reflect the expected MRP of prospects, which allows more appropriate assessment of monopsony rents. I find that schools possess substantially less monopsony power than unadjusted MRP estimates suggest.","[Makofske, Matthew Philip] Miami Univ, Dept Econ, Oxford, OH 45056 USA",University System of Ohio; Miami University,"Makofske, MP (通讯作者)，Miami Univ, Dept Econ, Farmer Sch Business 3003, 800 E High St, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.",makofsmp@miamioh.edu,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Alongside compulsory increases in the statutory retirement age, governments have used incentives to encourage workers to postpone voluntarily their exit from employment, deferring their Basic State Pension in exchange for the additional financial reward of an enhanced pension at a later point in time. The impact of pension deferral upon the sustainability of the state pension system is dependent on the interplay of short-term savings from payment delay and increased subsequent longer-term payments to pension recipients. This article presents a model that simulates the financial effect of deferral uptake on the National Insurance Fund over a 40-year projection under alternative scenarios, including current and revised post-2016 deferral incentives. The findings indicate that the recent change in enhancement rate from 10.4 per cent to 5.8 per cent will significantly impact on state pension sustainability while still providing an incentive to defer. We estimate that any reduction below 4 per cent would result in zero uptake of the deferral option, based on a rational financial choice.","[Moizer, Jonathan; Farrar, Sue; Hyde, Mark] Plymouth Univ, Fac Business, Plymouth, Devon, England",University of Plymouth,"Moizer, J (通讯作者)，Plymouth Univ, Fac Business, Plymouth, Devon, England.",jmoizer@plymouth.ac.uk,,"Moizer, Jonathan/0000-0001-7451-378X",,,,,19,5,5,3,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The results stemming from the balance-of-payments-constrained growth model suggest that the magnitude of China's impact was less than 1 percent, although it ranged from the largest to the second largest impact among all trading partners for the three countries. The estimated balance-of-payments growth rate of domestic income is lower than the real growth rate of domestic income. This is because the growth rates of the export volumes were not sufficient even during the commodity boom, on account of the continued increasing trends of income elasticity of demand for imports. Furthermore, the income elasticities of demand for imports from China were especially high. Therefore, the three countries will continue to face further increase in the income elasticity of demand for imports as well as a stagnant growth rate of export volumes. Thus, the balance-of-payments position will continue to be the main growth constraint for these countries.","[Murakami, Yoshimichi] Kobe Univ, RIEB Res Inst Econ & Business Adm, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan; [Hernandez, Rene A.] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile",Kobe University; Universidad de Chile,"Murakami, Y (通讯作者)，Kobe Univ, RIEB Res Inst Econ & Business Adm, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan.",y-murakami@rieb.kobe-u.ac.jp,,"Murakami, Yoshimichi/0000-0001-8385-2871; Hernandez, Rene/0000-0002-0708-1507",,,,,14,11,12,2,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Attempts to describe the actions and decisions of those acting from such motives in the terms of rational choice theory fail, and the model of human conduct which is implicit in the theory is both inadequate in itself and pernicious in its general influence. A picture may emerge of the human person as a repository of atomistic 'experiences', inhabiting a present from the vantage-point of which his relations to past and future 'selves' are contingent, and his responsibilities and commitments correspondingly fluid.

In contrast to previous studies in this area, the analysis focuses on business cycle fluctuations and we control for global supply and demand factors that might affect the real price of oil, its volatility as well as the US economy. We find that - even after accounting for these factors - oil price uncertainty still has a highly significant negative influence on the US business cycle. Our computations show that the effect is economically important during several periods, mostly after a significant variance shift in the mid-1980s. We simultaneously estimate the effect on the global business cycle but find that it is comparatively weak. Finally, significant spillover effects in the GARCH model suggest that oil price volatility is a gauge and channel of transmission of more general macroeconomic shocks and uncertainty. These linkages are particularly strong in case of unexpected bad news.","[Thiem, Christopher] Univ Duisburg Essen, Chair Int Econ, Univ Str 12, D-45117 Essen, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen,"Thiem, C (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Chair Int Econ, Univ Str 12, D-45117 Essen, Germany.",christopher.thiem@vwl.uni-due.de,,,,,,,40,7,7,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In this paper we describe the specific constraints and attractiveness of the PBI within Europe using the SWOT methodology to analyse the information coming from both pilot case studies and the responses that institutional investors and other stakeholders provided to the EC public consultation about the PBI.

We first measure FMD in China's heavy industry sector from 1995 to 2012, and then investigate the effects of resource reallocation from FMD correction by using the price elasticity of factor demands as a link, along with its potential TFP gains. The results indicate that: (1) Taking the price of capital as a reference, the prices of labour and energy in the study period were relatively higher to different extents. (2) If current FMD were fully corrected, the labour input in China's heavy industry sector would increase by 25.37%, whereas capital and energy inputs would decrease by 18.51% and 10.57%, respectively. (3) The resource reallocation effects resulting from current FMD correction will bring about significant TFP improvement (by 8.55%) in China's heavy industry sector, and there are evident industrial differences and stage characteristics for these promoting effects.

Economic actors are grouped into three categories, namely individuals/households, firms, and the state. Among these actors only monetized transactions are considered. The ultimate goal of the economy is defined as maximization of individual income or financial wealth. In the reality of the twenty-first century the working of the economy is far more complex. Economic actors represent diverse types and the monetized transactions are only one from of the interactions among them. The paper suggests that we should consider economic actors such as individuals, organizations, communities, networks, and robots (or algorithms). Among these actors four basic types of interactions can be identified: market exchange, bureaucratic coordination, ethical transaction, and aggressive action. Different types of interactions may be combined but crowding in and crowding out effects may happen among them. For example, market exchange may crowd out ethical coordination. The ultimate goal of the economic system is not to produce material gains but to provide livelihood for those who are involved. Just and sustainable prosperity can be considered as the ultimate goal of the economy against which the performance of any economic system should be measured.","[Zsolnai, Laszlo] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Business Eth Ctr, Budapest, Hungary",Corvinus University Budapest,"Zsolnai, L (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, Business Eth Ctr, Budapest, Hungary.",zsolnai@uni-corvinus.hu,"Zsolnai, Laszlo/ABH-3540-2020","Zsolnai, Laszlo/0000-0002-0213-7778",,,,,22,3,3,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2520-1794,2520-1808,978-3-319-94529-3; 978-3-319-94528-6,VIRTUES ECON,Virtues Econ.,,2018,3.0,,,,,,151,159,,10.1007/978-3-319-94529-3_11,0.0,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL9EL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000457322400011,0

How do home country conditions influence such a decision? This paper uses exogenous exchange rate shocks arising from the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis to distinguish between the motivations of Australian immigrants to return to their home country. A 10 percent favorable shock (a depreciation in a migrant's home country currency) leads to an almost 10 percent reduced likelihood of return in a two year period. The effect is stronger for those with pre-existing intentions to return, weaker for those undecided, and zero for those who initially desired to stay. These results favor a life-cycle explanation for migrant behavior and reject the theory that migrants are target earners who seek to invest upon return home. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Third, instrumental variable (IV) approach explores the determinants of these dimensions. Using a 59-item SEPQ and 506 student responses at a leading Australian university, the study identified four dimensions (Lecturer, Teaching Approach and Contents; Feedback, Communication and Assessment; Active Participation and Engagement; and Presentation, Delivery and Focus) that underpinned expectations and preferences. These dimensions differed due to variables typifying diversity within the student population. Higher school-leaving score (IV) and those aged 20-25 years significantly positively influenced the score for Lecturer, Teaching Approach and Contents. English speaking background (ESB) and economics students strongly preferred Feedback, Communication and Assessment, while male economics students disliked it. The IV and ESB discouraged Active Participation and Engagement while students aged > 25 years were keen on it. Both ESB males and higher IV scores promoted aversion toward Presentation, Delivery and Focus. The findings imply that instructors provide intellectual and analytical rigour; contents incorporating latest developments and relevance to real world issues while School respond to the diverse needs of non-English speaking students.

In stage 1, men and women decide whether to get married foreseeing the power and market dynamics in stage 2. Single people make their own decisions whereas married couples make decisions together, the power distribution among partners is determined endogenously. It is shown that female labor supply can take different shapes due to structural differences between economies and multiple equilibria might occur, causing low female labor force participation trap. As for policy implications, we find that tax-break to the employers can give a huge boost to female employment and may reduce the wage-gap. However, tax-benefit to women may widen the wage-gap although both these policies empower women. We also conclude that true empowerment should come with the freedom of choice (to work); increasing female labor force participation does not necessarily empower women. Results found here resonate well with previous empirical findings and suggest additional testable implications.","[Atal, Vidya] Montclair State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, 427 Partridge Hall,1 Normal Ave, Montclair, NJ 07043 USA",Montclair State University,"Atal, V (通讯作者)，Montclair State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, 427 Partridge Hall,1 Normal Ave, Montclair, NJ 07043 USA.",atalv@mail.montclair.edu,"Atal, Vidya/F-7074-2012",,,,,,36,3,4,3,31,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

While this trend is mainly associated with a decline in wage inequality, progressive reforms of the tax-benefit systems of the region may have played a role. While redistributive systems in Latin America are still in their infancy, they are constantly expanding and do so at different pace in the region. To investigate this point in a comparative way, the present study exploits newly developed tax-benefit microsimulation models for Ecuador and Colombia. These two neighboring countries show contrasted situations in terms of income distribution and we characterize the extent to which this difference is explained by different tax-benefit systems. The comparative nature of our microsimulation models allows us to swap tax-benefit systems between countries to produce counterfactual simulations whereby the system of a country is applied to the population of the other. In this way, we can decompose the total country difference in income distribution to extract the role of different tax-benefit policies. We confirm that the Ecuadorean system is more redistributive and quantify the difference: if the Ecuadorean system was applied to the Colombian population, the Gini coefficient would be reduced by 1.7 points in Colombia. Headcount poverty would decrease by around 10% and the intensity of poverty by up to 14.7%. This analysis contributes to the recent literature on the redistributive role of tax-benefit systems in Latin America and highlights the role of microsimulation techniques to show how countries in the region can learn from each other in order to improve social protection and reduce income inequality.","[Bargain, Olivier] Univ Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France; [Bargain, Olivier] Inst Univ France, Paris, France; [Jara, H.

We use the Davis (1998) version of the HOS model with wage rigidity in a sub-group of countries. We show that trade openness with developing countries reduces LS in rigid wage countries and does not affect IS in free wage countries. This pattern is induced by factor reallocation towards capital-intensive sectors in rigid wage countries. Using the KLEMS dataset for 8 OECD countries over the period 1970-2005, we show that the weight of capital-intensive sectors substantially increased in continental European countries, while it did not change or even decreased in the US and the UK. Fixed effects regressions suggest that trade intensity with China explains between 50% (IV estimates) and 80% (OLS estimates) of the observed differential labor share change between Continental Europe and Anglo-Saxon countries.","[Decreuse, Bruno] Aix Marseille Sch Econ, Marseille, France; [Maarek, Paul] Univ Cergy Pontoise, THEMA, Cergy Pontoise, France",Aix-Marseille Universite; CY Cergy Paris Universite,"Decreuse, B (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Sch Econ, Marseille, France.;Maarek, P (通讯作者)，Univ Cergy Pontoise, THEMA, Cergy Pontoise, France.",decreuse@univmed.fr; paul.maarek@u-cergy.fr,"maarek, paul/HGH-4161-2022","maarek, paul/0000-0001-6593-4179",,,,,34,3,4,1,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0939-3625,1878-5433,,ECON SYST,Econ.

We start by building a steady state model in which households are only subject to uninsurable idiosyncratic risk and evaluate the optimal level of public debt. We then augment the model to allow for aggregate risk and measure the impact on the optimal level. We show that the cyclical behavior of the economy has a quantitative impact on this level that can be decomposed into the effects of the aggregate productivity shock and the cyclicality of unemployment.

We fill this gap by contrasting two answers to the question. One is that the renminbi will assume the role of a global currency similar to the U.S. dollar. Supporters point to China's widely diversified trade and financial flows and to its institutional initiatives, not just in Asia but around the world. The other is that the renminbi will play a regional role in Asia equivalent to that of the euro in Greater Europe. Proponents of this view argue that China has a natural advantage in leveraging regional supply chains and deepening its links with other Asian countries as well as in developing regional institutions.

J,"Glasner, D",,,,"Glasner, David",,,Rules versus discretion in monetary policy historically contemplated,JOURNAL OF MACROECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Monetary policy rules are attempts to cope with the implications of having a medium of exchange whose value exceeds its cost of production. Two classes of monetary rules can be identified: (1) price rules that target the value of money in terms of a real commodity, e.g., gold, or in terms of some index of prices, and (2) quantity rules that target the quantity of money in circulation. Historically, price rules, e.g. the gold standard, have predominated, but the Bank Charter Act of 1844 imposed a quantity rule as an adjunct to the gold standard, because the gold standard had performed unsatisfactorily after being restored in Britain at the close of the Napoleonic Wars. A quantity rule was not proposed independently of a price rule until Henry Simons proposed a constant money supply consisting of government-issued fiat currency and deposits issued by banks operating on a 100% reserve basis. Simons argued that such a plan would be ideal if it could be implemented because it would deprive the monetary authority of any discretionary decision-making power. Nevertheless, Simons concluded that such a plan was impractical and supported a price rule to stabilize the price level. Simons's student Milton Friedman revived Simons's argument against discretion and modified Simons's plan for 100% reserve banking and a constant money supply into his k% rule for monetary growth. This paper examines the doctrinal and ideological origins and background that lay behind the rules versus discretion distinction.

Subsequent literature for the most part kept imperfect competition but jettisoned oligopoly. Instead, as the heterogeneous firms literature burgeoned in the 2000s, monopolistic competition quickly became established as the workhorse model. The use of oligopoly in trade models has been criticized for reasons that we argue are unpersuasive. Renewed incorporation of oligopolistic firms in international trade is warranted. Quantitative investigations of welfare effects of trade policy should again address the impact of such policies on the allocation of profits across countries.","[Head, Keith] Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Spencer, Barbara J.] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Spencer, Barbara J.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Spencer, BJ (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.;Spencer, BJ (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",barbara.spencer@sauder.ubc.ca,,"Spencer, Barbara/0000-0001-7636-2831",,,,,89,31,35,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

Home, by implementing the reform, induces government responses where labor income is taxed in Home and mostly subsidized in Foreign. In addition, post-reform price dynamics reduce Home's wealth and suppress households' ability to do consumption smoothing, with negative effects on the majority particularly on the poor. In turn, Foreign accumulates wealth, and price movements work particularly in favor of the poor. As a result, a large majority in Home prefers the status quo whereas Foreign supports the reform unanimously. These findings are robust to alternative scenarios where (i) the borrowing constraints are relaxed, (ii) both countries jointly eliminate capital income taxes, (iii) foreign interest income is taxed, and (iv) Home capital income tax is reduced from 40% to 35%.

Contagion is viewed as the occurrence of extreme events taking place in different countries simultaneously and is assessed with a measure of asymptotic tail dependence among the studied distributions. Currency crisis contagion is one strand of this research. However, the main aim of the paper is to examine the potential of bubble contagion. To this end the representative exchange rates are linked to their fundamentals using a cointegration approach. Given the long-time range required by cointegration testing, the variables are first tested for unit roots with structural breaks, whose existence is supported by these tests. In the sequel, the extreme values of the differences between actual daily exchange rates and their monthly equilibrium values determine the episodes associated with large departures from equilibrium. Using tools from Extreme Value Theory, we analyse the transmission of both standard crisis and bubble formation events in the examined currency markets. The results reveal a significant potential for contagion in the currency markets of Central Europe.","[Kadlcakova, Narcisa; Komarek, Lubos] Czech Natl Bank, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech National Bank,"Kadlcáková, N (通讯作者)，Czech Natl Bank, Prague, Czech Republic.",narcisakad@yahoo.com; lubos.komarek@cnb.cz,"Komarek, Lubos/E-9748-2018",,Czech Science Foundation (GA CR Grants) [16-21503],Czech Science Foundation (GA CR Grants),The research was supported by the Czech Science Foundation (GA CR Grants No. 16-21503).,,21,3,3,0,5,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

This new order type differs from standard limit orders in two ways. First, orders to buy and sell represent flows of shares over time rather than stocks of shares available for immediate purchase or sale. Second, orders are expressed as continuous piecewise linear functions relating price to quantity rather than step functions defined on a discrete grid of prices and quantities. Continuous scaled limit orders implement Fischer Black's vision of traders limiting temporary price impact by trading gradually over time. They dramatically lessen the rents high-frequency traders earn from the current market design. The proposal is compatible with frequent batch auctions and random time delays.","[Kyle, Albert S.] Univ Maryland, Robert H Smith Sch Business, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Lee, Jeongmin] Washington Univ, Olin Business Sch, St Louis, MO 63130 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Washington University (WUSTL),"Kyle, AS (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Robert H Smith Sch Business, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",akyle@rhsmith.umd.edu; jlee89@wustl.edu,"Lee, Mina/GZM-3199-2022",,,,,,26,18,20,3,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Both national accounts and productivity analysis would be better served by meeting the data needs of productivity analysis through satellite systems. It is recommended that the movement towards increased recognition of capital formation of knowledge in the core system of national accounts be halted.

Previous research has mainly considered FDI spillover effects within a closed area. Few studies have investigated how the technological upgrading of one area is influenced by the FDI in nearby regions. This paper therefore explores how the time-based characteristics of FDI, namely the pace and rhythm of FDI expansion, influence technological upgrading within and across cities. Using the panel data of 244 Chinese cities for the period from 2004 to 2011, our empirical results show that FDI spillovers have a positive effect on local technological upgrading in both local and neighbouring cities. Irregular FDI expansion negatively moderates FDI spillovers in the same city, but exhibits a positive effect on technological upgrading in neighbouring regions. Moreover, only rapid FDI expansion in neighbouring cities has a positive effect on local technological upgrading and can enhance its technological spillover effects across cities. Our empirical evidence provides implications for both the theoretical framework and policy making. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Inc.

The present study uses individual-level data to test the hypothesis that nostalgia influences the level of happiness of Japanese people. Its key findings were: (i) the number of wins by a prefecture team increased the happiness level of its residents; (ii) this effect applied only to residents of large cities; and (iii) for urban migrants, originally from rural areas, the effect of their home team wins exceeded that of the wins of their host area team. This effect was significant in cases where the host area cultural climate differed from that of the migrant home area.

It finds that unemployment benefits play an important role in the cyclical movement of unemployment through their effects on labor demand, a channel overlooked in previous studies. From the second half of 2008 to 2011, extended unemployment benefits may have increased the overall unemployment rate by one percentage point. In contrast, matching efficiency changes had less effect on the cyclical movement of unemployment for the same period, but significantly slowed down the recovery after 2012.","[Zhang, Ji] Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University,"Zhang, J (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, PBC Sch Finance, 43 Chengfu Rd, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhangji@pbcsf.tsinghua.edu.cn,,,,,,,22,5,7,3,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Our method is based on revealed preference theory. It measures willingness-to-pay for others' consumption and willingness-to-pay for equality in consumption by evaluating consumption externalities in monetary terms. We introduce an altruism parameter and an inequality aversion parameter. Each parameter defines a continuum of models characterized by varying degrees of externalities. We study the empirical performance of our method through a simulation analysis, in which we also investigate the impact of measurement error and increased sample size. Finally, we use our method to analyze decisions made by dyads of children in an experimental setting. We find that children's decisions are particularly characterized by varying levels of altruism.

Using a panel factor-augmented VAR analysis, we then investigate EME responses to shocks to GL momenta. A positive shock to policy-driven liquidity boosts growth in EMEs, elevating stock prices and currency values, while a shock to risk averseness has a largely opposite effect. A market-driven GL expansion boosts stock markets and lowers funding costs, increasing competitiveness and current account balance.

It is necessary, at this point, to promote mass consumption by expanding the middle-income group. The present paper puts forward the concept of the double middle-income traps. This refers to the situation in which an economy's per capita output stagnates and the size of the middle-income group is unable to expand for an extended period of time. These two factors are closely related. Based on data from the Chinese Social Survey conducted by the Institute of Sociology at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the present paper analyzes the scale and development of middle-income groups, and the relationship among middle-income groups, the middle-class and middle-class identity. The marginal consumption propensities of middle-income groups are also considered. The findings of the paper indicate that the expansion of the middle-income group plays an important role in promoting mass consumption, maintaining continuous and stable economic growth, and overcoming the double middle-income traps.","[Li, Peilin] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst Sociol, Beijing, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Li, PL (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst Sociol, Beijing, Peoples R China.",Lipl@cass.org.cn,,,,,,,20,2,2,9,66,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,NOV-DEC,2017,25.0,6,,,,,28,44,,10.1111/cwe.12219,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FM8VN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000415369600002,0

Using a large data set of 122 countries over the 1999 to 2007 period, we find that the well established negative correlation between political stability and inflation holds only if the size of the shadow economy remains modest; and it ceases to exist at higher levels of the size of the informal sector. This finding contributes to the existing literature on public finance that assigns special importance to political determinants of inflation. The results are robust against alternative specifications and satisfy the usual assumptions of a valid statistical inference.","[Mazhar, Ummad] Lahore Univ Management Sci, Suleman Dawood Sch Business, DHA, Lahore Cantt 54792, Pakistan; [Jafri, Juvaria] City Univ London, Sch Arts & Social Sci, London EC1V 0HB, England",Lahore University of Management Sciences; City University London,"Mazhar, U (通讯作者)，Lahore Univ Management Sci, Suleman Dawood Sch Business, DHA, Lahore Cantt 54792, Pakistan.",umadmazhar@gmail.com; juvaria.jafri@city.ac.uk,"Mazhar, Ummad/D-4390-2015","Jafri, Juvaria/0000-0002-4457-5098",,,,,54,5,5,1,12,UNIV CEMA,BUENOS AIRES,"AV CORDOBA 374, BUENOS AIRES, C1054AAP, ARGENTINA",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

This justifies, in part, strategies in the literature to use cross-sectional moments for the calibration of heteroscedasticity. At the same time, the cross-sectional dispersion of investment is procyclical, suggesting a nonsmooth capital adjustment friction at the micro level. There is substantial dispersion in within-firm volatility, a feature consistent with a recent literature on information frictions at the firm-level.

We find that oil return volatility serves as a strong predictor of industry momentum, even after controlling for stock market state, volatility and key macroeconomic variables. We argue that the predictive ability of oil over momentum payoffs is driven by time-varying investor sentiment that relates to excess buying pressure on winner stocks during uncertain times, captured by oil return volatility. Our tests also show that an oil-based momentum strategy wherein the investor conditions the trade on the state of oil return volatility yields significant abnormal returns, more than double that could be obtained from the conventional momentum strategy. In short, the findings suggest that oil market dynamics can contribute to stock market inefficiencies in such a way that these inefficiencies create significant abnormal profits for active managers.

Tax reforms have been attempted but without significant gains in revenue collection. Due to the recalcitrance of tax revenues, the tax authority attempted to enlist voluntary compliance, as one of the avenues for its efforts to increase collections. This paper examines the effectiveness of mass media campaigns in the TV and national newspapers used by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) of Pakistan to increase awareness, tax filing, and, ultimately, tax morale. We use survey data that were collected in 2014 immediately after these mass media campaigns by the FBR. Using coarsened exact matching, we construct treatment and control groups that are nearly identical in terms of pretreatment balance of demographic and behavioral predictors of high tax morale. We find improved perceptions towards tax compliance in Pakistan for respondents exposed to the TV and newspaper advertisements. The choice of the advertisement's delivery device is important since the latter is more effective. Our findings provide empirical evidence that well-timed mass media campaigns can enhance voluntary tax compliance. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

A Statistical Decision Problem,REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Sample design; statistical decision theory; minimax regret; missing data; point prediction,NONRESPONSE RATES; DATA MARKETS; SELECTION; SIZE; BIAS,"When designing data collection, crucial questions arise regarding how much data to collect and how much effort to expend to enhance the quality of the collected data. To make choice of sample design a coherent subject of study, it is desirable to specify an explicit decision problem. We use theWald framework of statistical decision theory to study allocation of a budget between two or more sampling processes. These processes all draw random samples from a population of interest and aim to collect data that are informative about the sample realizations of an outcome. They differ in the cost of data collection and the quality of the data obtained. One may incur lower cost per sample member but yield lower data quality than another. Increasing the allocation of budget to a low-cost process yields more data, while increasing the allocation to a high-cost process yields better data. We initially view the concept of better data abstractly and then fix attention on two important cases. In both cases, a high-cost sampling process accurately measures the outcome of each sample member. The cases differ in the data yielded by a low-cost process. In one, the low-cost process has non-response and in the other it provides a low-resolution interval measure of each sample member's outcome. In these settings, we study minimax-regret sample design for prediction of a real-valued outcome under square loss; that is, design which minimizes maximum mean square error. The analysis imposes no assumptions that restrict the unobserved outcomes. Hence, the decision maker must cope with both the statistical imprecision of finite samples and the partial identification of the true state of nature.","[Dominitz, Jeff] Resolut Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90067 USA; [Manski, Charles F.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Manski, Charles F.] Northwestern Univ, Inst Policy Res, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University; Northwestern University,"Dominitz, J (通讯作者)，Resolut Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90067 USA.",,"Manski, Charles/AAV-7497-2021",,"National Science Foundation [SES-1129475]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1129475] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",Manski's research was supported in part by National Science Foundation grant SES-1129475.

We set up a model of occupational choice where individuals have primary, secondary or tertiary education. A more educated work force raises firm size and productivity. More educated workers earn higher wages, and hence among educated individuals only the more able become entrepreneurs. We find that within the framework of our model, different educational attainments can explain one third of the difference in average firm size between the US and Mexico.

The main result of the paper is that apart from a low distance to the location of the parent company the attractiveness of a Czech district for German investors is mainly driven by agglomeration economies. Besides localization economies the agglomeration of German companies in a region plays a decisive role.

We find that inter-industry labor flows are highly concentrated in just a handful of industry pairs. Consequently, labor flows connect industries in a sparse network. We interpret this network as an expression of industries similarities in human capital requirements, or skill relatedness. This skill-relatedness network is stable overtime, similar for different types of workers and independent of whether workers switch jobs locally or over larger distances. Moreover, in an application to regional diversification and local industry growth, skill relatedness proves to be more predictive than colocation or value chain relations.

This paper assesses ex ante the effects of free riding on the cost-effectiveness of a rebate program that promotes the adoption of energy-efficient heating systems, relying on contingent valuation choice experiments carried out through identical representative surveys in eight EU Members States. The analysis distinguishes between strong and weak free riders: strong free riders already plan to adopt a new heating system in the next five years; weak free riders decide to purchase once propositioned with an attractive technology package (and therefore do not require a rebate to adopt). The reservation rebates for incentivized adopters (those who decide to adopt because of a rebate) differ substantially across countries. On average, they amount to approximately 40% of the heating system's purchasing price, suggesting generally high opportunity costs for premature upgrades. The reservation rebate and weak free-ridership vary with income, risk and time preferences, and environmental identity. At a rebate level that corresponds to half the purchase price of the offered heating system, the estimated share of free riders exceeded 50% for most countries, with a typically higher share of weak free riders than strong free riders. Specific rebate cost estimates (in sic/tCO(2)) differ considerably across countries, suggesting that cooperation can yield budgetary benefits. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Using the gravity approach and a difference-in-differences (DID) empirical strategy, the results reveal the importance of properly controlling for heterogeneity. The euro's effect on the performance of exporting firms is estimated not to be statistically significant when considering eurozone destination markets as a whole. Nevertheless, an increase of flows to 'peripheral' eurozone countries is channelled through the intensive margin. When heterogeneity in terms of firm-level labour-productivity is controlled for, a competition effect emerges in core markets, with a reduction of the intensive margin for less productive firms and an increase for the more productive ones. Finally, more financial contrained firms decreased the extensive margin in core markets, regardless of their productivity level.","[Pappalardo, Carmine] UPB, Italian Parliamentary Budget Off, Rome, Italy; [Vicarelli, Claudio] Italian Natl Inst Stat ISTAT, Via Tuscolana 1788, I-00173 Rome, Italy",,"Vicarelli, C (通讯作者)，Italian Natl Inst Stat ISTAT, Via Tuscolana 1788, I-00173 Rome, Italy.",cvicarelli@istat.it,,,,,,,37,4,4,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

We design a laboratory experiment to study individual behavior in Tullock (lottery) contests with group size uncertainty. There is a fixed pool of n potential players, each with independent probability q is an element of (0, 1] of participating. We independently manipulate each of the parameters and test the implied comparative statics predictions. Our results provide considerable support for the theory, both in terms of comparative statics and point predictions. Most surprisingly, we find no evidence of overbidding in treatments where there is a nontrivial probability that group size is one. This stands in stark contrast to the robust overbidding observed in experimental contests with deterministic group size. We propose a one-parameter model that incorporates nonlinear probability weighting and a modified version of joy of winning, which we call Constant Winning Aspirations (CWA), and show that it neatly organizes all of our results.

J,"Chattaraj, S; Walton, M",,,,"Chattaraj, Shahana; Walton, Michael",,,Functional dysfunction: Mumbai's political economy of rent sharing,OXFORD REVIEW OF ECONOMIC POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,India urban politics; urban governance; Mumbai; urban political economy; informal governance; informal institutions; urban development regulation,,"This paper presents a conceptual account of urban governance in Mumbai as a rent-sharing system based fundamentally on control over urban space. We use rents in the economic sense, of returns that exceed what would be available in a competitive market. Formal rules and policies, which are 'flexibly' enforced, form the underlying basis for the generation of rents. Rent creation and sharing is not solely concerned with corruption or patronage. We rather argue that the system is functional for Mumbai-it does work in the organization of economic and social life in the city. This includes areas where no formal market exists, such as the use of pavements for street vending. The system also helps address commitment problems in the multifarious transactions, many of which are informal, that underpin the economy of the city, by providing a measure of stability and predictability in an uncertain legal environment. However, while the system is both resilient and functional, it thwarts prospects for transformative change.","[Chattaraj, Shahana] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Walton, Michael] Harvard Kennedy Sch, Cambridge, MA USA; [Walton, Michael] Ctr Policy Res, New Delhi, India",University of Sheffield; Harvard University,"Chattaraj, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",s.chattaraj@sheffield.ac.uk; michael_walton@hks.harvard.edu,,,,,,,44,5,5,0,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.
