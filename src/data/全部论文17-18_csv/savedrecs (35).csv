The PMC reform abolished the subordinate fiscal relationship between prefectures and counties and transferred much of the tax and spending authority from the prefecture to the county level. Exploiting a county-level panel data set over 2001-11, we find that the reform has led to a significant increase in the GDP growth rate. The effect is considerably more pronounced in regions with superior initial institutional quality. We also identify channels: the PMC reform induced county governments to exert lower tax burdens on firms and increase spending on infrastructure construction.","[Ma, Guangrong] Renmin Univ China, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Mao, Jie] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; University of International Business & Economics,"Ma, GR (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China.",grma@ruc.edu.cn; maojie@uibe.edu.cn,,,,,,,76,30,32,9,83,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

For youth today, an important marker of adulthood is self-actualization in their professional career, and, consequently, also the achievement of stable financial conditions. Economic conditions of youth are greatly subject to fluctuations in the economy, and the subsequent governmental response. Using the Luxembourg Income Study, this work investigates the trends in income from work of young adults before and after the Great Recession of 2008 in five countries-US, UK, Norway, Germany, and Spain. The findings showed deterioration in economic conditions of young men, but with differences across countries. Young women suffered less from the crisis, and in some countries, their economic situation improved. The general negative trend was especially pronounced for those with high education, which is primarily because they stayed in education longer.","[Sironi, Maria] UCL, Dept Social Sci, 55-59 Gordon Sq, London WC1H 0NU, England",University of London; University College London,"Sironi, M (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Social Sci, 55-59 Gordon Sq, London WC1H 0NU, England.",m.sironi@ucl.ac.uk,,"Sironi, Maria/0000-0002-8005-7255",,,,,68,31,40,0,13,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

This paper discusses some recent developments bringing key characteristics of real firms into the analysis of tax systems, which include enforcement rules and remittance regimes alongside tax rates and bases. Introducing more realistic firms into the analysis of tax systems has enabled progress in understanding the role of information in tax administration, the tradeoff between production efficiency and minimizing the administrative costs of tax collection, the consequences of remittance responsibility, and the fundamental role of firm heterogeneity in tax incidence.","[Slemrod, Joel; Boning, William C.] Univ Michigan, 611 Tappan Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Slemrod, J (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, 611 Tappan Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",jslemrod@umich.edu; wcboning@umich.edu,"Slemrod, Joel/AAJ-5709-2020",,,,,,27,0,0,1,11,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,1614-0974,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,MAR,2018,74.0,1,,,,,131,143,,10.1628/fa-2018-0002,0.0,,,13,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GB6ES,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000429162500008,0

Real economic linkages such as trade between the Visegrad group as important trading partner to the GIIPS countries might have led to this increase in sovereign credit risk due to contagion during the sovereign debt crisis period. We aim to analyse whether contagion led to higher sovereign risk in the Visegrad group and furthermore, whether the economic adjustment programmes (EAPs) by the Troika have been able to stabilise and reduce sovereign risk. We analyse 30-min intraday credit default swaps (CDS) data prior to the sovereign debt crisis period (2008-Oct. 2009) and during the sovereign debt crisis period (Oct. 2009-2011). By using a panel VAR methodology we find rather comovement effects in the Visegrad group member countries as they have been only marginally affected by the turmoil in the peripheral countries during the sovereign debt crisis. In contrast, we find strong contagion effects amongst the GIIPS countries in our sample. From an event study, we find that the EAPs have been essential for the GIIPS countries in terms of reducing contagion and sovereign risk across the euro area while the Visegrad group only reacted with a moderate reduction.","[Ters, Kristyna] Univ Basel, Basel, Switzerland; [Urban, Jorg] Bank Int Settlements, Basel, Switzerland",University of Basel; Bank for International Settlements (BIS),"Urban, J (通讯作者)，Bank Int Settlements, Basel, Switzerland.",kristyna.ters@unibas.ch; joerg.urban@unibas.ch,,"Ters, Kristyna/0000-0002-1447-0906",Swiss National Science Foundation [PMPDP1-158369]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [PMPDP1_158369] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF),Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),The authors thank Matteo Ciccarelli and Leonardo Gambacorta for useful discussions and comments.

Economic theory delivers important guidance for long-run investment opportunities. Specifically, incorporating prior information from the habit formation or prospect theory models reinforces beliefs in mean reversion and inferences that stocks are safer over longer horizons. Conversely, investors with long-run risk priors perceive weaker mean reversion and riskier equities.

Since this type of research does not have large samples, the relevant variables were selected via Sala-i-Martin's (1997) test. The results, estimated using Poisson models, revealed that Brazil and Argentina are influenced by macroeconomic factors. However, the traditional (aggregated) models tend to minimize this influence on Brazil and overestimate it on Argentina. We also found that domestic and foreign income growth, exchange rate devaluation, and a reduction in domestic prices could reduce the number of AD cases in both countries. Therefore, there is evidence that these countries are using the AD law as a political tool, shifting it from its main objective of avoiding unfair trade.","[Couto Firme, Vinicius de Azevedo; Foffano Vasconcelos, Claudio R.; de Mattos, Rogerio Silva] Univ Fed Juiz de Fora, Juiz De Fora, MG, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora,"Firme, VDC (通讯作者)，Fed Univ Juiz de Fora UFJF GV, Dept Econ, Machado Sobrinho St 262, BR-36026380 Juiz De Fora, MG, Brazil.",firmez@ig.com.br,"Firme, Vinicius/N-1593-2017","Firme, Vinicius/0000-0001-9644-1000",,,,,34,1,1,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Sustainability standards, such as Fairtrade, play an important role in agri-food markets of horticultural produce and may be a tool to address these concerns. However, so far the implications of Fairtrade certification for extrinsic and intrinsic employment factors of hired labor on large-scale plantations remain hardly understood. In this paper we assess its effect on workers' hourly wages and their level of job satisfaction with primary survey data from 325 randomly sampled workers from eight different export-oriented pineapple companies in Ghana. We apply a linear, linear mixed model, and instrumental variable approach to take into account the multi-level characteristics of our data and possible selection bias. Our findings show that both hourly wages and job satisfaction are indeed higher on Fairtrade-certified plantations. Factors of increased job satisfaction are likely driven by higher wages, permanent employment contracts, training opportunities, company services such as medical care and paid leave as well as established labor unions on Fairtrade-certified plantations.

Since 2004, SEC requires all U.S. mutual funds to disclose their portfolio holdings on a quarterly basis from semi-annual previously. This change in regulation provides a natural setting to study the impact of frequency of disclosure on performance of mutual funds. Prior to the policy change, we find that successful semi-annual funds outperform successful quarterly funds by 17-20 basis points a month. After 2004, their performance goes down and they no longer outperform successful quarterly funds. This reduction in performance is higher for semi-annual funds holding illiquid assets. These results support our hypothesis that the performance of funds with more frequent disclosure, particularly of those holding illiquid assets, suffer more from front running activities. We also find complementary evidence that the profitability of a hypothetical front running strategy based on public disclosures goes up with the frequency of portfolio disclosures.

Fixed-effects regressions are performed with German Socio-Economic Panel data (1984-2012) to investigate how a labor market switch from paid employment to self-employment influences life, work, and leisure satisfaction. The results indicate that switching to self-employment benefits work satisfaction but not life satisfaction. The benefits for work satisfaction are pronounced and relatively persistent but accompany large and persistent decreases in leisure satisfaction. Life satisfaction for the switchers to self-employment is consequently on par with the life satisfaction of the non-switchers. Contrasting the switch to self-employment (out of paid employment) with the switch to paid employment (out of self-employment) shows that the detrimental effect on leisure satisfaction distinguishes a switch to self-employment from a switch to paid employment. In conclusion, the results explain why increases in life satisfaction are generally absent for individuals switching to self-employment and why undetermined evidence has been found in previous studies in terms of gains in life satisfaction.

It is one of the priority food crops necessary for improved food security and poverty reduction in Nigeria. The study investigated the determinants of food security and technical efficiency of cassava fanners in Ondo State, Nigeria using Food Security index, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Heckman probit model. The study used primary data and a multistage sampling technique was used to randomly select 120 respondents. Findings revealed that 43% of the respondents were food secured. The shortfall and surplus indices were 0.13 and 0.20 respectively. DEA results indicated that about 80% of the respondents had technical efficiency above 0.50 while the average technical efficiency was 0.83. The results of Heckman probit model also showed that farming experience, education, age, cassava output, number of dependants, access to credit, access to extension agent, distance to farm and farm size were the factors that influenced technical efficiency and food security in the study area. It is therefore concluded that improving technical efficiency of the cassava fanners will be an antidote to the problem of food insecurity in the area. This can be achieved by improving agricultural extension services as well as the educational background of the farmers to strengthen the activities of the Agricultural Credit Schemes policy to grant more loans to farmers at a low interest rate for increased productivity and subsequent increase in technical efficiency thereby improving food security further in Ondo State.","[Ajayi, Clementina Oluwafunke] Fed Univ Technol Akure, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, POB 704, Akure, Ondo State, Nigeria; [Olutumise, Adewale Isaac] Adekunle Ajasin Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Extens, POB 001, Akungba Akoko, Ondo State, Nigeria",,"Olutumise, AI (通讯作者)，Adekunle Ajasin Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Extens, POB 001, Akungba Akoko, Ondo State, Nigeria.",firstwalefat@yahoo.com,"Olutumise, Adewale Isaac/AAT-7457-2020; Olutumise, Adewale Isaac/M-4644-2018","Olutumise, Adewale Isaac/0000-0003-4600-9265; Olutumise, Adewale Isaac/0000-0003-4600-9265",,,,,48,12,13,1,10,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

It is because students' interest in islamicpreneur is the source for the birth of Islamic entrepreneurs in the future. Based on the previous research, entrepreneurial interest is influenced by among others, family enviroment and religiousity level. Therefore this research aims to analyze and predict the influence of family enviroment and religiousity toward students interests in islamicpreneur.

Financial instruments may be used for investment or financial purposes as well as an hedging instrument protecting against various types of risk (including price risk) and for stabilizing financial results. A particular challenge of modern accounting is the correct valuation of financial instruments, their identification and presentation in the financial statements to follow the accounting rules, in particular the principle of a faithful and reliable image. The constantly developing international markets, the growth of economic development and international exchange are the reason for changes also in the scope of classification and valuation of financial instruments in the accounting standards. This is particularly evident in the banking sector, in which the implementation of IFRS 9 (instead of IAS 39) from 1 January 2018 resulted in tremendous changes in some positions in the financial statements of individual banks operating on the Polish market.

Yet despite an extensive literature exploring the effects of conservation on human livelihoods, there is a lack of robust evidence about which type of conservation intervention works, for whom, and how. This is partly because the social impacts of conservation interventions often affect multiple aspects of human well-being, with changes taking place over long periods during which unintended feedbacks can occur. This paper assesses the medium-term impacts of Protected Areas (PAs) and of three Payment for Environmental Services (PES) projects on three socio-economic indicators across 16 villages in Northern Cambodia. We present a multi-period evaluation including three panel surveys over six years from villages inside and outside PAs to clarify the mechanisms through which social effects of conservation take place and how this translates into the development pathways adopted by households. While livelihood improvements were recorded across all villages, we found that PAs slightly reduce households' socio-economic status, though does not impede their development. PAs also protect traditional livelihoods. Participants in one of the three PES projects recorded higher economic status and agricultural productivity than non-participants, suggesting that there can be important social co-benefits to conservation interventions when programs are well-designed to respond to local contexts.

However, little is known about the effects of such updates on crowd participation. We investigate this question by using hand-collected data from 71 funding campaigns and 39,399 investment decisions on two German equity crowdfunding portals. Using a combination of different empirical research techniques, we find that posting an update has a significant positive effect on the number of investments made by the crowd and the investment amount collected by the start-up. This effect does not occur immediately in its entirety; rather, it lags the update by a few days. Furthermore, the effect of updates loses statistical significance with the number of updates posted during a campaign. We also find that an easier language used in updates increases crowd participation, whereas the length of updates has no effects. With respect to the update's content, we find that the positive effect can be attributed to updates about new developments of the start-up such as campaign developments, new funding, business developments, and cooperation projects. Updates on the start-up team, business model, product developments, and promotional campaigns do not have meaningful effects. Our paper contributes to the literature on the effects of information disclosure on equity crowdfunding participation. Furthermore, our results have practical implications for start-ups and their investor communication during equity crowdfunding campaigns.","[Block, Joern; Moritz, Alexandra] Univ Trier, Dept Management, Univ Ring 15, D-54296 Trier, Germany; [Block, Joern] Erasmus Univ, Dept Appl Econ, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Block, Joern] Erasmus Univ, ERIM, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Hornuf, Lars] Univ Trier, Dept Econ, Behringstr 21, D-54296 Trier, Germany; [Hornuf, Lars] Max Planck Inst Innovat & Competit, Marstallpl 1, D-80539 Munich, Germany",Universitat Trier; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Universitat Trier,"Hornuf, L (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Innovat & Competit, Marstallpl 1, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",block@uni-trier.de; lars.hornuf@ip.mpg.de; moritz@uni-trier.de,"Hornuf, Lars/AAF-7986-2020; Block, Joern/K-2208-2016; Kolisnyk, Mykyta/HTT-4095-2023; Dunbar, Rod/C-2570-2012","Hornuf, Lars/0000-0002-0576-7759; Block, Joern/0000-0003-4564-0346;",Max Planck Society; German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) [HO 5296/1-1],Max Planck Society(Max Planck Society); German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"Open access funding was provided by the Max Planck Society.

It gives an insight into methods developed for estimating efficiency and possible constraints of the analysis. Literature review of related papers covering European Union and OECD countries shows significant differences in efficiency coefficients across countries with most countries having the potential for increased efficiency of public spending. Specifically, there is large space for reduction of government size by raising the efficiency. The literature includes the aggregate expenditure efficiency analysis and efficiency analysis of its main components. More disaggregated analysis of individual public functions seems to be more adequate to capture the efficiency and determine the main drivers of inefficiency and draw policy implications. In that respect, the paper gives an insight into the structure of government expenditure by function across EU countries and its changes over the period 2002-2015. Differences in tradition and priorities in financing public goods and services can be noted between countries.

Predictability of herding behavior has been successfully modeled by applying 7 data mining models using various measures of performance. Market regulators may consider our findings to regulate the foreign institutional investors trading to make the financial system more transparent and robust.,"[Chattopadhyay, Manojit; Mitra, Subrata Kumar] Indian Inst Management Raipur, Raipur, Madhya Pradesh, India; [Garg, Ashish Kumar] Indian Inst Management Kashipur, Kashipur, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Raipur; Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Kashipur,"Chattopadhyay, M (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Management Raipur, Informat Technol Area, GEC Campus, Raipur 492015, Madhya Pradesh, India.",jitmano2011@gmail.com,"Kumar, Ashish/GQH-1988-2022; Kumar, Ashish/AAH-5246-2020","Kumar, Ashish/0000-0002-4567-8443; Kumar, Ashish/0000-0002-4567-8443",,,,,106,8,8,1,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

We build on, and extend, the role of bank-appointed directors as a better monitor to mitigate agency problems, thereby alleviating the financial constraints of the firm. Our results indicate that firms with bank-appointed directors hold less cash compared to firms without bank-appointed directors. Nevertheless, we find greater reduction in cash holdings, because of bank-appointed directors, in firms that are not dependent on bank financing. We show that the above relationship is driven by bankers' ability to alleviate the financial constraints of the firm by improving access to bank and non-banking financial institution loans. We next document that these benefits of a banker's presence on a corporate board are true only for standalone firms, not for firms affiliated with business groups.","[Chauhan, Yogesh] Indian Inst Management Raipur, Dept Finance & Accounting, GEC Campus, Raipur 492015, Madhya Pradesh, India; [Pathak, Rajesh] IFHE Univ, IBS Hyderabad, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Kumar, Satish] Indian Inst Management, Amritsar, Punjab, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Raipur; The ICFAI Foundation for Higher Education (IFHE); ICFAI Business School (IBS); Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Amritsar,"Chauhan, Y (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Management Raipur, Dept Finance & Accounting, GEC Campus, Raipur 492015, Madhya Pradesh, India.",yogesh@iimraipur.ac.in; rajesh.pathak84@gmail.com; satishwar1985@gmail.com,"Kumar, Satish/AAJ-6596-2020","Kumar, Satish/0000-0001-5625-8877; Chauhan, Yogesh/0000-0003-3989-1333",,,,,65,25,25,2,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

To this end, a selection model is formulated and applied to a dataset based on account information and transfer data from the EU Transaction Log (EUTL). Four different ways of adding carbon prices to the dataset are explored. Findings confirm that whether a company made a gain during the first period of EU emissions trading is highly dependent on the level of free allocation it received. Consequently, large industrial companies, especially in the iron and steel and cement sectors emerge as the biggest 'winners' as they were the companies with the highest allocation surplus. This also applies to a number of electricity generators located in Central and Eastern Europe. Policy makers therefore have to be mindful about decisions regarding the level of free allocation to individual sectors and companies, as those design choices have a large influence on the way in which gains and costs are distributed under the system, which in turn has repercussions on its political acceptability. Rules for free allocation are harmonised at EU-level since the beginning of the third trading period, but relatively generous free allocation to industrial sectors and additional sources of unequal treatment remain. The analysis also confirms that small companies were less likely to participate, which points to the existence of significant transaction costs preventing many small companies from realising potential gains on the market (as well as jeopardising the efficiency of the system). It is therefore important to reduce transaction costs for small companies, in particular at the beginning of an ETS, in order to incentivise market entry.","[Cludius, Johanna] Zurich Univ Appl Sci ZHAW, Sch Management & Law, Zurich, Switzerland; [Cludius, Johanna] UNSW Australia, Ctr Energy & Environm Markets CEEM, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Cludius, Johanna] Oeko Inst, Energy & Climate Div, Schicklerstr 5-7, D-10179 Berlin, Germany",Zurich University of Applied Sciences; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Cludius, J (通讯作者)，Zurich Univ Appl Sci ZHAW, Sch Management & Law, Zurich, Switzerland.;Cludius, J (通讯作者)，UNSW Australia, Ctr Energy & Environm Markets CEEM, Sydney, NSW, Australia.;Cludius, J (通讯作者)，Oeko Inst, Energy & Climate Div, Schicklerstr 5-7, D-10179 Berlin, Germany.",j.cludius@oeko.de,,,,,,,36,5,5,0,20,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

This paper investigates the impact of this displacement on affected households' income and consumption patterns using a difference-in-differences approach and primary household-level data from the villages around the mine in two periods: one just before relocation in 2011 and another in 2015. In 2011, all households of the Wali Kali village, one of the seven project-affected villages, were involuntarily relocated. Project-affected families (PAFs) claim that their traditional earning sources have been inadequately replaced by mine-related earnings and that, being separated geographically, they now face difficulty maintaining social networks that are necessary for their survival. Once lost, rebuilding social networks is not easy in war-trampled Afghanistan. This paper clarifies these shadowy effects of forced relocation and demonstrates that traditional daily labour income was reduced significantly and only partially replaced by income from mine-related activities among those who were relocated and that relocation significantly discouraged the participation in community life, reflecting the losses of social capital among the PAFs due to separation.","[Dastgir, Ghulam; Yoshida, Yuichiro] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Int Dev & Cooperat, 1-5-1 Kagamiyama, Higashihiroshima 7398529, Japan; [Kawata, Keisuke] Univ Tokyo, Inst Social Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Dastgir, Ghulam] Minist Finance, Afghanistan Customs Dept, Tech Affair Directorate, Kabul Jalalabad Rd, Kabul, Afghanistan",Hiroshima University; University of Tokyo,"Yoshida, Y (通讯作者)，Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Int Dev & Cooperat, 1-5-1 Kagamiyama, Higashihiroshima 7398529, Japan.",yuichiro@hiroshima-u.ac.jp,"KAWATA, KEISUKE/AAJ-7346-2020; Khan, Ghulam Dastgir/N-4323-2014; Yoshida, Yuichiro/M-2925-2013","Khan, Ghulam Dastgir/0000-0002-5704-363X; Yoshida, Yuichiro/0000-0002-3061-4594","Sumitomo Foundation [153421]; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan [16H05704]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16H05704, 16H03610, 16H03615, 15K13007] Funding Source: KAKEN","Sumitomo Foundation; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported by the The Sumitomo Foundation [#153421]; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan [#16H05704].",,45,9,9,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

In prospect theory and, generally, in behavioural economics, there are many methodological attitudes. Propensity theory gives possibility to standardise them, and this is the general motivation of the chapter. Presented methods of analysing propensity could help operationalise the prospect theory and other behavioural economics concepts. In the first part, general definition of propensity, as well as methods of measuring propensities is shortly discussed. In the next part of the chapter, propensity to risk is analysed in context of the prospect theory. Frequency measures of propensity to risk are used to specify a value function in the prospect theory. The first measure is based on nominal scale. This method might be useful when we have two outputs (safe and risky one), such as in the first version of the prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky in Econometrica 47: 2, 1979). Also, method of measuring propensity to risk that is based on game against nature is proposed. This method might be used in case of cumulative prospect theory, where we have more than two outputs.","[Doszyn, Mariusz] Univ Szczecin, Econometr & Stat, Inst Fac Econ & Management, Mickiewicza 64, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland",University of Szczecin,"Doszyn, M (通讯作者)，Univ Szczecin, Econometr & Stat, Inst Fac Econ & Management, Mickiewicza 64, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland.",mariusz.doszyn@usz.edu.pl,,,,,,,13,0,0,2,25,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-99187-0; 978-3-319-99186-3,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,47,60,,10.1007/978-3-319-99187-0_4,0.0,,,14,Behavioral Sciences; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Behavioral Sciences; Business & Economics,BM1WR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000460629400004,0

Indeed, several authors have observed that Donald Trump displays behaviors that are associated with a narcissistic personality disorder (http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/28/opinions/trump-campaign-narcissism-lipmani; McAdams, The mind of Donald Trump, The Atlantic, 2016; https://www.washing-tonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/22/is-donald-trump-a-textbook-narcissist/?utm_term=.80214dd189cd). These analyses focus on who the leader is rather than why followers endorse such a leader. Likewise, leadership researchers have begun to explore the dark side of leadership (Lipman-Blumen, The allure of toxic leaders: why we follow destructive bosses and politicians and how we can survive them, Oxford University Press, 2005; Kellerman, Bad leadership, Harvard Business School Press, 2004). Here, I argue that a focus on followers provides a better understanding of the appeal of toxic leaders. The appeal of toxic leaders stems from several factors, including implicit leadership theories, parental models of leadership, collusive relationships, as well as denigration out-groups. Taken together, followers play a crucial role in the legitimization of toxic leaders.","[Hansbrough, Tiffany Keller] Fairleigh Dickinson Univ, Management Dept, Madison, NJ 07940 USA",Fairleigh Dickinson University,"Hansbrough, TK (通讯作者)，Fairleigh Dickinson Univ, Management Dept, Madison, NJ 07940 USA.",thansb@fdu.edu,"Keller Hansbrough, Tiffany/KCX-9556-2024","Keller Hansbrough, Tiffany/0000-0002-7545-6710",,,,,26,2,2,0,15,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-58589-5; 978-3-319-58588-8,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,15,20,,10.1007/978-3-319-58589-5_2,0.0,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL0QR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000446372200002,0

The main aim of this paper is to evaluate which selected risks categories related to marketing activities are recognized by SMEs in case of potential cluster cooperation as the most risky. Evaluated were four risk categories: 1. Analysis of competition, 2. Market analysis, 3. Quality and 4. The production of clusters. We used the questionnaire method with a selection of respondents with experience or knowledge of cluster cooperation. The respondents' answers were examined by dividing into two groups according: size category of SMEs and affiliation to the technological or tourism orientation of their activities. Further we used descriptive statistics and our hypotheses have been evaluated by corresponding statistical tests for analysis of variance. The findings showed the differences in evaluation of risk categories by SMEs depending on the type of their activities, not size category.","[Haviernikova, Katarina; Ivanova, Eva] Alexander Dubcek Univ Trencin, Fac Social & Econ Relat, Trencin, Slovakia",Alexander Dubcek University Trencin,"Haviernikova, K (通讯作者)，Alexander Dubcek Univ Trencin, Fac Social & Econ Relat, Trencin, Slovakia.",katarina.haviernikova@tnuni.sk; eva.ivanova@tnuni.sk,"Havierniková, Katarína/P-1414-2019","Havierniková, Katarína/0000-0002-9019-8684",VEGA [1/0918/16],VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),VEGA [No 1/0918/16]: Risk management of SMEs in the context of clusters' involvement activities in the Slovak Republic.,,17,2,2,0,4,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-623-5,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,56.0,,,,,,433,436,,,,,,4,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO0KO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000491539600100,0

The larger the scale, the lower the risk bearing behavior of the bank; Under the condition of increasing the bank size, the capital adequacy ratio has a significant positive correlation with the risk assumption of the commercial bank, that is, the size of the bank inhibits the restraint of the capital adequacy ratio on the risk assumption behavior of the commercial bank to a certain extent.

Using hand-collected subsidy data on Chinese listed companies, we find that firms receiving more subsidies tend to have a lower cost of debt. However, such firms fail to have superior financial performance. Instead, firms with more subsidies tend to be overstaffed, which demonstrates higher social performance. These results are mainly driven by non-tax-based subsidies rather than tax-based subsidies. Overall, our results suggest that the Chinese government uses non-tax-based subsidies to achieve its social policy objectives at the expense of firms' profitability. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In the past two decades, the VaR and ES have been widely introduced and discussed. However, in a recent consultative document, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision suggests replacing Value-at-Risk (VaR) by expected shortfall (ES) for setting capital requirements for banks' trading books because ES better captures tail risk than VaR. However, besides ES, another risk measure called median shortfall (MS) also captures tail risk by taking into account both the size and likelihood of losses. The study argues that MS is a better alternative than ES as a risk measure for setting capital requirements in China because: (1) MS is elicitable but ES is not; (2) MS has distributional robustness with respect to model misspecification but ES does not; (3) MS is easy to implement but ES is not. In this paper, properties of VaR, MS and ES (e.g. elicitability, robustness and sub-additivity) are critically compared. Together with comparison of properties, backdatings are used to give reference of accuracy. By the approach of backtesting (traffic light) of MS and VaR, we could see many similarities but differences from ES in the paper. This paper adopts the test statistics Z2 for ES backtesting.

However, the empirical evidence in the literature does not agree on the extent of the potential savings from differentiation. We address this issue in the case of France, using a mathematical programming model of agricultural supply (AROPAj). The modeling approach used accounts for the spatial diversity of nitrate pollution and the heterogeneity of farming systems. Our results reveal the efficiency gains from differentiating pollution fees among polluters and water bodies. For instance, firm-specific and water body-specific taxes represent respectively 5.8 and 32.5 % of farmers' gross margin in terms of compliance costs, whereas a uniform policy at the river-basin district or national level leads to major economic losses and abandonment of the agricultural activity. These results stem from the lower tax rates faced by farmers in less polluted areas, for scenarios based on spatial differentiation. Our estimates suggest that realistic regulation via input-based pollution fees should be differentiated in order to significantly reduce the financial burden on farmers of conforming to predefined pollution levels. Some potential adverse effects related to input-based taxation and land use change call for additional fine-scale nitrogen pollution regulation (e.g. limitations on crop switching).","[Lungarska, Anna; Jayet, Pierre-Alain] Univ Paris Saclay, Agroparistech, INRA, Econ Publ, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France",INRAE; Universite Paris Saclay; AgroParisTech,"Lungarska, A (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Saclay, Agroparistech, INRA, Econ Publ, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France.",lungarska@gmail.com; jayet@grignon.inra.fr,,,French National Research Agency (ANR) under the ORACLE project [ANR-10-CEPL-011]; PIREN-Seine research program,French National Research Agency (ANR) under the ORACLE project(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); PIREN-Seine research program,"We are thankful to the co-editor Celine Nauges and the anonymous reviewers for their extremely useful comments, which have greatly contributed to the revised version of the manuscript.

The research data set comprises a balanced sample of both healthy and bankrupt firms operating in Slovakia in the period from 2014 to 2017. Financial information regarding a firm's financial situation are acquired from the Finstat database, which stores annual reports. For the purpose of comparing the classification accuracy of the proposed GA-NN model, two more models are constructed, namely BP-NN (back-propagation neural network model) as well as MDA (multiple discrimination model). The results gained by utilizing these models suggest the superiority of the developed GA-NN model to both BP-NN and MDA models in terms of prediction performance.","[Mihalovic, Matus] Ekon Univ Bratislava, Podnikovohospodarska Fak Kosice, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Mihalovic, M (通讯作者)，Ekon Univ Bratislava, Podnikovohospodarska Fak Kosice, Bratislava, Slovakia.",matus.mihalovic@gmail.com,,,,,,,31,9,9,1,18,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,2336-8225,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Using a realistic and holistic approach, this theoretic contribution corrects three main assumptions of the economic theory of copyright and explains why they hinder the proper understanding of its role. First, authors' pieces of work are like a public good that needs the protection of copyright to overcome the free rider problem. However, a piece of work can be spread only with a medium good or service. Such a pair might not possess the properties of a public good like nonexcludability and nonrivalry. The second assumption that copyright enables authors to charge the price above marginal costs was rejected as too simplistic because the copyright affects different markets with pairs work + medium variably and moreover, it ensures for authors a non-market revenue. The complexity of copyright also explains why the third assumption that copyright can be modelled as a single index is meaningless. A new framework for optimisation behaviour of authors is offered.","[Moravcova, Hana] Univ Karlova, Fak Socialnich Ved, Prague, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Moravcová, H (通讯作者)，Univ Karlova, Fak Socialnich Ved, Prague, Czech Republic.",hana1moravcova@gmail.com,"Moravcová, Hana/X-3990-2018","Moravcová, Hana/0000-0002-5853-430X",,,,,28,1,1,0,3,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Utilizing data from 9 metropolitan areas that have invested in light rail between 1980 and 2010, a k-means clustering approach is used to construct discrete multivariate neighborhood typologies. Together with Markov chains, we are able to examine transitions between neighborhood types before and after the opening of a station. Results for affected neighborhoods are compared to city-wide transitions to uncover differences. Our findings suggest that there is a significant difference in transit and non-transit neighborhood transitions. There also appears to be a difference in trajectories between Walk-and-Ride and Park-and-Ride neighborhoods. While neighborhoods are largely stable over time, impoverished neighborhoods are most likely to experience changes (such as gentrification) following the opening of a transit station. The most affluent neighborhoods are the least likely to experience change but are associated with the most probable trajectory of change featuring densification. Finally, there is little evidence that socioeconomic ascent following station openings is associated with significant changes in racial composition. Knowledge about neighborhood dynamics associated with transit investments can aid policy makers and planners in achieving socioeconomic goals of transit investments.","[Nilsson, Isabelle; Delmelle, Elizabeth] Univ N Carolina, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte,"Nilsson, I (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.",inilsso1@uncc.edu,,"Nilsson, Isabelle/0000-0003-0403-1309",,,,,51,46,54,0,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

In fact, the current tax ratio of Indonesia is low, which means that tax revenue is still low compared to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). However, there is still a big chance for the government to increase tax revenues. One of the efforts of government is to make a policy of tax amnesty, in which the government hopes that the taxpayers experience the ease to report all the assets. The ease of reporting comes from the elimination of any sanctions related to previously unreported assets by reporting the assets owned with a certain fixed amount of redemption. This research was conducted in Bekasi, Indonesia to find out how big the influence of tax amnesty policy on compliance of taxpayer is. This research is a descriptive and verification one which captures variables of tax amnesty program and compliance of taxpayer.

Meanwhile, specific tax regimes - for the self-employed, for seasonal workers, for workers of the so-called microenterprises - with low social contributions have gained popularity, and the share of the shadow economy is large, eventually leading to the situation when more than a third of all taxpayers pay social contributions from the base lower than the statutory minimum wage. In many cases they do it without realizing that their future pensions will also be minimal. For the pillar II, this is aggravated by the fact that more than threefourths of the participants do not control the profitability of their savings in pension plans. Although Latvian legislation allows changing pension plan and fund manager, more than 90% do not use this opportunity, and almost half of those who use it have done so under the influence of advertising, rather than rational thinking. The pillar II share in public old-age pension benefits in the course of time will constitute an increasingly significant part. In Latvia, all persons born after June 1971 are mandatory participants of pillar II pension funds, as well as the majority of those who were given the opportunity to join them voluntarily.

Relying on a permanent crop, apple producers are less flexible to react upon disturbances. Based on data of 134 apple producers operating in the two main production areas in Germany, we compare and determine efficient production options. Furthermore, appropriate risk management instruments (RMIs) are identified using stochastic dominance criteria. In addition, we use Stochastic Efficiency with Respect to a Function to evaluate farming options for defined ranges of relative risk aversion. The results indicate that Red Prince is the most efficient variety in the north and subsidized hail insurance with frost irrigation is superior to frost irrigation as single RMI. In the south Braeburn should be chosen by rational decision makers, but the tested insurance solutions are not as efficient as the common practice of producing apple under hail nets.","[Roehrig, Maren B.

The identification strategy relies on two characteristics of the study area: 1) its religious composition is stable; and 2) its households' pre-disaster socio-economic status is uncorrelated with religious fractionalisation and disaster damage after controlling for the observed characteristics. The findings suggest that households in disaster-affected and religiously fractionalised communities are more likely to be victims after a natural disaster than are households in non-fractionalised communities.

Top executives receive one-time increases in pensionable earnings through higher annual bonuses one year before a plan freeze and one year before retirement. Firms also boost pension payouts by lowering plan discount rates when top executives are eligible to retire with lump-sum benefit distributions. Increases in executive pensions do not appear to be an attempt to improve managerial effort or retention and are more likely to occur at firms with poor corporate governance.

One of the reasons why there is an imbalance between the potential and realization of zakat funds is because of the disobedience of muzakki in paying zakat.

It also examines the effect of uncertainty on the decision to invest in milk production in the two value chains. Results indicate that youths in the informal dairy value chain face the greatest level of risk followed by men in the formal value chain, and then men in the informal value chain. Women in both value chains and youths in the formal value chain face relatively low risk. Overall, milk production in the informal value chain is found to be substantially riskier than production in the formal chain. Optimal investment triggers are found to be much larger than the conventional triggers and are sensitive to volatility of returns. The results' managerial and policy implications for inclusive dairy industry development in Tanzania are highlighted.","[Twine, Edgar E.; Omore, Amos] Int Livestock Res Inst, POB 34441, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Githinji, Julius] Int Livestock Res Inst, POB 30709, Nairobi, Kenya",CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI),"Twine, EE (通讯作者)，Int Livestock Res Inst, POB 34441, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania.",e.twine@cgiar.org,,,NWO-WOTRO through LIQUID; Irish Aid in Tanzania through MoreMilkiT project,NWO-WOTRO through LIQUID; Irish Aid in Tanzania through MoreMilkiT project,The authors gratefully acknowledge support from NWO-WOTRO through the LIQUID project and Irish Aid in Tanzania through the MoreMilkiT project.

We estimate stock exposure to an economic uncertainty index and show that stocks in the lowest uncertainty beta decile generate 6% more annualized risk-adjusted return compared to stocks in the highest uncertainty beta decile. We find that the uncertainty premium is driven by the outperformance (underperformance) by stocks with negative (positive) uncertainty beta. Our results indicate that uncertainty averse investors demand extra compensation to hold stocks with negative uncertainty beta and they are willing to pay high prices for stocks with positive uncertainty beta.

A coefficient on the squared excess market return significantly smaller than zero is interpreted as evidence for herding. However, we show that the true coefficient is positive under the null hypothesis of no herding. Hence, their test is biased against finding evidence in favour of herding. Empirical examinations for the S&P 500 and the EuroStoxx 50 confirm the misleading implications of Chang, Cheng and Khorana's measure, while our modified test provides clear-cut evidence for herding behaviour.

The merchant bank borrows collateralized short-term funds from the deposit bank. In an economic downturn, as the value of collateral decreases, the merchant bank must sell assets on short notice, reinforcing the crisis, and defaults if its cash buffer is insufficient. The deposit bank suffers from losses because of the depreciated assets. If the value of the deposit bank's assets is insufficient to cover deposits, it also defaults. Deposits are insured by the government, with a premium paid by the deposit bank equal to its expected loss on the deposits. We define the bank's capital shortfall in the crisis as the expected loss on deposits under stress. We calibrate the model on the U.S. economy and show how this measure of stressed expected loss behaves for different calibrations of the model. A 40% decline of the securities market would induce a loss of 12.5% in the ex-ante value of deposits. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The focus is on the trade-off between domestically and internationally provided security as tax-financed public goods under heterogeneous risk classes of the members. A sufficient condition for a low-risk potential member to abstain from participation and a necessary condition for the participation of a high-risk potential member are stated. Disincentives for membership can include the cost of commitment in terms of the required production of the collective good, preemptive maneuvers, and ex post punishments of the enemy. The optimal tax is shown to be declining in the safety classification of a member subject to an adverse incentive effect of free riding. Solutions for the alliance size and the cost of membership are derived in the alliance equilibrium resorting to the fixed-point solution.

Our results indicate that the demand for audit assurance is higher in the presence of higher agency costs between controlling and non-controlling shareholders and higher agency costs of debts. We also find that companies with stronger capital need are more likely to have their interim financial statements audited. The quality of corporate governance is found to have a positive effect on the decision to choose audit assurance. Finally, our empirical results demonstrate audited information is more value relevant than reviewed information. This suggests that firms can potentially enjoy benefits from audited information as the market will rely more on their financial information in making investment-related decisions.

Using nationally representative data, we test empirically for a discouraged worker effect arising from either of two mechanisms: administrative rationing of jobs among those who seek work and delays in wage payments. We find strong evidence at the household and district levels that administrative rationing discourages subsequent demand for work. Delayed wage payments seem to matter significantly during rainfall shocks. We find further that rationing is strongly associated with indicators of implementation ability such as staff capacity. Politics appears to play only a limited role. The findings suggest that assessments of the relevance of public programs over their lifecycle need to factor in implementation quality.

We find that the program provided significant benefits in terms of gender equality and credit access while opening up new opportunities in terms of land taxation or land use planning, but that high level of rural informality may undermine these in the medium to long term. While public efforts to decentralize service provision helped to significantly reduce informality, additional efforts are likely to be needed to ensure sustainability of the registry.

This paper explores both theoretically and empirically whether or not the willingness to pay (WTP) for pollution control varies with income. Our model indicates that the income elasticity of the marginal WTP for pollution reduction is only constant under very restrictive conditions. Our empirical analysis tests the null hypothesis that the elasticity of the WTP for pollution control with respect to income is constant, employing a multi-country contingent valuation study of eutrophication reduction in the Baltic Sea. Our findings reject this hypothesis, and estimate an income elasticity of the WTP for eutrophication control of 0.1-0.2 for low-income respondents and 0.6-0.7 for high-income respondents. Thus, our empirical results suggest that the elasticity is not constant but is always less than one.

In this paper, we explore the possible linkage between rising saving rates and rising income inequality. We first characterize China's saving behavior using household survey data, finding that households with high income save at higher rates. We then derive analytically that the saving rate relates with income inequality index in a nonlinear way, in particular, the aggregate saving rate is a linear function of interaction term of the average income level and squared income inequality indicator, and the level value of average income. We conduct median regression analysis using community level data, finding that aggregate saving rates are increasing in income inequality, in particular, the higher the income inequality, the greater the marginal effect of income inequality on aggregate saving rates. This research has policy implication that the effective way to promote China's domestic demand is through promoting a more equal distribution of income.","[Chu, Tianshu; Wen, Qiang] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Econ & Management, 555 Liutai Rd, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Wen, Q (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Econ & Management, 555 Liutai Rd, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",chu@swufe.edu.cn; durianwen@2013.swufe.edu.cn,"Chu, Tianshu/Z-4133-2019","Chu, Tianshu/0000-0002-3519-8737; WEN, QIANG/0000-0002-5652-7755",Income Distribution and Development Policy Research Project at Research Institute of Economics and Management,Income Distribution and Development Policy Research Project at Research Institute of Economics and Management,We appreciate support from the Income Distribution and Development Policy Research Project at Research Institute of Economics and Management.,,41,11,16,2,26,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

We also examine the possible channels through which social capital may affect cash holdings. Using US data, this study shows that firms from a high social capital county hold significantly less cash than firms from a low social capital county. We also confirm that social capital reduces cash holdings via the financial constraints and financial reporting quality channels, while it increases cash holdings via the systematic and idiosyncratic risk channels. Additional analysis reveals that, the effect of social capital on cash holdings is more pronounced for less geographically dispersed firms. These results are robust to alternative specifications of cash holdings and social capital, and to the use of a two-stage least squares (2SLS) analysis to alleviate the endogeneity concern. Overall, our findings suggest that regional social capital plays an important role in determining corporate cash holdings.","[Habib, Ahsan] Massey Univ, Sch Accountancy, Private Bag 102904, Auckland, New Zealand; [Hasan, Mostafa Monzur] Curtin Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Kent St, Perth, WA 6102, Australia",Massey University; Curtin University,"Hasan, MM (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Kent St, Perth, WA 6102, Australia.",a.habib@massey.ac.nz; Mostafa.Hasan@curtin.edu.au,"Habib, Ahsan/ABB-1321-2021; Hasan, Mostafa/P-3611-2019","Hasan, Mostafa/0000-0003-2891-2979","School of Economics and Finance, Curtin Business School, Curtin University","School of Economics and Finance, Curtin Business School, Curtin University","We thank Carl R.

We exploit the geographical and inter-temporal variations of county-level minimum wages in a panel data set of all state-owned and all above-scale non-state-owned Chinese firms covering the introduction of the new Chinese minimum wage regulations in 2004. In our basic regressions including all Chinese firms, we find significant negative effects of the minimum wage on human capital investment rates and no overall effects on fixed capital investment rates. When grouping firms by their ownership structure, we find that these results hold for most firms. Foreign-owned firms are an exception to some extent, because the likelihood that they invest in human capital has not decreased in response to the policy.","[Lin, Carl] Bucknell Univ, Dept Econ, Lewisburg, PA 17837 USA; [Lin, Carl] Inst Study Lab IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Haepp, Tobias] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China",Bucknell University; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Peking University,"Lin, C (通讯作者)，Bucknell Univ, Dept Econ, Lewisburg, PA 17837 USA.",carl.lin@bucknell.edu,,,International Development Research Centre (IDRC) [106753],International Development Research Centre (IDRC),Lin gratefully acknowledges support from the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) (Grant #106753).,,42,9,12,3,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

We reexamine the herd behavior of the overall market by employing a new measure of herding based on the cross-sectional comovement of returns in excess of its expected value under an assumed asset pricing model. Employing the proposed measure based on either the capital asset pricing model or the Fama-French three factor model during the period 7/1963-12/2014, we find strong evidence of herding during periods of mid to large negative price movements, but weak or no evidence of herding during periods of positive price movements. The recent US sub prime crisis period is an exception because during the period no significant evidence of herding is found. We also find evidence that properly accounting for the effects of an assumed asset pricing model when calculating the herding measure is important and that the herding behavior of the overall market is likely to be driven by the contemporaneous market-wide information.

Based on 8.5 years of intraday data on copper, zinc, nickel, lead and aluminum, we explore a variety of extensions of the univariate heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) model and seek to harness the economic linkages among these metals to improve forecasts. A simple approach that augments the models with shocks in other metals' series appears to outperform more sophisticated specifications, which explicitly model covariances. The results suggest that the information inherent in the volatility series of aluminum is most useful in enhancing the accuracy of forecasts for other metals. While consistently outperforming the original HAR model with an individual model is difficult, combination forecasts, especially with univariate specifications or Bayesian model averaging, are found to conclusively outperform the benchmark.

Results for poverty reduction are less encouraging: were it not for the in-kind benefits from health and education spending, the overall effect of government spending and taxation would actually increase poverty in Ghana.

In contrast to previous years, the 2013 gap is completely explained by sex differences in faculty, experience, and, more important, type of appointment and rank. The distribution of values of these control variables changed considerably between the earlier years and 2013 in ways that influenced. the gap.","[Brown, Laura K.; Troutt, Elizabeth] Univ Manitoba, Dept Econ, Winnipeg, MB, Canada",University of Manitoba,"Brown, LK (通讯作者)，Univ Manitoba, Dept Econ, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.",,,,,,,,47,5,5,1,12,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

Public Financing and Inequalities in the Use of Home Care Services in Europe,FISCAL STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,inequality; horizontal inequity; long-term care insurance; home care,SELF-RATED HEALTH; LONG-TERM-CARE; CONCENTRATION INDEX; ELDERLY PARENTS; INFORMAL CARE; FORMAL CARE; EXPENDITURE; DELIVERY; INCOME; POPULATION,"Income-related inequalities in health care access have been found in several European countries, but little is known about the extent of needs-adjusted inequalities (inequities) in the provision of long-term care (LTC) services. This paper fills this gap: it addresses equity issues related to the provision of home care services across three macro areas in Europe that are highly heterogeneous in terms of the degree of public financing of LTC and the strength and social value of family ties. Using cross-country comparative microdata from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), we estimate and decompose an Erreygers concentration index of the use of both paid domestic help ('unskilled' care) and personal nursing care ('skilled' care), measuring the contribution of income, need and non-need factors to overall inequality. We base the decomposition on a bivariate probit model that takes into account the interaction between formal and informal home care use. We find higher inequities in the use of unskilled home care in areas where public financing of LTC is relatively low ('Southern Europe') than in areas where the public-private mix of financing is more balanced ('Continental Europe'). At the same time, we do not detect inequity in 'Northern Europe', which is characterised by high public spending on universal, equitable services, including LTC public coverage. In all areas, we find informal care is a substitute for paid unskilled care among the poor, and this contributes to further skewing of the distribution of the use of formal care services towards the rich. Policy points This paper addresses equity issues related to the provision of home care services across three macro areas in Europe that are highly heterogeneous in terms of the degree of public financing of long-term care (LTC) and the strength and social value of family ties. We find higher inequities in the use of unskilled home care in areas where public financing of LTC is relatively low (southern Europe). An interesting compromise that may help achieve both equity of access and public expenditure in the LTC sector is community care, which is less costly than institutional LTC and appears to be a sensible way of responding to elderly people's needs while also averting demographic and economic crisis.","[Carrieri, Vincenzo] Univ Salerno, Dept Econ & Stat, Salerno, Italy; [Carrieri, Vincenzo; Di Novi, Cinzia] Univ York, Hlth Econometr & Data Grp, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Carrieri, Vincenzo] RWI Res Network, Essen, Germany; [Di Novi, Cinzia] Univ Pavia, Dept Econ & Management, Pavia, Italy; [Di Novi, Cinzia] Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, LCSR, Moscow, Russia; [Orso, Cristina Elisa] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Econ, Venice, Italy",University of Salerno; University of York - UK; University of Pavia; HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Carrieri, V (通讯作者)，Univ Salerno, Dept Econ & Stat, Salerno, Italy.;Carrieri, V (通讯作者)，Univ York, Hlth Econometr & Data Grp, York, N Yorkshire, England.;Carrieri, V (通讯作者)，RWI Res Network, Essen, Germany.",vcarrieri@unisa.it; cinzia.dinovi@unipv.it; cristina.orso@unive.it,"Di Novi, Cinzia/AAK-3184-2021; Carrieri, Vincenzo/AAS-9319-2021","Carrieri, Vincenzo/0000-0001-8742-3820; Di Novi, Cinzia/0000-0002-3536-5507",Fondazione Farmafactoring (Milan); Government of the Russian Federation,Fondazione Farmafactoring (Milan); Government of the Russian Federation,"An earlier draft of this paper was presented at the annual meeting of the Italian Health Economics Association, Venice, at the Rand Corporation Workshop on Aging, Santa Monica, and at the Workshop on Public Financing of Long-Term Care at the London School of Economics.

In fact, this effect is completely offset if banks hold moderately high levels of capital. Interestingly, the components of capital stringency that have the strongest negative effect on loan growth are those related to the prevention of banks to use as capital borrowed funds and assets other than cash or government securities.

THE ROLES OF POLICY AND POPULATION,NATIONAL TAX JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,income taxes; distribution; tax liabilities; tax credits and deductions,TAX,"Over the years 2001-2013, the share of individuals in the United States paying positive income taxes fell 6 percentage points, while the fraction with zero and negative tax liabilities increased by 1 and 5 percentage points, respectively. However; during 2008 through 2010, the fraction with negative tax liabilities increased substantially, with corresponding declines in positive and zero tax liabilities. In this paper; we examine the extent to which changes in income tax law, as compared to changes in characteristics of the population represented on income tax and information returns, drove these changes. For this study, we use a sample of tax and information returns drawn from the population of U.S. individual income tax returns over the years 2001-2013. Using this data, combined with federal income tax calculators, we first simulate counterfactual trends in taxpaying status (whether tax liability is positive, zero, or negative) assuming constant tax policy and the actual year-specific populations. We then calculate counterfactual trends in taxpaying status assuming a constant population but actual year-specific lax policy. The results suggest that changes in the population drove most of the overall trends in taxpaying status over the sample period, but changes in tax policy drove almost all of the sizable drops in positive and zero tax liabilities and increase in negative tax liabilities in 2008 through 2010.","[Heim, Bradley T.] Indiana Univ, White Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Lurie, Ithai Z.; Pearce, James] US Dept Treasury, Off Tax Anal, Washington, DC 20226 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; United States Department of the Treasury,"Heim, BT (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, White Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",heimb@indiana.edu; Ithai.Lurie@treasury.gov; James.Pearce@treasury.gov,,,,,,,9,3,4,0,0,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

The reelection motives may affect commissioners' choice regarding when and which regulatory regime retail restructuring, price cap or sliding-scale regulation to adopt to deregulate particular utilities from the status quo of rate-of-return regulation. The system of selection of commissioners, timing of elections, and composition of commissions are evaluated as political factors. Frequency of elections is found to be associated positively with the risk of any deregulation, albeit with different time delay. In election years, the risk of price caps rises immediately, while that of restructuring rises in subsequent years. Elections favor price caps, while appointments by state legislature favor restructuring. Democratic-leaning commissions avoid restructuring in favor of price caps.","[Hlasny, Vladimir] Ewha Womans Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Ewha Womans University,"Hlásny, V (通讯作者)，Ewha Womans Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",vhlasny@gmail.com,"Hlasny, Vladimir/AAI-9716-2020","Hlasny, Vladimir/0000-0002-6029-1634",,,,,69,0,0,0,5,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

The announcement was associated with large investor outflows from EM funds and large fund re-allocations across countries and stocks. Unexpected flow-implied fund upward (downward) allocations are associated with positive (negative) individual security returns following the announcement. The effect is pronounced in EM stocks that had positive cumulative abnormal returns around earlier Federal Reserve asset-purchase announcements leading up to the taper.

Oftentimes, these SMEs have limited access to finance. Interventions to promote financial access for SMEs are therefore an integral part of the development strategy of many governments and donors. To provide an overview of the effectiveness of these interventions, we conduct a systematic review and multivariate meta-analysis. This yields three results. Firstly, few evaluations of SME finance programs apply the same rigorous experimental methods that are more commonly used in studies of microfinance. Secondly, most evaluations of SME finance programs consider neither spillover effects to other enterprises nor effects on the employee level. Thirdly, we find a positive significant effect of SME finance on capital investment, firm performance, and employment within the supported firm, whereas the summary effect on profitability and wages is insignificant. In sum, it remains unclear to what extent SME finance contributes to economic development and poverty reduction. We discuss the main policy implications of these findings as well as the limitations and suggestions for future research on SME finance. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, the choices of all those who are strongly more (or less) risk averse than the reference decision maker can be predicted. Thus, the increasing convex order, together with Ross's (1981) definition of strongly more risk averse, can provide additional comparative static findings in a variety of decision problems.

In the model, a borrower institution obtains funds from a large institutional lender and small investors. When the large lender's asset market is hit by a liquidity shock, it might decide to withdraw funding extended to the borrower. The potential withdrawal by the large lender causes small investors to panic and to close positions even if the large lender does not. Facing funding problems, the borrower has to cut its activities, contributing to further shocks to the supply of market liquidity. The original shock is exacerbated, which reinforces withdrawals by all creditors. The model helps explain how the spreading of liquidity shocks from the broker-dealer sector to the hedge fund sector and the feedback contribute to a systemic crisis.","[Liu, Xuewen] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Finance, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Mello, Antonio S.] Wisconsin Sch Business, Dept Finance, Madison, WI USA",Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Liu, XW (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Finance, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",xuewenliu@ust.hk; antonio.mello@wisc.edu,,,,,,,39,2,2,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

We apply panel fixed effect techniques using data for five EU countries. The analyses are controlled for alternative trade related indicators such as bilateral trade intensity and bilateral intra-industry trade as well as for industrial similarity variables.

Cross-sectional data from the 2007 General Social Survey were used. Descriptive analyses and multivariate regression modeling were conducted. We found that an estimated 42.3% of the Canadian caregivers reported experiencing at least one of the six caregiving consequences. Results also showed that out-of-pocket spending was significantly associated with increased odds of caregiving consequences for men and women.

China's planned national emissions trading scheme would include electricity generation, as nearly all emissions trading schemes do. The critical difference is that in most existing carbon pricing systems the power sector operates with competitive markets and cost-based pricing, while the Chinese power industry still uses a highly regulated dispatch and pricing system. Together these limitations mean that the effect of a carbon price on China is limited in terms of the impact on operational decisions for existing power stations and in terms of the effects on investment decisions. We explore the channels of interaction between electricity market reform and carbon pricing in China, and provide quantitative estimates of the effects and interactions on electricity sector emissions. A probabilistic discrete choice model is used to simulate the behavior of investors in the power sector. The analysis indicates that market reform can help reduce emissions intensity, but to meet China's 2030 targets for non fossil fuel generation a low to moderate carbon price is also necessary; conversely, a carbon price will only be effective with market reform that provides flexibility in dispatch. Using our simplified quantitative analysis, the carbon price required for the same share of non-fossil fuel generation would be about twice as high without market reform. Combining market reform and a carbon price could achieve significant rates of decarbonization and is likely to be the most effective and most feasibly policy package to cut emissions from China's power sector.","[Teng, Fei; Wang, Xin] Tsinghua Univ, Inst Energy Environm & Econ, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Jotzo, Frank] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Tsinghua University; Australian National University,"Jotzo, F (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",frank.jotzo@anu.edu.au,"teng, fei/M-1720-2015; teng, fei/HNI-1377-2023","teng, fei/0000-0003-0371-1142; Jotzo, Frank/0000-0002-2856-847X","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFA0602702]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71673162, 71173131]; Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade [15/46772#15]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade(Australian Government),"We are indebted to two anonymous reviewers for providing insightful comments and providing directions for additional work which has resulted in this paper.

As a result, capital gains taxes on sales of stock increase dividend payments and reduce investment. The new view result, that dividend taxes do not affect investment, however, survives in this setting.

In response to some of the adverse effects of state forestry and commercial timber production, CFM claims to improve local livelihoods and conserve forests. Many international organizations, donors, NGOs, and governments therefore advocate CFM. However, a vast body of literature reveals that the overall results are mixed. This paper contributes to this literature in two ways. By building upon neo-institutionalism in CFM studies, the paper uses a practice-based approach as a theoretical lens to better understand how and why CFM institutions are successful or not. In addition, the paper applies a Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) methodology to conduct a systematic cross-case comparison, while allowing for some generalization. By analyzing a decade of CFM research at the Forest and Nature Conservation Policy (FNP) group from Wageningen University in the Netherlands, this paper compares and synthesizes ten CFM cases from Africa, Asia, and Latin America. It concludes that: (1) CFM does indeed present mixed results; (2) CFM performs similarly on social and ecological parameters; (3) overall, community-based organizations are strongly engaged in CFM; (4) such strong engagement though is not sufficient for CFM to perform; and (5) in particular, the presence of a Community of Practice that links local people to external forest professionals for mutual learning, based on respect and trust, makes a positive difference in terms of livelihoods and forest conditions.

I study this cash differential using a dynamic model featuring corporate physical and intangible investment, cross-border decisions, and financial policies. I find that the cash differential diminishes by 42% if repatriation costs are set to zero. Hence, costly repatriation induces cash accumulation offshore. Further, firms that invest overseas have different ex ante cash policies from firms that do not. I examine this self-selection effect by elimiriating heterogeneous intangibility across multinational and domestic firms, which reduces the cash differential by 28%. 1 also examine the likelihood of corporate inversion under federal regulations.

After exploring how processes of internationalization are processed within each country, we show how these processes have played out in the commercial real estate markets of France and Germany. The French state played a key role in guiding processes of internationalization: the introduction of new tax regimes allowed French property companies to raise capital at the stock exchange. The case of Germany demonstrates the continued importance of the banking sector for real estate investment markets. Although the typical characteristics of the French and German political economies are strengthened in this process, agents also feel the need to respond to the interests of international investors by creating Real Estate Investment Trust-like systems to absorb domestic and foreign capital.","[Wijburg, Gertjan; Aalbers, Manuel B.] Univ Leuven, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Wijburg, G (通讯作者)，Univ Leuven, KU Leuven, Div Geog & Tourism, Celestijnenlaan 200-E, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium.",Gertjan.Wijburg@kuleuven.be,,"Aalbers, Manuel/0000-0001-6640-0988",European Research Council [313376]; European Research Council (ERC) [313376] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work is part of 'The Real Estate/Financial Complex' research project (European Research Council grant number 313376).",,94,21,25,1,29,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1024-5294,1477-2221,,COMPET CHANG,Compet.

This effect is stronger in specialized industries. In addition, increased IPO activity leads to a greater likelihood of executive transitions between firms. These findings indicate that market forces play a key role in the determination of CEO pay.","[Nickerson, Jordan] Boston Coll, 140 Commonwealth Ave, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA",Boston College,"Nickerson, J (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, 140 Commonwealth Ave, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA.",jordan.nickerson@bc.edu,,,,,,,41,4,5,1,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Scholars have raised significant reliability and validity problems with these types of scales, and alternative methods for capturing perceptions and preferences have gained traction within specific domains. In this paper, we evaluate a new, broadly applicable approach to opinion measurement based on quadratic voting (QV), a method in which respondents express preferences by 'buying' votes for options using a fixed budget from which they pay quadratic prices for votes. Comparable QV-based and Likert-based survey instruments designed by Collective Decision Engines LLC were evaluated experimentally by assigning potential respondents randomly to one or the other method. Using a host of metrics, including respondent engagement and process-based metrics, we provide some initial evidence that the QV-based instrument provides a clearer measure of the preferences of the most intensely motivated respondents than the Likert-based instrument does. We consider the implications for survey satisficing, a key threat to the continued value of survey research, and discuss the mechanisms by which QV differentiates itself from Likert-based scales, thus establishing QV as a promising alternative survey tool for political and commercial research. We also explore key design issues within QV-based surveys to extend these promising results.","[Quarfoot, David] Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [von Kohorn, Douglas; Sutherland, Rory; Goldstein, David] Collect Decis Engines LLC, Jackson Hts, NY 11372 USA; [Slavin, Kevin] MIT, Media Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Konar, Ellen] Stanford Ctr Longev, Stanford, CA USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"von Kohorn, D (通讯作者)，Collect Decis Engines LLC, Jackson Hts, NY 11372 USA.",dquarfoot@ucsd.edu; dougvk@aya.yale.edu; slavin@media.mit.edu; rory.sutherland@ogilvy.com; david@collectivedecisionengines.com; ellen.konar@gmail.com,,,,,,,15,10,14,1,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUL,2017,172.0,1-2,,,SI,,283,303,,10.1007/s11127-017-0416-1,0.0,,,21,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,EY2EV,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000403782200013,0

This paper shows how a theoretically-founded measure of ambiguity aversion can be derived from Hansen and Sargent's theory of multiplier preferences. Multiplier preferences are used in macroeconomics to capture model uncertainty. At the micro level, they have not been applied yet, because they do not permit ambiguity seeking, which is usually observed for a substantial proportion of subjects. We give a preference foundation for (extended) multiplier preferences accommodating both ambiguity aversion and ambiguity seeking and we propose a simple method to measure them using matching probabilities.

In this context, comparative research on development of the digital economy, both at national and regional level, should be considered as an actual and important scientific task. Therefore, the main aim of the article is to assess and compare the development level of digital economy in Visegrad countries at regional level (NUTS 1). In the research, the digital economy is defined as a multiple-criteria phenomenon. As a result, in the empirical research, the TOPSIS method with application of generalized distance measure GDM was used. The data for diagnostic variables concerning digital infrastructure in the years 2012 and 2015 was provided by Eurostat. On the one hand, the analysis confirmed a relatively quick progress in building digital economy at regional level in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary.

The research findings reveal that the deployed HSR services have a significant substitutional effect on domestic air transportation in China, but the effect varies across different HSR routes, travel distance and city type. Specifically, the research found a decrease in domestic passengers of 28.2%, in flights of 24.6% and in seat capacity of 27.9% after the introduction of HSR services. The impacts are found much stronger among those air routes that connect major hub within a distance range of 500 to 800 km. The uneven nature of the impact can be seen in the different experiences of selected cities.

Through this channel, higher interest rates translate into higher marginal costs of production and, finally, into higher inflation. Conventional wisdom has it that whether the central bank is transparent alters the effects of cost-push or supply shocks, but does not change the fact that demand shocks are fully offset by optimal monetary policy. We show that this view is incorrect in the presence of a cost channel, since the latter not only affects how transparency interacts with cost-push shocks, but also makes it interact with demand shocks.

Our study is the first to account for the selection of mothers into divorce or remarriage when estimating the role that marital history plays in wealth accumulation. Mothers who remained stably married to the biological father of their firstborn child reported greater wealth in their forties than mothers who divorced and did not remarry. Those who married at younger ages, women of color, and women from lower-income families were less likely to remain stably married. Net of selection, mothers who remained remarried had the same wealth as continuously married mothers. Thus the characteristics that predispose mothers to divorce, and not divorce per se, are linked to lower wealth. Once these selection effects were accounted for, we concluded that divorce was not necessarily detrimental to mothers' economic security, a new finding that contradicts past studies.","[Frech, Adrianne] Univ Akron, Dept Sociol, 247 Olin Hall, Akron, OH 44325 USA; [Painter, Matthew] Univ Wyoming, Dept Sociol, 411 Ross Hall,1000 E Univ Ave, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Vespa, Jonathan] US Bur Census, Fertil & Family Stat Branch, 4600 Silver Hill Rd, Washington, DC 20233 USA",University System of Ohio; University of Akron; University of Wyoming,"Frech, A (通讯作者)，Univ Akron, Dept Sociol, 247 Olin Hall, Akron, OH 44325 USA.",afrech@uakron.edu; mpainter@uwyo.edu; jonathan.vespa@census.gov,,,,,,,61,5,6,1,6,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

Using the sample of the period of corporate governance reform in the 2000s, we find that the adoption of stock option plans was more likely at firms in an industry where many firms had already introduced stock option plans. The result indicates a type of herding behavior among Japanese firms. We further find that firms rushed to grant stock options just before the adoption of the new accounting standard (ASBJ Statement No. 8). Unique to Japan, this standard requires stock option expensing only for newly granted options. We also find that operating performance decreased, but that payout and liquidity ratios remained almost constant after the adoption of stock option plans. Overall, the results do not support the view, at least in the Japanese context, that stock options can function as a primary incentive for improving firm performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

With data on 123-135 Japanese electronics/electrical machinery makers, we use a dyad panel regression methodology to address hypotheses drawn largely from embeddedness theory on how the firms' horizontal and vertical keiretsu business group affiliations and prior alliance networks supported and constrained partner choice in new R&D (innovation) and nonR&D (implementation) domestic economy alliances. We find that in the first half of our series (1985-1991; the preburst period), keiretsu served as infrastructure for new strategic alliances that had both innovation (R&D) and implementation (nonR&D) goals. In the second half of our series (1992-1998, the postbubble period), the keiretsu effects on R&D alliance formation were gone, but the groups' role in nonR&D alliances had magnified. Moreover, as the keiretsu effect on new alliances fell or rose, those of prior direct and indirect alliance ties moved in the opposite direction. We conclude with some discussion of whether these period shifts in the embeddedness of the electronics industry alliance formation process were or were not effective adaptations to the turbulence and uncertainty of the postbubble Japanese economy.","[Lincoln, James R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Walter A Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Guillot, Didier] Fukui Prefectural Univ, Fukui 9101195, Japan; [Sargent, Matthew] Univ Southern Calif, USC Digital Humanities Program, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Fukui Prefectural University; University of Southern California,"Lincoln, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Walter A Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",guillot@fpu.ac.jp; guillot@fpu.ac.jp; matthew.sargent@gmail.com,,,"Mitsubishi Chair in International Business and Finance; Institute for Technology, Enterprise, and Competitiveness of Doshisha University","Mitsubishi Chair in International Business and Finance; Institute for Technology, Enterprise, and Competitiveness of Doshisha University","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the Mitsubishi Chair in International Business and Finance and the Institute for Technology, Enterprise, and Competitiveness of Doshisha University.",,79,7,8,4,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

We do not find abnormal short selling in the days before downgrade announcements in the full sample. For the star (non-star) analyst subsample, however, we find significant (insignificant) abnormal short selling beginning 10 days prior to downgrade announcements. In addition, short sellers cut back their short positions when star analysts incorrectly upgrade. Hence, short sellers do not seem to know more than star analysts. With the timing of the short selling, our evidence indicates that star analysts might leak their research to certain short sellers before their downgrade announcements. Furthermore, we demonstrate that broker reputation and institutional investor ownership mitigate the relation between star analysts' downgrades and abnormal short selling. Our results are robust to different measures of abnormal short selling, abnormal returns, event windows, star analysts' impact, and endogeneity. Our overall findings suggest that short sellers are informed.","[Meng, Qingbin] Renmin Univ China, Sch Business, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Li, Ying] Shanxi Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Accountancy, Taiyuan 030006, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Xuanyu] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Accountancy, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Chan, Kam C.] Western Kentucky Univ, Gordon Ford Coll Business, Bowling Green, KY 42101 USA",Renmin University of China; Shanxi University Finance & Economics; Central University of Finance & Economics; Western Kentucky University,"Li, Y (通讯作者)，Shanxi Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Accountancy, Taiyuan 030006, Peoples R China.",mengqingbin@rbs.org.cn; sxcdly@126.com; jiangxuanyu@163.com; Johnny.chan@wku.edu,,,"Foundation of Renmin University of China [2015030083]; Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of China's Ministry of Education [15YJC630067, 15YJC630044]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71302156, 71602197]; Beijing Municipal Commission of Education Pilot Reform of Accounting Discipline Clustering",Foundation of Renmin University of China; Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of China's Ministry of Education; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Municipal Commission of Education Pilot Reform of Accounting Discipline Clustering,"Qingbin Meng acknowledges the financial support from the Foundation of Renmin University of China (Grant no. 2015030083).

However; it is possible to design an import border tax adjustment that would pose a reduced risk of violating WTO law and, in the event a violation is found, an increased likelihood of satisfying the requirements for an exception. The lowest risk of successful WTO legal challenge would be presented by a border tax adjustment (BTA) in relation to a national product based tax that does not vary by reference to carbon intensity of production but is set at a fixed rate for specified categories of products. A national carbon consumption tax that varies by reference to carbon intensity of production could achieve many of the same goals as the combination of a national carbon tax on production combined with an import BTA, including the creation of a level playing field within the United States, with a good chance of qualibring for an exception under WTO law. In addition, a national carbon consumption tax would not apply to goods consumed abroad and would thereby assist with competitiveness in foreign markets. If the consumption tax structure is not used, then an export border tax adjustment could address the foreign market competitiveness issue but might significantly reduce the likelihood of the related import BTA satisfying the requirements for a WTO law exception. An alternative to an export border tax adjustment may be to provide domestic subsidies to industries that are expected to experience competitive detriments in foreign markets as a result of a national carbon tax. So long as these subsidies are not contingent on exportation and do not cause specifically defined categories of adverse effects to foreign producers, they are not likely to violate WTO law. Even if a national carbon tax regime with import BTAs and/or export BTAs, or a subsidy to support exports, were to violate WTO law, the formal response by other states would generally (except possibly in the case of export subsidies) be imposed prospectively after a three-year litigation period and would be in the form of suspension of concessions or other obligations in an amount equivalent to the nullification or impairment of WTO rights resulting from the measure found to violate WTO law. As a practical matter; a state may decide to engage in civil disobedience or to operate in efficient breach in response to this level and type of retaliation. The specific industries targeted for the retaliation could even be supported through subsidies.","[Trachtman, Joel P.] Tufts Univ, Fletcher Sch Law & Diplomacy, Medford, MA 02155 USA",Tufts University,"Trachtman, JP (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Fletcher Sch Law & Diplomacy, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",Joel.Tracht-man@tufts.edu,"Trachtman, Joel/AAN-8482-2020",,,,,,6,18,18,6,34,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

It has to prove that its benefits outweigh the costs of its endeavour. In this respect, an EU competition policy that focuses on consumer welfare is one way to gain support by the citizens of its member states. The Roaming Regulation that has reduced the mobile communications costs while travelling abroad serves as a good example for this approach. The EU Commission views consumer policy as another important factor to protect and benefit customers. In markets with natural monopolies, the two policies require the support of an effective regulatory policy. The research demonstrates that these three policies - if harmonised - are able to lead to an increase in consumer welfare (primarily by reducing prices) and that they protect the rights and interests of consumers. In the case of telecommunications, several initiatives of the European Commission and of national regulatory authorities to falls in prices and forced operators to implement customer friendly rules and to protect customer data and privacy. The authors consider that the European Commission has tried to establish and harmonise rules across all member states in order to protect the interests and rights of consumers on the telecommunication market.

Greenfield-led surges and stops occur more frequently than mergers-and-acquisitions-led ones and different factors are associated with the onset of the two types of events. Global liquidity is the factor significantly and positively associated with a surge, regardless of its kind, while a global economic growth slowdown and a surge in the preceding year are the main factors associated with a stop. Greenfield-led surges and stops are more likely in low-income countries and mergers-and-acquisitions-led surges are less likely in resource-rich countries than elsewhere in the developing world. Global growth accelerations and increases in financial openness, domestic economic and financial instability are associated with mergers-and-acquisitions-led surges but not with greenfield-led ones. These results are particularly relevant for developing countries where FDI flows are the major type of capital flows and suggest that developing countries' macroeconomic vulnerability increases following periods of increased global liquidity. As countries develop they typically become more exposed to merger-and-acquisition-led surges, which are more likely than greenfield-led surges and stops to be short-lived and associated with domestic macroeconomic policies.","[Burger, Martijn J.] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam & Tinbergen Inst, Dept Appl Econ, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Ianchovichina, Elena I.] World Bank, Middle East & North Africa Reg, Chief Economist Off, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; The World Bank,"Burger, MJ (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam & Tinbergen Inst, Dept Appl Econ, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",mburger@ese.eur.nl; eianchovichina@worldbank.org,"Ianchovichina, Elena Ivanova/AAK-5943-2021",,,,,,61,8,8,2,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

The present study proposes and empirically tests a conceptual model of the influence of perceived product quality of store brands relative to perceived value and purchase intention. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was developed on a sample of 439 consumers, distinguishing between consumers with high perceived quality (HPQ) and low perceived quality (LPQ). Our findings highlight that store brands purchase intention is strongly influenced by confidence for both HPQ and LPQ customers, followed by product price. Additionally, our results suggest the moderating role of perceived quality on some of the proposed relationships.

For that purpose, besides the theoretical considerations, the paper comprises quantitative analysis of affecting the inability of economic development, and reproduction of crisis, by the following factors: (a) non-market enrichment and log-rolling structures, (b) parties' monopolies and lobbyism, and (c) systemic corruption. Multiple regression linear approach is applied on a sample of 300 selected respondents in five towns in Montenegro: Podgorica, Niksic, Cetinje, Herceg Novi, and Kotor. On the basis of the conducted statistical examines: standard error of the regression estimate, correlation coefficient, and coefficient of determination are calculated on the basis of previously determined regression coefficients and forecast values of the linear function of free variables (factors: a, b, and c). The regression plots for each of the considered cases, which verify the starting hypothesis, are shown along with the discussion and conclusions. Our results indicate the need to reduce and eliminate effects of the above factors in the society and economy, since they represent concrete manifestations of alternative institutions' negative impacts. The main conclusion of the research is that the authorities in Montenegro should identify all of the channels through which alternative institutions do affect the reduction of social and economic choices. In this sense, it is proposed overcoming the monistic neoliberal policies, along with affirmation of institutional pluralism.","[Draskovic, Mimo; Bauk, Sanja; Draskovic, Veselin] Univ Montenegro, Podgorica, Montenegro; [Bauk, Sanja] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Theoret Informat Technol, Aachen, Germany; [Streimikiene, Dalia] Lithuanian Sports Univ, Kaunas, Lithuania",University of Montenegro; RWTH Aachen University; Lithuanian Sports University,"Draskovic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Montenegro, Podgorica, Montenegro.",rookie@t-com.me,"Streimikiene, Dalia/AAD-7762-2020; Draskovic, Mimo/W-4245-2019; Draskovic, Veselin/AAC-4965-2020; Streimikiene, Dalia/AAF-2180-2020; Bauk, Sanja/AAW-5688-2020","Streimikiene, Dalia/0000-0002-3247-9912; Bauk, Sanja/0000-0003-2882-1321; Draskovic, Mimo/0000-0003-0638-1943; Draskovic, Veselin/0000-0003-3968-422X",,,,,35,6,6,0,2,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,MAY,2017,19.0,45,,,,,477,492,,,,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EZ2EY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404523800011,0

The cross-sectional hedging risk prices are economically consistent with the direction of long-horizon predictability.

Researchers have made a substantial effort to identify the characteristics of the BE that affect CIM and thereby to inform city policy to promote CIM. Although the findings from these studies are useful to inform context specific CIM policy, together they provide inconclusive results. This study made a first attempt to draw a generalised conclusion through a meta-analysis of existing knowledge base. The analysis was conducted using primary studies reporting 13 BE-CIM links and published between 1980 and 2016. Overall effect size (ES), directions, and consistency of each link were calculated, also stratified by contexts, using the reported results from the primary studies and based on a random effect model. The results show that four BE factors (dead-end street, % of residential land, % of commercial land, and residential location type) have a positive association with CIM; traffic volume has a neutral association; and the remaining eight factors (vehicular street width, road density, intersection density, major road proportion, land use mix, availability of recreational facilities, residential density, and distance to destination) have a negative association. Living in a dead end street was found to have the strongest positive ES (0.352), with moderate level of consistency across the primary studies. In contrast, land use mix has the strongest negative ES (- 0.212) but with the highest level of inconsistency. Both ESs and consistencies, however, vary between developing and developed country contexts. Diversity in contexts, research design, and measurement instruments across the primary studies contributed to the heterogeneous results. The findings of this research serve as a guide for practitioners and researcher alike to make an informed decision about the BE factors that consistently foster or hinder CIM in different contexts.","[Sharmin, Samia; Kamruzzaman, Md.] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, 2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Kamruzzaman, M (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, 2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",md.kamruzzaman@qut.edu.au,"Kamruzzaman, Liton Md/AAG-5909-2020","Kamruzzaman, Liton Md/0000-0001-7113-942X; Sharmin, Samia/0000-0001-9095-2088",,,,,108,52,58,21,128,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

We determine that while renting is superior to ownership in isolation, homeownership as a part of the household portfolio often improves wealth creation on a risk-adjusted basis.

The costs and benefits of size and product diversification are particularly relevant to the reinsurance industry, as risk diversification is central to the industry's business model. We find that reinsurers with total assets less than USD 2.9 billion exhibit scale economies, while those with total assets greater than USD 15.5 billion do not. Large reinsurers are characterized by high cost efficiency, while small reinsurers exhibit superior efficiency only when specialized. Large reinsurers also exhibit revenue scope economies when operating both life and nonlife reinsurance. Moreover, the evidence is in line with the efficient structure hypothesis: cost-efficient reinsurers can charge lower prices without sacrificing profitability. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The incentivised experimental task we employed was that of allocation: in a series of problems we gave the subjects an amount of money and asked them to allocate the money over three accounts, the payoffs to them being contingent on a 'state of the world' with the occurrence of the states being ambiguous. We reproduced ambiguity in the laboratory using a Bingo Blower. We fitted the most popular and apparently empirically valid preference functionals [Subjective Expected Utility (SEU), MaxMin Expected Utility (MEU) and alpha-MEU], as well as Mean-Variance (MV) and a heuristic rule, Safety First (SF).

These two treatments are compared with the imposition of rules and imposition of leaders. It is found that both endogenous leaders elected by the community members and endogenous rules selected by the direct involvement of the participants are more effective in promoting cooperation among the community members compared to exogenous leadership, exogenous rule imposition and the baseline scenario without any of these modifications. However, no significant difference is found between representative democracy in the election of leadership and direct democracy in the selection of rules.

In a real-options setting, this paper aims to clarify how PSD impacts on investment policy, capital structure, and agency cost of financing constraints when the firm faces the upper limit of debt issuance. We show that the constrained leverage hardly depends on the performance sensitivity. In particular, our conclusions predict that PSD can decrease the severity of financing constraints relative to the fixed-coupon debt case and the loss of firm value arising from investment and financing distortions due to the presence of financing constraints.

A new method, including micro-simulation of a range of rail crossing configurations, is used to inform a network model which makes aggregate estimates of impacts on all traffic. Relationships between train frequency and percentage change in vehicle travel time and volume were identified. These equations can predict change in travel time/traffic flow caused by rail level crossings based on rail crossing closures and train frequency. Overall, Melbourne's level crossings result in an average increase in travel time of 16.1% for vehicle traffic on links with a level crossing. However on average a level crossing reduces the volume of vehicles on these links by 5.9% as a result of traffic diversion. These values are higher in middle suburbs where train arrivals and crossing closure times at level crossings are more frequent. The aggregate effect of all 152 level rail crossings on all traffic in Melbourne is a travel time change from 1.81 to 1.82 min/km (an increase of around 03%). The number of congested links in Melbourne increases by 0.9% while the total delay increases by 0.7%. These network wide effects are not large compared to localised effects because road links affected directly by crossings represent a very small part of the overall network. Additionally, network effects also include traffic diversion impacts which will counteract some of the immediate impacts on a localised scale. However, it is significant that the very small element of the system can have even a measurable effect on aggregate traffic congestion. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present study, we document that banks can detect overvaluation and increase the price of bank loans to compensate for the engendered agency costs. On the basis of 17,309 firm year observations of Taiwan-listed firms for the 2002 2012 period, we find that firm-specific overvaluation (the first component of the decomposition model proposed by Rhodes-Kropf, Robinson and Viswanathan (2005)) is positively correlated with the bank loan spread. In addition, the positive overvaluation spread relationship is more conspicuous for firms associated with severe information asymmetry but attenuated for firms that had seasoned equity offerings prior to the loan initiation. Finally, we document that high bank loan costs reduce overvaluation and overvaluation-induced agency costs.","[Chiou, Chyi-Lun] Fu Jen Catholic Univ, Dept Business Adm, 510 Zhongzheng Rd, New Taipei 24205, Taiwan; [Shu, Pei-Gi] Fu Jen Catholic Univ, Grad Inst Business Adm, 510 Zhongzheng Rd, New Taipei 24205, Taiwan",Fu Jen Catholic University; Fu Jen Catholic University,"Chiou, CL (通讯作者)，Fu Jen Catholic Univ, Dept Business Adm, 510 Zhongzheng Rd, New Taipei 24205, Taiwan.",075110@mail.fju.edu.tw; 036047@mail.fju.edu.tw,,,,,,,67,2,2,0,15,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

But throughout U.S. history, local population growth has significantly deviated from it. Across small locations, growth was strongly negatively correlated with initial population throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. This strong convergence gave way to moderate divergence beginning in the mid-twentieth century. Across intermediate and large locations, growth became moderately positively correlated with initial population starting in the late nineteenth century. This divergence eventually dissipated but never completely. A simple-one sector model combining the entry of new locations, a friction from population growth, and a decrease in the congestion arising from the supply of land closely matches these and a number of other evolving empirical relationships.

However, other theories predict that frequent elections can even increase turnout. The existing empirical evidence is problematic as it simply correlates election frequency with turnout. By contrast, I exploit a natural experiment in the German state of Hesse, where voters from different municipalities faced the same electoral contest but experienced different election frequency, due to the staggered timing of some local elections. I find that when two elections are scheduled within a relatively short period of time, voter turnout at the later election is significantly reduced. This effect is stronger when the election is deemed less important in the eyes of the voters. Election frequency thus might also partly explain the wide turnout gap between first- and second-order elections, as suggested by Lijphart (1997).","[Garmann, Sebastian] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Chair Publ Finance & Econ Policy, Univ Str 150, Bochum, Germany",Ruhr University Bochum,"Garmann, S (通讯作者)，Ruhr Univ Bochum, Chair Publ Finance & Econ Policy, Univ Str 150, Bochum, Germany.",sebastian.garmann@rub.de,,"Garmann, Sebastian/0000-0002-1035-4916",,,,,38,17,18,1,18,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

Furthermore, their operation is not well understood given the new regulatory environment governing emissions standards and fuel efficiency that is common to the United States and Canada. Given these standards, the sale of more EVs permits manufacturers to sell fossil fuel vehicles with higher carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Paradoxically, more EV sales result in more CO2 emissions.

Consequently, the case for traditional externality correcting policies such as carbon taxation that approximate first-best solutions is compelling.","[Irvine, Ian] Concordia Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Concordia University - Canada,"Irvine, I (通讯作者)，Concordia Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",,,,,,,,27,4,4,0,12,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

Data were used from the Emerging Adult Financial Capability Study, the sample consisted of emerging adult college students (N = 321) from a large southeastern university in the United States. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the direct and indirect effects as well as the overall fit of the model that was constructed according to family financial socialization theory. Results suggested that increased attachment insecurity predicted decreased financial communication from parents and a decreased perception of an internal locus of control.

Results also suggested that financial communication and locus of control mediated the relationship between attachment insecurity and financial behavior.

This effect is generated from increased expenditures from smaller commercial farmers on the poor, labor-intensive, non-tradable, rural non-farm sector, thereby increasing incomes for the rural non-farm population and reducing poverty levels. We illustrate the relationship between small commercial farmers, rural non-farm households, large commercial farmers, and urban households in three contrasting situations. First, we analyze Punjab, Pakistan, a middle-income province with a large urban sector, dominance of small commercial farms in the local economy and significant land area managed by large commercial farms. Second, we analyze Sindh, Pakistan, a middle-income province with a large urban population and dominated in rural areas by large feudal holdings, but with a significant small commercial farm component. Third, we analyze data from Ethiopia, a low-income country with a relatively small urban sector and dominated by small commercial farms. In the two middle-income provinces of Pakistan, the role that agriculture plays in income determination is much less than the urban sector, but it maintains a dominant role in rural poverty determination. In Ethiopia, the low-income country, agricultural growth is a dominant variable both in income growth and poverty reduction accounting for 73% of employment growth in the fast agricultural growth case. Large-scale commercial farms show little impact of agricultural growth on poverty reduction as compared to areas dominated by small commercial farms, partly because of their small proportion of total agricultural output, and partly due to weak consumption based multipliers.

To answer this question, a dictator game was played in which measures of response time and heart rates were taken with treatments that slightly differ only in the cost associated with the choice of a selfish responding. We find that neither altruism nor egoism is an intuitive process for everyone; rather, altruism is intuitive for altruistic subjects while egoism is intuitive for selfish subjects so that when these subjects are confronted with the choice of the opposite, less probable options, they become more reflective by taking longer time to respond. Lastly, during the decision period, a subject that is altruistic has a higher probability of experiencing an increase in the mean heart rate than a subject that is selfish.","[Oyediran, Olusegun A.] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Econ, Albacete Campus, Ciudad Real, Spain; [Rivas, M.

IPRs affect dirty and clean intermediates alike such that higher IPR enforcement may promote the transition to the clean technology, if this technology is productive enough. If the green technology is relatively unproductive, higher IPRs promote the dirty technology while pollution is increasing. As households are due to subsistence consumption subject to a hierarchy of needs, the level of IPR enforcement as well as the level of abatement measures depends on the state of technology and is increasing during economic development. Thus, if the incentive to enforce IPRs is low the level of abatement measures is also low. This argument provides a theoretical foundation for the observed clash of interests in international negotiation rounds regarding the harmonization of IPR protection and actions to combat climate change.","[Schaefer, Andreas] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Econ Res, CER ETH, Zurichbergstr 18, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Schaefer, A (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Econ Res, CER ETH, Zurichbergstr 18, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",aschaefer@ethz.ch,,"Schaefer, Andreas/0000-0002-4703-7914",,,,,45,4,5,2,45,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

First, we review theoretical literature that deals with the problem of governance in donor-recipient relationships and are susceptible of highlighting effects of aggregate aid availability. Second, we provide a conceptual framework that explicitly incorporates a trade-off between considerations of needs and governance. We examine the impact of aid supply on the manner in which a donor agency allocates the available money between countries differing in terms of both needs and domestic governance. The central conclusion is that a donor's utility function that embodies the need-governance trade-off and the associated optimization mechanism yield a meaningful rule to guide inter-country allocation of aid resources.

We provide direct evidence of the gradual information diffusion model in Hong and Stein (1999): momentum profits are larger for stocks whose information diffuses slowly into the stock market. We exploit the options markets to identify stocks with slow information diffusion speed. As informed traders trade options to realize the information that has not been fully incorporated in the stock price, we are able to enhance the momentum strategy by selecting winner/loser stocks with high growth/large drop in call option implied volatility. Our empirical strategy generates a risk-adjusted alpha of 1.8% per month over the 1996-2011 period, during which the simple momentum strategy fails to perform. The results are robust to the impact of earnings announcement, transaction costs, industry concentration, and choice of options' moneyness and time-to-maturity.

This research topic falls under the heading of the Porter hypothesis (PH) of which different versions have been tested. We consider both the strong and the weak versions of the PH, while also adding some peculiar features to the analysis. Firstly, we assess the role played by environmental taxes, that is an instrument rarely tested as a factor which can support the PH. Secondly, we analyse not only the effect of environmental taxes within a given sector (within-sector), but also the role played by environmental taxes in upstream and downstream sectors in terms of input-output relationships. Thirdly, we test these relationships also 'indirectly' by verifying whether innovation is one of the channels through which higher sectoral productivity can be achieved by imposing tighter environmental regulations. Our main findings suggest that downstream stringency is the most relevant driver of innovation and productivity while within-sector regulations only affect productivity but not innovation. Moreover, the effect of regulations on productivity is mostly direct, while the part of the effect mediated by induced innovations, as measured by patents, is relevant only for what concerns downstream regulations.","[Franco, Chiara] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Int Econ Inst & Dev, Via Necchi 5, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Franco, Chiara; Marin, Giovanni] SEEDS Sustainabil Environm Econ & Dynam Studies, Ferrara, Italy; [Marin, Giovanni] Natl Res Council Italy, IRCrES CNR, Res Inst Sustainable Econ Growth, Via Bassini 15, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Marin, Giovanni] OFCE Sci Po, Sophia Antipolis, France",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Ricerca sulla Crescita Economica Sostenibile (IRCRES-CNR),"Marin, G (通讯作者)，SEEDS Sustainabil Environm Econ & Dynam Studies, Ferrara, Italy.;Marin, G (通讯作者)，Natl Res Council Italy, IRCrES CNR, Res Inst Sustainable Econ Growth, Via Bassini 15, I-20133 Milan, Italy.;Marin, G (通讯作者)，OFCE Sci Po, Sophia Antipolis, France.",chiara.franco@unicatt.it; giovanni.marin@ircres.cnr.it,"Marin, Giovanni/A-1917-2014","Marin, Giovanni/0000-0002-7396-1561; Franco, Chiara/0000-0001-6500-9389","National Research Project PRIN-MIUR 'Climate Changes in the Mediterranean Area: Evolutionary Scenarios, Mitigation Policies and Technological Innovation'; EMInInn research project - European Union under the 7th Framework Programme for Research [283002]","National Research Project PRIN-MIUR 'Climate Changes in the Mediterranean Area: Evolutionary Scenarios, Mitigation Policies and Technological Innovation'; EMInInn research project - European Union under the 7th Framework Programme for Research(European Union (EU))","Chiara Franco acknowledges the financial support of the National Research Project PRIN-MIUR 2010-2011 'Climate Changes in the Mediterranean Area: Evolutionary Scenarios, Mitigation Policies and Technological Innovation'.

J,"Huang, KGL",,,,"Huang, Kenneth Guang-Lih",,,Uncertain intellectual property conditions and knowledge appropriation strategies: Evidence from the genomics industry,INDUSTRIAL AND CORPORATE CHANGE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; INNOVATION; SCIENCE; NETWORKS; RIGHTS; FIRMS; SCIENTISTS; PATENTS; IMPACT,"Innovating science-and technology-based firms often endure a sustained period of uncertain intellectual property rights (IPR) protection before patents could be granted to their valuable knowledge assets. This problem is exacerbated, as firms increasingly develop their innovations or operate in countries with weak IPR institutional environments. But how does IPR uncertainty affect firms' strategy toward knowledge appropriation-capturing of economic value from their knowledge assets-and toward providing access to these knowledge assets? Drawing on research from the economics of science and intellectual property strategy, we examine this question using a novel panel data covering 362 firms and organizations in the knowledge-intensive genomics industry based on all genomics patents and matching papers from 1988 to 2005. We find that under uncertain IPR conditions, firms reveal and accumulate more knowledge through open science (follow-on publishing) but shift to knowledge appropriation through commercial science (follow-on patenting) when IPR uncertainty is narrowed. This effect is most salient when firms develop their knowledge assets or operate under strong IPR institutional regime. For highly science-based knowledge assets, firms continue tapping into open science for access and reciprocity in knowledge acquisition from the scientific community. These findings highlight the role of patent grant as a potential lever to shape firms' knowledge processes and long-term innovative capacity, and the emergence of a concerted science strategy employed by firms.","[Huang, Kenneth Guang-Lih] Natl Univ Singapore, Div Engn & Technol Management, Singapore, Singapore; [Huang, Kenneth Guang-Lih] NUS Business Sch, Dept Strategy & Policy, Singapore, Singapore",National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore,"Huang, KGL (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Div Engn & Technol Management, Singapore, Singapore.;Huang, KGL (通讯作者)，NUS Business Sch, Dept Strategy & Policy, Singapore, Singapore.",kennethhuang@nus.edu.sg,"HUANG, Kenneth Guang-Lih/D-2205-2010","HUANG, Kenneth Guang-Lih/0000-0002-4811-5638",,,,,92,22,22,1,56,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

We estimate the effect of minority representation on the frequency of visits to villages by health workers by exploiting the state variation in the share of seats reserved for the two minority groups in state legislative assemblies mandated by the Constitution of India. Using data from state and village level surveys on 15 major Indian states, we find that ST representatives increase the frequency of visits by both doctors and mobile medical units. In contrast, SC representatives have a tendency to decrease the frequency of visits by mobile medical units. Potential explanations for the differential impact of SC and ST representatives are also explored, including geographic isolation, support for the Congress Party, a shift in power, and relative population shares.","[Kaletski, Elizabeth] Cornell Univ, Sch Humanities & Sci, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Prakash, Nishith] Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Prakash, Nishith] Univ Connecticut, Human Rights Inst, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Prakash, Nishith] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Prakash, Nishith] CReAM, London, England",Cornell University; University of Connecticut; University of Connecticut; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Kaletski, E (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Sch Humanities & Sci, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",ekaletski@ithaca.edu,,,,,,,35,1,1,1,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

This paper presents a semi-analytical and fully explicit solution for pricing discretely monitored barrier options when the underlying asset is driven by a general Levy process. The explicit formula only involves elementary functions, and the Greeks are also explicitly available with little additional computation. By performing a 2-transform, we reduce the valuation problem to an integral equation. This equation is solved analytically with the solution expressed in terms of a Fourier cosine series. We then manage to analytically carry out the 2-transform inversion, and obtain a semi-analytical formula for pricing discrete barrier options. We establish the theoretical error bound and analyze the convergence order of our method. Numerical implementation demonstrates that our numerical results are accurate and efficient, and match up with the results from the benchmark methods in the literature. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Understanding the family situation of the household head is essential in assessing living conditions in the region of Latin America. We answer two main questions: first, how have the increase of union instability influenced trends in female headship? Second, are female-headed households in poorer living conditions than male-headed households? We use Integrated Public Use Microdata Series-International (IPUMS-I) census microdata for 14 Latin American countries, focusing on women aged 35 and 44 from 1970 to the present day. Our study finds that in, most countries, women are increasingly likely to head households regardless of union status. The union status, more so than the sex of the household head, is more telling of the living conditions of the household. Female householders are, in fact, less likely to reside in materially poor households after controlling for union status (e.g., single parenthood, divorce, cohabitation) in many countries. Our results highlight the nuance of family situations and female empowerment leading to headship. Policy makers should review differences in rights and entitlement between marital and non-marital couples, upward mobility and opportunities for women, and develop strategies that alleviate single earner households.

This study analyzes how heat, rainfall, and rainfall variability affect farmers' choices of a portfolio of potential climate smart practices - agricultural water management, improved crop seeds, and fertilizer - and the impact of these practices on farm income in the Nile Basin of Ethiopia. We apply a multinomial endogenous switching regression approach by modeling combinations of practices and net farm income for each combination as depending on household and farm characteristics and on a set of climatic variables based on geo-referenced historical precipitation and temperature data. A primary result of this study is that farmers are less likely to adopt fertilizer (either alone or in combination with improved varieties) in areas of greater rainfall variability. However, even when there is high variability in rainfall, farmers are more likely to adopt these two yield-increasing inputs when they choose to (and are able to) include the third part of the portfolio: agricultural water management. Net farm income responds positively to agricultural water management, improved crop variety or fertilizer when they are adopted in isolation as well as in combination. But this effect is greater when these practices are combined. Simulation results suggest that a warming temperature and decreased precipitation in future decades will make it less likely that farmers will adopt practices in isolation but more likely that they will adopt a combination of practices. Hence, a package approach rather than a piecemeal approach is needed to maximize the synergies implicit in various climate smart practices.","[Teklewold, Hailemariam; Mekonnen, Alemu] Ethiopian Dev Res Inst, Environm & Climate Res Ctr, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Mekonnen, Alemu] Univ Addis Ababa, Dept Econ, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Kohlin, Gunnar] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Di Falco, Salvatore] Univ Geneva, Dept Econ, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland",Addis Ababa University; University of Gothenburg; University of Geneva,"Teklewold, H (通讯作者)，Ethiopian Dev Res Inst, Environm & Climate Res Ctr, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",hamtekbel@yahoo.com,"Kohlin, Gunnar/AAK-7797-2021","Kohlin, Gunnar/0000-0002-4387-7561",International Development Research Centre (IDRC) under the project Adaptation to increase Resilience to Climate Change in Ethiopian Agriculture (IDRC) [107745-001],International Development Research Centre (IDRC) under the project Adaptation to increase Resilience to Climate Change in Ethiopian Agriculture (IDRC),"This study was financed by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) under the project Adaptation to increase Resilience to Climate Change in Ethiopian Agriculture (IDRC Project Number: 107745-001).

The analysis included a literature review of methods applied by other researchers performing Erasmus+ programmes evaluation and the methods applied by the European Commission (EC) which lead to the development of quantitative and qualitative data collection methods for the research. Quantitative data research comprised a survey completed by the students participating in the project and collected by their teachers. The qualitative data research consisted of semi-structured interviews with the students, teachers, project managers and different project stakeholders. The research results demonstrated that the project activities had a high value for the project stakeholders and ICT skills development was relevant to all students, as they would help them in their future studies and work. The project was evaluated as very effective, as it contributed to the improvement of different skill sets of students, such as ICT skills, communication, English, teaching, presentation, cross-cultural understanding skills and others. The project is coherent with other ICT skills development activities in the project countries and, in some cases, with national initiatives to assess the inclusion of ICT skills training in school programsmes. The European added value was achieved by exchanging information about the different teaching methods used in five EU countries and contributing to cross-cultural understanding. The evaluation results could be used for planning future Erasmus+ projects, coordinating and consolidating various stakeholders' activities to promote further ICT skills training for a larger group of students and to achieve even better coherence among different ICT training activities.","[Belicka, Daina] SIA CSE COE, Riga, Latvia; [Lancmane, Lasma; Meza, Lolita] Riga Municipal, Riga, Latvia; [Balina, Signe] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Belicka, D (通讯作者)，SIA CSE COE, Riga, Latvia.",,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,3,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-286-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,66,73,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393400007,0

This paper addresses this issue by investigating the relationship between college dropout or graduation and entrepreneurship activity as well as performance. Using information from the Danish labor market register, we identify college students, whether these students graduate, and if they registered a new venture. We find that a larger share of dropouts starts a business, but this reflects the endogeneity of the decision to exit from college. On average, becoming an entrepreneur does not allow dropouts to escape from their punishment in the labor market.","[Buenstorf, Guido] Univ Kassel, Dept Econ, Nora Platiel Str 5, D-34109 Kassel, Germany; [Buenstorf, Guido] Univ Kassel, INCHER Kassel, Nora Platiel Str 5, D-34109 Kassel, Germany; [Nielsen, Kristian; Timmermans, Bram] Aalborg Univ, Fibigerstr 11, DK-9220 Aalborg, Denmark; [Timmermans, Bram] Norwegian Sch Econ NHH, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway; [Timmermans, Bram] Agderforskning, N-4630 Kristiansand S, Norway",Universitat Kassel; Universitat Kassel; Aalborg University; Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Buenstorf, G (通讯作者)，Univ Kassel, Dept Econ, Nora Platiel Str 5, D-34109 Kassel, Germany.;Buenstorf, G (通讯作者)，Univ Kassel, INCHER Kassel, Nora Platiel Str 5, D-34109 Kassel, Germany.",buenstorf@uni-kassel.de; kn@business.aau.dk; bram.timmermans@nhh.no,"; Nielsen, Kristian/K-8139-2017","Timmermans, Bram/0000-0003-1087-6017; Buenstorf, Guido/0000-0002-2957-5532; Nielsen, Kristian/0000-0002-2790-4064",,,,,49,7,10,1,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

To more objectively assess the competitiveness of individual innovation projects in the forestry sector, it is proposed to use points of support. The points of support of the innovative project are the circumstances that have developed at this point in time (at this stage in the life cycle of the project), due to which the chances for successful development of the analyzed innovation project are increased.

Although new research suggests that the factors influencing decision making process of farmers under conversion should be taken into consideration, the corresponding literature in research is underrepresented. The dynamic development in organic agriculture since 1980s has brought an argument so-called conventionalization hypothesis into the literature for the accelerated organic movement. In the study, we aim to identify the factors influencing conversion decision among farmers in the context of the conventionalization literature, and to empirically investigate whether there are tendencies towards conventionalization. Quantitative analysis of primary data from 394 Turkish raisin producers by using multiple comparison tests showed significant differences between the farmer groups. The results of the multinomial logit model revealed implications with respect to basic determinants of the conventionalization such as farm size, specialization, and profit-oriented characteristics. Additionally, results indicated that 'in-conversion' farmers (the newcomers) likely behave in line with the theory by showing less concern about environmental issues.","[Cakirli, Nuray; Lakner, Sebastian; Theuvsen, Ludwig; Otter, Verena] Georg August Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Cakirli, N (通讯作者)，Georg August Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",nuray.cakirli@agr.uni-goettingen.de; slakner@gwdg.de; ltheuvs@gwdg.de; verena.otter@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Otter, Verena/AAC-5237-2020; Lakner, Sebastian/AAF-2585-2019","Lakner, Sebastian/0000-0002-5122-8924",,,,,30,1,1,0,11,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2787-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2017,,,,,,,31,39,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BJ1CL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417392400004,0

Three case studies from the Brazilian cerrado show the rise of large corporate farms to be enabled and impelled by the advance of agricultural production technologies and the search for scale economies. The key finding from the case studies is that complex technology not only necessitates large-scale farming but also generates technical and organizational solutions to the potentially pervasive agency problems. In addition to the use of sound corporate governance practices, these solutions include organizational architecture encompassing computer-aided accounting and budgeting systems, incentive-based compensation, clear definition of performance goals, and delegation of operational decisions to farm managers. Furthermore, organizational architecture has been shown to promote a culture of trust and accountability, which counteract the opportunistic tendencies of farm managers and workers.","[Chaddad, Fabio] Univ Missouri, 125 Mumford Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Chaddad, Fabio] INSPER, 125 Mumford Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Valentinov, Vladislav] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ, Theodor Lieser Str 2, D-06120 Halle, Germany",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; Insper; Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO),"Valentinov, V (通讯作者)，Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ, Theodor Lieser Str 2, D-06120 Halle, Germany.",valentinov@iamo.de,", IAMO/G-2328-2012; Valentinov, Vladislav/V-2932-2019; Change, Structural/W-8306-2019","Change, Structural/0000-0002-2459-4646",Volkswagen Foundation,Volkswagen Foundation(Volkswagen),The authors are grateful to the editors and anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.

How do banks cope with this challenge, how do they organize their small business lending processes? For the supply-side view, we interviewed nine Austrian banks. For the demand-side view, we conducted mystery shopping with five Austrian banks. We find that the complexity of overlapping but different legal standards for segmenting and handling small business clients hinders their finance. All banks in our sample have efficiency issues with this growing client segment, though their approaches vatyfrom relationship-driven to increasingly algorithm-driven.

Appropriate debt can provide funds for the development of the region and guarantee funds flow smoothly, which is conducive to local economic development. However, excessive debt will bring risks and even lead to a debt crisis. After the tax-sharing system reform in China, the debt scale of the local government has expanded greatly. The debt issuance, management and use have encountered big problems. Coupled with the widespread lack of perfect debt repayment mechanisms and supervision system, the credit risk of local government debt is obvious and continues to accumulate. Based on the risk management theory, this paper chooses X City as a case to study on the Debt Risk Management of local government by using literature review method and the combination of both qualitative and quantitative methodologies. Through collecting the 2016 data of the local government debt in X City, this paper expounds the present situation of local government debt risk and analyzes its influence factors. It also measures the risk of local government debt via KMV model and predict the scale of X City's next issuance of local government debt and its EDF (Expected Default Frequency).

Our analysis covers both Western and Eastern European countries over the period 2001-2007. Our results show that FDI increases the demand for intermediary goods.

[Method] A questionnaire survey of internship satisfaction of 380 nursing students in a university was conducted. The demographic variables of the survey data were analyzed according to sex and academic level, and statistical analysis was made on the influencing factors.[Result] The overall clinical satisfaction of students is good. Among them, the satisfaction rate of teaching ability of clinical teachers is the highest, while the satisfaction rate of school management is the lowest. The satisfaction degree of female intern students in clinical internship is higher than that of male intern students, and that of undergraduates is higher than that of junior college students. [Conclusion] Schools and hospitals should strengthen the clinical internship management in student hospitals, strengthen clinical teachers' awareness of teaching, improve the teaching management system, improve student internship satisfaction, and ensure the smooth progress of student internship. Nursing is a very practical discipline, and clinical internship is an extremely important practical link in medical education. which is also the most difficult part of teaching management in medical colleges and universities. For nursing students, McRobbie[1] believes that the clinical internship environment can affect students' professional attitudes, nursing knowledge, behavioral skills and ability to solve clinical problems. It is a test of the theoretical knowledge of books and a challenge to make a combination of theory and practice, as well as a key to cultivate the practical talent, which is conducive for nursing students who are from classrooms to wards and schools to society. At the same time, McCabe[2] believes that the clinical internship environment can help nursing students to establish good professional roles and enhance their sense of mission and responsibility. Through clinical internship, nursing students get comprehensive exercise in political thought, business technology, medical ethics, style discipline and other aspects, which is conducive to nurturing students' professional ethics and clinical skills training. However, clinical nursing students have characteristics of long time limit (one academic year), long line (multi-department rotation), wide distribution (nursing students in our hospital internship points distribute in more than 30 general hospitals in the province), there are more difficulties in teaching management of college internship. If the management is not proper, the internship results of nursing students will be greatly affected. How to arrange graduation clinical internship rationally, systematically manage graduated clinical internship scientifically and correctly, evaluate graduation clinical internship quality and improve students' clinical internship satisfaction is an important subject worth exploring.","[Jin, Xiaona] Xian Int Univ, Xian 710077, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",,"Jin, XN (通讯作者)，Xian Int Univ, Xian 710077, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",jinxiaonamv@163.com,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,10,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-463-7,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,53.0,,,,,,427,431,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL5MW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000452213200085,0

Striving for higher competitiveness and productivity, companies are looking beyond their current ways of outsourcing to create partnerships related to their core operations like research, development and innovation (RDI). Today and in future the success of distribution of knowledge intensive efforts in globally operated businesses is dictated by game changing capabilities such as quality of services, dynamic competence building of individuals and teams, as well as management of decentralized work. Yet, these are just examples of a larger spectrum of factors manifesting the dynamism of distributed software development. The DD-SCALE research program (2014-2016) has been targeted at investigating especially the aforementioned matters. The lack of feasible evaluation practises for explaining productivity of knowledge organizations in a comprehensive way has been an important driver. Managing and measuring productivity in the global settings of knowledge work has been in the focus of the program. Thus far, a baseline concept of the DD-SCALE evaluation framework, containing some 90 aggregated indicators, has been constructed. These Capability Indicators are related to individual, team and organizational capabilities, aiming to explain productivity in software engineering organizations. The development work was supported by context related theories concerning distributed knowledge work and Intellectual Capital (IC), which has been a key in capturing the less visible elements of productivity. Intellectual capital lenses were utilized in analysing interviews and workshops conducted with managerial level software RDI professionals in two globally operating case-companies. The contribution of this study is finding new dimensions for complementing the rather short-term input-output approach in assessing productivity. Also further elaboration about factors underpinning productivity in building a comprehensive evaluation framework is exercised. Eventually, the emphasis of this article is to bring forth the practical uses for the DD-SCALE evaluation framework. Initial instantiations of the framework include assessing 1) the influence a change in an organization's operation model has on software developers' perceptions, and 2) organizational impacts of technology transfer activities. As further research, the plan is to evaluate the comprehensiveness of the framework and advance its development into an actual tool to support managerial decision making.","[Kamaja, Pekka] Haaga Helia Univ Appl Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Loytty, Katriina; Ruohonen, Mikko; Ingalsuo, Timo] Univ Tampere, Sch Informat Sci, CIRCMI, Tampere, Finland",Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences; Tampere University,"Kamaja, P (通讯作者)，Haaga Helia Univ Appl Sci, Helsinki, Finland.",pekka.kamaja@haaga-helia.fi; katriina.loytty@uta.fi; mikko.j.ruohonen@uta.fi; timo.ingalsuo@uta.fi,,,,,,,38,0,0,0,1,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-911218-31-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2017,,,,,,,142,150,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI0KF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404891000018,0

A new Solvency II regulation is considered as an important step in the history of the European insurance market. It brings about changes in the view on the valuing process of assets and liabilities. This change, naturally, has to be transposed into the disclosure process and visualise in the financial statements. Technical reserves are kind of safety guarantee of fulfilment, which with regard to company liabilities are associated with signed contracts. A signed insurance contract represents a long-term commitment of an insurance company where its fulfilment value and timing are not certain not only for the company, but also from the policyholder's point of view. The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) and the International Accounting Standards Board seek to harmonise the requirements of the valuing process of an insurance company's assets and liabilities. The goal of this harmonisation is to ensure the consistency of mandatory data presentation in financial statements prepared on the basis of the IFRS.

Similar to the developed countries, structure of business enterprises is dominated by micro, small and medium-size enterprise. There are, also, different projects of entrepreneurial education within the higher education sector. The topic of this paper is how the students perceive the practical value of available knowledge and skills, as related to the potential entrepreneurial activity, after finishing the education. Authors analyze the entrepreneurial education from the aspects of the educational content and the methods of teaching. They also analyze students' perceptions, related to strengthening competences and skills, which can be associated to the entrepreneurial activity. The research has been conducted on a sample of the second year students. Its results show that the content and the approach of entrepreneurial education influence the positive perception of students, related to acquiring entrepreneurial competences and skills. The results can be useful for development of the entrepreneurial education system. They can be also used to initiate adequate measures of public support for educational institutions, as to develop a system of entrepreneurial education. Finally, they are a part of a methodological framework for assessment of entrepreneurial education efficiency in the institutions of higher education.","[Krneta, Mira] Split Reg Off, Croatian Bank Reconstruct & Dev, Split, Croatia; [Alfirevic, Ana Marija] Coll Appl Sci Marko Marulic, Knin, Croatia; [Rendulic, Darko] Karlovac Univ Appl Sci, Karlovac, Croatia",,"Krneta, M (通讯作者)，Split Reg Off, Croatian Bank Reconstruct & Dev, Split, Croatia.",mira.krneta@hbor.hr; anamarija.alfirevic@gmail.com; darkorendulic1@gmail.com,,,,,,,21,0,0,1,3,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2017,,,,,,,578,592,,,,,,15,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7PJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455302900036,0

In order to find a clean source of identification to assess the impact of reducing commuting costs for such individuals, we conducted a large and controlled experiment to study the impact of the intervention of subsidizing driving lessons in France by randomly assigning young candidates to one of two groups made up of treated and untreated individuals. We assessed the impact of improving their degree of mobility through this intervention on several outcomes, including drivers' testing results, housing, and employment status. We found that young people are less mobile during their training period, and therefore less involved in actively seeking employment or improving on their current position. Once they have passed the driving test, however, these findings are reversed. Finally, we do not discern any significant impact on the important outcome of access to permanent jobs, but we do find a positive yet weak effect on access to temporary jobs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

There are actually more ways of funding research and finding the optimal one requires constant monitoring and comparing models already used in practice. Countries in Europe, and even beyond, use different systems and combine them as well. Slovakia, as one of many countries, uses a performance-based model for funding universities and their research; universities have a possibility to propose research projects to four different agencies providing a competitive mechanism for supporting research and development in Slovakia. This paper analyses the support of two of those agencies (their support being very similar) in the period of 2007 - 2015 with regard to 18 public universities, and it answers the questions how allocation of resources among universities was provided, and whether there are any differences in funding from these two sources. The paper concludes that besides the amount of grants and concentration of one agency on better performers, there are indeed no significant differences in the way of funding or allocation of resources. Therefore, it suggests that it is worth to consider whether just one research and development supporting agency would be more efficient also in stimulating researchers to be more competitive.","[Leskova, Alexandra] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Lesková, A (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",alexandra.leskova@euba.sk,,,Slovak Research and Development Agency [APVV-14-0512],Slovak Research and Development Agency(Slovak Research and Development Agency),This paper was supported by the Slovak Research and Development Agency under the contract No. APVV-14-0512.,,14,0,0,0,2,VYDAVATELSTVO EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"DOLNOZENSKA CESTA 1-B, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-4429-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,277,286,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP5LI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000556157800033,0

However, due to a number of factors influencing the relations between the bodies, we can often observe a conflict instead. While the majority of existing studies use surveys as a method for measuring the level of conflict and cooperation in the local government, this paper proposes an alternative method of measurement and introduces a model of indicators of conflict that aims to capture the formal side of municipal politics more accurately than an indirect measurement of perception of conflict is able to. The indicators of conflict were selected by analyzing the legal framework within which the municipal bodies operate, considering the existing characterization of conflict in local government in literature and the use of individual indicators in previous research. Although the model is tailored to Slovak context and the structure and competencies of the bodies in Slovak municipalities, several of the indicators can be used as proposed or modified for the research of municipalities in other countries as well.","[Martin, Kollarik] Comenius Univ, Fac Social & Econ Sci, Bratislava, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Martin, K (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Fac Social & Econ Sci, Bratislava, Slovakia.",martin.kollarik@fses.uniba.sk,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,1,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",2336-1239,,978-80-210-8448-3,CURR TREND PUB SECT,,,2017,,,,,,,33,40,,,,,,8,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BH7FG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402427100004,0

The recent decline in life insurance activity calls for a study on the factors influencing life insurance demand in India. Design/methodology/approach - This study employs econometric techniques like augmented Dickey-Fuller test, Johansen cointegration test, vector error correction models and the Granger causality test to estimate the macroeconomic predictors of life insurance demand in India, during the period 1980-1981 to 2013-2014. Findings - Financial sector development and inflation positively influence life insurance demand in India. The real rate of interest and income are negatively related to life insurance consumption. The study finds an insignificant relation between the level of social security expenditure and life insurance buying. Financial sector development is found to Granger-cause life insurance demand. Research limitations/implications - Product-wise analysis of life insurance demand is not attempted due to lack of unit-level data. The impact of regulatory changes on life insurance demand in India is not attempted. Practical implications - Intervention by the policy makers is required to arrest the decline of life insurance activity in India. Efforts are required to widen the financial sector of the Indian economy to accelerate the growth of life insurance activity. Originality/value - The paper introduces a new measure of life insurance demand, the total regular new business premium, in the estimation of life insurance demand determination.","[Mathew, Biju; Sivaraman, Sunitha] Natl Inst Technol Calicut, Sch Management Studies, Kozhikode, India; [Mathew, Biju] Malabar Christian Coll, Dept Econ, Kozhikode, India",National Institute of Technology (NIT System); National Institute of Technology Calicut,"Mathew, B (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Technol Calicut, Sch Management Studies, Kozhikode, India.;Mathew, B (通讯作者)，Malabar Christian Coll, Dept Econ, Kozhikode, India.",4bijumathew@gmail.com,"MATHEW, BIJU/P-6074-2018","MATHEW, BIJU/0000-0001-5547-9280; Sivaraman, Sunitha/0000-0001-9976-207X",,,,,54,6,6,2,16,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

The research presents the structural labour supply model that allows estimating the effect of gains to work on the participation probabilities in Latvia, thereby the effect of the recent tax and benefit reforms on the changes of labour supply in Latvia. Gains to work are defined as the difference between net wage and the amount of lost benefits due to taking up a job. A classical Heckman model is used to impute the hypothetical wage for those actually not working on the basis of the observed employees' wage rates. The amount of benefits out of work are observed only for those who are not working, while the calculation of these measures for working individuals requires the detailed coding of the Latvian tax and benefit system provided by a tax and benefit microsimulation model EUROMOD. For the structural probit equation the author uses the same set of independent variables as in the selection equation of Heckman sample selection model, and, in addition, individual gains to work. The data used in the empirical analysis is the EU-SILC, years 2011-2015.

The life table provides a life distribution over an integer age, which gives us a very clear idea of the probability of death for each integer age. In the life insurance, the discrete integer year-end payment value can be accurately calculated, but want to pay in half a year or a shorter monthly payment, life table data cannot be met, and when using UDD assumptions, the monthly mortality It can be calculated according to the life table data, resulting in monthly payment value. Similarly, in the death insurance, the insurance company is generally the end of the year to pay the sum, and the occurrence of death is random, so the need to use UDD assumptions to calculate the value of life insurance at any time throughout the year. In the actuarial study of insurance, the probability distribution of death is difficult to find a suitable continuity model, so UDD assumes that we provide a relatively accurate and simple method, while UDD calculation method is more intuitive, allowing scholars to clearly understand the actuarial process. When calculating the life annuity, the model contains the mortality variable. When the mortality variable is equal to zero, the model is equal to the general annuity, indicating that the general annuity is a special case of life annuity.","[Qi Shixiong] Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Hangzhou 31008, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Fu Bincheng] Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Insurance Dept, Hangzhou 31008, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University of Finance & Economics; Zhejiang University of Finance & Economics,"Fu, BC (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Insurance Dept, Hangzhou 31008, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",bxqsx@126.com; 1416264898@qq.com,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,,,,,2017,,,,,,,526,538,,,,,,13,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK8HD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000442810700037,0

Bioenergy development is especially important for Sverdlovsk region as the region is rich in forest (the forest cover in Russia is 68.6 percent). Therefore, for Ural region and Sverdlovsk region, in particular, the issues of processing wood waste into fuel and promoting the use of alternative sources of energy are more relevant than ever. The authors conducted a marketing research on the prospects of bioenergy development on the basis of the use of wood fuel. It is revealed that the categorical apparatus of marketing and market research in this industry is at a stage of active formation.

Spillovers to neighbouring (untreated) mothers can be through social learning or imitation. Results from a difference-in-differences analysis show that nutritional knowledge measured through a quiz increases among neighbouring untreated mothers relative to a control group. Neighbouring mothers exhibit learning spillovers, changes in dietary behaviour and a reduction in food expenditure regardless of their level of literacy. Spillovers not only raise the cost effectiveness of health information programmes but are important to consider when designing an experiment as causal effects of treatments can be attenuated if the spillover group is used as a control group.","[Singh, Prakarsh] Amherst Coll, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01002 USA",Amherst College,"Singh, P (通讯作者)，Amherst Coll, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01002 USA.",psingh@amherst.edu,,,UK Department for International Development (DFID); Department of Economics at LSE; Asia Research Centre,UK Department for International Development (DFID); Department of Economics at LSE; Asia Research Centre,"This paper is an output from research funding by the UK Department for International Development (DFID) as part of the iiG, a research programme to study how to improve institutions for pro-poor growth in Africa and South-Asia.

The utmost importance is given to answering the following question: How do the crashes involving aging drivers vary compared to crashes involving other age groups? To achieve this objective, a three-step spatial analysis was conducted using geographic information systems (GIS) with a case study application on three urban counties in the Northwest Florida region, based on crash data obtained from the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT). First, crash clusters were investigated using a kernel density estimation (KDE) approach. Second, a crash density ratio difference (DRD) measure was proposed for comparing maxima-normalized crash densities for two different age groups. Third, a population factor (PF) was developed in order to investigate effect of spatial dependency by incorporating the effect of both number and percent of 65+ populations in a region. This spatial analysis was followed by a logistic regression-based approach in order to identify the statistically significant factors that can help investigate the distinct patterns of crashes involving aging drivers. Results of this study indicate that crashes involving aging drivers differ from other age group crashes both spatially and temporally. Further, the DRD and PF fattors are useful metrics to identify and investigate important regions of study. The GIS-based knowledge gained from this research can contribute to the development of more reliable aging-focused safety plans and models. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

According to SAWS statistics, major accidents occurring every year in the two cases above between 2013 and 2015. Due to the risk of major accidents in the high degree of concentration of matter and energy, the accident led to huge direct and indirect economic losses which the amount is often shocking. On account of the limited traditional insurance market, accident compensation cannot meet the requirements for damages particularly significant risk. Third Plenary Session of the party's eighteen requirements to promote national governance systems and governance modernization. If the management for the major accident risk could be promoted to the governance level, it is bound to favor the accident loss evaluation system, integrated collaborative governance, deepening the crisis management and the maintenance of social stability. In this paper, the risk of major accidents assesses by a Bayesian network model. Bayesian network is a common model of the system feasibility. Bayesian networks require detailed conditions given in transition probability between each node. We draw the entire system before the accident as a system. The occurrence of major accidents proof that the system reliability comes down. Through the establishment of a hierarchical Bayesian network model, we solve the particular risk of major accidents system reliability function and to derive the critical value of the crisis. And on this basis, considering repair of the system, we collect data censored by the timing and the number scheduled, to take strategy of repairing the old as old and repair the old as new, improving system reliability. At the same time, we select the administrative, equipment, education as externally observable characteristics of key data indicators, establishing degradation model to the performance of soft accident. When an accident occurs, the system is still working. But system performance cannot achieve reliability requirements. When computing the probability of soft accident occurred, we highlight the impact of the human factor. This article focuses on the perpetrator's liability risks. Our responsibility is to deal with the risk of civil liability of legal institutional arrangements. Civil liability is the legal responsibility of a compensatory nature and the compensation liability is reflected in the property, pursuing a no harm, no compensation, which shall not be more than harm principle. When we argue that the establishment of public liability insurance helps to defuse the risk of major accidents, the insurance companies underwriting the insured engaged in production or other activities in a fixed place or location, due to an accident caused when the law should bear the damage to property or injuries to others liability. Finally, we propose the regulation sound legal system for a basis of liability insurance, the establishment of major accident public liability insurance to rich insurance products, periodic quantitative detection of soft accident to timely warning the responsible party.","[Wang Shubin] Jiangsu Univ, Sch Finance & Econ, Zhenjiang 212013, Peoples R China",Jiangsu University,"Wang, SB (通讯作者)，Jiangsu Univ, Sch Finance & Econ, Zhenjiang 212013, Peoples R China.",wangsoobin@163.com,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,6,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,,,,,2017,,,,,,,308,318,,,,,,11,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK8HD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000442810700022,0

Findings - The author finds that inward joint venture experience interacts with CEO ownership and CEO duality, respectively, to have a negative impact on the selection of high-equity mode.

Firstly, it is concluded that docking these two strategies is a necessary requirement due to the latest global economic background, offering golden opportunities for China and Russia to cooperate further for economic development, as well as benefiting the countries along these two economic belts. Secondly, it is feasible to dock these two strategies from the geopolitical point of view. Meanwhile, the common goal of Russia and China for pursuing national economic benefits and the abundant practical experiences of cooperation between these two countries can greatly enhance the possibility of the success in docking two economic belts. Policy recommendations are given accordingly.","[Xu, Haiping] Shanghai Univ, SHU UTS SILC Business Sch, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ye] Chinese Acad Sci, Zhejiang Inst Adv Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China",Shanghai University; Chinese Academy of Sciences,"Xu, HP (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ, SHU UTS SILC Business Sch, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",,"xu, haiping/GSJ-1374-2022",,"National Social Science Fund of China [15BJL080, 14AGJ006]",National Social Science Fund of China,This paper is supported by the National Social Science Fund of China (No. 15BJL080 and No. 14AGJ006).,,15,0,0,1,5,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-405-7,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,37.0,,,,,,241,251,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ9PC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000429699600016,0

These sources of uncertainty and stress render expectant mothers susceptible to the influence of popular beliefs. We design an experiment to evaluate the widespread Israeli belief that a baby's room should remain unfurnished until after the baby is born. We test the impact of this belief on the economic decisions of pregnant Jewish women in Israel. Our findings show that many pregnant women, especially in the second half of pregnancy, prefer to avoid challenging popular beliefs - even at a financial cost. The negative affective consequences of tempting fate lead to a preference for a small monetary amount over new furniture for the newborn. The strength of popular beliefs and its influence on individual choice vary in accordance with ethnicity and degree of religiosity.","[Bayer, Ya'akov M.] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Beer Sheva Mental Hlth Ctr, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Bayer, Ya'akov M.] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Hlth Syst Management, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Ruffle, Bradley J.] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Shtudiner, Zeev] Ariel Univ, Dept Econ & Business Adm, Ariel, Israel; [Zultan, Ro'i] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Econ, Beer Sheva, Israel",Ben Gurion University; Ben Gurion University; Wilfrid Laurier University; Ariel University; Ben Gurion University,"Bayer, YM (通讯作者)，Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Beer Sheva Mental Hlth Ctr, Beer Sheva, Israel.;Bayer, YM (通讯作者)，Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Hlth Syst Management, Beer Sheva, Israel.",ymebayer@gmail.com,"Ruffle, Bradley/ITT-0251-2023; Zultan, Ro'i/C-8353-2012; Bayer, Ya'akov/U-7529-2019; Shtudiner, Zeev/AAB-1419-2020","Ruffle, Bradley/0000-0002-7122-9414; Zultan, Ro'i/0000-0002-4256-8601; Shtudiner, Zeev/0000-0003-1471-3565; Bayer, Yaakov M./0000-0002-3096-261X",Ben-Gurion University of the Negev,Ben-Gurion University of the Negev,"The research reported in this paper was part of Ya'akov Bayer's Ph.D. dissertation at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.

The technology in question is a small, portable palm oil expeller invented in Cameroon in the 1980 s. The technology was designed to increase the productivity of small farmers and create employment opportunities by increasing local capacity for small-scale palm oil processing. The expeller was subsequently promoted in Benin and Liberia over a period of nearly two decades. This evaluation is based on archival research of institutional records, data from impact surveys of technology users in all three countries during the project periods, and field research in Liberia in 2011 and 2013. The study analyzes and evaluates the social, economic, and environmental impacts of the expeller over the long term, comparatively, across a broad geographic area. In terms of social and economic impacts, the technology consistently increased incomes for farmers and small enterprises. The use of the technology altered relationships of production, particularly with regard to the role of women in palm oil processing and their control over resources. Environmental impacts of the technology are geographically dispersed and include increased water usage and pollution. Ultimately the technology in question has also contributed to political impacts over time by exacerbating conflicts between small farmers, palm oil corporations, and governments. This study confirms that comparative, longitudinal evaluation research can reveal important dimensions of development impacts. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Off-label prescribing increases when there are fewer FDA-approved alternatives and a patient's insurance has less restrictive formularies and lower copayments. The temporal increase in off-label use coincides with a surge in settlements of Department of Justice (DOJ) lawsuits for off-label marketing. Those drugs targeted by the DOJ have 4.6% higher rates of off-label use initially, but the rate decreases 10.2% after the company becomes aware of the suit. The welfare effects of such regulatory intervention are unclear because we find off-label prescribing patterns by physicians that are consistent with enhancement of patient welfare.","[Bradford, W.

Building upon the Schumpeter meeting Keynes family of models (cf. in particular Dosi et al. (2016b, 2017c)), we specify an endogenous process of accumulation of workers' skills and a state-dependent process of firms entry. Indeed, hysteresis is ubiquitous. However, this is not due to market imperfections, but rather to the very functioning of decentralized economies characterized by coordination externalities and dynamic increasing returns. So, contrary to the insider-outsider hypothesis (Blanchard and Summers, 1986), the model does not support the findings that rigid industrial relations may foster hysteretic behavior in aggregate unemployment. On the contrary, this contribution provides evidence that during severe downturns, and thus declining aggregate demand, phenomena like decreasing investment and innovation rates, skills deterioration, and declining entry dynamics are better candidates to explain long-run unemployment spells and reduced output growth. In that, more rigid labor markets may well dampen hysteretic dynamics by sustaining aggregate demand, thus making the economy more resilient.","[Dosi, G.; Pereira, M.

It was then reproduced in the author's mimeographed book Introduction to welfare economics, published by the Thomas Jefferson Center of the University of Virginia in 1961. In the old welfare economics, three fundamental approaches may be distinguished. Pareto's ophelimity requires that someone is made better off and no one is made worse off. A similar problem is present both in Wicksell, by the rule of the unanimous consent of the electorate representative, and in the Italian School of Public Finance that requires an open competition aimed at assembling a majority that pursues a similar solution. Finally, Pigou's paternalistic approach combines maximum national income with its optimal distribution. In the new welfare economics, the approach in terms of Pareto's compensation principle does not generate a stable equilibrium; the social welfare function approach formalizes Pigou's approach with the inclusion of paternalistic value judgements. The way out consists in combining Paretian ordinal choice with Wicksellian unanimity, with the Italian school's suggestion of competition in collective choices, or with both.","[Forte, Francesco] Sapienza Univ Roma, Fac Econ, Dipartimento Econ & Diritto, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Forte, F (通讯作者)，Sapienza Univ Roma, Fac Econ, Dipartimento Econ & Diritto, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy.",francesco.forte@uniroma1.it,,,"Thomas Jefferson Center for Studies in Political Economy, University of Virginia Charlottesville, Virginia","Thomas Jefferson Center for Studies in Political Economy, University of Virginia Charlottesville, Virginia","I wish to acknowledge James Buchanan, Ronald Coase, Warren Nutter, W.

This study considers five types of financial crises and seven dimensions of financial policy reform to evaluate the comprehensive relationships between financial crises and financial policy reform by assuming a financial crisis as an endogenous variable. Our work confirms the crisis-begets-reform argument in the context of financial liberalization by showing that all types of financial crises promote financial liberalization even when possible endogeneity problems are addressed. However, financial policy reform following financial crises does not generally include the strengthening of prudential regulation. Given the argument that financial liberalization without prudential regulation often causes financial instability or crises, our findings emphasize that policy makers should pay attention not only to financial liberalization but also to prudential regulation. Moreover, the results show that the origin of a financial crisis matters when financial regulators choose the policy dimensions of financial reform.","[Hlaing, Su Wah; Kakinaka, Makoto] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Int Dev & Cooperat, 1-5-1 Kagamiyama, Higashihiroshima, Hiroshima 7398529, Japan",Hiroshima University,"Hlaing, SW (通讯作者)，Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Int Dev & Cooperat, 1-5-1 Kagamiyama, Higashihiroshima, Hiroshima 7398529, Japan.",suwahhlaing@hiroshima-u.ac.jp; kakinaka@hiroshima-u.ac.jp,"Kakinaka, Makoto/O-2150-2015","Kakinaka, Makoto/0000-0003-2349-1976",,,,,87,15,15,16,91,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

A country's system of law and order enables or constrains the implementation of government policies, and consequently influences whether the size of government responds to changes in FDI inflows and outflows. We test this hypothesis by fitting a semiparametric model of government consumption to a panel of developed and developing countries with within-country variation. Over a short data frequency, the average compensating response of governments in developing countries to an increase in FDI inflows is larger by a factor of five than that of developed countries. These significant level effects of FDI inflows are driven by law and order and are adjusted for differences in per capita income across countries. The larger the compensating response of a government, the bigger is the constraining effect of a stronger system of law and order. The efficiency hypothesis seems empirically valid for developing countries with a moderate system of law and order. Over a long data frequency, we find a strong (negative) link between FDI inflows and government consumption, and increases in law and order weaken this link. For both data frequencies, FDI outflows have no level effect on government consumption, whereas the empirical regularity of strong and robust inertia in government consumption exists in all countries.","[McCloud, Nadine] Univ West Indies Mona, Dept Econ, Kingston 7, Jamaica; [Delgado, Michael S.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA; [Holmes, Chanit'a] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, POB 6000, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA",University West Indies Mona Jamaica; Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton,"McCloud, N (通讯作者)，Univ West Indies Mona, Dept Econ, Kingston 7, Jamaica.",nadine.mccloud02@uwimona.edu.jm; delgado2@purdue.edu; chanita.holmes@gmail.com,,,,,,,59,5,5,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

Using a nationally representative longitudinal panel of American teenagers and their parents, two questions related to the probability of teenage parenthood are examined. First, how do predictions of this occurrence made by the teenager's parents vary across the population? Second, how does the accuracy of these predictions vary? The actual prevalence and variance of teenage parenthood are also examined, and the determinants of its occurrence are estimated. Among other results, expectations and their accuracy are found to differ substantially across socioeconomic status and some demographics such as race and religion. The average American parent underestimates the probability their child will become a teen parent by only a small amount, but within certain demographic groups this outcome is considerably underestimated, and in others it is overestimated. These differences help explain the variability in teen parenthood effects, and more broadly, the analysis serves as a test of parents' ability to judge their childrens' future outcomes.","[Routon, P.

Yet participation into capital markets is limited and quite heterogonous both among and within several countries. This phenomenon represents an empirical puzzle whose understanding is rather incomplete. In this work, we exploited a combination of datasets for nine European countries and used different econometric specifications that allow to control for endogeneity of financial literacy and human capital, to assess the role of several variables in affecting the probability to participate in the stock market in year 2010. Besides socio-demographic variables, we found that financial literacy has a positive and significant effect on stock market participation, together with the level of human capital and social interaction. Country level differences are explained by such institutional factors as the effectiveness of the education system and by the attractiveness of the stock markets.","[Thomas, Ashok] Indian Inst Management, Kozhikode, India; [Spataro, Luca] Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Econ & Management, Publ Econ, Via C Ridolfi 10, I-56124 Pisa, Italy",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Kozhikode; University of Pisa,"Spataro, L (通讯作者)，Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Econ & Management, Publ Econ, Via C Ridolfi 10, I-56124 Pisa, Italy.",ashok.thomas@iimk.ac.in; luca.spataro@unipi.it,"Spataro, Luca/AAD-9002-2020","Spataro, Luca/0000-0002-5202-8879",,,,,60,33,35,7,58,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

Imitation benefited consumers by increasing product variety and reducing prices but also limited Volkswagen to 14% of potential profits from the TDI. Volkswagen's ability to differentiate its diesel models made the TDI a worthwhile investment nonetheless.

This article has two main objectives: (1) to introduce the basics of expert elicitations, including their design and implementation, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages and their potential to inform policymaking and energy system decisions; and (2) to discuss and compare the results of a subset of the most recent expert elicitations on energy technologies, with a focus on future cost trajectories and implied cost reduction rates.

J,"Coussi, O; Faccin, K; Balestrin, A",,,,"Coussi, Olivier; Faccin, Kadigia; Balestrin, Alsones",,,Foreign direct investment in an emerging country: a Brazilian case of a triple helix as practice,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING MARKETS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Brazil; Foreign direct investment (FDI); Strategy as practice; Emerging country; Triple helix; Territory management,STRATEGY-AS-PRACTICE; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; JOINT VENTURES; FDI; INNOVATION; DISTANCE; SYSTEMS; PERFORMANCE; CONSTRUCTS; CHALLENGES,"Purpose The purpose of this purpose is to understand the territorial management process behind the implementation and anchoring of a foreign direct investment (FDI) project in an emerging country during its project life cycle. This research contributes to the strategy as practice and triple helix research fields. Design/methodology/approach The authors use qualitative and single-case research with secondary public sources and confirmatory interviews. The case is related to the process of implementing and anchoring a joint venture in the semiconductor industry between a South Korean company and a Brazilian company. The relations between the university, the companies and the government are analyzed in terms of supporting territorial attractiveness. Findings Viewing the attraction of FDI in collaborative terms provides new empirical evidence and explanations of the phenomenon. From this single-case study, the authors can offer the following research propositions, which can be further developed and tested: P1 - the use of a triple helix strategy is an attractive factor when applying an exogenous investment; P2: the entrepreneurial university is an attractive factor when applying an exogenous investment; and P3: contemporary public policies must be involved in complex networks with the community to achieve success when locating and anchoring an exogenous investment. Research limitations/implications One of the main limitations is linked to the secondary data sources for the reconstruction of the case narrative. Secondary data sources omit important details when reporting events. The authors tried to overcome this limitation by using multiple sources and providing different types and breadth of details; for the triangulation stage, the authors held interviews to confirm the data collected in the newspapers and to look for details that could have passed unnoticed. Additionally, it should be noted that the confirmatory interviews were retrospective. An intensive interview promotes the clarification of each participant's interpretation of his or her own experience and therefore represents a very useful method for interpretative research. However, the limitation is that between the experience and the date of the interviews, the interviewee undergoes many other experiences, learning and contexts that modify his or her point of view and way of interpreting what happened in the past. Finally, in this study, the authors have chosen a Gioia method template rather than an Eisenhardt template (Langley and Abdallah, 2011) and one impression may be the result of a limitation of this template, as pointed out by Langley and Abdallah (2011) This template has limitations too. One potential limitation that seems, however, not to have hindered these researchers concerns the challenge of convincing readers about the transferability and relevance of the findings given the propensity to study single cases. In an interpretive research, it is argued that it is the depth of contextual detail in a case study that provides the understanding necessary for a reader to judge whether the theoretical implication is pertinent. Practical implications This paper presents a case of success in attracting FDI in emerging countries. The authors emphasize the mechanisms, agreements and difficulties experienced by the government and the local community involved in the management process for the implementation and anchoring of an FDI project. This study offers a valuable resource for FDI attraction for public sector managers and society members. The management of the implementation process of an FDI project life cycle leads to a territorial triple helix model that can be used by emerging countries to promote sustainable economic development in high-tech industries. By choosing the theoretical choice of narrative, the authors have a better understanding of the process for anchoring FDI because the authors can identify key events and present information on how territories develop their policies. Social implications The example of the Brazilian experience in the management of the FDI anchor of the semiconductor industry implies a series of learning for the emerging economies, particularly in terms of the possibility to discover new features to increase the attractiveness of their FDIs. Usually when the authors think about or consult the literature on attracting and anchoring FDI projects, the authors find that countries are concerned about market size, trade openness or interest rate data. However, in the case of HT Micron, an unknown or untouched criterion can be added: the collaboration between the agents of society. Originality/value The present research challenges the linear views of project life and displays a successful project that follows a quite different path. This study is original because it provides public sector managers and society members with a valuable resource for FDI implementation and anchoring. Usually when the authors think about or consult the literature on attracting and anchoring FDI projects, the authors find that countries are concerned about market size, trade openness or interest rate data. However, in the HT Micron case, it is possible to add an unknown or untouched criterion: the collaboration between agents of society.","[Coussi, Olivier] Univ Poitiers, Business Management Inst, Poitiers, France; [Faccin, Kadigia; Balestrin, Alsones] Univ Vale Rio dos Sinos Unisinos, Sch Business, Sao Leopoldo, Brazil",Universite de Poitiers; Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos (Unisinos),"Faccin, K (通讯作者)，Univ Vale Rio dos Sinos Unisinos, Sch Business, Sao Leopoldo, Brazil.",olivier.coussi@univ-poitiers.fr; kadigia.estagios@gmail.com; abalestrin@unisinos.br,"Faccin, Kadígia/AAC-5410-2019; Balestrin, Alsones/B-2202-2013","Faccin, Kadígia/0000-0003-2804-2328; Balestrin, Alsones/0000-0001-6397-1582",,,,,97,8,8,2,55,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Design/methodology/approach Herfindahl-Hirschman Index concentration scales were used to categorise industries into competitive, moderate and concentrated segments, while Arbitrage Pricing Model principles were used to capture the effect of macroeconomic fundamentals on ROE. Generalised method of moments estimator was used to model random effects which were supported by the Hausman test. Findings Findings suggest that the influence of macroeconomic fundamentals on ROE deteriorates as one moves from competitive to concentrated industries. ROE is volatile in concentrated markets and less volatile in competitive markets. Concentrated markets generally enjoy monopoly profits. Gross domestic product and interest rates have a positive impact on ROE, while inflation, unemployment and exchange rates have a negative effect. Originality/value This study highlights the need to apply appropriate business strategies and policies depending on the structure of the industry. Competitive advantage strategies may assist in sustaining profits of firms in competitive markets. Regulators need to be proactive and stress test the impact of a policy on industry performance before implementation because competitive and concentrated markets react differently to external shocks. Risk tolerant investors may invest in volatile markets such as Russia and South Africa, while risk-averse investors may prefer to invest in less volatile markets such as India and China.","[Ndlovu, Chiedza] Univ Witwatersrand, Fac Commerce Management & Law, Wits Business Sch, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Alagidede, Paul] Univ Witwatersrand, Grad Sch Business Adm, Finance, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand; University of Witwatersrand,"Ndlovu, C (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Fac Commerce Management & Law, Wits Business Sch, Johannesburg, South Africa.",tjedza.mathiya@gmail.com; paul.alagidede@wits.ac.za,,,,,,,46,9,11,3,26,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

In our extended model, the central banker monitors a weighted average of revised and real-time inflation. Moreover, we allow for an asymmetric central bank focus on real-time inflation depending on whether the unemployment rate is high or low. Our model identifies a source of inflation bias due to inflation revisions. Our empirical results suggest that the Federal Reserve Bank focuses on monitoring revised inflation during low unemployment periods, but it weights real-time inflation heavily during high unemployment periods. In contrast, the Bank of England seems to focus on an equally-weighted average of real-time and revised inflation when monitoring inflation which is fairly robust over the business cycle.","[Aguirre, Idoia; Vazquez, Jesus] Univ Pais Vasco UPV EHU, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ 2, Ave Lehendakari Aguirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain",University of Basque Country,"Vázquez, J (通讯作者)，Univ Pais Vasco UPV EHU, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ 2, Ave Lehendakari Aguirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain.",idoia.aguirre@ehu.es; jesus.vazquez@ehu.es,"; Vazquez, Jesus/D-3067-2019","Aguirre, Idoia/0000-0002-0572-7124; Vazquez, Jesus/0000-0003-4788-4838","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [BES-2013-063151, ECO2016-78749P]; Basque Government (Spain) [IT793-13]",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); Basque Government (Spain)(Basque Government),"We thank Steve Cassou, Dean Croushore and Gabriel Perez-Quiros for helpful comments on early stages of this project.

After accounting for the intraday periodicity in absolute returns, we discover some statistically significant co-movements of intraday volatility and information from stock-related Tweets for all constituents of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. However, economically, the effects are of negligible magnitude and out-of-sample forecast performance is not improved when including Twitter sentiment and activity as exogenous variables. From a practical point of view, we find that high-frequency Twitter information is not particularly useful for highly active investors with access to such data for intraday volatility assessment and forecasting when considering individual-level stocks.

We incorporate capital requirements and loan-to-value regulation into this framework, and subject the model to a positive foreign interest rate shock that raises the country risk premium and reduces the supply of foreign funds. The results show that both these macro prudential instruments can attenuate the impact of such a shock and that their joint application is Pareto optimal. Loan-to-value regulation delivers the largest shock attenuation benefits but entail a welfare tradeoff between borrowers and savers. Capital requirements improve the welfare of both agents, but have smaller shock attenuation benefits.

A reappraisal,REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,OPTIMUM TARIFFS; RETALIATION,"In their seminal paper, Kennan and Riezman () show that a sufficiently big country is better off under a tariff war compared to free trade. This prediction derived in a setting where market power stems from differences in factor endowments, is somehow puzzling, as the majority of free trade agreements notified to the GATT/WTO are initiated by large rather than small economies. To resolve this puzzle, I use a modified version of the Kennan and Riezman () model to show that the outcomes of a tariff war depend not only on countries' endowment sizes, but also on consumption requirements. In particular, free trade benefits two asymmetric countries if the subsistence level of consumption in the large country is sufficiently higher than in the small country. In addition, free trade between symmetric countries may harm the country with a lower subsistence level of consumption. The theoretical framework presented in this paper supports the idea that even small countries enjoy some market power and thus helps understand why large economies seek free trade in natural resources with smaller commercial partners.","[Kilolo, Jean-Marc Malambwe] UPN, Route Matadi,Ave Liberat Quartier Binza,BP 8815, Kinshasa, DEM REP CONGO",,"Kilolo, JMM (通讯作者)，UPN, Route Matadi,Ave Liberat Quartier Binza,BP 8815, Kinshasa, DEM REP CONGO.",malambwe@yahoo.com,"Kilolo, Jean-Marc Malambwe/AAU-1967-2021","Kilolo, Jean-Marc Malambwe/0000-0001-7671-2360",,,,,11,5,5,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Since treatment effect estimates are often prone to misspecification in either the treatment or outcome equation, we use the doubly robust inverse probability weighted regression adjustment method, complemented with propensity score matching on six different food security measures to obtain reliable impact estimates. Generally, we find a positive impact of improved maize adoption on food security across the two econometric approaches. Maize being the most important food staple in Zambia has a great bearing on the food security status of farm households. It is therefore imperative that a conducive environment is created that promotes the adoption of maize yield improving technologies.","[Manda, Julius; Alene, Arega D.] Int Inst Trop Agr, POB 30528, Lilongwe, Malawi; [Gardebroek, Cornelis] Wageningen Univ, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Kuntashula, Elias] Univ Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia",Wageningen University & Research; University of Zambia,"Manda, J (通讯作者)，Int Inst Trop Agr, POB 30528, Lilongwe, Malawi.",j.manda@cgiar.org,,"Manda, Julius/0000-0002-9599-5906",USAID/Zambia; project called Sustainable Intensification of Maize-Legume Systems for the Eastern Province of Zambia (SIMLEZA),USAID/Zambia(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); project called Sustainable Intensification of Maize-Legume Systems for the Eastern Province of Zambia (SIMLEZA),The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from USAID/Zambia.

The focus is on the spike in international food and fuel prices in 2008 and the subsequent shock to global demand, known as the Global Economic Crisis (GEC). Using a unique retrospective cross-section survey, the results show that experience of these shocks was widespread across urban and rural areas. Households with more education, access to income-generating activitiesparticularly in the informal sectorand greater wealth were best placed to withstand a deterioration in their well-being, measured as a fall in self-reported disposable income. Households also employed a variety of coping strategies in response to the shocks. Local food gardens and informal insurance are seen as key safety nets in times of stress, yet neither provided full insurance from the shocks. Some households, particularly in urban areas, employed harmful coping strategies, such as reducing spending on health, education, and food. While potentially effective in withstanding a temporary fall in disposable income, these responses are likely to weaken overall resilience and leave households vulnerable to future shocks.","[McDonald, Lachlan] RMIT Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"McDonald, L (通讯作者)，Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, Level 11,Bldg 80,445 Swanston St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",plachlan88@gmail.com,,"McDonald, Lachlan/0000-0003-4839-8102",,,,,58,4,4,2,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

The thesis of democratic advantage has been under careful scrutiny and empirical evidence is notoriously inconclusive. One topic that has drawn extensive scholarly attention is democratic institutions as a source of comparative advantage in international trade. Using a new data set that covers around 140 countries from 1962 to 2010, we find that on average, democratic countries have the comparative advantage in exporting differentiated products, which reflects lower transaction costs in trade and higher economic complexity. Echoing literature on electoral autocracy, we also make the distinction between different subtypes of authoritarian regimes. Similarly, authoritarian countries with electoral institutions have the comparative advantage in exporting differentiated products relative to other authoritarian countries, though the magnitude is much smaller and inconsistent over time. Our results are robust to a large set of control variables and multiple model specifications. In sum, our paper provides new insights into the relationship between democracy and trade and complements existing literature on the effect of authoritarian institutions on economic development.

The three share an ambitious innovation organization model, operating as public sector intermediaries between science and industry to pursue mission-oriented, high-risk/high-reward, breakthrough research. They also actively promote the follow-on development and implementation of technologies they support in their mission areas, achieving what has been termed mission innovation. They are therefore much more activist than more standard American R&D agencies, which do not pursue conscious technology strategies oriented to specific mission technology challenges. The three ARPA agencies tend to operate as change agents within the often conservative legacy sectors they operate within-defense, energy, and intelligence. Within the context of the overall US innovation system, DARPA and IARPA are leading examples of what can be termed the extended pipeline model, while ARPA-E is located within a more traditional R&D pipeline model agency, the DOE, trying to reach further down the innovation pipeline. All face the types of innovation barriers common to legacy sectors, which further challenge their efforts to implement their innovations. Despite these challenges, this ARPA model has proven quite dynamic; DARPA has an unparalleled record of technological advance, and the other two are rapidly building their own records. ARPA-E and IARPA show that the DARPA model is now a proven one in the innovation space, clearly relevant for consideration in other technology development mission sectors.","[Bonvillian, William B.] MIT, Dept Polit Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Bonvillian, William B.] MIT, Dept Sci Technol & Soc, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Bonvillian, WB (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Polit Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;Bonvillian, WB (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Sci Technol & Soc, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",bonvill@mit.edu,,,,,,,55,23,25,2,55,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

We find that the Big Five personality traits have a statistically significant and economically important effect: households with a more agreeable, introvert, and less conscientious head of household are more likely to co-hold. We also examine the role of intra-household dynamics.","[Choi, Hwan-sik] SUNY Binghamton, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA; [Laschever, Ron A.] Compass Lexecon, Washington, DC USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton,"Choi, HS (通讯作者)，SUNY Binghamton, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.",,,,,,,,73,8,8,2,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

This paper investigates how aggregate risk aversion and risk premiums in the crude oil market covary with the level of speculation. Using crude oil futures and option data, we estimate aggregate risk aversion in the crude oil market and find that it is significantly lower between 2005 and 2008 when speculative activity increases dramatically. Risk premiums implied by the state-dependent risk aversion are also negatively correlated with speculative activity and are on average lower and more volatile during this period. These findings, together with the increased index fund and managed-money infusion in the commodity market, suggest that speculators who demand commodity futures for the purpose of portfolio diversification are willing to accept lower compensation for their positions. Decreasing speculation after 2009 amid increased producers' hedging demand has a reverse impact on the market risk aversion and risk premiums. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this paper is to provide empirical evidence on the effect of the EU ETS on firm-level economic performance. There is a growing body of empirical literature that investigates the effects of the EU ETS on firm economic performance, with mixed results. Differently from the previous literature, we test the effect of the EU ETS on a larger set of indicators of economic performance: employment, average wages, turnover, value added, markup, investment, labour productivity, total factor productivity and ROI. Our results, based on a large panel of European firms, provide a broad picture of the economic impact of the EU ETS in its first and second phases of implementation. Contrarily to the expectations, the EU ETS did not affect economic performance negatively. Results suggest that firms have reacted to the EU ETS by passing-through costs to their customers on the one hand and improving labour productivity on the other hand.","[Marin, Giovanni] Univ Urbino Carlo Bo, Dept Econ Soc & Polit, Urbino, Italy; [Marin, Giovanni] SEEDS, Ferrara, Italy; [Marino, Marianna] ICN Business Sch, Dept Strategy & Entrepreneurship, Nancy, France; [Marino, Marianna] Univ Lorraine, France Bur Econ Theor & Appl BETA, Nancy, France; [Pellegrin, Claudia] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Coll Management Technol CEMI CDM, Chair Econ & Management Innovat, Odyssea 4-16 Stn 5, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Urbino; Universite de Lorraine; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne,"Pellegrin, C (通讯作者)，Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Coll Management Technol CEMI CDM, Chair Econ & Management Innovat, Odyssea 4-16 Stn 5, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",giovanni.marin@uniurb.it; marianna.marino@icn-groupe.fr; claudia.pellegrin@epfl.ch,"Marin, Giovanni/A-1917-2014","Marin, Giovanni/0000-0002-7396-1561",,,,,31,56,60,11,73,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Most of the time, disaster recovery efforts produce net benefits to society. However, depending on their design and governance, some projects can germinate adverse social, political, and economic outcomes. Drawing from concepts in political economy, political ecology, justice theory, and critical development studies, this study first presents a conceptual typology revolving around four key processes: enclosure, exclusion, encroachment, and entrenchment. Enclosure refers to when disaster recovery transfers public assets into private hands or expands the roles of private actors into the public sphere. Exclusion refers to when disaster recovery limits access to resources or marginalizes particular stakeholders in decision-making activities. Encroachment refers to when efforts intrude on biodiversity areas or contribute to other forms of environmental degradation. Entrenchment refers to when disaster recovery aggravates the disempowerment of women and minorities, or worsens concentrations of wealth and income inequality within a community. The study then documents the presence of these four inequitable attributes across four empirical case studies: Hurricane Katrina reconstruction in the United States, recovery efforts for the 2004 tsunami in Thailand, Typhoon Yolanda in the Philippines, and the Canterbury earthquakes in New Zealand. It next offers three policy recommendations for analysts, program managers, and researchers at large: spreading risks via insurance, adhering to principles of free prior informed consent, and preventing damage through punitive environmental bonds. The political economy of disaster must be taken into account so that projects can maximize their efficacy and avoid marginalizing those most vulnerable to those very disasters.

In this paper, I study special servicers in commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), which sell distressed assets on behalf of bondholders. Around 2010, ownership changes of four major servicers raised concerns that they may direct benefits to new owners' affiliates (buyers and service providers). Loans liquidated after ownership changes have greater loss rates than before (8 percentage points (p.p.), $2.3 billion in losses), relative to other (placebo) servicers. Together with a case study that tracks self-dealing purchases, the findings point to potential steering conflicts that could incentivize tunneling through fees to service providers.","[Wong, Maisy] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Wong, M (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",,,,Zell/Lurie Real Estate Center at Wharton; Jacobs Levy Grant; Wharton Dean's Research Fund,Zell/Lurie Real Estate Center at Wharton; Jacobs Levy Grant; Wharton Dean's Research Fund,"I am grateful to Fernando Ferreira, Joe Clyourko, and Todd Sinai for their advice.

Permanent or temporary out-migration can provide an individual or family the opportunity to mitigate against these effects. One major challenge to quantifying the impact of climate change on out-migration is lack of appropriate spatial and temporal data. Out-migration data must be adequately detailed to include both long- and short-term departures. The climate data must provide fine scale, community-specific detail. To examine the climate variability as a factor of out-migration we examine individual- and community-level responses using highly detailed, full migration histories of 3150 individuals with fine-scale rainfall data. Using this multi-method approach we examine the probability of out-migration as well as out-migration duration and destination as they relate to locally measured rainfall. The results suggest that out-migration behavior does not generally change because of failures or variation in the rainy season. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Three key trends stand out. First, cross-country inequality has declined as many developing countries have grown rapidly. Second, economic geography within countries has instead grown more unequal in both the developed and the developing world. Third, within-country spatial disparities have grown mainly because of the disproportionate success of skilled cities. In this paper, I develop a model that jointly explains these patterns as a consequence of deepening international economic integration. My model explains the faster population and output growth of skilled cities, as well as their tendency to increase their initial skill advantage. Consistent with the evidence, my theory predicts a non-monotonic path of urban growth in developed countries. The model predicts a future shift in worldwide urban hierarchies as some developing-world cities overtake unskilled cities in industrialized countries along global supply chains.","[Potlogea, Andrei V.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Econ, 31 Buccleuch Pl, Edinburgh EH8 9J, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Potlogea, AV (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Sch Econ, 31 Buccleuch Pl, Edinburgh EH8 9J, Midlothian, Scotland.",Andrei.Potlogea@ed.ac.uk,,,,,,,101,6,9,0,22,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0094-1190,1095-9068,,J URBAN ECON,J.

For this purpose, it applies a linear quantile regression and considers the effect of specific sports event variables which have rarely been assessed in this type of study. Empirical results confirm that the determinants of expenditure have a different influence depending on the spending level. Individual spending is principally influenced by the origin of the attendees as well as by several other sports factors such as the time the match takes place, the admission price, or the sporting level of the rival team. The study establishes two levels of spending to identify the different behaviors that correspond to each of the factors under study. The findings could provide a useful input into tourism strategies related to the hosting of sport events. (C) 2018 AEDEM.

Emerging market corporate bond yields are positively associated with the federal funds rate. However, this positive relation is transmitted through the domestic policy rate. If domestic policy rates are held constant, the spillover of US monetary policy on corporate bond yields diminishes. This suggests that domestic policymakers face a tradeoff: if they leave their policy rate unchanged when the Fed hikes, this may have benign consequences for corporate bond yields. However, a higher US policy rate may lead to exchange rate depreciation for emerging market currencies and thus elevated debt burdens for their US dollar debtors. Alternatively, if the Fed hikes and policymakers follow suit, funding conditions for corporates worsen through higher yields.","[Timmer, Yannick] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Econ, Dublin 2, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin,"Timmer, Y (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Econ, Dublin 2, Ireland.",timmery@tcd.ie,,"Timmer, Yannick/0000-0001-8343-4418",Grattan Foundation,Grattan Foundation,I am grateful to Philip Lane for helpful comments.

Effective adaptation governance requires in-depth, situated understanding of how adaptation is embedded in particular environmental, social, political, economic, and institutional contexts. Drawing on 93 qualitative interviews with smallholder households in five counties across three provinces on the Loess Plateau, we use a multi-scalar pathways approach to analyze two particular adaptations (planting maize and adopting drip irrigation). Our results show (1) how historical and ongoing multi-scalar, social ecological processes interact to shape smallholder adaptation decision-making, leading to synergies, tensions, and contradictions across risk management domains and social institutions; (2) whether an adaptation strategy persists over time is in part determined by the extent to which the strategy allows smallholder households to manage various forms of risk and uncertainty in both the present and future; and (3) how past and ongoing multi-scalar adaptation pathways determine not only smallholder exposure to current stressors but also possible choices for future adaptation. Specifically, we find some smallholder adaptive strategies, such as planting maize, stabilize over time because they enable smallholders to manage market risk, climatic risk, and water pollution challenges, allow them to take advantage of opportunities to diversify their livelihoods through local wage work and labor migration, and, at the same time, fit the local social institutions that guide their agricultural management decisions. We also find some adaptive strategies promoted by non-local actors, such as drip irrigation, are abandoned because they create tensions with the ways smallholders construct their livelihoods to manage various forms of uncertainty and risk, and contradict the local social relations and cultural values embedded in their day-to-day lives. Together, these results provide insight into why particular smallholder adaptation pathways become stabilized and reproduced over time, and the cross-scalar environmental, social, political, economic, and institutional processes that underpin them.

We show that adaptive learning argues against the Neo-Fisherian approach. Pegging the interest rate at a higher level will induce instability and most likely lead to falling inflation and output over time.

Tests of longer-run effects of the legal event indicate that foreign firms' disclosure quality and likelihood of facing enforcement actions remained stable, as did investors' revealed preferences for trading on US markets.

Using a unique sample of pure U.S. convertible bonds, devoid of other optionality, we show that underpricing is affected mainly by the degree of underlying asset volatility and liquidity. Convertible bonds with a greater debt component (more credit sensitive), longer time to maturity and lower quality credit ratings are also found to be more underpriced. The global financial crisis (GFC) is an episode with high-underlying asset volatility and one subject to short-selling constraints.

In particular, we use the level of financial knowledge and experience reported in the MiFID tests by retail investors. Such tests are implemented in the EU from the so-called Markets in Financial Instruments Directive since November 2007. We show that subjective financial literacy helps explain cross-sectional variations in retail investors' behavior. Investors who report higher levels of financial literacy seem to invest smarter, even after controlling for gender, age, portfolio value, trading experience and education. They trade more and are less prone to the disposition effect. They tend to concentrate their portfolios on a small set of stocks and achieve diversification through investment funds holding. Their trading behaviors allow them to display higher gross and net returns as well as higher excess Sharpe ratios. Our findings are relevant for both policy making and understanding retail investors' behavior. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Yet rural populations, geographies and economic activities continue to play a significant role in national development, while there are persistent and large rural-urban inequalities in well-being and opportunities. Promoting rural-urban linkages has been proposed as a strategy to reduce spatial inequalities, but there is much academic and policy debate about whether urban development has positive (spread) or negative (backwash) effects on rural development. This could translate into synergistic or predatory urban-rural linkages. This study examines how proximity to cities, and population and per capita income in cities, affect population growth and welfare in rural places in Mexico. Using data for 2000 and 2010, our findings include: (a) 75% of rural people live within 90 min of an urban area, and 60% within 60 min; (b) proximity to a city increases rural population growth and welfare; (c) adverse (backwash) effects on rural areas due to increases in urban per capita income are very small and of no economic significance; (d) cities with populations in the 350,000-500,000 range appear to have more positive effects on rural areas than smaller or larger cities; (e) rural localities interact with multiple urban places simultaneously.

An increasingly popular policy is to require that foreign companies provide public goods near the communities where their commercial investments are sited. This approach seeks to crowd in additional investments, create clusters of interconnected firms, and set in motion economic agglomeration processes. Post-2006 Liberia represents an ideal empirical setting to test the effectiveness of this approach. We construct a new dataset that measures the precise locations of 557 natural resource concessions granted to investors. We then merge these data with a remotely sensed measure of nighttime light growth at the 1 km x 1 km grid cell level and analyze it using a matched difference-indifferences strategy. We find heterogeneous treatment effects across sectors and investor types: mining (specifically iron-ore) investments projects have positive growth effects, while agriculture and forestry investment projects do not; furthermore, concessions granted to Chinese investors have positive growth effects while those given to U.S. investors do not. These patterns of heterogeneous treatment effects across sectors and investor types are consistent with the theory of change underpinning the government's development corridor strategy.

Previous studies typically model the growth in infected area using geometric Brownian motion (GBM). The advantage of this simple approach is that it allows for closed form solutions. However, such a process does not capture the mechanisms underlying the spread of infection. In particular the GBM assumption does not respect the natural upper boundary of the system, which is determined by the maximum size of the host species, nor the deceleration in the rate of infection as this boundary is approached. We show how the stochastic process describing the growth in infected area can be derived from the characteristics of the spread of infection. If the model used does not appropriately capture uncertainty in infection dynamics, then the excessive delay before treatment implies that the full value of the option to treat is not realised. Indeed, when uncertainty is high or the disease is fast spreading, ignoring the mechanisms of infection spread can lead to control never being deployed. Thus the results presented here have important implications for the way in which the real options approach is applied to determine optimal timing of disease control given uncertainty in future disease progression.","[Dangerfield, C.

In this period, is marked as one of the most volatile periods since the subprime crisis. A political and economic crisis, followed by federal police investigation combined with a period of slow economic growth and unconventional monetary and, a downtrend in commodities prices and in the world, makes the task to identify the sources of price risk dubious. Using a MGARCH-BEKK, DCC and t-Copulas modelling, the main results of the article suggest US monetary policy and rebalancing of portfolios generates volatility to Brazil. However, Bovespa also generates volatility to commodity markets and US bonds market.

We exploit that change in the rules and compare differences between final legislative votes, amendment votes and non-legislative votes before and after 2009, using a difference-in-differences approach with extensive controls. Using data from the Sixth (2004-2009) to Seventh (2009-2014) European Parliaments, we fail to find any large differences in voting cohesion for the main political groups.

However, the degree of risk sharing across countries is rather limited despite the recent waves of financial globalization. In this paper, we investigate an alternative avenue through which agents smooth their consumption volatility. We have noticed that apart from financial openness, domestic financial freedom is also a critical factor that determines a country's ability to insure against consumption risks. To motivate our analysis, we first develop a modified model of intranational and international risk sharing. We then examine the relative importance of domestic financial freedom and financial globalization in shaping the risk sharing outcomes using a large cross-country panel dataset. Our empirical findings suggest that for most countries in the world, domestic financial environment matters more in stabilizing consumption fluctuations than financial integration. We also show that agents are willing to give up a large amount of their consumption to achieve complete intranational or international risk sharing. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We show evidence that such pricing schemes can create an incentive to overinvest in energy efficiency. Using hourly smart-meter data for households facing time-invariant increasing block prices, we estimate how air conditioner upgrades affect electricity use. We find that the average participating household reduces consumption by 5%, which provides private savings in the form of lower electricity bills and social cost savings by decreasing generation and pollution costs. The private savings exceed the social savings by an average of 140%, so the average household is faced with an incentive to overinvest in energy efficiency. This incentive to overinvest in energy efficiency would be cut in half if consumers faced any one of three alternative pricing plans with lower marginal price but the same average price.","[Novan, Kevin; Smith, Aaron] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Novan, K (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",knovan@ucdavis.edu; adsmith@ucdavis.edu,,,Giannini Foundation of Agricultural Economics; Energy Foundation,Giannini Foundation of Agricultural Economics; Energy Foundation,"Kevin Novan (corresponding author) is at the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, University of California, Davis, One Shields Avenue, Davis, CA 95616 (knovan@ucdavis.edu).

Adopting land invasions as their main strategy in the struggle for land and power, Panguipulli workers experienced a radical politicization by aligning themselves with the Peasant Revolutionary Movement, the peasant front of the Revolutionary Left Movement. Because of its relation with this emerging new left, rural mobilization was a significant expression of the revolution from below, which challenged the Popular Unity's Chilean road to socialism. Moreover, because rural mobilization also took place in other areas throughout Chile where the Revolutionary Left Movement was influential, it gave rise to a grassroots project for radicalizing the government's agrarian reform. As a result, the rural revolution from below strongly influenced the content and trajectory of political conflict under the Popular Unity Government.","[Robles-Ortiz, Claudio] Univ Santiago Chile, Dept Econ, Av Bernardo OHiggins, Santiago 3363, Chile",Universidad de Santiago de Chile,"Robles-Ortiz, C (通讯作者)，Univ Santiago Chile, Dept Econ, Av Bernardo OHiggins, Santiago 3363, Chile.",claudio.robles@usach.cl,"Robles-Ortiz, Claudio/IAQ-6409-2023","Robles-Ortiz, Claudio/0000-0003-3041-7838",Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico [Proyecto FONDECYT Regular 1100673],Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT),"Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico, Grant/Award Number: Proyecto FONDECYT Regular 1100673",,131,3,4,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

We measure tournament incentives using the pay gap between a CEO and the next layer of senior executives. We find that tournament incentives are positively related to innovative efficiency, as measured by the number of patents and patent citations generated per million dollars of R&D expense. Our main finding holds in an instrumental-variable analysis and regressions using alternative innovation measures, including patent generality and originality indices and stock market reactions to patent grants. Consistent with prior theories, the positive effect of tournament incentives is found to be particularly pronounced during the period prior to CEO turnovers.","[Shen, Carl Hsin-han] Natl Cent Univ, Taoyuan, Taiwan; [Zhang, Hao] Rochester Inst Technol, Rochester, NY 14623 USA; [Zhang, Hao] US Secur & Exchange Commiss, Washington, DC USA",National Central University; Rochester Institute of Technology; U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC),"Shen, CHH (通讯作者)，Natl Cent Univ, Taoyuan, Taiwan.",,,"Shen, Carl Hsin-han/0000-0003-1982-6673",Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan; Saunders College of Business at RIT,"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); Saunders College of Business at RIT","We are grateful to two anonymous reviewers and Vikrant Vig (the editor) for their constructive and valuable comments.

Wage effects, and in many cases employment spillovers to the nontradable sector, appear larger than estimates from shocks to the tradable sector. Effects persist for ten to twenty years after Delaware loses its original policy-induced advantage. The shift towards a low unemployment sector explains this persistence, rather than direct productivity effects or agglomeration. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This could help the redevelopment of vacant ex-port land, while also offering new economic orientations for the city and the port. The aim of the paper is therefore to explore what conditions are needed to facilitate and encourage start-ups in innovation ecosystems in the port-city interface. The analysis is based on two in-depth case studies of the port-cities of Montreal (Canada) and Rotterdam (the Netherlands). The results indicate that government initiatives to actively facilitate start-ups in formerly industrialized port areas are quite successful. However, the functional linkages between start-ups and port activities remains rather limited, if not entirely absent, and the impact on the functioning of the innovation ecosystem at large is not substantial. Other factors such as capital, collaboration and proximity are valued more than the physical location of the start-up. In this, other actors in the ecosystem besides the municipality and the port authority also play a key role. Furthermore, start-ups often feel limited in their innovative capacity because of stringent regulations and institutional rigidness. Governments and port authorities could facilitate in this respect by working more demand-driven in terms of unburdening and creating more institutional support, instead of imposing top-down rules and regulations to try to govern the ecosystem, which in itself can be considered a contradiction in terms.

The evidence on this relationship is scarce, inconsistent and poorly understood, and reports of a negative association are common. Such results may appear counter-intuitive, but are in fact consistent with the idea that education is associated with higher expectations with respect to life circumstances. Consequently, education may be associated with greater subjective wellbeing only insofar as the ability to meet (or exceed) expectations is improved. This paper uses panel data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey to evaluate the evidence for differences in reference points across education levels, and to determine the overall association between education and subjective wellbeing. The results of the analysis confirm moderate rightward drifts across education levels for satisfaction with life in general, which are 'neutralised' by observed differences in actual circumstances. Other patterns emerge within specific life domains. Positive overall associations are observed for satisfaction with financial circumstances and health, while negative overall associations are observed for satisfaction with work and the amount of leisure time.","[Kristoffersen, Ingebjorg] Univ WA, Business Sch Econ, Perth, WA, Australia",University of Western Australia,"Kristoffersen, I (通讯作者)，M251,35 Stirling Hwy, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",inga.kristoffersen@uwa.edu.au,,,Australian Government Department of Social Services (DSS),Australian Government Department of Social Services (DSS)(Australian Government),"This paper uses unit record data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey.

Results indicate that while the yield rates between male and female teams do not differ, a gender disparity in the amount of angel funding does in fact exist. Female teams receive less capital and provide more equity relative to their male counterparts, even when controlling for typical determinants of investment, such as industry and prior company success. Further, we find that female teams receive investments with lower valuations than their male counterparts largely because they initially offer higher equity stakes for less capital. Thus, this suggests that limitations to angel financing of female entrepreneurial ventures may be partly self-imposed.","[Poczter, Sharon; Shapsis, Melanie] Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, 310C Warren Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Poczter, S (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, 310C Warren Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",sharon.poczter@cornell.edu; mrs367@cornell.edu,,"Poczter, Sharon/0000-0003-2663-7352",,,,,95,24,25,5,81,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Since the 1990s, however, many metropolitan areas have seen a resurgence of interest in central city neighborhoods. Theoretical models of income sorting lead to ambiguous predictions about where households of different income levels will live within metropolitan areas. In this paper, we explore infra-city spatial patterns of income and race for U.S. metropolitan areas, focusing particularly on the locations of low-income and minority neighborhoods. Results indicate that, on average, neighborhood income increases with distance to city centers for blacks, Hispanics and Asians. Income among non-Hispanic whites is uncorrelated with distance to CBD. All MSAs exhibit spatial clustering of poor and non-white neighborhoods.

The rate of household formation has increased with strong population growth, due to elevated rates of natural increase and net migration, and lack of growth in average household size, due to a rise in single-person households with population ageing. This paper presents an overlapping generations model of housing, endogenous labour, savings and growth to analyse the effect of an increase in the household formation rate and speculative demand under rational expectations on house prices in a general equilibrium. We find that real house prices rise over time if the rate of household formation outstrips the rate of housing supply, but do not follow a speculative bubble path in the long run. The results explain why the upward trend in real house prices reflects market fundamentals and has continued despite population ageing as the number of working and retired households grows relative to the number of older people seeking to sell.","[Day, Creina] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University,"Day, C (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",,,,,,,,14,11,11,3,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

This study shows that the labor productivity gap between farm and non-farm sectors attenuates after controlling for labor intensity. Within agriculture, there are no productivity gaps between staple and high value crops. This provides some evidence of underemployment in agriculture and employment gaps between the farm and non-farm sectors. In addition, diversification into and within farm and non-farm sectors is positively correlated with labor productivity in the specific sector. Diversification into non-farm activities may, however, reduce farm labor productivity and requires policies that reduce such tradeoffs in the transformation process. In addition, the pathways linking income diversification and labor productivity are complex and non-linear. In Uganda, income diversification is higher among resource-poor households (with limited family labor, land, and livestock) in rural areas away from main roads or urban centers. In Nigeria, diversification is higher for male-headed households with productive assets (family labor and land) and in areas closer to markets and urban centers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper also investigates the unique agency relationships using a sample of 90 Islamic banks across 13 countries over the period 2006-2014. We find that the larger the Shari'ah Supervisory Board (SSB) the better the financial performance and this result reinforces the fundamental role of the SSB to certify permissible financial instruments and products. We also find evidence of the scope of operation hypothesis with respect to both the board of directors and the SSB as Islamic banks are characterised by a higher degree of complex operations. Interestingly, we find that a larger SSB size may result in lower agency costs and that the greater the size of the unrestricted contracts, the higher the agency costs. This implies that unrestricted profit-sharing contracts are one of the main sources of the unique agency relationships in Islamic banks. The paper has a number of policy implications for regulators including the design of governance mechanisms in Islamic banks and the dynamics of unrestricted contracts. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This enables us to control for the coincidence of tax policy measures in different countries, which is an aspect left unconsidered in previous econometric studies. A fiscal devaluation consisting of a budget-neutral tax shift in the amount of 1% of gross domestic product (GDP) from employers' social security contributions to value added tax leads to a short-term improvement of bilateral trade balance ranging between 0.3 and 0.6% of GDP. An extrapolation of our baseline estimate to the overall trade balance yields an impact of 4.3% of GDP for the whole sample, which is slightly higher than presented in previous empirical research. Applying extrapolation to the trade deficit countries in the euro area shows that these countries' balance of trade with the rest of the euro area improves by only 0.75% of GDP. Thus, the magnitude of the fiscal devaluation impact on the trade balance varies significantly across countries, depending on their trade openness, among other potentially relevant factors.","[Holzner, Mario] Vienna Inst Int Econ Studies, Rahlgasse 3, A-1060 Vienna, Austria; [Tkalec, Marina; Vizek, Maruska] Inst Econ, Trg JF Kennedyja 7, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Vuksic, Goran] Inst Publ Finance, Smiciklasova 21, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies; University of Zagreb; Institute of Economics Zagreb (EIZ); Institute of Public Finance,"Vuksic, G (通讯作者)，Inst Publ Finance, Smiciklasova 21, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",holzner@wiiw.ac.at; mtkalec@eizg.hr; mvizek@eizg.hr; goran.vuksic@ijf.hr,"; Vuksic, Goran/A-7454-2016","Holzner, Mario/0000-0001-7407-5011; Vuksic, Goran/0000-0003-1502-5561",Croatian Science Foundation [7017],Croatian Science Foundation,"We are very grateful to the two anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions.

Global statistical models are widely used to explore the relationships between vehicle crashes and the built environment, but these models do not incorporate a spatial component and are unable to deal with the issues of spatial autocorrelation and spatial non-stationarity. Our research utilizes a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model to explore the relationships between crashes and the built environment in the context of the Detroit region in Michigan. We find that the relationships between the built environment and crashes are spatially non-stationary: both the strength and the direction of their relationships differ over space. Our study also identifies several built environment variables, such as commercial use percentage, local road mileage percentage, and intersection density, that have relatively stable relationships with crashes.

This earthquake caused great damage to the port of Kobe, resulting in a diversion of its container traffic to the nearby port of Busan, which increased markedly after this windfall. The strengthened economies of transport density therefore allowed Busan to expand its hinterland to regions whose container shipping operations had not even been directly affected by the earthquake, such as eastern Japan. The empirical evidence from the port choice dynamics in eastern Japan supports this mechanism. Substantial diversions of container traffic occurred after 1995 from the major ports in this region to the port of Busan. Furthermore, these unintended container shipping diversions led to a structural change in the manufacturing sector of related regions after the late 1990s.","[Xu, Hangtian] Hunan Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, Changsha 410079, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Itoh, Hidekazu] Kwansei Gakuin Univ, Sch Business Adm, Nishinomiya, Hyogo 6628501, Japan",Hunan University; Kwansei Gakuin University,"Xu, HT (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, Changsha 410079, Hunan, Peoples R China.",hangtianxu@hnu.edu.cn; hito@kwansei.ac.jp,,"ITOH, Hidekazu/0000-0002-0170-0872; Xu, Hangtian/0000-0002-0178-9213",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71703034]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI [JP14J04705]; JSPS KAKENHI [JP16K03684]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K03684] Funding Source: KAKEN,"National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",The authors would like to thank the editor Nathaniel Baum-Snow and two anonymous referees for useful comments.

Introducing reputational effects eliminates defaults and results in a unique but still indeterminate steady state.

The model provides a forest value expression and allows a solution to the optimal rotation problem valid for perpetual rotations of even-aged forest stands. However, continuous forest cover forest management systems imply uneven-aged dynamics, and while a number of numerical studies have analysed specific continuous cover forest ecosystems in search of optimal management regimes, no one has tried to capture key dynamics of continuous cover forestry in simple mathematical models. In this paper we develop a simple, but rigorous mathematical model of the continuous cover forest, which strictly focuses on the area use dynamics that such an uneven-aged forest must have in equilibrium. This implies explicitly accounting for area reallocation and for weighting the productivity of each age class by the area occupied. We present results for unrestricted as well as area-restricted versions of the models. We find that land values are unambiguously higher in the continuous cover forest models compared with the even-aged models. Under area restrictions, the optimal rotation age in a continuous cover forest model is unambiguously lower than the corresponding area restricted Faustmann solution, while the result for the area unrestricted model is ambiguous.","[Jacobsen, Jette Bredahl; Jensen, Frank; Thorsen, Bo Jellesmark] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Fac Sci, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Jacobsen, Jette Bredahl; Thorsen, Bo Jellesmark] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Macroecol Evolut & Climate, Fac Sci, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark",University of Copenhagen; University of Copenhagen,"Jacobsen, JB (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Fac Sci, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",jbj@ifro.ku.dk; fje@ifro.ku.dk; bjt@ifro.ku.dk,"Thorsen, Bo Jellesmark/K-8770-2014; Jacobsen, Jette Bredahl/C-9354-2015","Thorsen, Bo Jellesmark/0000-0002-3305-8343; Jacobsen, Jette Bredahl/0000-0002-1313-6228",Danish National Research Foundation,Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond),"We would like to than Colin Price and Finn Helles for constructive commenting on several previous versions of this paper, helping clearing the thoughts and for continuously urging us to finalize it.

Despite the substantial proportion of existing residents in the population, their responses to land-use changes have not been thoroughly studied. To address this gap in the literature, this study compares two groups of suburban residents in the Atlanta metropolitan area: a treatment group whose neighborhoods experienced increases in density, land-use mix, and street connectivity and a control group whose neighborhoods did not experience such land-use changes. After correcting for self-selection, this study reveals that residents in the treatment group who relocated to suburban neighborhoods before land-use changes drove more miles for household maintenance activities than their control group counterparts in other suburban neighborhoods. The same households, however, drove substantially less for subsistence activities (e.g., commutes to school and work), which more than compensates for the moderate increase in vehicle miles traveled for household maintenance. These findings suggest that increased residential density and land-use mix in older suburbs contributes to a reduction in automobile vehicle miles traveled.","[Lee, Yongsung; Guhathakurta, Subhrajit] Georgia Inst Technol, Ctr Spatial Planning Analyt & Visualizat, Sch City & Reg Planning, 760 Spring St NW,Suite 217, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Lee, Y (通讯作者)，Georgia Inst Technol, Ctr Spatial Planning Analyt & Visualizat, Sch City & Reg Planning, 760 Spring St NW,Suite 217, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",yongsung.lee@gatech.edu; subhro.guha@design.gatech.edu,"Lee, Yongsung/Q-1720-2018; Guhathakurta, Subhrajit/L-4568-2019","Lee, Yongsung/0000-0002-1980-1225; Guhathakurta, Subhrajit/0000-0002-2456-3284",,,,,63,4,4,1,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

We show how nonparametric methods can also be used to bound the welfare effects of changes in the provision of a non-market good. Our main context is one in which the non-market good affects the marginal utility of consuming a related market good. This can also be framed as a shift in the taste for, or quality of, the market good. A systematic approach for incorporating quality/taste variation into a revealed preference framework for heterogeneous consumers is developed. This enables the recovery of the minimal variation in quality required to rationalise observed choices of related market goods. The variation in quality appears as a adjustment to the price for related market goods which then allows a revealed preference approach to bounding compensation measures of welfare effects to be applied.","[Blow, Laura] Surrey Univ, Guildford, Surrey, England; [Blow, Laura; Blundell, Richard] IFS, London, England; [Blundell, Richard] UCL, London, England",University of Surrey; University of London; University College London,"Blow, L (通讯作者)，Surrey Univ, Guildford, Surrey, England.;Blow, L (通讯作者)，IFS, London, England.",l.blow@surrey.ac.uk; r.blundell@ucl.ac.uk,"Blundell, Richard William/C-1552-2008","Blundell, Richard William/0000-0003-1588-2299",Economic and Social Research Council Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at IFS; ESRC [ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at IFS; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We would like to thank Kerry Smith, two anonymous commentators and participants at the conference for comments on an earlier draft.

We ask whether mental and physical health problems and poor general health by age 15 have similar or different influences on lifetime earnings. We then ask whether the health care system influenced the estimated effects of early health problems on lifetime earnings.

Vision screening is common in U.S. schools, but it remains an open question whether screening alone is sufficient to improve student outcomes. We implemented a multi-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the impact of vision screening, and of vision screening accompanied by eye exams and eyeglasses, provided by a non-profit organization to Title I elementary schools in three large central Florida school districts. We find that providing additional/enhanced screening alone is generally insufficient to improve student achievement in math and reading. In contrast, providing screening along with free eye exams and free eyeglasses to students with vision problems improved student achievement as measured by standardized test scores. We find, averaging over all students (including those without vision problems), that this more comprehensive intervention increased the probability of passing the Florida Comprehensive Achievement Tests (FCATs) in reading and math by approximately 2.0 percentage points. We also present evidence that indicates that this impact fades out over time, indicating that follow-up actions after the intervention may be necessary to sustain these estimated achievement gains.","[Glewwe, Paul] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, 332G Ruttan Hall,1994 Buford Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [West, Kristine L.] St Catherine Univ, Dept Econ, Whitby 106C,2004 Randolph Ave, St Paul, MN 55105 USA; [Lee, Jongwook] Dept Appl Econ, 1994 Buford Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Saint Catherine University,"Glewwe, P (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, 332G Ruttan Hall,1994 Buford Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",pglewwe@umn.edu; klwest@stkate.edu; leex2825@umn.edu,,"Lee, Jongwook/0000-0002-3660-4370",NICHD NIH HHS [P2C HD041023] Funding Source: Medline,NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,29,33,35,2,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

If rationality can be characterized by conditions on preferences and choices and, in addition, people are, to a reasonable degree of approximation rational, then economists can invoke the theory of rationality to explain choices. If people are also, as in positive economics, largely self-interested and reasonably well-informed, then their preferences will also indicate their level of well-being. Modeling both choice and welfare in terms of rational preferences thus unites positive and normative economics. In explaining market outcomes in terms of individual choices, explaining choices by preferences, and taking preferences to indicate well-being, economists who are concerned with welfare defend a normative theory that piggybacks on their positive theory. This traditional mainstream normative theory is problematic, but because of its unity and its connection to positive economics, it is also very powerful.","[Hausman, Daniel M.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Hausman, DM (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",dhausman@wisc.edu,,,,,,,44,1,1,0,4,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,2105-2883,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

When these factors are associated with small betas, the beta-estimator using their mimicking portfolios has nonstandard limit behavior. This jeopardizes inference on risk premia in the commonly used Fama and MacBeth (1973) two-pass procedure. Using sorting or the average excess returns on the mimicking portfolios to estimate the risk premia leads to similar non-standard behavior. We therefore propose a novel test for the risk premia on mimicking portfolios. Its validity does not depend on the magnitude of the betas. Simulation evidence suggests that it performs well in terms of size and power. We use it to analyze the risk premium on the leverage factor of Adrian, Etula, and Muir (2014). Our results indicate that the leverage factor is a weak factor which leads to substantially different results for its risk premium.","[Kleibergen, Frank] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Econ, Roetersstr 11, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Zhan, Zhaoguo] Kennesaw State Univ, Coles Coll Business, Kennesaw, GA USA",University of Amsterdam; University System of Georgia; Kennesaw State University,"Kleibergen, F (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Econ, Roetersstr 11, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",f.r.kleibergen@uva.nl,,,,,,,33,8,9,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1479-8409,1479-8417,,J FINANC ECONOMET,J.

This study finds evidence of systematic differences in diagnosis and treatment of ADHD due to third party financial incentives. In some states, due to the financing mechanism for special education, schools face a financial incentive to facilitate the identification of children with ADHD. Using variation in special education funding policies across states, we find that children living in states with financial incentives are about 15 percent more likely to report having ADHD and are about 22 percent more likely to be taking medication for ADHD. We provide support that these findings are causal by leveraging variation from two states that implemented policy changes during the time period studied.","[Morrill, Melinda Sandler] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Econ, Campus Box 8110, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",North Carolina State University,"Morrill, MS (通讯作者)，North Carolina State Univ, Dept Econ, Campus Box 8110, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",melinda_morrill@ncsu.edu,,"Morrill, Melinda/0000-0002-1479-1996",,,,,53,8,12,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

Including these margins of adjustment changes the problem of benefit-transfer. It requires the evaluation of policies that affect more than one region at a time.

The study finds that bonds heavily bought by retail investors in one month underperform in the next month relative to bonds heavily sold, and the opposite holds for institutional investors. The alpha of the high-low portfolio (formed based on decile sorting on the buy-sell trade imbalance) relative to the usual market factors is significant for retail investors, but insignificant for institutional investors. The overall results indicate that retail investors in the corporate bond market suffer from behavioral biases but institutional investors do not. However, when the spread between the purchase and sell prices is factored into the returns, no profitable trading strategies exist, consistent with limits to arbitrage. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We conduct a randomized trial of two financial literacy education programs in government-run Ghanaian primary and junior high schools. The first integrated both financial and social education, while the second included only financial education. Our study finds that after nine months, both programs had positive impacts on self-reported savings at school relative to the control group, but there were no statistically significant increases in aggregate savings nor in hypothesized mechanisms such as attitudes, preferences, or knowledge. The financial education-only treatment led to a weakly statistically significant increase in child labor relative to the control group, although the difference in impact between the two treatment groups was not statistically significant.

We show that if inequality decreases over time, the social discount rate should be lower than the one obtained by the standard Ramsey rule under certain but reasonable conditions. Applied to the global discount rate and due to the projected convergence across countries, this implies that the inequality adjusted discount rate should be about twice as high as the standard Ramsey rule predicts. For individual countries on the other hand, where inequality tends to increase over time, the effect goes in the other direction. For the United States for instance, this inequality effect leads to a reduction of the social discount rate by about 0.5 to 1 percentage points. We also present an analytical formula for the social discount rate allowing us to disentangle inequality, risk, and intertemporal fluctuation aversion.","[Emmerling, Johannes] FEEM, Corso Magenta 63, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Emmerling, Johannes] Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat CMCC, Corso Magenta 63, I-20123 Milan, Italy",Fondazione Mattei; Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC),"Emmerling, J (通讯作者)，FEEM, Corso Magenta 63, I-20123 Milan, Italy.;Emmerling, J (通讯作者)，Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat CMCC, Corso Magenta 63, I-20123 Milan, Italy.",johannes.emmerling@feem.it,"EMMERLING, Johannes/K-8283-2019","EMMERLING, Johannes/0000-0003-0916-9913",,,,,51,4,4,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

It argues that the positive effect of exporting on innovation usually found in the literature varies according to the specific destinations of exports, and it identifies two dimensions along which export destinations might differ: the level of foreign technological spillovers available to exporting firms (the technological learning effect) and the type of foreign demand that exporting firms are able to access (the foreign demand effect). The empirical analysis, which takes advantage of firm-level information about the export destinations of exporters, shows that while the technological learning effect increases mainly the incentives to introduce brand new product innovations, the foreign demand effect fosters the adoption of process innovations.","[Fassio, Claudio] Lund Univ, CIRCLE, POB 118, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Fassio, C (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, CIRCLE, POB 118, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",claudio.fassio@circle.lu.se,"benites, sebastian/JCN-4799-2023","Fassio, Claudio/0000-0002-9931-3976",European Union [225551]; UniCredit,European Union(European Union (EU)); UniCredit,"The author has benefitted from the access to the EU-EFIGE/Bruegel-UniCredit database, managed by Bruegel and funded by the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme ([FP7/2007-2013] under grant agreement number 225551), as well as by UniCredit.",,50,30,32,1,41,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

In the United States, the Federal Transit Administration requires transit agencies to assess the equity of proposed service changes using the demographic shares of affected riders. The purpose of the work presented here is to inform the development of more robust transit equity analyses than are currently conducted by integrating measures of accessibility - the ease with destinations can be reached - into FTA-required analyses. The measures are calculated using publicly available data, including the US Census Bureau's Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics dataset and transit route and schedule information in the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) format. The results demonstrate that relying on a single measure (e.g. population shares or accessibility) to associate a route with a particular demographic group is likely to be deficient. Previous academic work on accessibility has not translated well to practice in part because the calculation of accessibility relied upon regional travel demand model outputs that were difficult to obtain. This work thus fills an important gap in the literature and practice by tying advances in the academic literature to FTA-mandated analysis with publicly available data.","[Karner, Alex] Univ Texas Austin, Sch Architecture, Grad Program Community & Reg Planning, 310 Inner Campus Dr B7500, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Karner, A (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Sch Architecture, Grad Program Community & Reg Planning, 310 Inner Campus Dr B7500, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",alex.karner@utexas.edu,"Karner, Alex/I-6672-2019","Karner, Alex/0000-0002-3651-8157",,,,,64,69,84,3,43,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

We investigate employment growth in 108 portfolio companies that benefited from the ARKimedes fund-of-fund in Flanders. Accounting for the heterogeneity in the types of venture capital investors managing hybrid funds, and the associated goal diversity and resource endowments, we find that portfolio companies backed by hybrid independent venture capital funds show greater employment growth than those backed by hybrid captive or hybrid government venture capital funds. This finding is relevant because it indicates that the financial objectives of hybrid independent venture capital funds are highly compatible with the government's objective of employment growth, as providing companies with superior monitoring and value adding services with the objective of realizing a successful exit creates employment in the process.","[Standaert, Thomas; Manigart, Sophie] Univ Ghent, Dept Accounting Corp Finance & Taxat, Sint Pieterspl 7, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Standaert, Thomas] Univ Lille 2, Fac Finance Banque Comptabil, Rue Mulhouse 2 BP 381, F-59020 Lille, France; [Manigart, Sophie] Vlerick Business Sch, Competence Ctr Accounting & Finance, Reep 1, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University; Universite de Lille; Vlerick Business School,"Standaert, T (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Accounting Corp Finance & Taxat, Sint Pieterspl 7, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",ThomasB.Standaert@UGent.be; Sophie.Manigart@UGent.be,,"Standaert, Thomas/0000-0003-4624-4353; Manigart, Sophie/0000-0002-3406-9386",Ph.D. grant of the Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology (IWT),Ph.D. grant of the Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology (IWT)(Institute for the Promotion of Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT)),"Thomas Standaert is supported by a Ph.D. grant of the Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology (IWT).

Constraining forestland to its current boundaries and constraining management to current levels reduce average sequestration by 25 to 28 Tg C y(-1).

This idea finds strong theoretical support from the theory of information and from the agency approach as applied to the issue of transferring small firms in which both ownership and management are typically transferred together. In this article, we compare two ways of transferring businesses: transfers to outsiders and transfers to employees. After identifying key advantages and disadvantages for each, we turn to a rich panel dataset on start-up and development conditions for new French businesses during the mid-2000s. Our results show that transfers to employees are more frequently long-lasting than transfers to outsiders. Our empirical investigation also shows that transfers to employees are less dynamic in terms of turnover growth than external transfers, but more dynamic in terms of job creation. We conclude the article by providing guidance on public action to promote business transfers.","[Bastie, Francoise; Cieply, Sylvie] Univ Normandie, CREM, Campus 4,19 Rue Claude Bloch, F-140321 Caen, France; [Cussy, Pascal] Univ Normandie, CREM, Campus 1, F-14032 Caen, France",Universite de Caen Normandie; Universite de Caen Normandie,"Cieply, S (通讯作者)，Univ Normandie, CREM, Campus 4,19 Rue Claude Bloch, F-140321 Caen, France.",Sylvie.cieply@unicaen.fr,"Bastié, Françoise/AAP-4164-2021",,,,,,22,4,6,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

This is quite a controversial approach, because the results of some studies indicate that when the emotions are too negative (this is particularly true in case of fear), the effect may be counterproductive and lead to the emergence of defensive mechanisms in the audience. It is important, therefore, to evoke emotions of adequate intensity. Thanks to the use of cognitive neuroscience tools (electroencephalography, measurement of galvanic skin response and heart rate), the researchers can check reactions to different media messages (varying in intensity of negative emotions) which go beyond declaration of recipient and ascertain which ones are the most effective in terms of increasing awareness of the problem and the involvement of the recipient. These additional methods of measuring the effectiveness (apart from questionnaires) offer new possibilities in conducting social campaigns research. The chapter presents a scenario of the experiment aimed to check whether the relationship between the intensity of negative emotions in the media message of the social campaign and its effectiveness is consistent with the curvilinear model proposed in the literature.

Using the series of statistical data available for 1990-2014, firstly we have tested the hypothetical inverse relationship between national income and emissions of pollutants (SO2), or what we know as the Environmental Kuznets Curve. In the case of Romania, the results have confirmed the existence of such an inverted curve. Secondly, using the Merchandise Trade Specialization Index, we have questioned the possible influence of Romanian specialization in the production and consumption through trade on the pollution level. We draw the conclusion that far from being a kind of creative destruction, Romanian deindustrialization after 1990 is rather a form of premature deindustrialization. In such a context, this evolution cannot be attributed exclusively to the economic growth, but it must be analyzed from a wider perspective, as a result of a complex of determinants.","[Burciu, Aurel; Kicsi, Rozalia; Condratov, Iulian] Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Suceava, Romania",Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava,"Kicsi, R (通讯作者)，Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Suceava, Romania.",aurelb@usv.ro; rozaliak@seap.usv.ro; iulianc@seap.usv.ro,"Condratov, Iulian/HSF-0166-2023; KICSI, ROZALIA/ADX-2909-2022; Burciu, Aurel/ADB-6064-2022","KICSI, ROZALIA/0000-0001-6712-4284; BURCIU, AUREL/0000-0003-1628-2316",,,,,21,2,2,0,5,LUMEN PUBLISHING HOUSE,IASI,"2, TEPES VODA STR, IASI, 700 714, ROMANIA",,,978-1-910129-18-0,,,,2018,,,,,,,156,165,,10.18662/lumproc.70,0.0,,,10,Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BM9BY,,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470307900015,0

There has always been a very particular connection between food growing and technology. Traditional thinking maintains that technology and urban life stand in opposition to the peaceful and quiet life on the farm. Food is produced and distributed globally nowadays. This makes the chain of distribution significantly more complex, and great stress is laid on food safety. Contemporary consumers are more and more interested in the origin and production technology of the food they eat. The provision of organic food, locally produced food, food picked that day are only some of the trends that have been on the increase. Vertical food growing requiring the intensive use of energy is still in its infancy. There are, however, many initiatives which are leading to rapid advances. Vertical farming in open or enclosed spaces has, therefore, the potential to respond to the demographic challenges faced by Smart Cities. Rapid urbanization will make urban agriculture more significant. Peri-urban, or suburban agriculture, is a part of urban culture. It can greatly contribute to the food supply of the entire city. This raises the question of the designation of the peri-urban zone and of its capacity to feed big cities. This paper is an attempt at describing the elements of a new agrarian politics that could help tackle the problems of resource allocation and, at the same time, provide citizens with a better quality of life.","[Cvijanovic, Drago] Univ Kragujevac, Fac Hotel Management & Tourism, Vrnjacka Banja, Serbia; [Sedlak, Otilija; Vojinovic, Zeljko] Univ Novi Sad, Dept Finance Banking Accounting & Auditing, Novi Sad, Serbia",University of Kragujevac; University of Novi Sad,"Cvijanovic, D (通讯作者)，Univ Kragujevac, Fac Hotel Management & Tourism, Vrnjacka Banja, Serbia.",drago.cvijanovic@kg.ac.rs; otilijas@ef.uns.ac.rs; zeljko.vojinovic@ef.uns.ac.rs,,"Cvijanovic, Drago/0000-0002-4037-327X","Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia [III-46006]","Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia","The paper is part of the research at the project III-46006 Sustainable agriculture and rural development in terms of the Republic of Serbia strategic goals realization within the Danube region, financed by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia.",,16,2,2,0,10,"INST AGRICULTURAL & FOOD ECONOMICS, NATIONAL RESEARCH INST-IAFE-NRI",WARSZAWA,"UL.

Some reforms aim at increase capitalization in the determination of the final pension through a life annuity to complement the public retirement pension as a second retirement income. Against the background of the change of agents' behaviors throughout the life cycle and the presence of an adverse selection problem in the annuities market, we describe in this paper a 'two-steps mixed pension system' that tries to solve the pressure that increasing longevity is putting on pension schemes to provide adequate and sustainable pensions for all. In our two-steps mixed system, when workers reach their ordinary retirement age they receive a 'term annuity' generated by their previous capitalized savings to be replaced by a Social Security defined contribution 'pure life annuity' when the so-called 'grand age' is reached. The analysis is carried out from an individual perspective, through the Internal Rate of Return that workers will receive since ordinary retirement in both schemes compared with the one they would get with the same contributions in the current situation. We also analyze some possible transition strategies to the new system.","[Devolder, Pierre] Catholic Univ Louvain, Louvain, Belgium; [Dominguez-Fabian, Inmaculada] Univ Extremadura, Badajoz, Spain; [del Olmo-Garcia, Francisco] Univ Alcala De Henares, Madrid, Spain; [Herce, Jose A.] Afi Finance Sch, Frankfurt, Germany",Universite Catholique Louvain; Universidad de Extremadura; Universidad de Alcala,"Devolder, P (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, Louvain, Belgium.",pierre.devolder@uclouvain.be; idomingu@unex.es; francisco.olmo@uah.es; jherce@afi.es,"García, Francisco del Olmo/CAE-8449-2022",,,,,,9,0,0,0,2,LODZ UNIV TECHNOLOGY PR,LODZ,"BIBLIOTEKA POLITECHNIKI LODZKIEJ-BUDYNEK B22, UL WOLCZANSKA 223, LODZ, 90-924, POLAND",,,978-83-7283-900-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,43,56,,,,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9BP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470276200004,0

In this context, socially responsible entrepreneurship is an innovative model that makes it possible to integrate social and environmental aspects into its economic activities. This innovative voluntary approach of social and responsible entrepreneurship doesn't deny the social, economic and ecological fundamentals; Thus helping creating social value in different fields (health, education, employment, finance, etc.). The will to control the overall socio-economic environment (internal and external) of a socially responsible company is based on the search for total control of all the risks that it can generate in its business, These risks are closely linked to the innovation process. The main objective of a social entrepreneur's innovation is to bring about social change, which leads to real risk-taking, namely: determining the financing capacity of innovation, which is often costly, and its development, the innovative use of resources to explore and exploit opportunities which respond to a social need in a sustainable way. Hence social enterprise explicitly displays a mission of collective interest which involves the concerned stakeholders in order to analyze, share and control the various risks that may constitute a major obstacle to innovation, to communicate programs of development, of cooperation, of financing and of social and solidarity economy, contributing to the realization of social entrepreneurial projects, assisting them, accompanying them and ensuring their good governance and ensuring their sustainability. On the basis of theoretical reflections, the aim of this communication is to highlight the different approaches of social entrepreneurship concept through a literature relating to social innovation concept, and then to recognize the various risks closely linked to social innovation, in order to study how a socially responsible company can manage these risks and finally to analyze in a pluralistic manner the ways in which risks are shared among its stakeholders partners for an optimal development.","[El Yamani, Kaoutar; Rouggani, Khalid; Amine, Nabil Bouayad] Univ Hassan 1er Settat, Settat, Morocco",Hassan First University of Settat,"El Yamani, K (通讯作者)，Univ Hassan 1er Settat, Settat, Morocco.",elyamani.k@gmail.com,,,,,,,43,0,0,1,1,WYDAWNICTWO UNIWERSYTETU EKONOMICZNEGO W POZNANIU,Poznan,"ul.

The government, in an effort to counter these challenges, has instituted various policies aimed at reversing the situation. This paper is aimed at examining spatial maize market integration in the presence of non-constant transaction costs and policies implemented. Findings indicate that market pairs close to each other were integrated, had a lower transaction cost and the price differential across markets were quickly corrected compared to markets further apart. Evaluation of the effects of policies on market integration shows the implementation of policies resulted in market distortion. The price difference between surplus and deficit markets were not corrected hence equilibrium was not achieved. When markets are poorly integrated, the price mechanism does not work and price signals cannot be transmitted thus allowing for efficient exchange of food products across spatial markets. To reduce transaction costs in the maize sector, the government should improve the road infrastructure connecting production areas with the markets and between markets. Harmonisation of the local government levies imposed on maize traversing different local municipalities will help reduce transaction costs. On the fertiliser subsidy, the government needs to collaborate with the private sector as it has a wide distribution network countrywide. This will ensure accessibility of the fertiliser by farmers in remote areas. Market forces should guide participation of the marketing board in the maize market. The board should not succumb to political pressure by purchasing maize at a higher price than the market prices.","[Gitau, Raphael] Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, Private Bag X20, ZA-0028 Pretoria, Gauteng, South Africa; [Gitau, Raphael] Egerton Univ, Tegemeo Inst Policy & Dev, Res & Extens, POB 20498 City Sq, Nairobi 00200, Kenya; [Meyer, Ferdi] Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Rural Dev & Extens, Bur Food & Agr Policy, Pretoria, South Africa; [Meyer, Ferdi] Univ Pretoria, Private Bag X20 Hatfield, ZA-0028 Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria; Egerton University; University of Pretoria; University of Pretoria,"Gitau, R (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, Private Bag X20, ZA-0028 Pretoria, Gauteng, South Africa.;Gitau, R (通讯作者)，Egerton Univ, Tegemeo Inst Policy & Dev, Res & Extens, POB 20498 City Sq, Nairobi 00200, Kenya.",grkanyingi02@gmail.com; ferdi.meyer@up.ac.za,,,,,,,48,6,7,0,6,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2018,57.0,3-4,,,,,251,265,,10.1080/03031853.2018.1526693,0.0,,,15,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,HD1WR,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000452303600006,0

Despite the increasing significance of EM OFDI, this particular theme of EM OFDI to a DM host has received relatively little attention from researchers. This paper seeks to address this shortfall. Design/methodology/approach Considering the distinctiveness of EM OFDI in its firm-specific characteristics, given circumstances and motivations, this paper applies adapted Resource-based view (RBV) framework and institutional theory to build a theoretical framework. A range of hypotheses regarding strategic-asset seeking, market seeking and institution seeking motivations of EM OFDI, which reflect both pull factors (advantages in hosts) and push factors (disadvantages at home), were then developed. Using panel data for the years 2003-2012, the research questions were analysed using a sample of the then most important EM source countries which had undertaken Greenfield FDI into the UK. Findings The analysis results supported the hypotheses that strategic-asset seeking and institution seeking motivations were important in determining EM OFDI to the UK, with the coefficients of relevant variables showing statistical significance and expected sign (i.e. positive). However, the hypothesis on market seeking motivation of EM OFDI cannot be supported as the coefficient of the relevant variable, whilst showing the expected sign, had a statistically insignificant coefficient. Amongst the three control variables, the source countries' exports and imports as a percentage of GDP was statistically significant and had the correct sign whilst, the UK's share of intra-EU trade, whilst statistically significant, had the opposite sign to that expected. The third control variable, the exchange rate was not statistically significant, though it had the correct sign. Originality/value This paper provides an adjusted theoretical framework for the analysis of EM OFDI to DM with a novel application of institutional theory and RBV. It also qualifies and extends existing works on EM OFDI by including a wider range of EM source countries and DM hosts with empirical analysis results as well as theoretical suggestions.

This study uses primary data and secondary data from village side and by interview through village apparatus and direct observation to the field by visiting RT and RW so the research is a descriptive quantitative research. There are five variables measured in this study, they are economic, health, education, social humanitarian and da'wah variables. The research was conducted in Binangun Village, Pataruman Sub District, Banjar City. The calculation result of Zakat Village Index (IDZ) indicates that Binangun Village is included in good condition and can be considered to be empowered using zakat fund. Variables that have the lowest IDZ value are economic and health variables. For the zakat institution that will empower the Binangun Village, can be more focused on the two variables. Then for zakat management institution should use Zakat Village Index instrument (IDZ) to determine the target of the program and to know the requirement of society exactly so that program of channeling of zakat fund can be done effectively and efficiently.","[Hakim, Fitriyani Nurul; Mahri, A.

Generally, research findings are supportive of TOD policies over sprawl development in many aspects such as reducing car-dependency, congestion, and emissions. Although sprawl development has been identified as a key factor of the urban heat island (UHI) effect, a phenomenon when an urban area experiences a higher temperature compared to its surrounding non-urban areas, existing empirical studies, however, lack to answer whether TODs are likely to reduce the UHI effect. Using Brisbane as a case, this research answers this question by: a) identifying TOD neighbourhoods based on a cluster analysis of six built environment factors (residential density, employment density, land use diversity, intersection and cul-de-sac densities, public transport accessibility levels); b) validating the selection of TOD neighbourhoods based on travel behaviour analysis of residents living between TOD and non-TOD areas; c) examining patterns of UHI effects between the areas and their changes over the period of 2004-2013 based on Landsat remote sensing data; and d) identifying the factors contributing to the UHI effects in TODs. Results show that TODs experienced a higher level of UHI effect compared to non-TOD areas. Although both areas experienced an increase in the UHI effect between the periods, the rate of increase was found to be significantly higher in TOD areas. Land use diversity, percentage of porous land vis-vis density significantly contributed to the UHI effect. The findings suggest that a compromise between natural and built-up areas is essential to reduce the UHI effect while contributing to the ultimate goal of TODs - i.e. to create settings which prompt people to drive less and ride public transit more.","[Kamruzzaman, Md; Deilami, Kaveh; Yigitcanlar, Tan] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, 2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Kamruzzaman, M (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, 2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",md.kainruzzaman@qut.edu.au; k.deilami@qut.edu.au; tan.yigitcanlar@qut.edu.au,"Deilami, Kaveh/N-7430-2017; Kamruzzaman, Liton Md/AAG-5909-2020; Yigitcanlar, Tan/J-1142-2012","Deilami, Kaveh/0000-0003-3455-5111; Kamruzzaman, Liton Md/0000-0001-7113-942X; Yigitcanlar, Tan/0000-0001-7262-7118",,,,,86,46,49,7,66,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

The Czech Republic is one of the leading EU countries in terms of availability and quality of services even in smaller municipalities. Awareness of the arisen problems or deficiencies can increase both the interest in their solution and current possibilities to help municipalities. The article deals with drawing results from evaluation of the research in the area of monitoring public services and facilities of the municipalities in the Czech Republic. A comprehensive questionnaire survey was conducted in the course of 2018 and was focused on the municipalities in the South Moravian Region. The state of the technical infrastructure - electricity, gas, water and sewerage systems, wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), transport, communications and other components, whose state and technical sophistication quality most affect the environment for people living in the municipalities, was researched in detail. The aim of the research w as mainly to evaluate, change or correct the information in the database of the South Moravian Region and at the same time to assess some indicators over the six-year period. For example, an increase in the total number of municipalities, a significant increase in the number of municipalities equipped with sewerage systems as well as a more positive response to transport services have been observed. Development of technical infrastructure is rather demanding for municipalities from the financial point of view. Moreover a key role could be played by the region itself, which may be involved in the negotiation about operational programmes. It also has possibilities to mediate contacts between individual municipalities which could subsequently cooperate in the above mentioned areas. The article raises some practical suggestions and recommendations of measures to be adopted in the monitored field of technical infrastructure.","[Linkeschova, Dana; Kocourkova, Gabriela; Istencinova, Nikol; Ticha, Alena; Hrabincova, Dagmar] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn, Veveri 331-95, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,"Linkeschova, D (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn, Veveri 331-95, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",linkeschova.d@fce.vutbr.cz; kocourkova.g@fce.vutbr.cz; nikolistencinova@seznam.cz; Ticha.a@fce.vutbr.cz; hrabincova.d@fce.vutbr.cz,"Kocourkova, Gabriela/AAD-9545-2019",,Brno University of Technology [FAST-S-18-5195],Brno University of Technology,This paper has been worked out under the project of the specific research at Brno University of Technology no.

Increasing car ownership is already reflected in high congestion levels in South African cities and does not appear to be reducing, despite policy interventions. The factors that drive the high car ownership intentions thus need to be investigated, so that policy efforts can be appropriately directed. The study aimed at investigating the car ownership intentions of students, as being most likely to drive car sales in the future, with the purpose of understanding the factors underlying the high desire to own a car. The study finds that although costs are the main barrier to market entry, and that most students intend to purchase a car as soon as they can afford it. These intentions are largely driven by the view that the quality of public transport constrains the movement of people and does not provide a travel alternative that is considered to be a reasonable alternative to the car, as indicated by the view that cars are a necessity. The study finds that although there are differences in the valuation of public and alternative modes of transport, based on demographic elements, familiarity with car usage and psychosocial factors, most students intend to own a car as the best means of travel, with little seeming to moderate the decision. The poor valuation of public and alternative transport suggests however that, whilst other measures to curb car use and promote public transport may have value, only significant service level improvements in public transport is likely to drive real behaviour change.","[Luke, Rose] Univ Johannesburg, Inst Transport & Logist Studios Africa, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Luke, Rose] ITLS, POB 524,Auckland Pk, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Johannesburg,"Luke, R (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, Inst Transport & Logist Studios Africa, Johannesburg, South Africa.",rluke@uj.ac.za,,,,,,,44,22,24,0,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Comparing with a baseline, two optimistic pathways explore greater market access, both within Europe (Deep integration) and globally (trade liberalisation). In contrast, an isolationist `trade bloc' pathway reflecting a deteriorating political situation between Russia and the West is also examined. In the 'baseline', Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (DCFTA) members realise market gains, whilst intra-CIS trade diversion effects are small. The 'deep integration' scenario (liberalisation' scenario) generates significant relative benefits for DCFTA signatories' agrifood (non-agrifood) activities. In both of these trade reform narratives, the Eurasia Economic Union (EAEU) economic gains are biased in favour of Russia's energy sector resulting in greater import dependence on agrifood commodities from the EU. The isolationist trade narrative nurtures EAEU agrifood activity, although at the cost of its macroeconomic growth.","[Philippidis, George] Aragonese Agcy Res & Dev ARAID, Zaragoza, Spain; [Sanjuan, Ana] Ctr Agrofood Res & Technol CITA, Zaragoza, Spain; [Tabeau, Andrzej; van Berkum, Siemen; Verma, Monika] Wageningen Econ Res WEcR, The Hague, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Philippidis, G (通讯作者)，Govt Aragon, Ctr Agrofood Res & Technol CITA, Aragonese Agcy Res & Dev ARAID, Avda Montanana 930, Zaragoza 50059, Spain.",gphilippidis@aragon.es,,"Van Berkum, Siemen/0000-0002-0248-8033",research project 'Agriculture and Trade Development in the EU's Eastern Neighbours' [AGRICISTRADE: KBBE. 2013. 1.4-10]; European Commission,research project 'Agriculture and Trade Development in the EU's Eastern Neighbours'; European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"This research was supported by the research project 'Agriculture and Trade Development in the EU's Eastern Neighbours' (AGRICISTRADE: KBBE. 2013. 1.4-10), supported by the European Commission under the 7th Framework Programme (FP7).

It looks at the fluidity between three segments of the classes of labour, namely debt-bonded, unskilled/self-employed and educated labourers. It examines how Dalit youths' experiences and representations of labour circulation and political clientelism shape and are shaped by the articulation between the construction industry and rural leaders, and by class, family, caste and generational relations in the village. Two points are made. First, circulation at the bottom of the labour hierarchy prevents labourers (even educated ones) to accumulate capital and participate in collective action: rather, the total lack of protection at work has brought about renewed and graded forms of dependence and political clientelism. Second, circulation serves as a locus that fosters and segments young male Dalit labourers' quests for respect, but hinders them from getting involved in political competition against rural leaders.","[Picherit, David] Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre La Def, CNRS, Lab Ethnol & Sociol Comparat, Maison Archeol & Ethnol LESC, 21 Allee Univ, F-92023 Nanterre, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paris Nanterre,"Picherit, D (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre La Def, CNRS, Lab Ethnol & Sociol Comparat, Maison Archeol & Ethnol LESC, 21 Allee Univ, F-92023 Nanterre, France.",picheritdavid@gmail.com,,,"Fondation Maison des Sciences de l'Homme, Paris; School of Oriental and African Studies; ESRC [ES/I036702/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I036702/1] Funding Source: researchfish","Fondation Maison des Sciences de l'Homme, Paris; School of Oriental and African Studies; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","This paper was written thanks to a postdoctoral fellowship funded by the Fondation Maison des Sciences de l'Homme, Paris and to a visiting scholarship at the School of Oriental and African Studies.

The key argument is that an increase in inflation expectations may reduce the real interest rate and thus encourage consumption spending. This article examines not only the traditional channels of the fall in the interest rate connected to the relative importance of the substitution and income effects, but it also investigates the impact on the perceived real future labour income. It is shown that if people do not adjust their expectations about future nominal labour income when inflation their expectations rise, the effect on present consumption can be negative, and the aggregate demand might be reduced rather than increased. A graphical and mathematical analysis in the paper exposes the relative importance of traditional channels and this new channel. It is shown that the traditional perspective is only a special case of a more general approach.","[Potuzak, Pavel] Vysoka Skola Ekon Praze, Narodohospodarska Fak, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Potuzák, P (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Ekon Praze, Narodohospodarska Fak, Prague, Czech Republic.",pavel.potuzak@vse.cz,"Potuzak, Pavel/C-2954-2019","Potuzak, Pavel/0000-0003-2561-5768",,,,,37,0,0,0,6,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Several factors inhibit women's participation in transport cycling. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between gender equality using the composite indicator of Gender Equality Index and its six core domains (work, money, knowledge, time, power, and health) plus violence and women's participation in transport cycling across the 28 member states of the European Union. The gross domestic product was included as a controlling variable. Results showed that the composite indicator of Gender Equality Index was associated with women's participation in transport cycling as well as with gender differences in participation in transport cycling. The core domains of health and work were not related to women's participation in transport cycling. Women's participation in transport cycling was associated with the following domains: time, power, and violence. The effect of gender equality varied across different indicators, with the strongest effect size found for time. The traditional sexual division of labour (gender gaps in caring and educating children or grandchildren, as well as in cooking and housework) may inhibit women's participation in transport cycling.","[Prati, Gabriele] Univ Bologna, Dept Psychol, Viale Europa 115, I-47521 Cesena, FC, Italy",University of Bologna,"Prati, G (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Psychol, Viale Europa 115, I-47521 Cesena, FC, Italy.",gabriele.prati@unibo.it,"Prati, Gabriele/K-8426-2014",,European Commission under the Horizon Framework Programme; Project XCYCLE [635975],European Commission under the Horizon Framework Programme; Project XCYCLE,This work was supported by the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme (2014-2020).

Because self-enforcement limits the feasible incentives, the conservation levels are constrained by the surplus created. Regardless of the degree of persistence of such opportunity costs across contracting periods, a first-best self-enforcing contract can deliver additional carbon sequestration beyond the business as usual scenario only if the value of forest conservation is sufficiently high. Otherwise, self-enforcing contracts can induce some, suboptimal level of carbon sequestration. The degree of persistence of opportunity costs across periods does not affect the amount of total payments provided in the optimal menu of contracts, but greater persistence of opportunity cost types leads to contracts that feature more of the total payment as a bonus in contracts for landholders with a high opportunity cost for their land and more of the total payment as an upfront fixed payment for landholders with a low opportunity cost.","[Salas, Paula Cordero] Univ Alabama, Econ Finance & Legal Studies Dept, 361 Stadium Dr,250 Alston Hall, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Roe, Brian E.; Sohngen, Brent] Ohio State Univ, Dept AED Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Salas, PC (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Econ Finance & Legal Studies Dept, 361 Stadium Dr,250 Alston Hall, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",paula@paulacordero.com,"Roe, Brian E/A-7386-2009",,Bank's Trust Fund for Environmentally and Socially Sustainable Development,Bank's Trust Fund for Environmentally and Socially Sustainable Development,This paper was prepared for the Development Economics Group of the World Bank as part of the project A Mechanism for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD): A Framework to Design Cost-effective Contracts.

Design/methodology/approach - dThe influence of central bank intervention-related events on USD/ZAR volatility is investigated through the application of Brown-Forsythe variance equality tests on individual dealer and market quotes. Furthermore, the study applies bivariate Granger-causality tests to individual dealers' USD/ZAR spot rate quotes, in an effort to determine whether certain dealers can be established as price leaders around an exogenous news event. Findings - The study finds significant evidence to suggest the USD/ZAR market price leadership of Nomura forex (FX) prior to the public announcement of a South African Reserve Bank intervention-related news event. This finding supports microstructure theory's assertions regarding the existence of foreign-exchange market characteristics such as trader heterogeneity and private information. Research limitations/implications - The paper is conducted on a sample of eight USD/ZAR market agents, of which six are offshore dealers, and only two are located locally. Although these proportions are somewhat relatable to the locations of rand turnover, it would still be interesting to investigate the existence of price leadership solely amongst South African authorised FX dealers. Practical implications - The results suggest the existence and price relevance of private information, as well as the heterogeneous nature of USD/ZAR market participants, based on informational asymmetries. The outcomes of the paper are useful to market participants, researchers, and central banks alike. Originality/value - Though the study does not impugn the body of work related to the orthodox macroeconomic approaches to exchange rate determination, it seems apparent that much more microstructure-related research still has to be conducted in the context of emerging market currencies. It is this void that the current study has attempted to provide for in contribution to literature.","[Shandu, Philani] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Shandu, Philani] Genesis Analyt Pty Ltd, Dept Appl Behav Econ, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Boako, Gideon] Univ Witwatersrand, Dept Finance, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Alagidede, Paul] Univ Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand; University of Witwatersrand; University of Witwatersrand,"Boako, G (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Dept Finance, Johannesburg, South Africa.",gboako@gmail.com,,"Shandu, Philani/0000-0002-0370-4842",,,,,55,0,0,0,44,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

According to the new regulations insured people born after 31st December 1948 are entitled to retire after reaching a retirement age of at least 60 years for women and at least 65 years for men. It means coming back to the previous retirement age, which was gradually increased from 1st January 2013. This reversal of pensionable age in Poland has significant economic and social consequences. The cognitive goal of the article is to analyze the macro- and microeconomic consequences of restoring the statutory retirement age at the previous level. The results of analyzes show that the macroeconomic effects of the restoration of the previous retirement age will be negative - the expected increase in public finances expenses for subsidies to the Social Insurance Fund, from which pension benefits in Poland are financed, and the decrease of the GDP growth dynamics related to the population aging and changes on labour market. Also in the microeconomic perspective the balance of changes of pensionable age is negative, because the expected replacement rates (retirement pension to recent or average earnings) will be reduced for both women and men, in case of women even much more drastic. The future replacement rates in Poland are projected to be among the lowest in the OECD. A full career average earner can expect the net pension to be 34% or 39% of previous earnings for men and women, respectively, against corresponding OECD averages of 62% and 63%. It can be assumed that sooner or later it will be necessary to extend the statutory retirement age in Poland. Due to strong politization of this issue that is unlikely to happen before the next parliamentary elections.","[Szczepanski, Marek] Poznan Univ Tech, PL-60461 Poznan, Poland; [Szczepanski, Marek] Poznan Univ Tech, Fac Engn Management, Econ Sci, PL-60461 Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Technology; Poznan University of Technology,"Szczepanski, M (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Tech, PL-60461 Poznan, Poland.;Szczepanski, M (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Tech, Fac Engn Management, Econ Sci, PL-60461 Poznan, Poland.",marek.szcze-panski@put.poznan.pl,"SZCZEPAŃSKI, MAREK/N-1685-2014","SZCZEPAŃSKI, MAREK/0000-0002-8929-7490",,,,,24,0,0,0,2,OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE,PRAGUE 3,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2283-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,138,145,,,,,,8,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL8FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000456200200018,0

This paper takes one particular mechanism from a very abstract concept to an approach that deserves serious consideration as the regulatory approach for electricity transmission investment. For this purpose, some adjustments of the original mechanism have to be made to take care of the rent extraction issue and to provide fairness among user groups. To the extent that reliability can be assessed and measured in monetary terms, it can also become part of the reward structure of the Transco. Most of the environmental issues associated with transmission investment can best be addressed by environmental rather than electricity regulators. A comparison of the adjusted mechanism with a central planning approach and a stakeholder bargaining approach to transmission investment brings out tradeoffs between the approaches but leads to a favorable assessment of the mechanism for practical applications.","[Vogelsang, Ingo] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, 270 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02116 USA",Boston University,"Vogelsang, I (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Econ, 270 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02116 USA.",vogelsan@bu.edu,,,,,,,38,6,6,0,2,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

We uncover three new results. Firstly, we find that opacity increases insolvency risks among banks. Secondly, we establish that the relationship between opacity and bank risk-taking is accentuated by the degree of banking market competition. Thirdly, we show that the bank business model moderates the risk-taking incentives of opaque banks, albeit only marginally. Overall, these findings suggest that the analysts forecast measure of bank opacity is useful for understanding risk-taking by publicly-traded banks, with important implications for bank stability.

As Hispanic students have been theorized to be more constrained in the college search and selection process, one potential policy lever is to increase the set of colleges to which these students apply and attend. In this paper, we investigate the impacts of the College Board's National Hispanic Recognition Program (NHRP), which recognizes the highest-scoring 11th-grade Hispanic students on the PSAT/NMSQT, as a mechanism of improving college choice and completion. The program not only informs students about their relative ability, but it also enables colleges to identify, recruit, and offer enrollment incentives. Overall, we find that the program has strong effects on college attendance patterns, shifting students from two-year to four-year institutions, as well as to colleges that are out-of-state and public flagships, all areas where Hispanic attendance has lagged. NHRP shifts the geographic distribution of where students earn their degree, and increases overall bachelor's completion among Hispanic students who traditionally have had lower rates of success. These results demonstrate that college outreach can have significant impacts on the enrollment choices of Hispanic students and can serve as a policy lever for colleges looking to draw academically talented students.

We make use of the index of donor performance from the Center for Global Development to compare the effects of quality-adjusted aid and unadjusted aid on changes in GDP per capita. Our difference-in-differences analysis reveals significant and quantitatively important treatment effects for quality-adjusted aid after the introduction of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness in 2005, while we do not find significant treatment effects for unadjusted aid. This implies that only recipient countries with increased aid inflows of high quality benefit in terms of increasing GDP per capita. The quality of aid matters most when accounting for delayed effects. However, our results depend on the sample of recipient countries. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Correspondingly, the cost of debt in such markets should be lower compared to markets facing a lower degree of international risk sharing. We empirically examine this prediction using a panel data set of sovereign bond yield spreads and a measure of suboptimal foreign bond portfolio allocations for 50 emerging and ten developed markets. Consistent with theory, our results show higher levels of foreign bond allocations - relative to the theoretical benchmark - are negatively related to the cost of debt. These results have important policy implications as a country's cost of debt could potentially be lowered by encouraging foreign portfolio investors to hold their optimal allocation.

In terms of industries, the household products and personal products industries have significant negative exposure as well.

Since then, more than 600 government officials have been investigated. We regard the investigations involving senior officials as signals of increased political uncertainty. Focusing on these events, we study how firms' exposure to political uncertainty varies with government ownership. It is found that the stock performance of private firms is worse on the event days than in normal times, whereas state-owned enterprises (SOEs) suffer less from the events. Moreover, the event-day effects are not quickly reversed in the post-event periods. Among SOEs, the negative impact of the events also decreases with government ownership. The evidence indicates that government ownership mitigates firms' exposure to political uncertainty. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Our hypothesis is that compliance increases until a certain auditing level is reached, and decreases beyond that level (i.e., an elevated auditing level backfires). In line with our expectation, the results of a series of tests indicate that there is a U-shaped association between auditing and tax evasion.

A diverse array of initiatives have been proposed and implemented with the aim of facilitating human economic and social development, while mitigating or even reversing associated environmental damage. These initiatives vary in their definitions of sustainability, their targets for planning and management, their bureaucratic structures, and other characteristics. As such, a universally applicable how-to manual for realizing the goals of regional sustainable development remains elusive. The objective of this paper is to provide scholars and practitioners with a simple analytical framework for assessing objectives, strengths, and weaknesses of sustainability initiatives at the regional scale. Drawing upon a review of theoretical and applied research on regional sustainable development, we categorize initiatives into typologies, including (1) Natural resource and ecology-based; (2) Urbanism; (3) Issue-based; and, (4) Governance, participation and science-based. We analyze each according to their focus, scope, fields of action and activities, and successes and challenges. Through this analysis, we define axes that highlight the prominent differences in characteristics between diverse approaches to sustain ability. These are: (1) top-down-bottom-up, based on who initiates and maintains the sustainability initiative; (2) ecological-socio economic, defining the relative emphasis on ecological and/or social systems; (3) holistic-subject-specific, defining the initiatives' breadth of the planning and management focus; and (4) regional-local, defining the spatial scale of the initiative. These axes are useful for highlighting considerations that may have been neglected within an initiative, possibly preventing successful outcomes. We suggest that successful sustainability initiatives are introspective and work progressively toward balance between the extremes of these axes. This conclusion is buttressed by the evolutionary development of three global-scale sustainability efforts initiated by UNESCO's Man and The Biosphere program, the International Long-Term Ecological Research Network, and the Urbanist movement.

The results show that LEED conveys to the market the presence of attributes like superior air, efficient systems, and recycling. However, the research also demonstrates significant independent rental premiums for features such as access to natural light, efficient HVAC, water conservation, public transit, an electric car charging station, and access to services even with the presence of green labels. ENERGY STAR is found to have a premium independent of the green building attributes, but not in concert with them.

Greater accessibility is often achieved by increasing individuals' potential mobility. However, potential mobility, if realized by motorized modes, can also generate negative environmental impacts such as fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. While the negative environmental impacts of greater mobility are acknowledged, there has been a lack of research to validate those impacts using empirical data, especially considering variations in individuals' mobility levels. This paper presents a method for estimating the expected environmental costs of accessibility represented by a network-time prism (NTP). A NTP delimits all accessible locations within a network and the available time for an individual to present at each location given a scheduled trip origin and destination, a time budget and the maximum achievable speeds along network edges. Estimating the expected environmental costs of a NTP involves three steps: (1) semi-Markov techniques to simulate the probabilities to move along network edges at given times; (2) the speed profiles for reachable edges, and (3) a cost function that translates speeds into environmental impacts. We focus on air quality and employ the motor vehicle emission simulator MOVESLite to estimate the CO2 emissions at both the edge and prism levels. We calibrate and validate the methods for experimental NTPs defined within the Phoenix, AZ, USA road and highway network using vehicles instrumented with GPS-enabled onboard diagnostic devices (OBD). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through two scenarios and investigate the impact of changes in mobility levels on the expected CO2 emissions associated with the experimental NTPs.","[Song, Ying] Univ Minnesota, Geog Environm & Soc, 414 Social Sci Bldg,267 19th Ave S, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Miller, Harvey J.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Geog, 1036 Derby Hall,154 North Oval Mall, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Miller, Harvey J.] Ohio State Univ, Ctr Urban & Reg Anal, 1036 Derby Hall,154 North Oval Mall, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Stempihar, Jeff] Arizona State Univ, Sustainable Engn & Built Envirohment, POB 873005, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Zhou, Xuesong] Arizona State Univ, Sustainable Engn & Built Envirohment, Coll Ave Commons,Room 474,660 S Coll Ave, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Song, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Geog Environm & Soc, 414 Social Sci Bldg,267 19th Ave S, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",yingsong@umn.edu; miller.81@osu.edu; JStempih@asu.edu; xzhou74@asu.edu,,"Miller, Harvey/0000-0001-5480-3421",National Science Foundation - United States [BCS-1224102],National Science Foundation - United States(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The research in this paper is supported by the National Science Foundation - United States under grant no.

We put an emphasis on direct pensions already perceived by retirees and to be paid in the future, without taking into account current contributors' future retirement. We find that the overall pension wealth is not very sensitive to the discount rate, but this result does not hold if we concentrate on the future pension wealth. From this point of view, it must be noted that some of the organisms have a high proportion of pension still to be paid. Moreover, whatever the type of pension wealth calculated, the results show a rapid increase from 2008 to 2012 (except for the basic scheme of farmers). Finally, spread indicators and Gini index of pension wealth are relatively higher than those found in the distribution of labor income by other studies.

We also show that the underpricing is affected by affiliations because of conflicts of interest that exist between the players: when an institutional investor is affiliated with a lead manager or with a venture capitalist we observe nepotistic behavior in hot IPOs and dumping ground behavior in cold IPOs.","[Geranio, Manuela] Bocconi Univ, Dept Finance, Via Roentgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Mazzoli, Camilla] Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Management, Ple Martelli 8, I-60121 Ancona, Italy; [Palmucci, Fabrizio] Univ Bologna, Dept Management, Via Capo di Lucca 34, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",Bocconi University; Marche Polytechnic University; University of Bologna,"Mazzoli, C (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Management, Ple Martelli 8, I-60121 Ancona, Italy.",manuela.geranio@unibocconi.it; c.mazzoli@univpm.it; f.palmucci@unibo.it,"Palmucci, Fabrizio/A-6297-2009","Palmucci, Fabrizio/0000-0002-8786-2409; Geranio, Manuela/0000-0003-0084-5225",,,,,35,2,2,1,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

With respect to stock's characteristics, trading volume and return on asset are related to better diversification, whereas profit margin and return on equity are related to least diversification.

By contrast, the narrative approach identifies a smaller increase in intermediate goods and services purchase but a large increase in employment compensation.

It provides a decomposition of the growth of Canada's trade flow with each of its top trading partners. The growth of Canada's bilateral trade with the prospective TPP member countries can be largely attributed to output growth, whereas a vast majority of trade growth with the non-member countries is associated with a reduction in trade costs. Moreover, the elimination of trade barriers after putting into effect free trade agreements considerably diminishes trade costs and raises bilateral trade.","[Liaqat, Zara] Univ Waterloo, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Liaqat, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",,,"Liaqat, Zara/0000-0002-9576-5748",,,,,19,1,1,0,6,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

This might be partly due to the model minority assumption that implies research on this population is not needed. This study is one of the first studies to examine the effects of social support on parental nurturance of children in a sample of Asian Indian parents and investigate the mediating role of parenting self-efficacy in this relationship pathway. We used newly available data from the Survey of Asian American Families and conducted analyses in the Asian Indian sub-sample (N = 211). The regression models controlled for a rich array of parent and child characteristics and family socioeconomic status. We found that parental nurturance was positively associated with family support but not with support from partner or friends. Parenting self-efficacy played a significant mediating role in the relationship between family support and parental nurturance. These findings have important implications for social work practice and policy interventions that address the needs of the growing ethnic minority population of Asian Indians in the US.","[Mathew, Sunny] Coll St Rose, Social Work, 432 Western Ave, Albany, NY 12203 USA; [Zhai, Fuhua] Fordham Univ, Grad Sch Social Serv, 113 West 60th St, New York, NY 10023 USA; [Gao, Qin] Columbia Univ, Sch Social Work, 1255 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10027 USA",Fordham University; Columbia University,"Mathew, S (通讯作者)，Coll St Rose, Social Work, 432 Western Ave, Albany, NY 12203 USA.",sthuruthippilly@gmail.com; fzhai1@fordham.edu; qin.gao@columbia.edu,"Mathew, Sunny/JFB-1599-2023","Mathew, Sunny/0000-0003-2472-6052",Fahs-Beck Fund for Research and Experimentation (US) and Lois and Samuel Silberman Fund,Fahs-Beck Fund for Research and Experimentation (US) and Lois and Samuel Silberman Fund,Funding was provided by Fahs-Beck Fund for Research and Experimentation (US) and Lois and Samuel Silberman Fund.,,105,13,18,0,18,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

In this article, we examined the productivity and welfare effects of the program using household-level data from rural Nigeria. The article employed instrumental variable regression approach to control for the potential endogeneity of the input subsidy program. Our results suggest that the program is effective in improving productivity and welfare outcomes of beneficiary smallholders. The size of the estimated effects suggests a large improvement in productivity and welfare outcomes. Moreover, the distributional effects of the program suggest no heterogeneity effects based on gender and farm land size. These results are robust to using alternative measurements of program participation. The benefit cost ratio of 1.11 suggests that the program is marginally cost-effective. Overall, our results suggest that while improving average productivity is a good outcome for improving food security, improving the distributional outcome of the program by targeting the most disadvantaged groups would maximize the program's contribution to food security and poverty reduction.

Digitizing G2P payments has the potential to dramatically reduce costs, increase efficiency and transparency, and help recipients build familiarity with digital payments. Digital wage and social transfer payments can also provide the onramp to financial inclusion and in many cases the first account that the recipient has in her own name and under her control. However, digitizing G2P payments is not without its challenges. Most importantly, digitization may require significant up-front investments in building an adequate physical payment infrastructure that is able to process such payments, as well as a financial identification system and a consumer protection and education framework to ensure that recipients have safe, reliable, and affordable access to the digital payment system.","[Klapper, Leora; Singer, Dorothe] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Finance & Private Sect Team, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Klapper, L (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Finance & Private Sect Team, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",lklapper@worldbank.org,,,,,,,28,12,14,7,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0257-3032,1564-6971,,WORLD BANK RES OBSER,World Bank Res.

Many oil exporters have established oil funds to delink government expenditure from oil revenues; however, their effectiveness remains unresolved. This paper examines the roles of oil funds and institutional quality in reducing fiscal procyclicality and macroeconomic volatility in 42 oil-exporting countries from 1960 to 2014 using panel vector autoregression techniques. The results show that oil funds are effective in reducing fiscal procyclicality in countries with high institutional quality. There is also a reduction in the procyclical bias in those with low institutional quality but the statistical evidence is weak. Nevertheless, oil funds are associated with reduced volatility of government consumption and the real exchange rate in countries with low institutional quality. These findings give credence to the macroeconomic stabilization role of oil funds but also reinforce the importance of good institutions.","[Koh, Wee Chian] Australian Natl Univ, Coll Asia & Pacific, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, CAMA, JG Crawford Bldg, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia",Australian National University,"Koh, WC (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Coll Asia & Pacific, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, CAMA, JG Crawford Bldg, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia.",wc.koh@anu.edu.au,,"Koh, Wee Chian/0000-0001-8710-5427","Centre for Strategic and Policy Studies (CSPS), Brunei Darussalam","Centre for Strategic and Policy Studies (CSPS), Brunei Darussalam","The author is also grateful for the detailed comments from an anonymous referee as well as the Managing Editor, Professor Andy McKay, which helped to improve the manuscript.

The Japanese market provides a unique environment to identify firms with poor-quality financial inputs because the stock exchanges require firms simultaneously to disclose (1) condensed financial statements for the current year and (2) management forecasts for the following year in their financial highlights (Kessan Tanshin) after the settlement of financial accounts and board approval before the final financial statements are issued. The simultaneous disclosure of management forecasts and earnings announcements implies that the firms that have restated their financial highlights are relying on poor-quality financial inputs to generate the statements and, most likely, the earnings forecast, as well. Our results suggest that restatement firms are likely to use poor-quality financial inputs and consequently report less accurate management forecasts. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This study helps to fill this gap by investigating how village democracy affects rural household welfare through these channels, using a unique household survey. The authors first establish a theoretical framework that links democracy to household welfare through changes in production efficiency. Focusing on both agricultural and forest production, they then implement empirical estimation using stochastic production frontier techniques with careful consideration of household heterogeneity in technical efficiency. They find that higher levels of village democracy significantly increase farmers' production efficiency, thereby improving their welfare. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study on the impacts of democracy on producer welfare using micro-level data.","[Xu, Ying] Univ Adelaide, Ctr Global Food and Resources, 5-25 Nexus 10, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Amacher, Gregory S.] Virginia Tech, Dept Forest Resources & Environm Conservat, Blacksburg, VA USA; [Xu, Jintao] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of Adelaide; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; Peking University,"Xu, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Ctr Global Food and Resources, 5-25 Nexus 10, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",ying.xu03@adelaide.edu.au; gamacher@vt.edu; xujt@pku.edu.cn,,"Xu, Jintao/0000-0001-5588-2942",,,,,41,4,4,0,21,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

The charter schools in this study designate small geographic areas within their attendance areas as priority zones. Each of the study charter schools has at least two priority zones: households located in priority one zones have a higher probability of admission than households located in priority two zones. We use this spatial variation in the likelihood of attending a charter school to identify the capitalization effect of increased charter school admission probabilities as the difference-in-differences within priority zone one and two border areas. Our results indicate that prices increased by six to eight percent for priority one zone homes compared to priority two zone homes after the opening of a new charter school.

Indigenous wildflowers, harvested according to conservation principles, are processed into Cape Flora' bouquets and sold into international and domestic markets. The principal supply chain provides an example of ethical trade due to the explicit environmental and social standards that are required at local sites of production. The incorporation of such standards represents an attempt to engender economic and social upgrading within the value chain. In this sense, the programme is consistent with dominant policy discourses, which suggest that exploiting potentially profitable niches within international trade flows represents a high road' to economic growth and transformation. The paper focuses upon the job creation and social impacts of the programme in the context of efforts to overcome South Africa's deeply entrenched socio-economic disparities and high poverty levels. Despite impressive growth in production and exports during the global financial crisis, there have been mixed outcomes in terms of benefits to stakeholders at the upstream end of the supply chain. The paper concludes by considering the extent to which local initiatives operating under the framework of ethical trade possess the potential to facilitate effective social and economic upgrading.","[Bek, David] Coventry Univ, Ctr Business Soc, Priory St, Coventry CV1 5FB, W Midlands, England; [Binns, Tony; Blokker, Thijs] Univ Otago, Dept Geog, POB 56, Dunedin, New Zealand; [McEwan, Cheryl] Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Sci Labs, South Rd, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Hughes, Alex] Newcastle Univ, Sch Geog Polit & Sociol, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",Coventry University; University of Otago; Durham University; Newcastle University - UK,"Bek, D (通讯作者)，Coventry Univ, Ctr Business Soc, Priory St, Coventry CV1 5FB, W Midlands, England.",David.Bek@coventry.ac.uk; jab@geography.otago.ac.nz; Thijs.Blokker@ghd.com; Cheryl.McEwan@durham.ac.uk; Alex.Hughes@ncl.ac.uk,,"Binns, Tony/0000-0003-1803-7218",Leverhulme Trust (UK) [F/00128/BE],Leverhulme Trust (UK)(Leverhulme Trust),"We would like to acknowledge the Leverhulme Trust (UK) for its generous support between 2010 and 2012 (grant reference: F/00128/BE).

In particular, countries with strong state capabilities are able to draw from a broader menu of policies than countries with lower capabilities. We apply and test this insight to the case of exposure to trade-related risk. So far, most of the literature has considered that only one type of policythe one that increases government sizecan help to overcome the challenge imposed by openness. However, there are a number of policies that can mitigate trade-induced risks, many of which do not have the necessary implication of increasing public spending. Yet, many such policies require governmental capabilities not available to any country. For that reason, while the choice of a particular policy within a menu depends on political conditions, the relationship between openness and the size of government might be mediated by the capabilities of states. This paper provides reduced form evidence confirming that the empirical relationship between openness and government size is conditional on state capabilities. Therefore, public policies cannot be assessed independently of the capacity of the State that would have to implement them.","[Chuaire, Maria Franco] World Resources Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Scartascini, Carlos] Interamer Dev Bank, Washington, DC 20577 USA; [Tommasi, Mariano] Univ San Andres, Victoria, BA, Argentina",Inter-American Development Bank,"Scartascini, C (通讯作者)，Interamer Dev Bank, Washington, DC 20577 USA.",carlossc@iadb.org,"Scartascini, Carlos/ABE-4489-2021","Scartascini, Carlos/0000-0001-7031-3983",,,,,105,14,16,1,17,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

Based on the idea that credibility can be measured by the difference between the policymaker's plans and the public's beliefs about those plans, several indicators were built. The findings denote that central bank credibility is able to more than counteract the bad effects on inflation caused by the exchange rate pass-through and thus contribute to greater price stability in developing economies. In brief, for the case of monetary authorities committed to anchor inflation expectations there is a gain of credibility that works as a tool to eliminate the pass-through effect on inflation.","[de Mendonca, Helder Ferreira] Fluminense Fed Univ, Dept Econ, Rua Dr Sodre 59, BR-26900000 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Tiberto, Bruno Pires] Cent Bank Brazil, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [de Mendonca, Helder Ferreira] CNPq, Natl Council Sci & Technol Dev, Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Central Bank of Brazil,"de Mendonça, HF (通讯作者)，Fluminense Fed UTablenivers, Dept Econ, Rua Dr Sodre 59, BR-26900000 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",helderfm@hotmail.com,"de Mendonca, Helder Ferreira/A-7415-2009; Tiberto, Bruno Pires/O-1886-2019","de Mendonca, Helder Ferreira/0000-0003-1465-1755; Pires Tiberto, Bruno/0000-0001-8176-8043",,,,,69,21,23,0,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

More specifically, recent work assumes that markets create the possibility to use resources more efficiently, which, theoretically, enables economies to grow as long as institutions adjust and enable the population to exploit the arising opportunities. That is, the current works in African economic history are to a large extent grounded in Smithian growth models, labelled after Adam Smith's work on the mechanisms of long-term growth. This paper critically discusses the explanatory value of the Smithian growth models for understanding the long-term economic development in Africa. The latter is best described as recurrent growth episodes, and we argue that while Smithian models can account for initial periods of growth, they fail to explain why the growth was not sustained. We use the boom and busts of cocoa production in Ghana in the twentieth century as a case in point. We show that the decline in cocoa production was not caused by state policies distorting the functions of the markets, as the Smithian growth models suggest. Instead, the decline in production was an outcome of changes in the ecological and institutional conditions that caused the initial growth. The irony is that it was the initial growth in cocoa production that altered the conditions, making further growth in production impossible. We capture these changes - for the first time ever - by combining the concepts of forest rents and involutionary growth in an African case.","[Green, Erik] Lund Univ, Dept Econ Hist, Box 7083, S-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Green, Erik] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Econ, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa",Lund University; Stellenbosch University,"Green, E (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ Hist, Box 7083, S-22007 Lund, Sweden.;Green, E (通讯作者)，Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Econ, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa.",Erik.Green@ekh.lu.se,,,,,,,61,6,6,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Voter turnout and votes cast under quadratic voting,PUBLIC CHOICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Voting; Voter turnout; Paradox of voting; Quadratic voting; Pivotality; Elections,INCENTIVES; MOTIVATION; ELECTIONS; CHOICE,"Who will vote quadratically in large-N elections under quadratic voting (QV)? First, who will vote? Although the core QV literature assumes that everyone votes, turnout is endogenous. Drawing on other work, we consider the representativeness of endogenously determined turnout under QV. Second, who will vote quadratically? Conditional on turning out, we examine reasons that, in large-N elections, the number of votes that an individual casts may deviate substantially from that under pure, rational QV equilibrium play. Because turnout itself is driven by other factors, the same determinants may influence how voters who do turn out choose the quantity of votes to cast. Independently, the number of votes actually cast may deviate dramatically from pure QV predictions because of the complex and refined nature of equilibrium play. Most plausibly, voting behavior and outcomes would be determined predominately by social and psychological forces, would exhibit few of the features emphasized in the analysis of hyper-rational equilibrium play, and would have consequential properties that require a different research agenda to bring into focus. Some of our analysis also has implications for voting behavior under other procedures, including one person, one vote.","[Kaplow, Louis; Kominers, Scott Duke] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kaplow, Louis; Kominers, Scott Duke] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kaplow, L (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Kaplow, L (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",meskridge@law.harvard.edu; kominers@fas.harvard.edu,,"Kominers, Scott/0000-0002-7608-6619","National Science Foundation [CCF-1216095, SES-1459912]; John M.

Based on more than 200 interviews, we unravel the complex dynamic mechanisms of changes in access to shea. We show that negotiations result in reduced access to shea for late comers as well as for people with a limited number of shea trees in their fields, since areas where shea is managed as a common-pool resource are becoming less accessible. However, we also demonstrate that late comers are not powerless in the face of first comers' claims to shea. Our results should help policy-makers and project-based activities concerning shea to focus more on issues related to access to this resource.","[Rousseau, Karen] CIRAD, BSEF, TA C-105 D Campus Int Baillarguet, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France; [Gautier, Denis] CIRAD, BSEF, Reg Off Burkina Faso, 06 BP 9478, Ouagadougou 06, Burkina Faso; [Wardell, D.

When central banks set an inflation target that is not fully communicated, agents draw inferences about inflation from recent data and remain alert to structural change by forming expectations from a forecasting model that is estimated via discounted least squares. Inflation targets can lead agents' beliefs to depart from rational expectations through two channels. First, implementing a higher inflation target can lead to overshooting. Second, there can be nearly self-fulfilling inflation, disinflation, or deflation that arises as an endogenous response to shocks. Policy implications for implementing a higher target without deanchoring expectations are discussed.","[Branch, William A.] Univ Calif Irvine, Econ, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Evans, George W.] Univ Oregon, Econ, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Evans, George W.] Univ St Andrews, Econ & Finance, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland",University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of Oregon; University of St Andrews,"Branch, WA (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Econ, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",wbranch@uci.edu; gevans@uoregon.edu,"Evans, George W/H-8051-2012",,National Science Foundation [SES-1025011],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),Financial support from National Science Foundation Grant no.

Unlike Standard & Poor's, which is a privately held division of McGraw-Hill, Moody's is a public company listed on the NYSE. From 2001 to 2010, Moody's has two shareholders, Berkshire Hathaway and Davis Selected Advisors, which collectively own about 23.5% of Moody's. Moody's ratings on bonds issued by important investee firms of these two stable large shareholders are more favorable relative to S&P, as well as Fitch, ratings. We exploit Moody's initial public offering in 2000 to address endogeneity and to mitigate concerns that the results are driven by issuer characteristics or by the greater informativeness of Moody's ratings. S&P's parent, McGraw-Hill, has a large shareholder for much less time, and some weak evidence exists that S&P ratings are relatively more favorable toward the owners of McGraw-Hill. These findings are consistent with regulatory concerns about the ownership and governance of rating agencies, especially those that are publicly listed.

For understanding the underlying decision process, it is key to identify what affects these preferences in different situations. To shed light on how people make intertemporal allocation choices, we analyze the stability of time preferences under time pressure. Conducting a laboratory study with 144 subjects using convex time budgets, we elicit time preferences with and without time pressure in a within-subject design. We find preferences to be stable across conditions for aggregate estimates of present-bias and utility function curvature. For standard discounting, we find subjects to be significantly less impatient under time pressure. All results hold across specifications and different sub-samples.

Monetary policy easing has a priori ambiguous effects on income and net wealth inequality via financial channels. Effects depend in a complex way on the relative size and distributions of assets, liabilities, and income. In practice, these effects are estimated to be small. A house price increase generally reduces net wealth inequality, while the opposite is true for increases in stock and bond prices. As monetary policy has the potential to affect inequality, monetary authorities face communication challenges.

In line with this general frame of analysis, this article intends to explore the impact of export variety on economic growth, interrelating variety with technological upgrading. Cointegration econometric results based on the Portuguese experience over the past four decades (1967-2010) show that greater related variety has led to a significant boost in growth, but only in the case of technologically advanced sectors.

Thus, model risk - the potential for different models to provide different probability-of-default (PD) estimates - is of crucial importance. Using a comprehensive German credit registry dataset from 40 banks and 17,000 corporate borrowers from 2008-2012, we assess the consistency of internal PD estimates across banks. We find three main results. First, the variability of PD estimates for the same borrower across banks is large. Second, bank fixed effects explain 5% of the variation in PD estimates across banks, while 95% of the variation is idiosyncratic. For the 10 largest banks in our sample, reported regulatory capital ratios would change by a maximum of +/- 10%, equivalent to approximately 1 percentage point, when using average risk weights from all banks instead of risk weights based on banks' individual PD estimates. Third, we explore various bank characteristics that explain the size of bank fixed effects. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Using Uganda as a case study, this paper employs an integrated computable general equilibrium-microsimulation model framework rich in household-level detail to assess the consequences of the East African Community EPA for economic output and poverty in Uganda. Simulations of the agreement's tariff liberalization provisions indicate a very small negative economic impact and ambiguous outcomes for poverty. The poverty results depend in size and sign on the poverty line, on the way the government addresses tariff revenue losses and on labor market assumptions.","[Boysen, Ole] Univ Hohenheim, Dept Agr & Food Policy, Stuttgart, Germany; [Matthews, Alan] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Econ, Dublin, Ireland",University Hohenheim; Trinity College Dublin,"Boysen, O (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Dept Agr & Food Policy, Stuttgart, Germany.",boyseno@tcd.ie,"Boysen, Ole/S-9441-2019","Boysen, Ole/0000-0003-2459-4715; Matthews, Alan/0000-0003-1051-1499",,,,,45,2,2,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

We find the least (most) structural change in the return of the health care sector for the UK (US) stock market, as both countries belong to two extreme (i.e., public and private) health care systems. There is also an overall increase of long-run interdependence between UK and US health care sectors. Both the subprime mortgage crisis and global financial crisis caused clear contagion effects between the health care sectors of DE and UK as well as those of US and DE.

A better understanding of these park-people conflicts would assist in suitable policy changes to constructively address them while concurrently pursuing conservation and livelihood goals. We interviewed 601 people living inside or along the borders of fifteen Colombian NPAs to identify five main categories of park-people conflicts. Based on interviews with 128 community leaders and 76 institutional-level respondents -mainly park officers- we discuss the five principal factors underlying the identified conflicts and present a conflict framework relating the dominant sources to the most prominent conflict manifestations. Finally, we detail five strategies toward conflict prevention. While simultaneous interventions at multiple levels would be ideal or preferred, our analysis suggests that the incidence of park-people conflicts in Colombia can be substantially lowered through (i) making the environmental legislative body more socially inclusive; and (ii) adequately empowering NPA administrations. We expect our findings to be valuable for managing conflict contexts in protected areas in other tropical countries. Further research is necessary to determine the most effective interventions for both conflict resolution and meeting conservation goals. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper we try to separate the portion of the correlation that is attributed to developments in common risk factors, which capture changes in the degree of risk aversion and the perceived amount of risk among international investors, from the impact of domestic or idiosyncratic risk factors. We employ a panel VAR model where all variables are treated as endogenous and the common risk factors are represented by widely used default and liquidity indexes. In this framework the residuals from the panel VAR model are associated with the effect that domestic/idiosyncratic factors have on sovereign and bank CDS prices. The main result we derive is that the European banking sector reacted homogeneously during the 2007:1-2009:12 period but after 2010, Euro-area Periphery countries became more idiosyncratic. Moreover, calculated directional volatility spillovers indicate that Eurozone periphery countries were net receivers and not net contributors to the financial instability caused by the subprime and the Eurozone sovereign debt crises.

If sick pay is set by the government and not paid for by firms, it induces the trade union to lower wages. This mitigates the positive impact on absence. Moreover, a union may oppose higher sick pay if it reduces labour supply sufficiently. Better employee health tends to foster wage demands. If the union determines both wages and sick pay, we identify situations in which it will substitute wages for sick pay because adverse absence effects can be mitigated.","[Goerke, Laszlo] IAAEU Trier Univ, Trier, Germany; [Goerke, Laszlo] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Goerke, Laszlo] CESifo, Munich, Germany",IZA Institute Labor Economics; Ifo Institut,"Goerke, L (通讯作者)，IAAEU Trier Univ, Trier, Germany.;Goerke, L (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.;Goerke, L (通讯作者)，CESifo, Munich, Germany.",,,,,,,,46,0,0,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

Far from being convergent or even complementary, the theories and policies are rather contradictory and conflicting in and between them. Nominally subsumed to the consumer welfare, the praise of competition and of its disciplinary power within the market economy (and twistingly even within the socialist one) has experienced between the eras of classical and neoclassical economic science a subtle transition from the paradigm of freedom to that of perfection. And the transition was accomplished with a significant risk of loss both in internal consistency and realistic adequacy, which undergo the fictional methodology as well as the mathematical formalism, endemic in the neoclassical approach. The tension inside the theorizing of competition cohabits with the one inside the policies' camp: the regulations often seem to be at odds with the stated commitment towards the consumers (seen holistically and aggregately). Some of the real flesh and blood consumers become in fact passive objects of pro-competition coercive rearrangements of welfare in three hypostases that individuals (though unevenly) subsume: as consumers (of goods and services), as competitors (factors of production in labour markets) and as citizens (asymmetrically hit by the myriad of policies). This paper offers an original recovery of a common sense argument: after the mainstream imposition of perfect instead of free competition standard, the neoclassicism-inspired public policies end up promoting a competition climate heavily strained from both freedom and perfection.","[Jora, Octavian-Dragomir; Hurduzeu, Gheorghe; Iacob, Mihaela; Cretan, Georgiana-Camelia; Hurduzeu, Raluca-Elena] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Jora, OD (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",octavian.jora@yahoo.com,"; Georgescu (Cretan), Georgiana Camelia/I-7565-2016","JORA, Octavian-Dragomir/0000-0001-7111-3078; Georgescu (Cretan), Georgiana Camelia/0000-0001-7901-535X",,,,,58,2,2,0,12,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,MAY,2017,19.0,45,,,,,544,565,,,,,,22,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EZ2EY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404523800015,0

We find that the realized forecasts from the HAR model with bagging and principal component (PC) combination approaches produce the lowest MSFE at relatively longer forecast horizons.

However, given a desire to maximize the impact of limited funds by avoiding transfers that do not change behavior, typically some potential recipients are excluded on the basis of their characteristics, their actions or at random. This paper uses a laboratory experiment to study the behavior of individuals excluded on different bases from a new incentive that encourages real monetary donations to a public environmental conservation program.

Very little, however, is known regarding how these relationships vary on a cross-national basis, including across countries at different stages in development. To address this gap, this paper presents an analysis of household transport expenditure as a function of the available variables, with a particular focus on the ICT. This analysis is based on a cross-sectional dataset from 2010 comprising information on 33 countries including average household transport expenditure, ICT represented by the percentage of households with Internet access at home, and a number of contextual macroeconomic and infrastructural variables. Using a log-log framework we find that, in our sample of countries, household transport expenditure is negatively associated with Internet penetration with an elasticity of -0.394. We verify this to be robust to endogeneity using presence of restrictions on foreign ownership in the Internet market as an instrumental variable. We also control for potential differences in data quality across countries using the Corruption Perceptions Index. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to quantify this relationship at a cross national level while also controlling for endogeneity and data quality issues. Among the control variables, we observe the estimated effects to be intuitive, and consistent with existing research and microeconomic understandings of the behaviour of individuals and households.","[Bris, Myriam; Pawlak, Jacek; Polak, John W.] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Transport Studies, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Pawlak, Jacek; Polak, John W.] Imperial Coll London, Urban Syst Lab, London, England",University of London; University College London; Imperial College London; Imperial College London,"Pawlak, J (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll London, Ctr Transport Studies, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England.",jacek.pawlak@imperial.ac.uk,"Polak, John W/L-1481-2017","Pawlak, Jacek/0000-0002-3254-6257",Digital City Exchange research programme at Imperial College London - Research Councils UK's Digital Economy Programme (EPSRC) [EP/I038837/1]; EPSRC [EP/I038837/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/I038837/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Digital City Exchange research programme at Imperial College London - Research Councils UK's Digital Economy Programme (EPSRC); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),This work was supported by the Digital City Exchange research programme at Imperial College London funded by Research Councils UK's Digital Economy Programme (EPSRC Grant No. EP/I038837/1).,,102,21,21,1,12,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

A natural way to assess multivariate dependence is to use copula models. The application of copula models in the multipopulation mortality analysis, however, is still in its infancy. In this article, we present a dynamic multipopulation mortality model based on a two-factor copula and capture the time-varying dependence using the generalized autoregressive score (GAS) framework. Our model is simple and flexible in terms of model specification and is widely applicable to high dimension data. Using the Swiss Re Kortis longevity trend bond as an example, we use our model to estimate the probability distribution of principal reduction and some risk measures such as probability of first loss, conditional expected loss, and expected loss. Due to the similarity in the structure and design of CAT bonds and mortality/longevity bonds, we borrow CAT bond pricing techniques for mortality/longevity bond pricing. We find that our pricing model generates par spreads that are close to the actual spreads of previously issued mortality/longevity bonds.","[Chen, Hua] Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [MacMinn, Richard D.] Natl Chengchi Univ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Sun, Tao] Univ Wisconsin, La Crosse, WI 54601 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; National Chengchi University; University of Wisconsin System,"Chen, H (通讯作者)，Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",hchen@temple.edu; richard@macminn.org; tsun@uwlax.edu,"MacMinn, Richard D/D-1909-2010","SUN, Tao/0000-0002-2035-2260",,,,,61,17,18,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

Using 1,824 films released during 2000-2014, we examine determinants of box office revenues and critical reviews, while addressing the overlap between them. Our results indicate that consumers and critics respond differently not only to film rating but also to film budgets, story sources, genre, and political content.

We identify a partial disclosure equilibrium in which firms in the lowest value region neither disclose nor repurchase, firms with intermediate values disclose but do not repurchase, and firms in the highest value region induce undervaluation by not disclosing and buy back shares. In particular, the well known unraveling result when the manager is always informed (and when disclosure is costless) the typical upper-tailed disclosure region in classic voluntary disclosure models need not obtain when informed managers can use repurchases to extract information rents. We offer a new perspective on open-market share repurchases-the most common form of share repurchases when chosen optimally with disclosure.

Four spatial regression models are used to investigate the effect on the MAG of six factors of the built environment (distance to city public centers, residential density, landuse mix, bus stop density, metro station density and road network density). The results show that travel time for a given origin to destination (OD) trip is likely to be larger by public transport than by car, especially for a trip of longer travel time. The MAG values of all the communities are larger than 0, indicating that when compared with public transport, travelling by car takes less travel time for individuals. Residential density, land-use mix, bus stop density and metro rail station density have significant negative direct impacts and indirect impacts (spatial spillover effects) on MAG, which indicates that appropriate increase in community residential density, providing diversified service facilities within a community, and improving public transport supply are beneficial to promote modal shift. Specifically, the role of metro rail is greater than that of buses. However, the road network density has significant direct positive impacts on MAG, and its spillover effect is also significantly positive, which indicates that building more roads is not an effective way to narrow the accessibility gap between public transport and cars but may facilitate more car travel instead.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first article to apply the LSHAC model to mortality studies. Through an extensive empirical analysis on modeling mortality experiences of 13 countries, we demonstrate that the LSHAC model, which has the advantage of capturing the geographical structure of mortality data, yields better fit, compared to the elliptical copulas. In addition, the proposed LSHAC model generates out-of-sample forecasts with smaller standard deviations, when compared to other benchmark copula models. The LSHAC model also confirms that there is an association between geographical locations and dependence of the overall mortality improvement. These results yield new insights into future longevity risk management. Finally, the model is used to price a hypothetical survival index swap written on a weighted mortality index. The results highlight the importance of dependence modeling in managing longevity risk and reducing population basis risk.","[Zhu, Wenjun] Nankai Univ, Sch Finance, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Tan, Ken Seng] Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Wang, Chou-Wen] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Wang, Chou-Wen] Natl Chengchi Univ, Coll Commerce, Risk & Insurance Res Ctr, Taipei, Taiwan",Nankai University; University of Waterloo; National Sun Yat Sen University; National Chengchi University,"Zhu, WJ (通讯作者)，Nankai Univ, Sch Finance, Tianjin, Peoples R China.",zhuwenjun@nankai.edu.cn; kstan@uwaterloo.ca; chouwenwang@gmail.com,"Zhu, Wenjun/ABC-4088-2021","Zhu, Wenjun/0000-0002-7251-9579","Society of Actuaries (SoA) James C.

In addition, direct likelihood-ratio tests find that the knife-edge restrictions of unspanned models are rejected with high statistical significance, though these restrictions have only small effects on cross-sectional fit and estimated term premia.","[Bauer, Michael D.; Rudebusch, Glenn D.] Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - San Francisco,"Bauer, MD (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA.",,"Bauer, Michael/A-6573-2019","Bauer, Michael/0000-0002-2711-816X",,,,,56,29,31,2,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

We propose that e-business value depends on how fast growth SMEs deploy IT resources, strategic planning, culture, and business partnerships to develop e-business capability and business process competence which help these companies to achieve outstanding business performance. Structural equation modelling is employed to test our theoretical conceptualization on a cohort of 310 Australian fast growth SMEs across different industrial sectors. The results show that IT resources, strategic IT alignment, market orientation, and business partnerships do contribute significantly and indirectly to SME performance through the development of e-business capability and business process competence. Our study provides an initial empirical evidence to understand the relationship between IT and entrepreneurial SME performance. These findings have important implications for research and business practices.","[Bi, Rui] Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Management & Mkt, POB 789, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia; [Davison, Robert M.] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Informat Syst, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Smyrnios, Kosmas X.] RMIT Univ, Sch Management, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Charles Sturt University; City University of Hong Kong; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Bi, R (通讯作者)，Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Management & Mkt, POB 789, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia.",rbi@csu.edu.au; isrobert@cityu.edu.hk; kosmas.smyrnios@rmit.edu.au,"Davison, Robert M/E-4383-2013","Davison, Robert M/0000-0002-7243-3521; Smyrnios, Kosmas/0000-0003-1390-5856; Bi, Rui/0000-0001-7016-9168",,,,,85,30,37,2,97,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The present paper develops a theoretical framework to study an endogenously growing economy which is subject to pollution-induced health shocks with the health status being an argument of the welfare function. Pollution, arising as a negative externality from production, adversely and randomly affects the regeneration ability of a human body leading to a decline in the overall health status of the population. We include two types of uncertainty surrounding the health status: continuous small-scale fluctuations, driven by the Wiener process, and large-scale shocks or epidemics, driven by the Poisson process. We derive closed-form analytical solutions for the optimal abatement policy and the growth rate of consumption. Devoting a constant fraction of output to emissions abatement delivers the first-best allocation. This fraction is an increasing function of total factor productivity, polluting intensity of production, and damage intensity of both continuous and jump-type shocks. A higher frequency of jumps also calls for more vigorous abatement policies. By contrast, the optimal growth rate of the economy is decreasing in the frequency and intensity of shocks and in the polluting intensity of output. The efficiency of abatement technology has, in general, an ambiguous bearing on both the growth rate and on the abatement share due to the opposing forces of the direct and indirect effects.","[Bretschger, Lucas; Vinogradova, Alexandra] ETH, CER, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Bretschger, L (通讯作者)，ETH, CER, Zurich, Switzerland.",lbretschger@ethz.ch; avinogradova@ethz.ch,,"Brausmann, Alexandra/0000-0002-8769-8944",,,,,31,11,11,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

What is not apparent is how, and how well, national governments can implement actions after reclaiming the authority to plan. I answer this question through a case study of recentralization Bolivia's Zero Malnutrition Program (ZM). My data come from ongoing fieldwork I conducted in Bolivia since the launch of the ZM program in 2007, but focus on additional, in-depth fieldwork I carried out over a period of 13 months during the program's fourth and fifth year of implementation. Data collection methods included semi-structured interviews, participant observation, document review, and secondary data analysis at local, regional, and national levels of the program. I argue that national planners may find it difficult to avoid replicating the fragmented planning model recentralization is often working against. In the Bolivia case, when ZM planners were given the rare opportunity to lead national-level health reform, they believed the fastest way to act was to rely primarily on short-term consultants. This allowed for fast action on the ground, but at the cost of constant staff rotation and loss of momentum, training gaps, turf wars, and eventually, a loss of accountability and credibility for the program overall. How ZM staff at different levels of the program overcame these added challenges, however, is perhaps the most important story. Through participatory planning, a negotiated implementation approach, the re-skilling of mid-level managers, and the work of emerging street-level champions, I show how ZM planners and staff eventually began to restore public sector capacity. These findings contribute to the dearth of research on public sector implementation, particularly as it relates to developing countries and the growing initiatives aiming to effectively re-build national planning capacity.

Our study of the scandal reaches two main conclusions: 1) the removal of corrupt politicians happens mostly at the pre-election stage; 2) information availability is a crucial ingredient in the accountability process. we also show that punishment was directed to individual MPs rather than their parties and that voters displayed a substantial partisan bias, not only at the voting stage but also by perceiving co-partisan MPs to be less involved in the scandal. Ceteris paribus, female MPs attracted more press coverage and, for the same amount of coverage, were more likely to stand down.

It then highlights the importance of individual bank characteristics in identifying the asymmetric effect of swap lines on bank stocks. Bank level evidence suggests that stock prices of local and less-well capitalized banks as well as banks with high foreign currency exposures and high reliance on short-term funding responded more strongly to SNB swap lines.

In this analysis, we find that higher minimum wage values are associated with higher levels of GDP per capita, in both SSA and non-SSA countries. Using two measures to assess the level at which minimum wages are set, we find that minimum wages in SSA countries are on average lower-relative to average wages-than most other comparable regions of the world. Thus, SSA as a whole reflects no particular bias toward a comparatively more pro-minimum wage policy. Within SSA, however, we observe that low-income countries set relatively higher minimum wages than middle-or upper-income countries. We find significant variation in the detail of minimum wage regimes and schedules in the region, as well as large variations in compliance. Notably, several countries in SSA have relatively complex minimum wage schedules, and on average we find high levels of noncompliance among covered workers. We also summarize the limited research on the employment effects of minimum wages in SSA, which are consistent with global results. By and large, introducing and raising the minimum wage appears to have small negative employment impacts or no statistically significant negative impacts. There are country studies, however, where substantial negative effects on employment are reported-often for specific cohorts. The release of country-level earnings and employment data at regular intervals lies at the heart of a more substantive, country-focused minimum wage research agenda for Africa.",,,,,,,,,,,59,27,29,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0257-3032,1564-6971,,WORLD BANK RES OBSER,World Bank Res.

To develop effective policies, it is important to know whether mothers with young children who are not gainfully employed prefer to be at home and care for their children, or are involuntarily out of the labor force, because they could not prevent getting those children. In this study having twins is used as the external shock due to which some women have obtained more children than they wanted. These women are compared with those who are similar in many respects (married and have at least one child) but did not experience this shock. We use a newly constructed database that contains information on almost 250,000 women living in Sub-Saharan Africa of whom 4,863 women, or about 2%, reported a twin birth of which both children survived. To our knowledge, the present study has the highest number of twins of any Instrumental Variables study that uses twins for estimating causal effects, so that the estimates are very precise. We find that the number of children below age six has a significantly negative effect on the woman's ability to work in the non-farm sector; it reduces the odds of employment of African mothers by 6%. The effects of the number of young children on women's non-farm work are more problematic for older women and for women with more years of education. These findings imply that investments in family planning are likely to enhance the opportunities for women to work for pay and that policies aimed at facilitating the combination of child rearing and paid labor are particularly important for educated and older women.

We extend the Malmquist Productivity Index by applying an additive two-stage DEA model. This allows us to explore the sources of growth in different stages of production. Furthermore, we assess the integration of European banks by analyzing the beta-convergence and sigma-convergence of the two-stage Productivity Index. Our results show a productivity growth during the U.S. subprime crisis, but a consistent decline during the global financial crisis. The loss of competitiveness of the European banking system is due to the drop in growth of the performance stage and technical change. Finally, we find a strong convergence pattern during the financial crisis, mainly driven by the catch up process of some Eastern countries and the drop in performance of Western countries.

In consequence, policy makers frequently try to regulate them and modern marketing arrangements are increasingly emerging to address some of their presumed deficiencies. However, it is unclear how trustworthy these markets actually are. The purpose of this study is to look at these issues in the case of coffee marketing in Ethiopia. Coffee markets in Ethiopia present an interesting case study due to the high price and quality differentiation linked to a number of both easily and not so easily observable characteristics. Moreover, modern marketing practices, such as modern retail, branding and packaging, are becoming increasingly common in Ethiopia's urban coffee markets. When we define and examine trustworthiness in the Addis Ababa coffee market as a function of weights and quality, we find that traditional traders are relatively trustworthy on observable quality characteristics and weights. However, there is a consistent pattern of over-representation of not so easily verifiable quality characteristics. We further find that modern marketing outlets or formats, including modern domestic retail and branded packaged products, deliver higher quality at a higher price, but are not more trustworthy than traditional marketing arrangements in terms of these dimensions of trade transactions.

It uses (1) a polychoric principal component analysis to construct indicators of household asset endowments, (2) the growth incidence curve to analyze the pro-poorness of the different assets, and (3) a Shapley value framework decomposition to account for changes in deprivation in terms of within-sector growth and changes in within-sector inequality. Data is sourced from the second and third Cameroon household consumption surveys. Results show that: (a) pro-poor growth is not observed for all assets and households at the bottom of the distribution of the different assets experienced an increase in inequality; (b) for all asset endowments, overall deprivation worsened between 2001 and 2007; (c) whereas the growth component mitigated the worsening incidence, depth and severity of human asset deprivation, both growth and redistribution components accounted for the worsening physical, financial and social asset deprivations; (d) while the tertiary sectors of activity benefited some human asset poverty reduction, all sectors suffered from worsening financial and social asset deprivation.

Although this model is widely used in the evaluation of businesses, empirically there are still concerns regarding the characterization and correlations between the elements of the model and the connection with the performance of a company. This article aims to determine the correlations between the elements of the EFQM model based on the results of a research conducted in a clothing company in Romania. For this, the factor analysis was applied in order to determine both the correlations between the elements of the model and in order to group them in several strategic directions. Based on the results, there were determined three strategic directions. Out of these directions, one was oriented towards the external environment of the company, one was oriented towards the internal environment and the third one towards the brain of the company, who has the vision and the strategic thinking.","[Pop, Nicolae Alexandru; Pelau, Corina] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Pelau, C (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",corinapelau@yahoo.com,"Pelau, Corina/F-4663-2015; Pop, Nicolae Alexandru/L-9045-2016","Pelau, Corina/0000-0002-6139-028X;",,,,,25,18,18,0,14,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2017,19.0,44,,,,,28,40,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EN1CB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000395746900003,0

In the past fifteen years the turn to religion in development studies has altered how development scholars and practitioners perceive religious actors, opening up possibilities for renewed partnership. Yet the turn to religion in development has mostly disregarded missionaries. This oversight is partly due to the complicated historical relationship between Western Christian missionaries and development workers. Although missionaries have long participated in the work of development, present-day missionaries remain associated with coercive proselytization, or they are overlooked in literature on religion and development. In order to understand the challenges of positioning missionaries in development, I review 48 sources which create, apply, or critique typologies of faith-based organizations (FBOs). FBO typologies of the past fifteen years have broken new ground in exploring the links between beliefs and practices of religious actors doing development work. Yet these typologies struggle to position missionaries due to (1) simplistic categorization of FBOs, (2) unhelpful scales of religiosity, and (3) a basis in outdated assumptions of separate spheres of religious and secular actors, and separate worlds of religion and development. Based on shared critiques of FBO typologies, I propose a new framework for positioning missionaries. The framework provides a shared space to explore how all development actors, both religious and secular, are shaped by the interaction between sacred and material influences. The framework offers a way to move beyond circular arguments about comparative advantage of religious or secular approaches toward an appreciation of the complementarity of different approaches to development. The article concludes with a shared critique of missionaries and development workers who impose their beliefs and values on others. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, it is not enough to just have the knowledge, the right approach has to be found for the knowledge to be useful, thus in this paper authors are examining the theoretical framework of knowledge management and organizational innovations. Knowledge management is a systematic management of an organization's knowledge assets for the purpose of creating value, meeting tactical & strategic requirements and fostering innovations in an organization. However, most of the enterprises do not pay enough attention to using the available knowledge to gain the greatest effect. Right now scholars have different approaches which explain knowledge management and its processes. Also there are many key questions to be answered to understand the real necessity of knowledge management, for example, how to promote a culture conducive to learning, sharing, and knowledge creation, how to make the right knowledge available to the right people at the right time etc. The purpose of this paper is to propose literature review for understanding the theoretical framework of organizational innovations and knowledge management by examining the current researches done by scholars in order to create new theoretical framework for further empiric analysis.

Specifically, we investigate whether there is a long-run relationship between the RC and Greece and between the TRNC and Turkey, in terms of inflation, interest rates, money supply, and foreign direct investment (FDI). The paper contributes to the literature by examining financial integration in the unique case of Cyprus, where two separate, small economies each operate in a monetary union with their respective mainland partners. The results of our analysis indicate the strong integration of the financial markets of the TRNC and Turkey, and of the RC and Greece. We also demonstrate that financial-market indicators in the TRNC and the RC are largely driven by mainland-partner economies, further advancing the literature on financial integration.","[Balcilar, Mehmet] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Via Mersin 10, Famagusta, Northern Cyprus, Turkey; [Balcilar, Mehmet] Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier, France; [Kutan, Ali M.] Southern Illinois Univ, Sch Business, Dept Econ & Finance, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA; [Yaya, Mehmet E.] Eastern Michigan Univ, Dept Econ, 703 Pray Harrold Hall, Ypsilanti, MI 48197 USA",Eastern Mediterranean University; Montpellier Business School; Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University Edwardsville; Eastern Michigan University,"Yaya, ME (通讯作者)，Eastern Michigan Univ, Dept Econ, 703 Pray Harrold Hall, Ypsilanti, MI 48197 USA.",myaya@emich.edu,"BALCILAR, MEHMET/K-7346-2019","BALCILAR, MEHMET/0000-0001-9694-5196; Kutan, Ali/0000-0003-4446-4627",,,,,40,1,1,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

Many countries have imposed standards on both domestically produced and imported food. In particular, countries have implemented regulations to control the quantity and quality of vegetable imports. Maximum Residue Limit (MRL) standards are one of the main restrictions adopted by numerous countries. Japan has one of the strictest MRL standards in the world. This study builds on previous studies to explore the impact of MRL standards on Japanese vegetable imports. Gravity models are used to analyze how MRL standards influence the Japanese imports of different types of vegetables (fruit vegetables, leafy vegetables, bulb vegetable, and root vegetables). The results reveal that the trade impacts of MRL standards are different for different types of vegetables, with the most significant impact on imports of leafy and fruit vegetables and the least significant impact on imports of bulb vegetables.","[Choia, Jong Woo] Korea Rural Econ Inst, 601 Bitgaram Ro, Naju Si 58217, Jeollanam Do, South Korea; [Yue, Chengyan] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, 458 Alderman Hall,1970 Folwell Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Yue, Chengyan] Univ Minnesota, Dept Hort Sci, 458 Alderman Hall,1970 Folwell Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Yue, C (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, 458 Alderman Hall,1970 Folwell Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.;Yue, C (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Hort Sci, 458 Alderman Hall,1970 Folwell Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",yuechy@umn.edu,,,,,,,45,6,6,1,23,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

Key concept of industrial symbiosis is to ensure that one industry's waste becomes another industries raw material. It is considered that it can generate the highest environmental, social and economic benefits as well as business opportunities, but at the same time the highest business risks followed by utility sharing and planning and management are to be addressed. Latvia is currently entering the stage of transition towards circular economy. When speaking of circular economy, it has to be stated that it appeared in the literature through recycling, recovery and reuse and is most commonly associated with waste management. The aim of the research is to analyse Latvian municipal waste landfills as starting points for industrial symbiosis, thus fostering regional economic development. The research is based on quantitative and qualitative methods, including data analysis (primary and secondary data), systems dynamics and mathematical modelling. Main results and findings of the study are development of landfill's resource equations, which can be applied to any landfill in order to identify most valuable internal resources that can be offered for industrial symbiosis Theoretical and practical implications of the research are in development of a methodologically justified. The authors develop a set of modules, which can be attracted for industrial symbiosis. Main conclusions of the research are that implementation of industrial symbiosis on a landfill basis allows company to undertake risk diversification, consequently decreasing their current direct dependence from landfilled waste volume.","[Cudecka-Purina, Natalija; Atstaja, Dzintra] BA Sch Business & Finance, Riga, Latvia",,"Cudecka-Purina, N (通讯作者)，BA Sch Business & Finance, Riga, Latvia.",,"ATSTAJA, Dzintra/A-6576-2010; Cudecka-Purina, Natalija/V-4988-2019","ATSTAJA, Dzintra/0000-0002-9411-7212; Cudecka-Purina, Natalija/0000-0002-5736-7730",,,,,20,0,0,0,11,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-286-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,116,125,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393400012,0

Consequently, the theory indicates that relative abundances and intensities of these resources should play fundamental roles in influencing trade patterns in international bank loan and deposit markets. The paper focuses on the theory's implication that systematic relationships should exist between measured overall capital intensities of nations' banking systems and their net exports and imports of loans and deposits.

The article explores the specifics of assessing the efficiency of PPP projects abroad. An analytical review of foreign methods for assessment of the effectiveness of PPP projects has showed that the following indicators should be included in the national methodology: debt load (helps objectively assess the credit load of a private partner before attracting new loans and credits); Liquidity (solvency): an indicator of current liquidity, fast liquidity; Budgetary efficiency: assessment of the increase in the budget load as a result of the adoption of additional obligations, the risks of project implementation (the risk of underutilization of the facility), the discounted indicator of budget efficiency, the budget efficiency index, etc. It seems that the least developed are the issues of the balance of interests of the project stakeholders. Ignoring the need to take into account the interests of the parties in PPP projects increases the risks of the project, which can become a negative factor for the national economy of the country as a whole.

The values of the coefficients at x for year 2015 were positive (3.22 - for small enterprises; 0.68 - for medium enterprises; 1.67 - for individual entrepreneurs), hence, with increasing values of budget expenditures in a particular region the magnitude of SMEs output were also increasing.

However, the frequent occurrence of extreme weather phenomena in recent years has brought great risks to the cultivation of agricultural products. In this context, this paper takes the index insurance as the breakthrough point, and takes the Heilongjiang rice production weather index insurance as the research object, carries on the product design and pricing research of weather index insurance. The agricultural index insurance takes determined index as compensation factor, thus it can effectively avoid the inherent moral hazard and adverse selection in traditional insurance products. At present, the research on the pricing of weather index insurance products mainly includes: actual historical production method (APH), empirical rate method, yield distribution model. The actual historical yield method is based on the normal distribution of production, and the rate is determined by the mean and variance of the distribution. On this basis, Jerry and Michael (1999) introduced the trend yield to APH method, and then use the relative meteorological yield as the pure rate of insurance (ie, the yield loss rate). This method is the empirical rate method. The core of yield distribution model is to determine the probability distribution of risk loss. The common methods include parameter estimation method and nonparametric estimation method. The common parameter estimation methods include : Gamma distribution, Beta distribution, Weibull distribution, hyperbolic arcsin distribution, logarithmic normal distribution and exponential distribution. In recent years, the nonparametric estimation method has attracted the attention of many scholars with its flexible and accurate fitting effect, but Barry and Olivier (2004) have shown that the nonparametric method is not robust under the small sample. The structure of this research is as follow: Firstly, we will systematically review the domestic and foreign scholars on the weather index insurance, and on this basis we will determine the research focus. Secondly, based on the analysis of the growth characteristics and weather characteristics of rice in Heilongjiang Province, we will carry out disaster-cause analysis, and the relevant meteorological factors were selected according to the principle of sensitive, measurable, stable and transparent. Thirdly, we will determine the trend yield and analyze the rationality of the model. If the trend yield is not accurate, it will cause error in weather output, and eventually undermine the product function. Therefore, this paper will use the moving average method to determine the trend yield, and use the ARIMA model to verify the reliability of the trend yield. And then determine the relative meteorological output (yield loss rate) on this basis. Fourthly, we will establish the relative meteorological yield-meteorological factor relationship model. select the relevant meteorological factors, build meteorological index and determine the trigger value. Lastly, weather index insurance product pricing. In this part, we use the empirical rate method and the parameter estimation method in the yield distribution model to calculate the insurance rate of the weather index insurance, and analyze and compare the difference between the two results, and then on the basis of the pure rate of insurance determine the insurance premium rate. We believe that the research and application of weather index insurance products are of great value in optimizing the structure of agricultural insurance market in China and improving the insurance ability of agriculture.","[Hao Jifei; Wang Haiyan] Tongji Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Room 816,Tongji Bldg,1500 Siping Rd, Shanghai 20092, Peoples R China",Tongji University,"Wang, HY (通讯作者)，Tongji Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Room 816,Tongji Bldg,1500 Siping Rd, Shanghai 20092, Peoples R China.",18666845524@163.com; wanghaiyan@tongji.edu.cn,,,,,,,35,0,0,0,1,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,,,,,2017,,,,,,,677,702,,,,,,26,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK8HD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000442810700047,0

In this paper we propose a multi-commodity model that makes an explicit distinction between flows of non-damaged containers, on the one hand, and flows of damaged containers, on the other. The model is tailored for the repositioning of these containers in the representative setting of a network of off-dock empty depots, ocean terminals, and inland terminals. In our case study, cost savings of up to 17% are found, depending on the composition of the network, container type, and particular evacuation and repositioning strategy. In particular, directly transporting containers front inland terminals to other inland terminals (direct repositioning) results in cost savings of up to 15% for dry containers and up to 17% for reefer containers. Furthermore, the total costs might be optimized by actually preventing the container failure from occurring possibly leading to considerable additional cost reductions. Finally, exporting damaged containers might seem to be the optimal solution from a regional cost perspective, but, this does not necessarily lead to total cost optimization from the global perspective.

The aim of this research is to identify types of electronic money and their development possibilities in the future, analyzing the legal regulation and considering a necessity of a new legal regulation by identifying the risks. Main result: A significant development of electronic money could have implications for the monetary policy strategy and the control of the operational target; The rights and obligations on the part of the respective participants in an electronic money system must be clearly defined and disclosed; An electronic money system must maintain adequate technical, organizational and procedural safeguards to prevent, contain, and detect threats to the security of the system; Protection against criminal abuse, such as money laundering and fraud, must be taken into account when designing and implementing electronic money systems.

This paper investigates whether U.S. milled rice markets are integrated across regions and whether these markets are integrated by rice types. Understanding dynamic relationships across regions and types provides important insights for risk management and policy making. Of the four major producing regions, three are in the South - Arkansas-Missouri, Louisiana- Mississippi, and Texas - and the other is California. There are different rice types associated with a production region. California mainly produces short and medium grain; while Arkansas, Texas, and Louisiana primarily produce long and also medium grains. We determine the potential market integration of these rice markets by applying a Vector Error Correction Model and Directed Acyclic Graphs to monthly free on board milled rice price data from August 1986 to December 2015.Results suggest that Arkansas-Missouri region is the leading price reference in the long grain markets. Arkansas-Missouri medium grain also plays an important role in the medium grain markets. California medium grain markets are weakly exogenous in the short run, but affected by Arkansas-Missouri medium grain in the longer term. As anticipated, Arkansas-Missouri long grain milled rice markets are driven by rough rice futures price in the longer term. Interestingly, Arkansas-Missouri medium grain market has a sizable impact on long grain markets even though long and medium grains are not substitutes. This may be due to land competition to long grain rice production in Arkansas, a major area of long grain rice production.","[Kim, Man-Keun] Utah State Univ, Appl Econ, 4835 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Tejeda, Hernan] Univ Idaho, Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Twin Falls Res & Extens Ctr, 315 Falls Ave East, Twin Falls, ID 83301 USA; [Yu, T.

Legislation has generality and it is difficult to take the special features of social life into consideration, thus, when applicable, the occurrence of unfair judgment to individual cases is inevitable. Taking into consideration of individual justice, the Court will converse the law meaning in judgment, or abandon the usual explanation of the law and select an unusual explanation. This process is essentially a process of constitutional interpretation. Although the Supreme People's Court does not approve of the direct invoking of the Constitution in judicial judgment, the conversion of law meaning or the selection of interpretation scheme in the process of judgment objectively requires the Court to take the Constitution as the basis of argument. Resorting to the Constitution, after all, is better than the abstract idea of resorting to fairness and justice. By converting the question of judgment of individual justice into the question of whether the law is in conflict with the Constitution in its application process, the constitutional interpretation can not only provide constitutionally legitimate basis for judicial lawmaking, but also provide it with constitutionally control, which is conductive to the standardization of the judgment. Constitutional interpretation can also make up for the institutional gaps and omissions of constitutional review system of China.","[Lu, Huafeng; Zhang, Jiayuan] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Polit Sci & Publ Adm, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China",University of Electronic Science & Technology of China,"Lu, HF (通讯作者)，Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Polit Sci & Publ Adm, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",,"Zhang, Jiayuan/HZI-1907-2023",,,,,,21,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-437-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,32.0,,,,,,577,582,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6HK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426689600121,0

Our story emphasises three region-specific factors driving growth capital, labour and political factors. Conditional on differences in production factor (Le., labour and capital) variations across democratic states, what role do differences in underlying political factors across regions play in accounting for regional growth disparities? We build a political economy model of endogenous growth where regions have the same political institutions, but experience different (and estimable) distributions over voter political biases (i.e., our political factors). In our model, political factors affect regional productivity as a consequence of politico-economic equilibrium. We discipline our regional growth accounting exercises by calibrating/estimating each model to American state-level economic and political-survey data. We show that the capital factor is the predominant driving force behind growth in American states. Nevertheless, regional variations in distributions of voter's political biases also account a great deal for regional growth disparities. We also evaluate how much politics would have distorted agents' welfare and regional growth, were regional economies given the opportunity to live under an efficient social planner's allocation system; and, if agents were to live under the same democratic system but where all voters have equal voting influence.","[Okabe, Tomohito] Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, Res Div Econ Inst & Policy, Kunitachi, Tokyo, Japan; [Kam, Timothy] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Hitotsubashi University; Australian National University,"Okabe, T (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, Res Div Econ Inst & Policy, Kunitachi, Tokyo, Japan.",t-okabe@ier.hit-u.ac.jp; tcy.kam@gmail.com,,"Kam, Timothy/0000-0002-3938-609X",,,,,31,5,6,1,33,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

Taking into considerations their revenue sources we can notice that over two third of them is supported by equalization grants. The main objective of this paper is to find out how do they use their negative taxing powers to lower tax burden from local taxes while they receive equalization grants. It is important because equalization scheme in Poland should equalize revenues taking into consideration Base Tax Revenues of municipality (potential revenues to collect by the municipality omitting all introduced tax expenditures). All collected data come from local government annual reports Rb-PDP, Ministry of Finance announcements about equalization grants for local governments and Base Tax Revenue per capita indicator also announced by Ministry of Finance. Research cover 2012-2017 period. Basic methods of survey were descriptive statistics summary statistics as location, spread, shape and dependence (Pearson population correlation coefficient). The main findings of this analysis are as follow: firstly we can observe that in case of urban-rural municipalities revenue loss from tax expenditures of all kinds is between 10 and 50 % of possible revenues from Base Tax Revenues (local government taxes and tax shares in income taxes) but average loss was about 20%. Secondly we can notice that municipalities use mainly possibility to lower tax rates for all local taxpayers instead of discretional administrative decisions eg. about tax reliefs. It should be also noted that lowering tax rates mainly is visible in vehicle meanings tax (almost half of them reaches 70 to 100% loss of possible revenues) than in real estate tax. The third finding points out that there is Pearson population correlation coefficient (-0,37 for 2015 year) between level Base Tax Revenue per capita and coverage of tax expenditures by equalization grant (when tax base drops down coverage rises, when we remove outliers it changes to -0,60). In another words municipalities with poor tax base chose low tax rates because they are aware that equalization grant will cover their revenue loses.","[Olejniczak, Jaroslaw] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Econ Sci, Dept Finance, Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Olejniczak, J (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Econ Sci, Dept Finance, Wroclaw, Poland.",jaroole@ue.wroc.pl,"Olejniczak, Jarosław/F-7780-2014","Olejniczak, Jarosław/0000-0003-2028-8446",,,,,11,1,1,0,1,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2787-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2017,,,,,,,257,263,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BJ1CL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417392400034,0

After applying specific inclusion/exclusion criteria, the researchers determined a sample consisting of DoA patients over 40 years of age (54% men, 75% inpatient, the rest outpatient). In addition to basic sociodemographic data and types of treatment (inpatient / outpatient), we used standardised screening questionnaires to determine the level of patient psychopathology (SCL-90), quality of life (WHOQOL-100), risky alcohol consumption (AUDIT) and potential depression (BDI-II). In our evaluation of BDI-II we followed the screening tool manuals. The results are presented using descriptive statistics. The BDI-II test shows that a significant part of the patients (46%) were at risk of depression. Similarly, 50% of patients fell outside of the psychopathology standard when assessed by the SCL-90. More than 30% of respondents scored values indicating serious psychopathology in the category of obsessive-compulsive disorder, paranoid thoughts, psychotic and depressive states.

However, since the adoption of hybrid induces higher intermediary cost, it is also found that there is no evidence to conclude the impact of the adoption of these new inputs on value added derived from rice cultivation.","[Pham Tien Thanh] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Business Adm, Tan Phong Ward, 19 Nguyen Huu Tho St,Dist 7, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Ton Duc Thang University,"Thanh, PT (通讯作者)，Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Business Adm, Tan Phong Ward, 19 Nguyen Huu Tho St,Dist 7, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",phamtienthanh@tdt.edu.vn,"Pham, Tien Thanh/J-7668-2019","Pham, Tien Thanh/0000-0003-1198-2487",,,,,17,0,0,0,3,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-11-7,,,,2017,,,,,,,251,263,,,,,,13,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO0GY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000490868000020,0

Business strategies must have the ability to catch the opportunities presented by the external environment. The needs of the population in the quality health sector have increased, and it's necessary to ensure an appropriate response to the needs with the highest productivity in terms of overall service rendered. The health services must adapt to changing needs in order to develop, manage, measure and control the flow of knowledge. Low-cost high-value healthcare comapnies have the ability to sense the needs (ex-ante) and the satisfaction (ex-post). The economic and monetary sacrifice is opposed to the benefits derived from the service received and the satisfaction of the proposed requirements. The final objective of the study is to analyze the different strategic choices from value chain to dynamic capabilities developed by two companies that have adopted low-cost high-value strategies: the Centro Medico Santagostino and Odontosalute situated in Northern Italy.

Demographic and socioeconomic characteristics determine the specific transport service needs of districts that, in most cases, are not served by the existing bus routes. Small changes in the frequency of a bus route can have a direct effect on the territorial distribution of a city's public transport service. Adjusting the frequencies of a bus fleet can help planners improve the service level and adapt the fleet's spatial distribution. A bus frequency optimization methodology is proposed to improve harmonization between service level and social equity in public transport. The method relies on a simple spreadsheet that integrates geographic data about bus routes and socioeconomic information about city districts. Simulation and optimization procedures are coordinated to appropriately adjust the routes to the geographic space. The proposed method is tested in a real case study that demonstrates its usefulness in analysing the service level and equity of a transport system and improving a city's public transport planning.

The level of the student's competencies is measured by a newly introduced Employability Readiness Indicator (ERI). The purpose of this study is to find out how intellectual capital of academic staff can contribute to increasing the efficiency of universities in transmitting transferable competencies and to test relationships between ICI and ERI. This is an explanatory research carried out in the form of a case study. The cross-sectional, multi-method quantitative study is conducted in two stages. Firstly, a template for calculating ICI as a set of competencies verified by the teacher's qualifications is developed and ICI of each teacher is calculated. Secondly, ICI is compared with ERI to find out to what degree competencies are transmitted from teachers to students.

On the one hand, this notion is oriented to obtainment of quantitative evaluation of resources, which are important for innovational development. On the other hand, the potential characterizes not real processes but possibilities that could be realized as a result of overcoming a range of difficulties. The article presents survey materials of questioning Togliatti residents about the prospects for the city's further development. Analysis of the survey results has shown that more than half of respondents connect the city's development with automotive industry.

Our empirical results show that having politicians as independent directors helps listed privately controlled firms to increase subsidies received from the government as well as obtain an ease of access to long-term bank financing. In contrast, we discern that a large fraction of politically connected independent directors increases the magnitude of related-party transactions between the listed firms and their controlling parties, suggesting wealth expropriating from minority shareholders. Finally, when exploring the net effects of political connections, the presence of politically connected independent directors promotes firm profitability and adds residual value to Chinese listed privately controlled firms.","[Wang, Lihong; Lin, Philip T.] Xiamen Univ, Inst Financial & Accounting Studies, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Lin, Philip T.] Shantou Univ, Business Sch, Shantou, Peoples R China",Xiamen University; Shantou University,"Lin, PT (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Inst Financial & Accounting Studies, Xiamen, Peoples R China.;Lin, PT (通讯作者)，Shantou Univ, Business Sch, Shantou, Peoples R China.",tplin@xmu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [NSFC-71302072]; Research Funds for Outstanding Youth Scholars in Fujian, China [0155-Z0210502]; Shantou University [STF-15002]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Research Funds for Outstanding Youth Scholars in Fujian, China; Shantou University","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [NSFC-71302072]; Research Funds for Outstanding Youth Scholars in Fujian, China [0155-Z0210502] and Shantou University Research Grant [STF-15002].",,43,17,17,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

An incomplete orthogonal set of levels for each factor was used in a 35 factorial conjoint analysis. A web-based survey was conducted in March 2015. The results show the four factors account for 50.24% of the variance in plant preference, the other factor (plant type) accounts for the remaining 49.76%. Relative importance decreases from price level (16.15%) to cue (12.27%) to area (11.04%) and location (10.79%). Consumer's purchase intention varies by demographics. The price level-purchase intention relationship also depends on cue. Benefit cue is more likely to offset the adverse effect of a price increase on purchase intention than feature cue, and the price level-purchase intention relationship for plants with feature/benefit cue appears to be inverted U shape.","[Zhu, Zhiwen] Huaiyin Inst Technol, Business Sch, 89 Beijing Bei Rd, Huaian 223001, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Zhiwen; Behe, Bridget; Sage, Lynnell] Michigan State Univ, Coll Agr & Nat Resources, Dept Hort, 1066 Bogue St, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Huddleston, Patricia] Michigan State Univ, Dept Advertising & Publ Relat, Coll Commun Arts & Sci, 404 Wilson Rd, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Huaiyin Institute of Technology; Michigan State University; Michigan State University,"Zhu, ZW (通讯作者)，Huaiyin Inst Technol, Business Sch, 89 Beijing Bei Rd, Huaian 223001, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Zhu, ZW (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Coll Agr & Nat Resources, Dept Hort, 1066 Bogue St, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",zhiwen@msu.edu,"Huddleston, Patricia/AAQ-9544-2021","Huddleston, Patricia/0000-0002-9367-5431",Jiangsu Overseas Research & Training Program; Social Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China [14GLD001],Jiangsu Overseas Research & Training Program; Social Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China,"This work was supported by the Jiangsu Overseas Research & Training Program for University Prominent Young & Middle-aged Teachers and Presidents, and the Social Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China, Projects No. 14GLD001.",,62,6,8,0,15,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

In those countries, contract farming, whereby processors contract out the production of some agricultural commodity to growers, is often seen as a means of spurring the development of an agribusiness sector, and thus launch the structural transformation. As a result, economists and other social scientists have extensively researched contract farming over the last 30 years. We review the findings of the economics literature on contract farming and discuss its implications for development policy and research. In so doing, we highlight the methodological weaknesses that limit much of the literature on contract farming in answering questions of relevance for policy. Despite valiant research effort, many of the core features of contract farming imply substantial challenges for researchers aiming to study the question Does contract farming improve welfare? We conclude with a discussion of where we see the literature on contract farming evolving over the next few decades. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The time-varying copula parameters are endowed with generalized autoregressive score dynamics. For the institutions of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, several variations of the proposed model are considered and compared with alternative, competing models.

Critics argue that program effects are likely to fade out or disappear over time, while supporters contend that program effects are likely to persist under certain conditions. Using data from Tulsa Public Schools, three neighboring school districts, and the state of Oklahoma, and propensity score weighting, we estimate the effects of Tulsa's universal, school-based pre-K program on multiple measures of academic progress for middle school students. We find enduring effects on math achievement test scores, enrollment in honors courses, and grade retention for students as a whole, and similar effects for certain subgroups.

Countries can cooperate or be engaged in a tax or a yardstick competition process. This paper uses a Spatial Dynamic Panel Data model (SDPD) to test the timing of fiscal stances interactions in Europe. Results show that fiscal interactions are not contemporaneous: governments mimic the behavior of neighboring governments on the last year, leading to a kind of delayed mimicking behaviors. This result is then used and deepened to discriminate between the three main rationales for fiscal interactions. Using original weighting schemes based on political proximity and similarities between investment contexts, we show that fiscal interactions in Europe are likely due to yardstick competition. Implications are twofold: on one hand controlling for delayed interactions when fiscal interactions are estimated is necessary, and, on the other hand, more organizations are needed in Europe in order to foster cooperation and thus to improve fiscal policy efficiency.","[Hory, Marie-Pierre] Univ Orleans, CNRS, UMR 7322, Lab Econ Orleans, Rue Blois,BP 26739, F-45067 Orleans 2, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Orleans,"Hory, MP (通讯作者)，Univ Orleans, CNRS, UMR 7322, Lab Econ Orleans, Rue Blois,BP 26739, F-45067 Orleans 2, France.",marie-pierre.hory@univ-orleans.fr,,,,,,,61,2,2,1,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

We find important differences in shelter use by single adults, youth, and families. We introduce an approach that allows us to identify a noticeable increase in the percentage of shelter clients whom we define as chronic users of the shelter system - people for whom each episode of shelter use is typically very long. This should be a concern because chronic users of the system, although they make up only a small fraction of all shelter clients, fill more than 40 percent of shelter capacity. A growing number of chronic shelter users will strain the ability of the shelter system to provide shelter to those seeking temporary relief while they re-establish themselves into housing. Homeless shelters are a response to a serious social problem. They are not the cause of nor are they the solution to that problem. Growing shelter use is an indication of a social order in trouble.","[Jadidzadeh, Ali; Kneebone, Ron] Univ Calgary, Sch Publ Policy, Calgary, AB, Canada",University of Calgary,"Jadidzadeh, A (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Sch Publ Policy, Calgary, AB, Canada.",,,"Jadidzadeh, Ali/0000-0002-2889-5868",,,,,29,5,7,0,5,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

Was the increase in credit spreads relative to triple-A benchmarks which followed the GFC the result of higher sovereign default risk or the result of a re-pricing that reflected changes in broader market conditions and risk aversion? In this paper we examine the variations of the systemic components of sovereign spreads before and after the GFC by specifying a sovereign credit yield curve which relates sovereign yield spreads to credit ratings and global factors which affected sovereign spreads regardless of their rating. We use daily data of ten-year bond yields and ratings for 64 developed economies and emerging markets, covering the period from 1/1/2000 to 1/1/2015. Our estimates suggest that sovereign risk premia increased significantly after the GFC with most of the increase due to a re-pricing of broader market risks rather than an increase in the quantity or price of sovereign risk per se. Global risk in the sovereign bond market is driven by variables that relate to investor confidence, volatility risk, central bank liquidity and the position and the slope of the yield curve in the US.","[Malliaropulos, Dimitris; Migiakis, Petros] Bank Greece, 21 EL Venizelou Ave, Athens 10250, Greece; [Malliaropulos, Dimitris] Univ Piraeus, Dept Banking & Financial Management, Piraeus, Greece",European Central Bank; Bank of Greece; University of Piraeus,"Migiakis, P (通讯作者)，Bank Greece, 21 EL Venizelou Ave, Athens 10250, Greece.",dmalliaropulos@bankofgreece.gr; pmigiakis@bankofgreece.gr,"Migiakis, Petros/AAZ-6611-2020","Migiakis, Petros/0000-0002-6038-876X; Malliaropulos, Dimitrios/0000-0001-8172-2280",,,,,66,7,8,0,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5398,1879-1727,,J EMPIR FINANC,J.

This paper analyzes the impacts of the program Mas Familias en Accion on the perception of poverty and subjective wellbeing in Colombia. The analyses are based on data from the Encuesta Nacional de Calidad de Vida between 2008 and 2016. Two empirical strategies were compared to account for the lack of randomness in groups of beneficiary and non-beneficiary families: (i) non-experimental designs (linear and nonlinear models with cross-sectional and pooled data); (ii) quasi-experimental designs (Propensity Score Matching and Inverse Probability Weighted Regression Adjustment). The results were robust to the different empirical strategies and emphasized that: (i) transfers increase the perception of food insecurity and subjective poverty; (ii) conditionalities involve positive impacts on different indicators of subjective wellbeing, especially health and education; (iii) general impacts on the perceptions of life are nonsignificant, as a result of divergent impacts on the dimensions of the subjective wellbeing of families.","[Martinez, Daniel Morales; Maia, Alexandre Gori] Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Econ, Rua Pitagoras 353, BR-13085857 Campinas, SP, Brazil",Universidade Estadual de Campinas,"Martínez, DM (通讯作者)，Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Econ, Rua Pitagoras 353, BR-13085857 Campinas, SP, Brazil.",danielmorales_0831@yahoo.com; gori@unicamp.br,"Maia, Alexandre Gori/Q-5222-2019","Maia, Alexandre Gori/0000-0003-0075-5094",,,,,67,10,11,1,25,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

Strategic innovation management of the four-stroke engine,INDUSTRIAL AND CORPORATE CHANGE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,INVENTION; TECHNOLOGY; AGENTS; MARKET; SPAIN,"A significant argument in favor of patents is that they enable knowledge disclosure, which compensates for their social cost. Although patent institutions can influence disclosure levels by what they require before granting patents, innovators have a natural bias to conceal key information because such knowledge can make a competitor's second-generation invention and patent more powerful. Despite interest in the subject, little empirical research has been carried out to analyze how much information patents actually disclose and how patentees and corporations historically manage these kinds of monopolies. Using a key case study of a radical innovation-the four-stroke engine, patented by Nicolaus August Otto in 1876-we conducted a detailed technical analysis of its patents in six countries. Our research provides new insights on issues related to full (or lack thereof) patent disclosure, the management strategies designed to maintain patent monopolies, and the effects of such monopolies on future innovation, knowledge, and control of marketplaces.","[Saiz, Patricio] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Econ Anal Econ Theory & Econ Hist, C Francisco Tomas & Valiente 5, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Amengual, Ruben] Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Energy Engn, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn Ind, C Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, E-28006 Madrid, Spain",Autonomous University of Madrid; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Sáiz, P (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Econ Anal Econ Theory & Econ Hist, C Francisco Tomas & Valiente 5, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",patricio.saiz@uam.es; ruben.amengual@upm.es,"Sáiz, Patricio/L-2384-2013","Sáiz, Patricio/0000-0003-2714-7443","Collaboration Agreement OEPM-UAM 2014-2017; Spanish R&D project, Scientific Culture, Perception, and Attitudes towards Science and Innovation in the Spanish Business Sector [CSO2014-53293-R]","Collaboration Agreement OEPM-UAM 2014-2017; Spanish R&D project, Scientific Culture, Perception, and Attitudes towards Science and Innovation in the Spanish Business Sector","The authors acknowledge financial support from the Collaboration Agreement OEPM-UAM 2014-2017 and the Spanish R&D project, Scientific Culture, Perception, and Attitudes towards Science and Innovation in the Spanish Business Sector (CSO2014-53293-R).

It does so by using Nigeria as a case study whose electioneering activities seem to be characterized by money bags with attendant effects on the behaviour of its domestic currency (naira). Thus, the study tests for spillover transmission among Nigeria's six most traded currencies namely the US Dollar, Euro, Pound Sterling, Yen, Swiss Franc and the West African Unit of Account (WAUA). Using the Diebold and Yilmaz (DY) (2009, 2012) approach, the results show that electioneering process in Nigeria appears to have greater spillover effects on the naira than the global financial crisis and this finding is robust to alternative measures of exchange rates. Some implications of the findings to investors and policy makers are documented. Copyright (C) 2018, Borsa Istanbul Anonim Sirketi.

Evidence from India,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Adaptation; Climate change; Agriculture; India; Crop choice,CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; MIGRATION RESPONSE; IMPACTS; AGRICULTURE; YIELDS; HEAT; VULNERABILITY; FLUCTUATIONS; VARIABILITY; IRRIGATION,"Projections suggest that the damages from climate change will be substantial for developing countries. Understanding the ability of households in these countries to adapt to climate change is critical in order to determine the magnitude of the potential damages. In this paper, I investigate the ability of farmers in India to adapt to higher temperatures. I use a methodology that exploits short-term weather fluctuations as well as spatial variation in long-run climate. Specifically, I estimate how damaging high temperatures are for districts that experience high temperatures more or less frequently. I find that the losses from high temperatures are lower in heat-prone districts, a result that is consistent with adaptation. However, while adaptation appears to be modestly effective for moderate levels of heat, my results suggest that adaptation to extreme heat is much more difficult. Extremely high temperatures do grave damage to crops, even in places that experience these temperature extremes regularly. The persistence of negative impacts of high temperatures, even in areas that experience high temperatures frequently, underscores the need for development policies that emphasize risk mitigation and explicitly account for climate change-related risks.

Design/methodology/approach Using the organizational network approach, a typology is developed to explain the Springboard network. Quantitative analysis is used, in the form of logistic binary regression, to study these networks composition. Findings From a sample of 154 subsidiaries extracted from the AMADEUS intelligent database, three categories for multinational's networks are created, with the Spanish subsidiary acting as the leader: strategic centers (SCs), administrative centers (ACs) and regional headquaters (RHQs). Findings provide evidence of cultural features, industry behavior and the multinational's size and entry mode influence these networks organization. Research limitations/implications It is proposed that culture and historical ties have evolved together and management scholars should be aware of this phenomenon. Specific limitation that this study exhibits is the data provided by AMADEUS and the fact that R&D information for both the Spanish and the Latin American subsidiary were not available. Practical implications Staffing composition and expatriate corporate policy should consider the springboard effect to manage springboard networks. Social implications Industries and authorities in all countries involved should be aware of their role in MNC strategies for regional expansion. Originality/value It is argued that a network of subsidiaries within the multinational can participation in the springboard behavior, which is determined by the culture that the multinational originates from, as well as the Spanish culture, creating a particular type of leadership.","[Quesada Chaves, Federico] Costa Rica Open Univ, Dept Econ, UNED Costa Rica, Sabanilla, Costa Rica",,"Chaves, FQ (通讯作者)，Costa Rica Open Univ, Dept Econ, UNED Costa Rica, Sabanilla, Costa Rica.",fequesada@uned.ac.cr,,,,,,,59,5,5,0,20,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

We draw upon data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) on new long term care insurance (LTCI) purchases (traditional and Partnership) by US state (weighted by the population over age 65 to make the data comparable). We use a difference-in-differences strategy to obtain estimates of the program effect of the LTCP on the overall uptake of private LTCI, and specifically of LTCP contracts and applications for a subsample of states. Findings suggest no significant effect of LTCP on insurance uptake and an increase in insurance applications.

It estimates the effect of the district consumption shock during the crisis on the change in married men's and women's working status and assets. It finds that the regional shock is associated with a large increase in wives' employment and a large decrease in wives' business assets in urban areas, and not associated with change in husbands' working status or asset holdings in urban areas. In rural areas the regional shock is associated with a drop in women's business assets and not related to other outcomes of husbands or wives.

A panel dataset of household lots in Rondonia, Brazil is used to test the hypothesis that the closer a household is to market the more likely it will adopt land-sparing patterns of cattle production in response to rising demand for beef and milk. Results from a fixed effects model suggest that, consistent with theory, pasture area declines and forest is spared in lots located closer to market. Other results differ, however, depending on forest type and commodity. Greater initial endowments of forest are associated with more deforestation.","[Fontes, Francisco] Food & Agr Org United Nations FAO, Agr Dev Econ Div ESA, Monitoring & Analyzing Food & Agr Policies MAFAP, Rome, Italy; [Palmer, Charles] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England",Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Fontes, F (通讯作者)，Food & Agr Org United Nations FAO, Agr Dev Econ Div ESA, Monitoring & Analyzing Food & Agr Policies MAFAP, Rome, Italy.",,,"Fontes, Francisco/0000-0003-1266-5037",U.K. Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC); Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy,U.K. Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy,"We thank the authors of the dataset (Caviglia-Harris, Roberts, and Sills 2014), in particular, Jill Caviglia-Harris for sharing additional data, as well as the ICPSR for making this dataset publicly available.

When the government can credibly commit its policy, we show that the equilibrium outcomes under both policies are equivalent in terms of permits price and tax rate. Under the non-committed policy, however, the equivalence breaks down because firms have opposite incentives to induce time-consistent policy to be adjusted ex post. In particular, compared to pre-committed government, firms abate less emission to induce higher emission quotas under the permits policy while a consumer-friendly firm abates more emissions to reduce tax rate under the tax policy. Finally, we show that tax policy will result in higher welfare and lower environmental damage unless the concern on consumer surplus is large.","[Garcia, Arturo; Leal, Mariel] Tecnol Monterrey, Sch Sci & Engn, Campus Monterrey, Monterrey, Mexico; [Lee, Sang-Ho] Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Econ, 77 Yongbong Ro, Gwangju 61186, South Korea",Tecnologico de Monterrey; Chonnam National University,"Lee, SH (通讯作者)，Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Econ, 77 Yongbong Ro, Gwangju 61186, South Korea.",aru.gmtz@hotmail.com; mariellealc@gmail.com; sangho@jnu.ac.kr,"Lee, Sang-Ho/E-7848-2017","Lee, Sang-Ho/0000-0002-0283-5998; Garcia, Arturo/0000-0002-6901-2419; Leal, Mariel/0000-0003-2407-6272","Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2017S1A5B8059731]; CONACYT, Mexico","Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); CONACYT, Mexico(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT))","We thank two anonymous referees for their constructive comments.

Deficits in manufacturing trade cause dislocation and generate protectionism. Dynamic OLS results indicate that U.S. export elasticities exceed unity for automobiles, toys, wood, aluminum, iron, steel, and other goods. Elasticities for U.S. imports from China are close to one or higher for footwear, radios, sports equipment, lamps, and watches and exceed 0.5 for iron, steel, aluminum, miscellaneous manufacturing, and metal tools. Elasticities for U.S. imports from other countries are large for electrothermal appliances, radios, furniture, lamps, miscellaneous manufacturing, aluminum, automobiles, plastics, and other categories. Stock returns on many of these sectors also fall when the dollar appreciates. Several manufacturing industries are thus exposed to a strong dollar. Policymakers could weaken the dollar and deflect protectionist pressure by promoting the euro, the yen, and the renminbi as alternative reserve currencies.","[Thorbecke, Willem] Res Inst Econ Trade & Ind, Chiyoda Ku, 1-3-1 Kasumigaseki, Tokyo 1008901, Japan; [Thorbecke, Willem] Ctr Int Dev Harvard, Chiyoda Ku, 1-3-1 Kasumigaseki, Tokyo 1008901, Japan",,"Thorbecke, W (通讯作者)，Res Inst Econ Trade & Ind, Chiyoda Ku, 1-3-1 Kasumigaseki, Tokyo 1008901, Japan.;Thorbecke, W (通讯作者)，Ctr Int Dev Harvard, Chiyoda Ku, 1-3-1 Kasumigaseki, Tokyo 1008901, Japan.",willem-thorbecke@rieti.go.jp,,,JSPS [17H02532]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17H02532] Funding Source: KAKEN,"JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","I thank an anonymous referee for valuable comments.

This ambition has often pushed researchers to develop methods for combining (or aggregating) various dimensions of disadvantage into a single, multi-faceted metric of potential transit demand (or need) among the disadvantaged population. These metrics then enable a somewhat straightforward analysis of the transit needs of the aggregate disadvantaged population to the transit service supplied in order to arrive at a measure of transit equity. More recently, it has been proposed that such aggregated transit equity analysis may introduce veiled judgments or bias through the specific interpretation of key definitions and through the particular choices in the construction of a combined metric. It may also be the case that such an aggregate metric may mask or convolute important disparities in transit equity experienced by the various disadvantaged populations aggregated into a combined metric. This research studies these issues through a clear discussion of the ambiguity and implied judgments often found in transit equity literature and then provides recommendations to mitigate these issues. Also, two common equity analysis methods are compared through a case study of public transit service in the city of Corvallis, Oregon, and a new transit service metric construction is introduced. By comparing the results of both the aggregated and disaggregated forms of disadvantaged group transit need within each analysis method, this study provides further evidence that important information may be concealed or easily misinterpreted when using aggregated descriptions of transit need.","[Carleton, Phillip R.; Porter, J.

Therefore, it of interest to determine how the distance students walk to school varies depending on where they live and how their decision to walk is affected by contextual/environmental variables. This study aimed to examine which of the distances (Euclidean, Manhattan, walking-network and driving-network) is the best predictor of the decision to walk to school and determine the areas of influence of active commuting to school for four high schools in Granada, Spain. To achieve these aims, the regression-kriging method was used. The results indicated that the Euclidean and the walking distances were the best predictors of the decision to walk to school. Spatial dependence produced by some locational variables and spatial contagion among students was found to be moderate to strong. In addition, the spatial range of this spatial dependence is approximately 1000 m to 1600 m. Regression-kriging could be implemented in a geographic information system to determine the areas of influence of schools and aid urban designers and planners in developing neighborhoods that support active modes of commuting. Identifying the areas of influence is important for promoting active modes of transport by local governments.","[Chica-Olmo, Jorge] Univ Granada, Fac Econ & Business Sci, Dept Quantitat Methods Econ & Business, Campus Cartuja S-N, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Rodriguez-Lopez, Carlos; Chillon, Palma] Univ Granada, Fac Sport Sci, Dept Phys Educ & Sport, PROFITH PROmoting FITness & Hlth Phys Act Res Grp, Granada, Spain",University of Granada; University of Granada,"Chica-Olmo, J (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, Fac Econ & Business Sci, Dept Quantitat Methods Econ & Business, Campus Cartuja S-N, E-18071 Granada, Spain.",jchica@ugr.es; crdguez@ugr.es; pchillon@ugr.es,"Chica Olmo, Jorge/F-1921-2016; Chillon, Palma/E-5634-2014","Chica Olmo, Jorge/0000-0003-2274-7829; Chillon, Palma/0000-0003-0862-8989; Rodriguez Lopez, Carlos/0000-0002-2918-2632",,,,,77,21,24,2,22,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Smaller minimum wage increases, as well as increases linked to inflation indexation provisions, appear to have had much smaller (and possibly positive) effects on employment over our sample period.

Such empirical evidence is critical for assessing previous and candidate future land use-transport policies. Existing research however, has mostly investigated travel behaviour during relatively short time periods and for a single transport mode. This paper examines the development of travel behaviour and its socio-demographic and location determinants, using Dutch National Travel Survey data from 1980 to 2010 among other sources, for the Randstad, the Netherlands. A pseudo panel analysis is conducted to investigate the effect of various indicators on average daily distance travelled by train, car and bicycle over three decades. Econometric models including pooled ordinary least squares, fixed and random effects and a hybrid model were tested to identify the best fit. The results indicate that average daily distance travelled rose until the mid-1990s before witnessing a decrease till 2010. Interestingly, half of the Randstad inhabitants have been travelling <= 26 km per day over the past thirty years. Furthermore, as people grow older, they increasingly travel more by train and bicycle. Finally, a rise in suburban inhabitants decreases the average distance travelled by train and increases that of bicycle, while a rise in rural inhabitants encourages higher distances travelled by car.","[Kasraian, Dena] Univ Toronto, Dept Civil & Mineral Engn, 35 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 1A4, Canada; [Maat, Kees] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, Julianalaan 134, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands; [van Wee, Bert] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Jaffalaan 5, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands",University of Toronto; Delft University of Technology; Delft University of Technology,"Kasraian, D (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Civil & Mineral Engn, 35 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 1A4, Canada.",D.Kasraian@utoronto.ca,"Maat, Kees/AAB-7865-2019","Maat, Kees/0000-0002-7832-7017; Kasraian, Dena/0000-0001-5253-0669",Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) under the Urban Europe Joint Programming Initiative [438-12-458],Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) under the Urban Europe Joint Programming Initiative,"This work was supported by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO), under grant 438-12-458 (CASUAL: Co-creating Attractive and Sustainable Urban Areas and Lifestyles-Exploring new forms of inclusive urban governance), funded under the Urban Europe Joint Programming Initiative.",,38,9,10,1,18,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Based on the Theory of the Hedonic Asymmetry we analyze through Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) how emotions drive consumer satisfaction. A sample of 570 respondents was gathered for a high involvement product - wine -, while a sample of 431 consumers was collected for a low involvement product - a cup of coffee -. Results show that positive emotions exert a higher influence on satisfaction in low involvement products, rather than in high involvement products, suggesting that situational factors - such as the occasion of consumption - could be acting as qualifiers of pleasant emotions. Additionally, our findings support the moderating role of product involvement on the consumption-elicited emotions and satisfaction link. (C) 2018 AEDEM.

Similar to meta-analytic findings, conventional analysis of these data found only a modest impact on proximal relationship outcomes (e.g., satisfaction).

Zero-rating the supply of certain foodstuffs is a prominent example of this practice. Using data on South Africa, this paper considers whether taxing foodstuffs alongside compensating cash transfers may be preferred to zero-rating foodstuffs in a developing country context. The results show that cash transfers may be preferred if all the additional revenue from eliminating the zero rate can be earmarked and government is perfectly efficient. In the likely absence of earmarking and perfect efficiency, developing countries may need to apply special treatment to some foodstuffs to protect the poor. If this is the case, it is proposed that zero-rating can be preferred to the exemption of certain foodstuffs.","[van Oordt, Marius] Univ Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa; [van Oordt, Marius] African Tax Inst, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"van Oordt, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa.;van Oordt, M (通讯作者)，African Tax Inst, Pretoria, South Africa.",marius.vanoordt@up.ac.za,,"van Oordt, Marius/0000-0002-2300-6603",National Research Foundation (NRF),National Research Foundation (NRF),"The financial assistance of the National Research Foundation (NRF) towards this research is hereby acknowledged.

The calibration to U.S. data using the simulated method of moments technique captures the dynamics of consumption, and the short- and long-term interest rates. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The technology has spread rapidly in the developing world, leapfrogging the provision of formal banking services by solving the problems of weak institutional infrastructure and the cost structure of conventional banking. This article examines the evolution of mobile money and its important role in widening financial inclusion. It explores the channels of economic influence of mobile money from a micro perspective, and critically reviews the empirical literature on the economic impact of mobile money. The evidence convincingly suggests that mobile money fosters risk-sharing, but direct evidence of the promotion of welfare and saving is still mostly rather less robust.","[Aron, Janine] Univ Oxford, Oxford Martin Sch, Inst New Econ Thinking, Oxford, England; [Aron, Janine] Ctr Study African Econ, Dept Econ, Manor Rd Bldg, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Aron, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford Martin Sch, Inst New Econ Thinking, Oxford, England.;Aron, J (通讯作者)，Ctr Study African Econ, Dept Econ, Manor Rd Bldg, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",,,,Gates Foundation [MQRYDE00]; Open Society Foundations; Oxford Martin School,Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); Open Society Foundations; Oxford Martin School,"Janine Aron is a Senior Research Fellow at the Institute for New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School, University of Oxford, UK; Centre for the Study of African Economies, Department of Economics, Manor Road Building, Oxford OX1 3UQ.

Recently, however, China has experienced a labor shortage and rising wages, implying that the country's long-lasting competitive advantage based on its unlimited labor supply and low costs is vanishing. We find that structural demographic changes, regional economic growth disparities and the household registration system may have caused the labor shortage. Furthermore, China's continued low wages, relatively low labor share of gross national income, declining proportion of household consumption to GDP, and productivity improvements as well as increasing unit labor costs can be used to explain the recent wage increases. The dramatic development of its labor market signals that China is entering a new stage of economic development. The country's prior successful model of economic development needs to be adjusted to adapt to the new situation in its labor market to achieve sustainable economic development.","[Cui, Yuming] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Lu, Changrong] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Int Relat, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Meng, Jingjing] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology; Sun Yat Sen University; Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications,"Lu, CR (通讯作者)，Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Int Relat, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",narcissu1113@hotmail.com,"Meng, Jingjing/J-8756-2014","Cui, Yuming/0000-0002-3314-5842; LU, CHANGRONG/0000-0002-2351-3672",Bank of Italy; Bank of Finland,Bank of Italy; Bank of Finland,We thank managing editor Andy McKay for very helpful comments and suggestions.

Given board composition is endogenous, we instrument for the presence of industry expert directors using the supply of experienced executives near conglomerate firms' headquarters. We find that industry expert representation on the board causes increased segment investment. Consistent with experienced directors playing favorites rather than acting as dispassionate advisors, segment profitability (firm value) is lower for segments (firms) with industry expert outside directors. We do not find analogous negative profitability or valuation effects of director experience for single-segment firms.","[Ellis, Jesse A.] North Carolina State Univ, Poole Coll Management, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Fee, C.

Overall, we find no clear evidence of significant market responses to firms announcing auditor switches, consistent with a lack of information content or potential information leakage argument. However, examination of a more recent sample in the 'partial deregulation' period (2015-2017), whereby timing and consent provisions have been relaxed under a more market-driven regime, uncovers univariate evidence of market reactions directionally consistent with the audit quality interpretation. Overall, these results provide support for the regulator's recent initiative to deregulate the auditor resignation process in Australia to become more disclosure driven as in other jurisdictions.","[Ferguson, Andrew; Lam, Peter; Ma, Nelson] Univ Technol Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Technology Sydney,"Ferguson, A (通讯作者)，UTS, Accounting Discipline Grp, POB 123, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia.",Andrew.Ferguson@uts.edu.au,"Ma, Nelson/AAX-3733-2020",,AFAANZ 2013 research grant,AFAANZ 2013 research grant,This project was partly funded by an AFAANZ 2013 research grant.,,49,2,2,4,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1815-5669,,,J CONTEMP ACCOUNT EC,J.

This formulation implicitly assumes that all users are the same distance from each resource pool, that all users can switch costlessly from one type of resource to another (e.g. liquid fossil fuels to coal or vice-versa), and that all users are subject to the same regulations. These assumptions imply, as Herfindahl (Extractive resources and taxation. University of Wisconsin Press, Madison, pp 63-90, 1967) showed, that in competitive equilibrium all users will exhaust a lower-cost resource completely before beginning to extract a higher-cost resource: simultaneous extraction of different grades of oil or of oil and coal should never occur. In trying to apply the single-demand curve model during the last twenty years, several teams of authors have independently found a need to generalize it to account for users differing in their (1) location, (2) resource needs, or (3) regulatory environment. Each research team found that Herfindahl's strong, unrealistic conclusion disappears in the generalized model; in its place, a weaker Herfindahl result emerges. Since each research team focussed on a different application, however, it has not always been clear that everyone has been describing the same generalized model. The goal in this paper is to integrate the findings of these teams and to present an easily accessible generalization of the nonrenewable resource model to multiple demand curves.","[Gaudet, Gerard] Univ Montreal, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Gaudet, Gerard] Univ Montreal, CIREQ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Salant, Stephen W.] Univ Maryland, Dept Agr & Resource Econ AREC, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Salant, Stephen W.] Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Salant, Stephen W.] Resources Future RFF, Washington, DC USA",Universite de Montreal; Universite de Montreal; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Resources for the Future,"Gaudet, G (通讯作者)，Univ Montreal, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;Gaudet, G (通讯作者)，Univ Montreal, CIREQ, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",gerard.gaudet@umontreal.ca; ssalant@umich.edu,"Salant, Stephen/L-8398-2016","Salant, Stephen/0000-0001-5407-4572",,,,,20,2,2,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The literature is less clear on how local firms have reacted or which new industrial structures are emerging in middle-income countries in response to these developments. This article examines how the textile and garment industry in Brazil is adapting to this new competitive environment.

This paper evaluates whether the unequal distribution of costs women bear as a result of climate change are reflected across broader macro-social institutions to the detriment of gender equality and women's rights. It argues that gender disparities in climate change vulnerability not only reflect preexisting gender inequalities, they also reinforce them. Inequalities in the ownership and control of household assets and rising familial burdens due to male out-migration, declining food and water access, and increased disaster exposure can undermine women's ability to achieve economic independence, enhance human capital, and maintain health and wellbeing. Consequences for gender equality include reductions in intra-household bargaining power, as women become less capable of generating independent revenue. Outside the home, norms of gender discrimination and gender imbalances in socio-economic status should increase as women are less able to participate in formal labor markets, join civil society organizations, or collectively mobilize for political change. The outcome of these processes can reduce a society's level of gender equality by increasing constraints on the advancement of laws and norms that promote co-equal status. I empirically test this relationship across a sample of developing states between 1981 and 2010. The findings suggest that climate shocks and climatic disasters exert a broadly negative impact on gender equality, as deviations from long-term mean temperatures and increasing incidence of climatological and hydro-meteorological disasters are associated with declines in women's economic and social rights. These effects appear to be most salient in states that are relatively less-democratic, with greater dependence on agriculture, and lower levels of economic development. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

What should we know?,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Review,,,,,,Public Works programs; Investment; Wages; Skills; Public goods,SAFETY NET PROGRAM; ETHIOPIA; IMPACT; TRANSFERS; RISK; EMPLOYMENT; ARGENTINA; WORKFARE; GROWTH; INDIA,"Public Works (PW) programs are popular development interventions due to their potential 'double dividend' of transferring income to the poor while at the same time creating public infrastructure. However, PW programs are costly and demanding from an administrative perspective and it is not clear whether they are the most cost-effective intervention to reduce poverty. Therefore, an assessment of PW programs needs to understand which benefits and costs these programs entail relative to other interventions, and whether or not the extra cost can be outweighed by generating benefits over and above those of alternative interventions, such as Cash Transfer programs. This paper seeks to identify these benefits, and develops a conceptual framework that highlights four mechanisms through which PW programs could strengthen the productive capacity of poor households beyond the effects of Cash Transfers: productive investments, labor market effects, skills development, and increases in trade and production. It then reviews available empirical evidence from PW programs in developing countries. The results suggest that PW programs can induce productive investments via income and insurance effects when the program is sufficiently reliable and long-term. PW programs can also have positive welfare effects by raising wages, but potential adverse effects on labor markets have to be taken into account. Implicit or explicit training components of PW programs do not seem to increase the employability or business earnings of participants. Finally, there is only scant empirical evidence on the productive effects of the public infrastructure generated by PW programs, and further research is crucial to understand and quantify those effects. This paper concludes that PW programs are only preferable over alternative interventions if they generate substantial investments among the target group, if there is clear evidence that private-sector wages are below equilibrium wages, or if the public infrastructure generated in PW programs has substantial growth effects.

We use the heat mitigation potential of greenspace and the case of Taipei Metropolis in Taiwan to assess challenges arising from thinking about fairness in terms of distribution of benefits from greenspace functions, as opposed to fairness in greenspace accessibility and availability. Urban greening to foster 'resilient' communities arguably deflects from - or even exacerbates - structural causes of vulnerability, with benefits accruing disproportionately to more affluent or empowered groups. Yet the need for practical action on climate threats in cities is urgent, and for heat, strategic greenspace use considered systematically across a city may mitigate effects through the cooling effect of vegetation. The challenge is thus to balance the justice concerns associated with urban greening with this tangible risk reduction potential. We undertake content analysis of articles from two Taiwanese newspapers - the Taipei Times and the China Post - to assess how heat and greenspace issues have been discussed in urban governance debates within Taipei. We suggest change adaptation through urban greening raises three challenges for equity thinking: (a) guiding planning and governance processes with scientific understanding of how green space functions are delivered, even in the face of urban development pressures and site-specific controversies; (b) tempering the social cohesion and practical deployment benefits of neighbourhood-level greening with the need for specific understanding at the city-wide level to most effectively realise ecosystem services; and (c) linking targeted adaptation actions with broader rationales for urban greening, whilst not diluting justice concerns. We caution that pragmatism towards all urban climate adaptation via greening as intrinsically 'good' must not serve as a blinder to the need for accompanying social policy measures to reduce unequal vulnerability to climate risks.

Previous work has shown that these mandates likely increase health insurance premiums, which in turn could make it more costly for firms to compensate employees. Using 1996-2010 data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages and a novel instrumental variables strategy, we show that there is limited evidence that mandates reduce employment. However, we find that mandates lead to a distortion in firm size, benefiting larger firms that are able to self-insure and thus exempt themselves from these state-level health insurance regulations. This distortion in firm size away from small businesses may lead to substantial decreases in productivity and economic growth.","[Bailey, James] Creighton Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, 2500 Calif Plaza, Omaha, NE 68178 USA; [Webber, Douglas] Temple Univ, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Creighton University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Bailey, J (通讯作者)，Creighton Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, 2500 Calif Plaza, Omaha, NE 68178 USA.",jamesbailey@creighton.edu,"Bailey, James/AAE-7321-2019","Bailey, James/0000-0002-6132-6026",Mercatus Center at George Mason University,Mercatus Center at George Mason University,We thank the Mercatus Center at George Mason University for funding and helpful comments.,,32,1,1,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

The relative labor demand model is estimated using biennial data for 25 industries, nine European countries and five time periods (2002-2010) or by use of a size-class dataset with broad industry groups. System GMM estimations accounting for endogeneity show that the turnover (sales) of market novelties (in relation to existing products) has a significant impact on relative employment in manufacturing industries. On average, an increase in the relative turnover of new market products by one percentage point is associated with a 1.6% increase in the employment ratio. In contrast, employment in service industries does not benefit from new market products but instead from the intensity with which information and communication technology innovations are used, approximated by the proportion of broadband internet connected employees.

Mosca and V. Pareto in their political and sociological writings. The scientific spirit, which in their era led to the foundation of various social disciplines, fostered the application of economic analysis to the political sphere. In that context, Antonio de Viti de Marco (1858-1943) formulated an economic model of the state, consisting of two types of constitutional extremes: the absolute state and the democratic state. We ask herein how that model may be reconciled to G. Mosca and Pareto's theory of the ruling class, with which De Viti de Marco agreed. Finally, we analyze his political writings in order to reconstruct his interpretation of collusion, rent seeking and clientelism, i.e., the redistribution of extracted rent, which takes place in the form of discretionary allocations of public jobs, public contracts and other corporative favors. Collusion is the use of democratic institutions by the ruling classes in order to gain monopoly power. While collusion is the basis of rent creation, rent extraction is not the final goal of politicians; rather, it is a means of strengthening electoral support.","[Giuranno, Michele G.; Mosca, Manuela] Univ Salento, Dipartimento Sci Econ, Lecce, Italy",University of Salento,"Giuranno, MG (通讯作者)，Univ Salento, Dipartimento Sci Econ, Lecce, Italy.",michele.giuranno@unisalento.it,"Giuranno, Michele Giuseppe/AAS-9334-2020","Giuranno, Michele Giuseppe/0000-0003-3162-3115",,,,,89,2,2,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUN,2018,175.0,3-4,,,,,325,345,,10.1007/s11127-018-0539-z,0.0,,,21,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,GG9QZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000433037400007,0

Several approaches are common in the literature and in practice. We theoretically and empirically analyze how the exposure at default should be modeled to obtain accurate estimates of the expected loss. Our empirical analysis is based on a large and unique dataset from a retail portfolio of a European bank. We demonstrate that some approaches can lead to substantially biased estimates of the expected loss and show that the generalized cohort approach is advantageous. Moreover, using in- and out-of-sample analyses, we empirically demonstrate that using the credit conversion factor is preferable to the loan equivalent factor, exposure at default factor, and direct exposure at default estimation to achieve high estimation accuracy.

Interaction effects with mineral oil taxes reduce carbon taxes on motor fuels and transport externalities increase them. We show that the cost-effective overall carbon tax on motor fuels should be lower than the one on thermal fuels. This is found in spite of the fact that pre-existing taxes on motor fuels are well below our estimate of the transport externality per unit of transport fuel consumption. Differentiating taxes in favor of motor fuels yields only slightly more equitable incidence effects among households, suggesting that equity considerations play a minor role when designing differentiated carbon pricing policies.","[Landis, Florian; Rausch, Sebastian; Kosch, Mirjam] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CER ETH, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Zurich, Switzerland; [Rausch, Sebastian] MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Rausch, S (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CER ETH, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Zurich, Switzerland.;Rausch, S (通讯作者)，MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",landisf@ethz.ch; srausch@ethz.ch; mkosch@ethz.ch,,"Rausch, Sebastian/0000-0002-6379-8406","Swiss Competence Center for Energy Research, Competence Center for Research in Energy, Society and Transition (SCCER-CREST); Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI); SNF [407140_153710]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [407140_153710] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)","Swiss Competence Center for Energy Research, Competence Center for Research in Energy, Society and Transition (SCCER-CREST); Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI); SNF; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF))","We gratefully acknowledge financial support by the Swiss Competence Center for Energy Research, Competence Center for Research in Energy, Society and Transition (SCCER-CREST) and the Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI).

A relatively high occupation-specific unemployment risk and high earnings risk are conducive to opt for self-employment. Also, occupations that are characterized by high self-employment rates foster entrepreneurial choice among their employees. The results suggest that career choices of future entrepreneurs are driven by different motivations than those of non-entrepreneurs. In particular, the expectation of a pronounced financial gain is critical for future entrepreneurs when they make their initial occupational choices in paid employment and it is also relevant for a self-employment choice. We find that when future entrepreneurs enter the labor market, they are more likely to choose occupations that require a relatively high variety of skills.","[Sorgner, Alina; Fritsch, Michael] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Carl Zeiss Str 3, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Sorgner, Alina] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Sorgner, A; Fritsch, M (通讯作者)，Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Carl Zeiss Str 3, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",alina.sorgner@uni-jena.de; m.fritsch@uni-jena.de,"Fritsch, Michael/ABB-7526-2021; Fritsch, Michael/E-9321-2011","Fritsch, Michael/0000-0003-0337-4182; Sorgner, Alina/0000-0002-6876-5961",,,,,65,23,28,1,41,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We analyze transition paths as well as steady state responses to the new policies. The current reforms in China provide modest rural pensions and reimbursement of a portion of healthcare costs, but at rates that are substantially lower than are already in place in the urban sector. We investigate the potential effect of raising the rural benefit rates to those enjoyed in the urban sector. While both reforms reduce income per capita, we show that the health insurance reforms are potentially welfare improving if they are implemented in a way that leads to reduced out-of-pocket health spending. The welfare gains are driven by rural health insurance providing relief from the risk of catastrophic medical expenditures that can wipe out household savings and force long working hours. A pay-as-you-go rural pension results in a welfare gain in the short-run but welfare loss in the long-run due to the distorting effects of taxes. Despite an increase in required financing due to an aging population, the welfare impact of rural health insurance remains positive when incorporating the projected old-age dependency ratio for the year 2050. However, a pay-as-you-go rural pension creates large income and welfare losses with 2050 demographics. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Nowhere is this more important than in sub-Saharan Africa, where rural poverty remains high and pressure on natural resources continues to build. At the same time, generating more agricultural profits on this land remains crucial to reducing poverty. This research asks how changing land quality, as measured by soil organic carbon (SOC) content, affects agricultural profitability and agricultural technology adoption for poor farmers in Tanzania. It is the first to match high-resolution, remote-sensing soil data to nationally representative household-plot surveys, using the World Bank's Living Standards Measurement Study and World Agroforestry Centre's Land Degradation Surveillance Framework. We employ a household fixed effects model that isolates SOC contributions to plot-level agricultural profits, finding positive changes of $7-8 per acre per year for each gram per kilogram change in SOC, with higher sensitivity to SOC differences for farmers with worse quality land. SOC and fertilizer use also exhibit a positive synergistic interaction with plot-level agricultural profits. Despite this, however, we find that SOC levels do not factor into fertilizer adoption decisions, and land quality has a smaller role in how farmers assign value to their land compared to how it contributes to profits. Partly because of a lack of matched, high-resolution, and nationally representative environmental and socioeconomic data, researchers and policymakers typically have not been able to include land quality as a primary dimension on which to analyze agricultural profitability and technology use in sub-Saharan Africa. We conclude that this should be a major factor in both targeting rural development and environmental policies and understanding impacts of long-run land health declines on the world's poor.

In this vein, our paper investigates whether exporting and export diversification at the firm level have an effect on the output volatility of firms. We use large representative firm-level databases from Estonia, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia over the last boom-bust cycle in 2004-2012. The results confirm that exporting is related to higher volatility at the firm level.

We find that export diversification mitigates volatility only in some cases.

While these systems aim to increase transit mode options as well as overall bicycle ridership, bike share programs also face challenges and criticisms related to density and inequitable distribution of services. Key factors in the success of bicycle share include high station density as well as services that reach a variety of neighborhoods, though many current systems do not reach low-income areas. Equitable station distribution therefore appears to be a complex problem to address. We propose utilizing spatial analytics, including GIS and spatial optimization, to help site bicycle share stations across an urban region. Specifically we seek to apply a covering model to assess how many bicycle stations are needed, and where they should be located, so no user would have to travel too far for access. The city of Phoenix, Arizona, is used as a case study to illustrate the coverage and access tradeoffs possible through different investment strategies. Accordingly, for a given investment level, the set of stations is identified that provides the best access to the designated bike path network for the greatest number of potential users. Further, tradeoff options that differentially favor either network or population coverage are possible, and can be identified and evaluated through the proposed analytical framework.","[Conrow, Lindsey; Fischer, Heather A.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, POB 875302, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Murray, Alan T.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Conrow, L (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, POB 875302, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",lconrow@asu.edu,"Murray, Alan T/B-2993-2012","Murray, Alan T/0000-0003-2674-6110; Fischer, Heather/0000-0003-2530-3529",,,,,29,49,56,8,59,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Various backbone extraction algorithms have been proposed in different scientific fields. Although of clear interest to transport geographers, backbone extraction techniques have been adopted unevenly and in an ad hoc fashion in transport geography research. In this paper we therefore present a conceptual and experimental comparison of backbone extraction techniques in a transport-geographical context, and explore the new insights each technique can offer to enhance our understanding of the Southeast Asian intercity air transport network (SAAN). We review six frequently-used methods, i.e. global weight thresholding method (GWTM), k-core decomposition method (KCDM), minimum spanning tree method (MSTM), primary linkage analysis method (PLAM), multiple linkage analysis method (MLAM), and the disparity filter algorithm method (DFAM), and elaborate their analytical essence by applying them to extract the backbone of the SAAN. The abstracted networks are compared in terms of their geographical and topological structures using the initial network as a benchmark. This comparison is then used to point out the different techniques' potential in light of different transport geography research applications.","[Dai, Liang] Nanjing Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Adm, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Dai, Liang; Derudder, Ben] Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, Ghent, Belgium; [Liu, Xingjian] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Urban Planning & Design, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Finance & Economics; Ghent University; University of Hong Kong,"Derudder, B (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, Ghent, Belgium.",liang.dai@ugent.be; ben.derudder@ugent.be; xliu6@hku.hk,"Derudder, Ben/A-1616-2008; Derudder, Ben/ABH-5648-2020","Derudder, Ben/0000-0001-6195-8544; Liu, Xingjian/0000-0003-4158-3655",,,,,70,20,24,2,36,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

It aims to overcome the limitations of existing empirical literature by building a new urban population dataset that allows the construction of a set of Herfindahl-Hirschman-lndices which capture a country's urban structure in a more nuanced way than the indicators used hitherto. We find that, contrary to the general perception, urban concentration levels have on average decreased or remained stable (depending on indicator). However, these averages camouflage diverging trends across countries. The results of the econometric analysis suggest that there is no uniform relationship between urban concentration and economic growth. Urban concentration is beneficial for economic growth in high-income countries, while this effect does not hold for developing countries. The results differ from previous analyses that generally underscore the benefits of urban concentration at low levels of economic development. The results are robust to accounting for reverse causality through IV analysis, using exogenous geographic factors as instruments. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We argue that the patterns of interaction between urbanization and investment in real estate vary across regions. The results show that urbanization does Granger-cause investment in real estate, primarily in the central and northeastern regions of China, while urbanization does not Granger-cause investment in real estate in the eastern and western regions, except for four provinces. Most regions do not have a Granger-causality relationship from real estate investment to urbanization; the exceptions are Henan and Hei Longjiang provinces. Our results only support one theory on the relationship between urbanization and the real estate market for one-third of the provinces. Thus, urbanization can improve real estate investment by increasing the demand for housing as a result of population agglomeration, but urbanization does not depend on real estate investment in China.","[Liu, Tie-Ying] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Su, Chi-Wei] Ocean Univ China, Dept Finance, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Chang, Hsu-Ling] Ling Tung Univ, Dept Accounting & Informat, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chu, Chien-Chi] Shantou Univ Business Sch, Dept Finance, 243 Da Xue Rd, Shantou City 515063, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Chu, Chien-Chi] Shantou Univ, Res Inst Guangdong Taiwan Business Cooperat, Shantou, Peoples R China",Beijing Jiaotong University; Ocean University of China; Shantou University,"Chu, CC (通讯作者)，Shantou Univ Business Sch, Dept Finance, 243 Da Xue Rd, Shantou City 515063, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",jqzhu@stu.edu.cn,"Su, Chi Wei/ABE-4976-2021","Su, Chi Wei/0000-0001-9722-8105","Ministry of Education, Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Fund [16YJC790064]","Ministry of Education, Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Fund","Ministry of Education, Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Fund, Grant/Award Number: 16YJC790064",,46,15,16,4,65,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

This article presents insights from in-depth qualitative research, offering stronger evidence of causal influences than in mainstream studies on the built environment and travel. Analyzing 33 qualitative interviews, the paper explains causal mechanisms underlying differences between inner-city and suburban residents' travel behavior observed in the Norwegian metropolitan areas of Oslo and Stavanger and in several earlier studies. We argue that built environment characteristics influence travel through their interplay with inhabitants' rationales for location of activities and travel mode choice. The interviewees' main rationales for activity locations, choosing the best facility and minimizing the friction of distance, are often traded off against each other. Innercity residents can still be selective about the quality of the facility without needing to travel a long distance, since many potential facilities are often available within short distance from the dwelling. For suburbanites, choosing the best facility more often requires acceptance of longer travel distances This is still context-dependent, depending on the center structure of the city. The interviewees' rationales for travel mode choice are, together with time-geographical constraints, an important part of the explanation why suburbanites tend to travel much more frequently by car than inner-city residents do. Those who need to overcome long distances to reach daily destinations need fast means of transportation, and therefore consider themselves more car-dependent. The similarity of the transport rationales found in this study with rationales identified in other studies in different city contexts suggests a high degree of generality in the basic mechanisms through which urban form influences travel behavior.","[Naess, Petter; Peters, Sebastian; Stefansdottir, Harpa] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, POB 1432, N-1432 As, Norway; [Strand, Arvid] Inst Transport Econ, Gaustadalleen 21, N-0349 Oslo, Norway",Norwegian University of Life Sciences; Institute of Transport Economics,"Næss, P (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, POB 1432, N-1432 As, Norway.",petter.nass@nmbu.no,,"Stefansdottir, Harpa/0000-0003-1707-1828",,,,,61,34,39,0,25,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Employing a survival analysis and a difference-in-difference framework, we find that registered sex offenders have a large adverse impact on nearby home liquidity on average; and, this effect is largely driven by surprises of their moving in or out during the marketing period of nearby homes. However, for homes near offenders who reside nearby through the entire marketing period, sellers tend to steeply discount the initial list price and may actually sell their homes more quickly.

To this end, a general setting describing a foreign exchange market is introduced. Two adequate models-PCSV and a simpler multivariate Heston model-are adjusted to suit the foreign exchange setting. For both models, characteristic functions are found which allow for an almost instantaneous calculation of option prices using Fourier techniques. After presenting the general calibration procedure, both the multivariate Heston and the PCSV models are calibrated to a time series of option data on three exchange rates-USD-SEK, EUR-SEK, and EUR-USD-spanning more than 11 years. Finally, the benefits of the PCSV model which we find to be superior to the multivariate extension of the Heston model in replicating the dynamics of these options are highlighted.","[Escobar, Marcos] Western Univ, Stat & Actuarial Sci, 1151 Richmond St, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; [Gschnaidtner, Christoph] Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Management, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Technical University of Munich,"Gschnaidtner, C (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Management, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",marcos.escobar@uwo.ca; christoph.gschnaidtner@tum.de,"Escobar-Anel, Marcos/AAM-1507-2020; Escobar-Anel, Marcos/S-1225-2018; Gschnaidtner, Christoph/AAE-3802-2019","Escobar-Anel, Marcos/0000-0001-9691-4322; Gschnaidtner, Christoph/0000-0002-9352-7658",,,,,62,8,8,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1380-6645,1573-7144,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

It also looks at what individual and household characteristics may have moved these children into or out of situations of nutritional deprivation and how their stunting profile in later childhood correlates with psychosocial outcomes at age 19 and how it may have intergenerational consequences. The paper uses 4 rounds of longitudinal data collected in 2002, 2006, 2009 and 2013 from Andhra Pradesh and Telengana, India when the children were aged 8, 12, 15 and 19. The paper finds that there are significant gender based biases in growth faltering later in childhood disfavouring girls and that becoming newly stunted as an adolescent is strongly correlated with a child reporting to have poorer relationships with peers compared to the group that were never stunted. We also find that a girl experiencing stunting in middle childhood or adolescence (even if they were not stunted at age 8 or eventually moved out of being stunted by age 19) correlates significantly with offspring being shorter and thinner than the offspring of girls never stunted. This is one of few, if any, studies that look at growth patterns in middle childhood and adolescence and outcomes as a young adult and the results are important for their implications for further research and policy.

In our experiment, participants observed 60 sequences of stock prices, and after each, reported a neutral trading price at which they would be indifferent about buying or selling. We manipulated both motivation and memory in a 2 x 2 between-subjects design, yielding four separate conditions where participants were assigned to the role of either buyer or seller, and had to rely more or less on memory. We tested how these variations in context affected the weight that participants put on each previously observed price in determining their neutral trading price. Our results show that the weighting of reference prices depends a great deal on contextual variables. Specifically, participant assignment to the role of buyer (rather than seller) and reliance on memory (rather than having access to historical prices) similarly increase the weighting of intermediate and recent prices, but decrease the weighting of early and high prices. This provides evidence for motivated information processing depending on role, as well as recency but not primacy memory effects. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, I found a particularly strong and one-way causal direction from stock prices to the unemployment rate in G7 countries. There is a strong bilateral causal relationship between stock prices and unemployment for other advanced countries. However, in the 11 developing and emerging countries, the causality test results indicate a strong Granger causality from unemployment to stock prices. The results for developing and emerging countries suggest that the unemployment rate can help forecast stock prices, but not vice versa.

Based on a new trade theory framework, we derive a sectoral gravity equation, including novel variables corresponding to the exporter's labor competitiveness levels, along with importer's price indices and sectoral incomes, and analyze industry-specific bilateral trade flows of 186 countries for the period 1996-2012. We address potential endogeneity and econometric drawbacks by means of the Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood estimation methods. The results indicate that both the institutional conditions at destination and the institutional distance between exporting and importing countries are relevant factors for bilateral trade. Moreover, the effect associated with institutional conditions at destination moderately increases over time. This is a robust outcome across economic sectors, with higher values for agriculture and raw materials than for manufacturing and services. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

While much research has focused on the link between expectations and behavior, this study extends the literature by asking how those expectations were shaped initially. Specifically, we explore how one's economic context is related to expectations. This paper further extends the literature by focusing on two dimensions of the parenthood expectations of young people (men and women aged 18-27). Using the 2005, 2007, 2009, and 2011 waves of the Panel Studies of Income Dynamics (PSID) Transition to Adulthood (TA) sample, we considered whether young people expected to have children in the future and, for those who did, when they expected to do so. The results support financial-strain theories of the relationship between (subjective and objective) economic circumstances and childbearing expectations. Women and men with lower earnings, less education, and more worries about their future job prospects are more uncertain whether they will have children. Of those who expect to have children, those with more education and more worries expect to do so later in life. Further analyses reveal that race and gender condition these relationships.","[Brauner-Otto, Sarah R.] McGill Univ, Dept Sociol, Room 712,Leacock Bldg,855 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada; [Geist, Claudia] Univ Utah, Dept Sociol, Room 301,380 S 1530 E, Salt Lake City, UT 84105 USA",McGill University; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Brauner-Otto, SR (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Dept Sociol, Room 712,Leacock Bldg,855 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada.",sarah.brauner-otto@mcgill.ca; Claudia.geist@soc.utah.edu,,,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,63,34,37,4,27,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

A dynamic panel data least squares dummy variable estimator estimator is employed over a sample of 15 European Union countries during the period 1990-2012. The empirical results show that real GDP growth decreases when fiscal austerity measures are implemented, especially if they are spending-driven. Cuts in public expenditure undermine economic growth, namely if they slash spending on public order, recreation, and education. Spending cuts on education, in particular, affect the investment in human capital, harming not only growth but also economic, social, and human development. The unemployment rate also proved to be significantly boosted when austerity measures restrict spending on education, whereas income inequality rises when social protection expenditures are cut.","[Castro, Vitor] Loughborough Univ Technol, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough, Leics, England; [Castro, Vitor] Econ Policies Res Unit NIPE, Coimbra, Portugal",Loughborough University,"Castro, V (通讯作者)，Loughborough Univ Technol, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough, Leics, England.",v.m.q.castro@lboro.ac.uk,"Castro, Vítor/P-4837-2019","Castro, Vítor/0000-0002-6426-6663",Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BSAB/113588/2015]; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [SFRH/BSAB/113588/2015]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BSAB/113588/2015] Funding Source: FCT,Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Grant/Award Number: SFRH/BSAB/113588/2015; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology, Grant/Award Number: SFRH/BSAB/113588/2015",,44,5,6,2,23,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

The recent subprime mortgage crisis has shed light on the imperative need to address the affordability challenge. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the housing affordability constraint from a conceptual and analytical standpoint by highlighting its role in a dynamic life cycle modelling framework. We attempt to assess quantitatively the impact of the affordability constraint on households' optimal consumption, mortgage, portfolio choices and poverty status over their lifetime. Meanwhile, we investigate the interaction between borrower-based macroprudential policies and social policies aimed at improving poverty and fostering home ownership and credit availability. Based on our simulation results, the mortgage affordability constraint is shown to have a significant impact in the prime and subprime mortgage markets. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis confirms the findings of the baseline case and emphasises that there is a non-linear (hump-shaped) relationship between affordability degrees and housing caused poverty, particular in the age groups above 40. This implies that, in the light of the age profile of households and the features of mortgage credit markets, the magnitudes of the borrower-based macroprudential policies need careful assessment to minimise the potential conflicts with other social policies.","[Chen, Xi] CEIBS Lujiazui Inst Int Finance, Shanghai 200120, Peoples R China",,"Chen, X (通讯作者)，CEIBS Lujiazui Inst Int Finance, Shanghai 200120, Peoples R China.",xi.chen.2015@gmx.de,,,"Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,48,3,4,0,21,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",1051-1377,1096-0791,,J HOUS ECON,J.

The transmission mechanism works through an increase in domestic private-sector productivity, spurred by government purchases, which reduces real marginal costs at home allowing for accommodating monetary policy response.","[Di Giorgio, Giorgio] LUISS Guido Carli, Dept Econ & Finance, Viale Romania 32, I-00197 Rome, Italy; [Nistico, Salvatore] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Social & Econ Sci, Piazzale Aldo Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Traficante, Guido] European Univ Rome, Via Aldobrandeschi 190, I-00163 Rome, Italy",Luiss Guido Carli University; Sapienza University Rome; European University of Rome,"Traficante, G (通讯作者)，European Univ Rome, Via Aldobrandeschi 190, I-00163 Rome, Italy.",gdg@luiss.it; salvatore.nistico@uniroma1.it; guido.traficante@unier.it,"Nisticò, Salvatore/JBS-4745-2023","Nistico, Salvatore/0000-0001-9054-923X; Traficante, Guido/0000-0002-0626-2787","Italian Ministry of University and Research (PRIN Asymmetric information, adjustment costs and efficiency: microeconomic foundations and macroeconomic implications)","Italian Ministry of University and Research (PRIN Asymmetric information, adjustment costs and efficiency: microeconomic foundations and macroeconomic implications)(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","We thank Hamid Beladi (editor) and an anonymous referee for the useful comments on the earlier draft.

Due to the financial crisis following the collapse of Lehman Brothers and in particular due to the sovereign debt crisis, however, this notion has changed in several countries. Against this background, we provide the first study investigating factors influencing risk premiums in the international public covered bond market on a bond-individual level. We show that bond-specific and macroeconomic factors, as well as the recent economic crises and monetary policy measures by the ECB, affect risk premiums. While the two crises had an increasing effect, the first covered bond purchase program lowered risk premiums of public covered bonds. Since the cover pools consist of loans to (mostly domestic) public sector entities, we further show significant differences in the influencing factors between bonds issued in different countries.

We show that while the price impact of trades increases with the percentage of shares held by foreign investors, the bid-ask spread decreases with foreign ownership. We interpret these results as evidence that although foreign investors increase adverse selection risks for liquidity providers, they bring net benefit to the market in terms of lower trading costs by increasing competition in the price discovery process. The general increase in foreign ownership in emerging markets after the global financial crisis resulted in higher price impacts and lower spreads.

We show that the corrupt behavior of appointed politicians also follows certain patterns which are driven by political cycles. Based on BEEPS data, exploiting variation in the dates of surveys and in the starting dates of Russian regional governors' terms of office, we find that corruption levels, as perceived by firms operating in different regions of Russia, are higher closer to the end of a regional governor's term. We argue that such a pattern cannot be explained by standard political budget cycle reasoning, but rather that the observed pattern may be generated by governors' accumulation of private information about their likelihood of remaining in office for another term. When a governor gradually learns that he will not be re-appointed once his current term has expired, he has increasing incentives to engage in corrupt activities in order to accumulate wealth before his departure. Alternatively, when a governor becomes more certain that he will remain in office, he may have higher incentives to smooth rent extraction over time and thus not to increase it. We test this explanation in several ways and consistently find supporting evidence.","[Sidorkin, Oleg; Vorobyev, Dmitriy] CERGE EI, Politickych Veznu 7, Prague 11121, Czech Republic; [Sidorkin, Oleg; Vorobyev, Dmitriy] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Econ, Politickych Veznu 7, Prague 11121, Czech Republic; [Vorobyev, Dmitriy] Ural Fed Univ, Grad Sch Econ & Management, Ekaterinburg, Russia",Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Ural Federal University,"Vorobyev, D (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, Ekaterinburg, Russia.",oleg.sidorkin@cerge-ei.cz; d.a.vorobyev@urfu.ru,"Vorobyev, Dmitriy/A-6975-2018; Sidorkin, Oleg/V-9044-2017","Vorobyev, Dmitriy/0000-0002-2230-182X; Sidorkin, Oleg/0000-0002-2902-989X","Economics Education and Research Consortium, Inc.

To that purpose, we develop and empirically test a monopolistic competition model with variable elasticity of substitution and labor differentiated by skill level, where skilled workers are the residual claimants of savings on imported inputs. Consistently with the model predictions, we find that a 10% reduction in tariffs implies on average a 3.8% increase in the wage gap. In addition, the same level of tariff reduction is expected to lower unskilled employment in domestic production by 3.3%, which is partially offset by an expansion of unskilled employment in the export segment of production.

In addition, the Chinese bond investors distinguish ratings from different credit rating agencies (CRAs), demanding lower yields on bonds rated by global-partnered CRAs. However, the empirical results suggest that the rating scales used by Chinese CRAs are not comparable to those of international CRAs. Furthermore, Chinese CRAs have very broad rating scales and pool bonds with significantly different default risks into a single rating category, resulting in over 90% of bonds in only three rating categories.

The results indicate that allocations are not made in response to endowment differences in isolation, but depend on the interaction of child endowment, gender, and beneficiary status. Moreover, investments are made so as to counterbalance efficiency and equity considerations: widening differences in height but closing gaps in BMI, where both strategies maximize returns given the earnings-endowment function for height and BMI in Mexico. Finally, household socio-economic status matters. Thus, discriminatory responses within the better-off urban beneficiary households are smaller. In contrast, indigenous beneficiary households, which have the lowest average endowment z-scores and fraction spent on education, see the largest differences in educational outlay between child subgroups. While the economic effects seem small, these are measured relative to the mean of the base category. In some cases, then, parents are dedicating nearly a quarter of all expenditures to education for a standard deviation increase in endowment over mean sibling endowment. Hence, it seems that the success of the Oportunidades program in improving overall human capital formation may be masking rising inequalities within recipient households.","[Majid, Hadia] Lahore Univ Management Sci, DHA, Lahore 54792, Pakistan",Lahore University of Management Sciences,"Majid, H (通讯作者)，Lahore Univ Management Sci, DHA, Lahore 54792, Pakistan.",hadia.majid@lums.edu.pk,,"Majid, Hadia/0000-0002-8208-2753",,,,,50,0,1,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

In Ghana, government and donors use CF as a strategy for increasing adoption of new agricultural technologies and developing value chains. Yet to date, there has not been a rigorous assessment of these CF schemes. The focus in this paper is on different maize-based CF schemes in the poorest and most remote region in Ghana. It assesses the profitability and potential impact of these CF schemes, utilizing a unique plot level dataset that covers two periods of data and two maize plots (scheme and non-scheme) per household, and employing matching techniques and an instrumental variable approach to address selection bias and unobserved heterogeneity across farmers. These are complemented by a community-level survey, in-depth interviews with scheme operators, and a series of key informant interviews. Results show that these schemes led to improved technology adoption and yield increases. In addition, a subset of maize farmers with high yield improvements due to CF participation have high profits. Maize CF schemes also enabled market coordination and consistent supply of quality maize to downstream industries. However, on average, the impact of the CF schemes on profitability is negative, even when input diversion is accounted for. Yield increases are not high enough to compensate for higher input requirements and the cost of capital under the schemes. Despite higher yields, the costs to produce one metric tonne of maize under CF schemes are higher than on maize farms without CF schemes, twice that of several countries in Africa, and more than seven times higher than that of major maize-exporting countries (the United States, Brazil, and Argentina). Sustainability of these CF schemes will largely depend on developing and promoting much-improved varieties and technologies that boost yields in order to compensate for the high input and credit costs.

We propose to use the performance measure that can't be manipulated with respect to the underlying distribution, time variation, nor estimation error, (the manipulation proof performance measure (MPPM, Goetzmann et al. (2007)), to rank all active U.S. domestic equity mutual funds from 1980 to 2013 on a quarterly basis to analyze managerial skills. We find fund managers in the higher ranked persistently outperform lower ranked managers by posting higher gross and net fund returns, higher holding-based returns, and generating positive return gap. Analyzing the holdings of the portfolios indicates higher ranked managers hold stocks with higher information asymmetry, especially the growth companies that are younger, smaller, and with lower liquidity. Our results show that the spread on gross and net fund returns between highest ranked and the lowest ranked fund managers is between 49 and 52 basis points per month. The holding returns are statistically significant for up to six months indicating the stock picking skills exist for those higher ranked managers.

First, the micro-scale and macro-scale definitions of generation are explained, and the concept of intergenerational fairness is discussed. Then we develop two perspectives from which intergenerational fairness can be considered. The first one is that of an economy (a macro approach) the other is that of a family (a micro approach). In the case of an economy the government's policy matters since it determines the intergenerational transfers today and their impact on the future. This means that contemporary intergenerational distribution of incomes or resources crucially affects such a distribution in the future. In the case of a family, its structure and the strength of family ties play a dominant role. We also show that intergenerational relations on the macro and micro level are not independent. The impact of transfers on the macro level on transfers on the micro level is, however, more direct and stronger than the other way around.","[Chybalski, Filip; Marcinkiewicz, Edyta] Lodz Univ Technol, Lodz, Poland; [Dominguez Fabian, Inmaculada] Univ Extremadura, Badajoz, Spain",Lodz University of Technology; Universidad de Extremadura,"Chybalski, F (通讯作者)，Lodz Univ Technol, Lodz, Poland.",filip.chybalski@p.lodz.pl; edyta.marcinkiewicz@p.lodz.pl; idomingu@unex.es,"Marcinkiewicz, Edyta/N-4203-2018; Chybalski, Filip/N-2595-2018","Chybalski, Filip/0000-0001-9555-8741",National Science Centre (Poland) [UMO-2016/23/B/HS4/01772],National Science Centre (Poland),"The paper forms part of the project Intergenerational fairness across welfare state regimes: A comparative cross-country study, funded by the National Science Centre (Poland) under grant number UMO-2016/23/B/HS4/01772.",,37,0,0,0,4,LODZ UNIV TECHNOLOGY PR,LODZ,"BIBLIOTEKA POLITECHNIKI LODZKIEJ-BUDYNEK B22, UL WOLCZANSKA 223, LODZ, 90-924, POLAND",,,978-83-7283-900-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,5,18,,,,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9BP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470276200001,0

Our empirical findings confirm that indeed BitCoin and altcoin markets are interdependent. The BitCoin-altcoin price relationship is significantly stronger in the short-run than in the long-run. We cannot fully confirm the hypothesis that the BitCoin price relationship is stronger with those altcoins that are more similar in their price formation mechanism to BitCoin. In the long-run, macro-financial indicators determine the altcoin price formation to a slightly greater degree than BitCoin does.

Recent empirical findings show that binding term limits invalidate this result: democratic dyads in which at least one country imposes term limits on the executive are as conflict prone as autocratic and mixed dyads. Moreover, in democracies with two-term limits conflicts are more likely during the executive's second term. To rationalize these findings, we model international relations as a repeated prisoners' dilemma. We show that the fear of losing office makes democratic leaders less willing to start costly conflicts. Crucially, this discipline effect can only be at work if incumbent leaders can run for re-election. Term limits thus make it harder to sustain peaceful relations.","[Conconi, Paola] Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, CP 114,Ave FD Roosevelt 50, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Conconi, Paola; Sahuguet, Nicolas] CEPR, London, England; [Conconi, Paola] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Sahuguet, Nicolas] HEC Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Zanardi, Maurizio] Univ Lancaster, Management Sch, Lancaster, England",Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Ifo Institut; Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; Lancaster University,"Conconi, P (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, CP 114,Ave FD Roosevelt 50, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",,,"Zanardi, Maurizio/0000-0003-1713-1034",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,38,0,1,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

There were two major developments in India's foreign exchange market since the 1980s: first, a shift in foreign exchange management regime from a basket peg to a free float; and second, a rapid phase of economic liberalization since the mid-1990s. The paper attempts to find out whether the market efficiency of foreign exchange markets is affected by these developments. The paper mainly uses the well-known Hurst exponent calculated through corrected empirical R over S analysis to determine whether the exchange rates possess long memory. The robustness of the method is tested by calculating the Hurst exponent through two other prevalent methods in the literature. Design/methodology/approach The authors apply the corrected empirical Hurst exponent which employs the Anis Lloyd correction with the modification suggested by Weron. The sensitivity of the results is then tested by replicating the calculations using the detrended fluctuation analysis and Robinson's method. Findings All the methods show that: first, there is no significant change in the overall efficiency of the foreign exchange market vis a vis the US$ for the time period from 1980 to 2017. Second, neither regime shifts nor calculations over sub-time periods is able to identify significant change in the efficiency level of the market for the US$ exchange rate. Third, efficiency of different exchange rate markets are different over the time period 1999-2017. The US$ market has unequivocally more long run memory compared to the GBP, Yen and EURO markets. Fourth, the results are robust to the method used for calculations. Originality/value Does the efficiency of asset markets evolve over time? This paper attempts to answer this question. In the process, the paper studies the effect of regime shifts and progressive globalization on the ability of the market to internalize information.","[Datta, Radhika Prosad] Indian Inst Foreign Trade, Dept Informat Technol, Kolkata, India; [Bhattacharyya, Ranajoy] Indian Inst Foreign Trade, Dept Econ, Kolkata, India",,"Datta, RP (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Foreign Trade, Dept Informat Technol, Kolkata, India.",rpdatta@gmail.com,"Bhattacharyya, Ranajoy/L-7591-2019; Trade, Indian Institute of Foreign/AAF-4182-2021; Datta, Radhika Prosad/AAG-2305-2021","Trade, Indian Institute of Foreign/0000-0002-2546-3285; Datta, Radhika Prosad/0000-0001-7671-7065",,,,,40,1,1,0,3,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

The companies under investigation are listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) of South Africa. Output from natural resources companies is a significant contributor of GDP in South Africa, an emerging and developing economy. In order to attract foreign investors, improve stock pricing and trading liquidity, South African companies need to signal to the capital market at the level that they are used to from companies in developed economies. Communications with the capital market is proxied by investor relations activities on the companies' websites. I find that on average, natural resources companies have significantly better IR practices than companies in other industries. However, in the multivariate model, being a natural resource company is a weak and insignificant predictor of online investor relations quality. Results indicate that larger companies that were listed more recently, had a Big 4 Auditor and were listed on multiple exchanges had significantly better online investor relations practices. From a policy point of view, investor relations officers at natural resources companies can still do more to improve their capital market communication practices to reap the full benefits from increased transparency, especially in the face of political uncertainty and declining or stagnant commodity prices. This study contributes to the theories on signalling and legitimacy by testing its application to natural resource companies in a sub-Saharan country.","[Esterhuyse, Leana] Univ South Africa, Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa,"Esterhuyse, L (通讯作者)，Univ South Africa, Pretoria, South Africa.",,"Esterhuyse, Leana/G-5040-2019","Esterhuyse, Leana/0000-0003-0140-7980",,,,,48,0,0,0,0,INTL INST SOCIAL & ECONOMIC SCI,PRAGUE,"TREBESOVSKA 2038/14, PRAGUE, 193 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",2336-6044,,978-80-87927-53-3,PROC ECON FINAN CONF,,,2018,,,,,,,32,50,,10.20472/EFC.2018.009.003,0.0,,,19,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2CN,,"Bronze, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000505163200003,0

Using small/medium sized domestic financial institutions as a control group, we find that large financial institutions overall had negative abnormal stock returns and positive abnormal bond returns, suggesting that the markets expect the Act to be effective in reducing these banks' risk-taking. We further investigate the market reactions for (1) larger and more interconnected financial institutions; and (2) the Big 6 banks to evaluate the markets' assessment about the effectiveness of the act in ending the too-big-to-fail policy. We document that larger and more interconnected financial institutions experienced more negative abnormal stock returns and more positive abnormal bond returns as compared to other banks in our sample, but these relations are not present during the final phase of the passage. Likewise, we find that both shareholders and bondholders of the Big 6 banks initially experienced significant negative returns, followed by insignificant returns during the final phase of the passage. These results appear to suggest the markets are doubtful about the effectiveness of the final version of the bill to end the too-big-to-fail status in particular for the Big 6 banks.

The results suggest that the propensity to buy the controlling banks' equity among financial professionals at the time of the stock market meltdown was shaped rather by the individual taste for their assets as consumption goods than by external pressures by direct superiors or the parent banks' management. Additionally, this predisposition was influenced positively by the fund managers' tendency to herd and fund participants' expectations as well as managers' sensitivity to eventual losses and previous work experience in the owning banks. The major investment segment represented by the fund also seems to be important, with an increasing level of risk acting as the denominator.

We construct a new database of studies of these programs that report impacts on food security outcomes and asset formation. Our meta-analysis finds that social protection programs improve both the quantity and quality of food consumed by beneficiaries. The magnitudes of these effect sizes are meaningful. The average social protection program increases the value of food consumed/expenditure by 13% and caloric acquisition by 8%. Food expenditure rises faster than caloric acquisition because households use transfers to improve the quality of their diet, most notably increasing their consumption of calories from animal source foods. Since the consumption of animal source foods in these populations is low, and because there are significant nutritional benefits to increasing the consumption of these, this is a positive outcome. Our meta-analysis also finds that social protection programs lead to increased asset holdings as measured by livestock, non-farm productive assets, farm productive assets, and savings. There is no impact on land holdings though the number of studies that assess these is small. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

The fragmentation has increased markedly since the outbreak of the global financial crisis in 2007. It declined somewhat from late 2012 onwards, but is still above the pre-crisis level. Interest rate pass-through has become less efficient primarily because of increased mark-ups and, to a certain extent, the lower responsiveness of bank interest rates to policy rates. The effectiveness of interest rate pass-through has become more heterogeneous across euro area countries, making a common monetary policy more difficult. The unconventional monetary policy conducted by the European Central Bank has reduced financial market fragmentation notably; however, this policy was not without side effects.

Currently, access to the Internet is not only a facilitation, but also a necessary condition for full participation in social, cultural and professional life. Older people, i.e., those after the age of 65, use new technologies to a lesser extent than young people do. Digital exclusion of older people in the face of an increasing number of seniors in the population may in the future be a serious social problem, and, in addition, a loss of a large market for suppliers of goods and services. The purpose of the article is to indicate the reasons for both the lack of interest and the lack of use of an online sales channel by people over 65 years of age. Focus studies showed the growing role of soft factors in the e-purchase exclusion of older people. At present, in Poland, lack of access to a computer or the Internet is not a basic barrier to making purchases over the Internet by seniors. The most frequently indicated reasons for not choosing to make purchases through this sales channel were the lack of the ability to make a transaction, being used to the traditional form of shopping, security concerns, and distrust shown to sellers.","[Huterska, Agnieszka; Lapinska, Justyna; Huterski, Robert] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Fac Econ Sci & Management, Ul Gagarina 13a, PL-87100 Torun, Poland; [Voss, Grazyna] Univ Technol & Nat Sci Bydgoszcz, Fac Management, Ul Fordonska 430, PL-85790 Bydgoszcz, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Huterska, A (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Fac Econ Sci & Management, Ul Gagarina 13a, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.",huterska@umk.pl; justlap@umk.pl; robhuski@umk.pl; gvoss@wp.pl,"Huterska, Agnieszka/AAC-9799-2021; Łapińska, Justyna/HMD-4197-2023; Huterski, Robert/G-3837-2014","Huterska, Agnieszka/0000-0002-4722-2853; Łapińska, Justyna/0000-0003-4134-4750;","National Science Centre, Poland [2017/26/E/HS4/00858]","National Science Centre, Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)","this research was undertaken as a part of the The impact of the development of FinTech and legal regulations on innovations in the payment services market of the European Union: strategies of the financial sector and consumer needs project and was fully funded by the National Science Centre, Poland under the grant (2017/26/E/HS4/00858).",,16,0,0,1,8,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-9164-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,108,114,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO1EW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000495441500014,0

Gift taxes are levied based on the average market value of the stock transferred for a certain period known as the valuation period. This process enables controlling shareholders to be incentivized to depress stock prices during this period and thereby alleviate tax burden. We discover that the firms that have stock gift transactions in the sample significantly decrease their discretionary accruals in the quarters that precede and/or overlap with the valuation period. Earnings management that decreases income is statistically significant when stock gifts are made for individuals who are the related parties and family members of controlling shareholders. By contrast, we do not observe a similar earnings-management behavior in cases where stock gifts are donated to institutional donees who are not subject to gift taxes.","[Lee, Su Jeong] Inha Univ, Coll Business Adm, Incheon, South Korea; [Park, Sung Ook] Kyung Hee Univ, Sch Management, Seoul, South Korea; [Jung, Woon-Oh] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Business, Seoul, South Korea",Inha University; Kyung Hee University; Seoul National University (SNU),"Park, SO (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Sch Management, Seoul, South Korea.",sopark@khu.ac.kr,,,INHA UNIVERSITY Research Grant,INHA UNIVERSITY Research Grant,This work was supported by INHA UNIVERSITY Research Grant.,,49,2,2,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

The results of the study highlight behavioural intentions towards technology adoption as the strongest predictor of value perception of the customers followed by their personal disposition towards technology adoption, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Based on the findings of the study, probable courses of actions have been suggested to the banks for enhancing value perception of the customers regarding the latest banking technologies, thereby, ensuring long-term profitability and sustainability.

This paper sheds new light on this issue by fitting a mixed frequency vector autoregressive model to monthly stock prices, quarterly bank loans, firm profit, and private investment. Monthly stock prices explain as much as 50.7% of the long-run forecast error variance of investment. We also reveal a spiral of declining stock prices, profit, and investment. Finally, the stagnation of bank loans is a consequence of declined stock prices, and the former is not a cause of declined investment.","[Motegi, Kaiji] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Nada Ku, 2-1 Rokkodai Cho, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; [Sadahiro, Akira] Waseda Univ, Shinjuku Ku, 1-6-1 Nishi Waseda, Tokyo 1698050, Japan",Kobe University; Waseda University,"Motegi, K (通讯作者)，Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Nada Ku, 2-1 Rokkodai Cho, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.",motegi@econ.kobe-u.ac.jp; sadahiro@waseda.jp,,,JSPS KAKENHI [16K17104]; Suntory Foundation; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K17104] Funding Source: KAKEN,"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Suntory Foundation(Suntory Foundation for Life Sciences); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We are grateful for the managing editor (Hamid Beladi) and an anonymous referee for valuable comments.

The investigation mainly focuses on shifts in public debt structure which does not change the level of debt quota. Methodical approach follows similar exercises developed to evaluate the effects of tax shifts on economic growth. Debt decompositions are made according to i) original maturity of instruments; ii) currencies; iii) residency of creditors; iv) kind of instrument. The panel data regression of 24 OECD countries in the period from 2000 to 2014 is used. The main findings suggest that the structure of public debt matters to economic growth in every decomposition made. Moreover, it was found that shifts in debt structure which are neutral towards the level of debt quota could be associated with changes of economic growth rates. Hence, it is legit to deal with adequate public debt structure not only with debt level in terms of influencing the economic growth.","[Murin, Martin] Masarykova Univ, Ekon Spravni Fak, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Murín, M (通讯作者)，Masarykova Univ, Ekon Spravni Fak, Brno, Czech Republic.",martin.murin@mail.muni.cz,"Murin, Martin/S-8419-2019","Murin, Martin/0000-0003-0070-4270",,,,,38,0,0,1,15,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

In order to test this relationship, we use of panel data for a sample of 13 developing countries over the period from 1998 to 2011. We make two contributions to the literature. First of all, the majority of empirical studies, using a single indicator of IPR elaborated by Park And Ginarte (1997), usually do not take into account the application of laws on patents filed in the practice. Unlike the previous studies, we incorporate in our work a new indicator developed by Papageorgiadis et al. (2014) which used to measure the intensity of the dimension related to the application of patent systems. We have also used the one developed by Park and Ginarte (1997) that measures the strength of patent regulations. As a second contribution, we add a new factor likely to influence innovation, namely education. The variable of education has not been taken into account in some studies. On the one hand, our empirical results reveal the existence of nonlinear relationships between IPR and innovation and argue, on the other hand, that the economic development, the opening as well as education are essential factors that contribute significantly and positively to innovation in developing countries.","[Rassaa, Emna; Ben Abdennebi, Hafedh] Univ Carthage, IHEC, Tunis, Tunisia",Universite de Carthage,"Rassâa, E (通讯作者)，Univ Carthage, IHEC, Tunis, Tunisia.",,,,,,,,22,0,0,1,6,INTL INST SOCIAL & ECONOMIC SCI,PRAGUE,"TREBESOVSKA 2038/14, PRAGUE, 193 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87927-77-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,420,429,,10.20472/EFC.2018.010.028,0.0,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2CO,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000505164900028,0

Our sample includes 1438 M&A deals announced during the period January 1999 to January 2010. The acquirer in these deals is a UK or US public listed firm in the financial sector, but there are no restrictions for the country of origin, the sector, or the listing status for the target firms. We provide some contrary evidence to prior studies that documented a positive relationship between various measures of financial advisor quality and M&A returns. Our results show that acquiring firms performing in-house M&As, rather than hiring financial advisors, have consistently achieved higher abnormal returns. Furthermore, acquiring firms hiring top-tier advisors within our sample achieve lower abnormal returns than the acquirers hiring lower-tier advisors. In addition, acquiring firms hiring top-tier advisors achieve low (negative) returns in M&As where targets are publicly listed. However, consistent with prior research, our findings suggest that top-tier advisors are able to achieve the highest deal completion rates amongst any other tier of advisors and commanded the highest fees. The question thus also revolves around not only whether financial advisors add value but rather whether their added value and knowledge also seem to be compensated by the huge sums of money they get paid. Achieving higher returns will be a justification of financial advisory excellence and higher premium fees. Overall, returns around the M&A announcement in this sector are perceived pessimistically. Our results also imply that financial advisors are not equally important across all deal types. Top-tier advisors perform much more complex deals which are on average at least ten times larger in size than any other M&A deal.","[Sahyoun, Bachir; Giannopoulos, George; Anagnostopoulos, Yannis] Kingston Univ, Kingston, England; [Sykianakis, Nicos] Piraeus Univ Appl Sci, Athens, Greece",Kingston University; University of West Attica,"Sykianakis, N (通讯作者)，Piraeus Univ Appl Sci, Athens, Greece.",,,,,,,,67,0,0,3,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",1431-1933,,978-3-319-93452-5; 978-3-319-93451-8,CONTRIB ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,161,197,,10.1007/978-3-319-93452-5_10,0.0,,,37,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BQ4NA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000591182600010,0

We use a multi-industry model of international trade to estimate a measure of industry productivity. We then quantify the effect that domestic innovation and technology diffusion have in explaining differences in productivity across countries and industries. Consistent with standard growth theories, we find the following: (i) Higher-income countries benefit more from domestic innovation than lower-income countries, whereas lower-income countries benefit more from technology diffusion; and (ii) the speed of convergence is larger for those countries and industries that are farther away from the technology frontier. To the extent that productivity differences determine comparative advantage, our findings suggest that domestic innovation and technology diffusion are endogenous sources of comparative advantage.","[Santacreu, Ana Maria; Zhu, Heting] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63166 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Santacreu, AM (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63166 USA.",,"Santacreu, Ana Maria M/I-5753-2016",,,,,,23,2,4,0,8,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

Thus the organisation as well as the monitoring of students is changing. Online courses have taken another turn with the innovation, which are the MOOCs. MOOCs are non fee paying courses, delivered mostly by recognised universities, course organisation and management was bound to change. By default MOOC courses are offered over a period of 1 to 1 and a half month, by course providers allowing courses to be hosted on their platforms, learning resources are often in the form of video lectures. Interactions with tutors are either synchronous or asynchronous. The appropriate evaluation mode for the high number of registered users for this type of course, is often the peer to peer evaluation. Another form of evaluation is the online quiz either assessed automatically or assessed by the system. With less than 10% successful completion rate for MOOC courses, Jordan 2013, and keeping in mind the Mauritian context, the Open University of Mauritius decided to offer a personalised MOOC, which could be referred to as a HOOC.

This article uses the average treatment effect and the difference-in-difference approach to evaluate the impacts of investment support from the Rural Development Programme and the Operational Programme Enterprise and Innovation on structural and economic indicators of small enterprises. This representative case study of 550 supported small companies from the Czech food and beverage industry during 2007-2015 clearly shows that investment subsidies increase the fixed assets, the credit-to-debt ratio and the labour productivity of supported companies versus nonparticipants. However, the discussion with recent studies indicates that this is not always positive for participants since high growth versus nonparticipants could result in crowding-out effects and increasing long-term and short-term debt that negatively impact technical efficiency.","[spicka, Jindrich] Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"spicka, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",jindrich.spicka@vse.cz,"Spicka, Jindrich/C-9855-2013; Pineda, Diana/K-6241-2012","Spicka, Jindrich/0000-0001-5699-9544;","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports [F3/46/2017]","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)","This study was funded by the institutional support for long-term conceptual development of the research organisation University of Economics, Prague (research project 'The Impact of Support for Public Investment Projects on The Gross Added Value of Supported Enterprises', No. F3/46/2017) provided by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports.",,55,6,6,0,13,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

These specific elements affect both the drivers and the output of innovation leading to a more detailed understanding of family firm innovation. Our results indicate that a long-term perspective positively affects innovation output in small family firms. We also show that family firms are better able to preserve the knowledge of the workforce through lower fluctuation rates which leads to higher levels of innovation output. Finally, the succeeding generations of family firm leaders seem to be more risk averse than the founder generation.

(2) Increases in firm growth, firm size, ROA, and GDP growth and a decrease in Tobin's q significantly boost firm-level financing. Policy makers should thus maintain a stable economic policy, so that firms can firmly anticipate any economic policy and solidify their financing plans.

In the model's hierarchy, politicians are constrained by elections while bureaucrats are controlled by budgets. If voters and bureaucrats prefer different types of politicians (i.e. they have a conflict of interests), incumbents pass oversized budgets to prevent bureaucrats from engaging in strategic behaviours that damage incumbents' reputations. If, instead, voters and bureaucrats prefer the same type of politicians (i.e. they have an alignment of interests), bureaucrats cannot obtain a concession from politicians. In the latter case, however, bureaucrats send voters a credible signal regarding an incumbent's type, which improves electoral selection. This paper also shows that political appointment systems improve political accountability in the conflict-of-interests case while they weaken electoral selection in the alignment-of-interests case.","[Yazaki, Yukihiro] Tokyo Metropolitan Univ, 1-1 Minami Osawa, Hachioji, Tokyo 1920397, Japan",Tokyo Metropolitan University,"Yazaki, Y (通讯作者)，Tokyo Metropolitan Univ, 1-1 Minami Osawa, Hachioji, Tokyo 1920397, Japan.",y-yazaki@tmu.ac.jp,,,,,,,33,6,11,1,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

Lessons Learned for Policy Design from Preference Revelation,ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Hedonic price method; Water quality; Environmental amenities; Valuation; Waterfront properties,IMPLICIT PRICES; QUALITY; VALUATION; PROPERTY,"The Water Framework Directive (WFD) seeks to achieve good ecological status of surface waters across the European Union by 2027. The WFD guidelines explicitly recognize the economics of water management by providing exceptions to water areas with disproportionately high restoration costs. This calls indirectly for estimations of benefits lost due to non-attainment. We employ a hedonic property pricing approach on waterfront recreational properties to estimate the welfare impacts of attaining the good ecological status described by the WFD. The empirical challenge is that the quality measure proposed by the WFD specifically denotes ecological quality, whereas economically measurable water quality values are heavily dependent on recreation impacts. Intuitively, the choice of water quality measure should have an effect on estimating the value of water quality. Our data provide a unique chance to compare three alternative indicators of water quality: (1) a usability-based index, (2) subjectively reported measure and (3) the ecological status determined by the WFD. We find that an improvement in water quality is associated with a statistically significant, non-linear change in recreational property values. We show how the ecological status compares with the other two indicators, and discuss the justifiability of using revealed preference methods when the valued good is defined purely on the basis of ecological criteria.","[Artell, Janne] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Helsinki, Finland; [Huhtala, Anni] VATT Inst Econ Res, Box 1279, Helsinki 00101, Finland",Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); VATT Institute for Economic Research,"Huhtala, A (通讯作者)，VATT Inst Econ Res, Box 1279, Helsinki 00101, Finland.",anni.huhtala@vatt.fi,"Artell, Janne/ABF-7870-2020","Artell, Janne/0000-0002-9833-5903; Huhtala, Anni/0000-0002-8613-3749",Water Management Research Program of Ministry of the Environment; Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry; Academy of Finland [263483]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [263483] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA),Water Management Research Program of Ministry of the Environment; Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry; Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); Academy of Finland (AKA)(Research Council of Finland),"We are grateful for valuable feedback to the seminar and conference participants at the Annual Meeting of the Finnish Economic Association, MTT Economic Research seminar, VATT Institute for Economic Research seminar and the 21st Annual Conference of European Environmental and Resource Economists in Helsinki.

Moreover, we find that the effect of DB pension plans on audit fees is stronger when clients' earnings are more sensitive to DB pension estimates, or when managers' compensation induces more risk taking. Finally, we find that the additional audit fees charged for clients with DB pension plans are negatively associated with the extent of manipulations of DB pension accounting estimates. Collectively, our findings suggest that auditors consider managers' incentive to manipulate earnings and increase audit effort to reduce audit risk associated with DB pension accounting, which results in higher audit fees.","[Chen, Yangyang; Ge, Rui] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Sch Accounting & Finance, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zolotoy, Leon] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Business Sch, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Hong Kong Polytechnic University; University of Melbourne,"Ge, R (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Sch Accounting & Finance, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",yangyang.chen@polyu.edu.hk; rui.ge@polyu.edu.hk; l.zolotoy@mbs.edu,,"Chen, Yangyang/0000-0003-3665-8261","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71672165, 71272199]; Departmental General Research Fund of Hong Kong Polytechnic University (G-UA4U)",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Departmental General Research Fund of Hong Kong Polytechnic University (G-UA4U),"We thank Dan Simunic (the editor) and the anonymous reviewer for their helpful suggestions.

The history of this involvement reflects the expansion and transformation of the scholarly community, as the discipline of political economy, pursued by a handful of scholars at a few universities, divided into multiple social sciences, with many more practitioners, and as close interaction with US social scientists came to displace the influence of the British political economy (e.g., Beveridge, Keynes, the Fabians) and, in Quebec, of the papal social encyclicals.","[Dimand, Robert W.] Brock Univ, Dept Econ, St Catharines, ON, Canada",Brock University,"Dimand, RW (通讯作者)，Brock Univ, Dept Econ, St Catharines, ON, Canada.",,,,,,,,111,2,2,0,4,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

This optimal tax accounts for externalities resulting from traffic congestion, road accidents, local air pollution, and climate change. Our methodology draws on Parry's (2009) theoretical model, which we calibrate with parameters for the Quebec context from the literature or from original estimations. We find that the optimal gasoline tax should be $0.72/litre in the GMA, $0.65/litre in the GQA, and $0.28/litre in the rest of the province. Thus, at $0.292/litre, the actual level of excise tax turns out to be very close to the optimal level of gasoline tax if the congestion costs are internalized through other instruments such as congestion charges.","[Dorval, Jeremie] Univ Laval, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Barla, Philippe] Univ Laval, Dept Econ, Quebec City, PQ, Canada",Laval University; Laval University,"Dorval, J (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.",,,"Barla, Philippe/0000-0002-3606-5549","Institut Hydro-Quebec en environnement, developpement et societe","Institut Hydro-Quebec en environnement, developpement et societe","Funding from the Institut Hydro-Quebec en environnement, developpement et societe is gratefully acknowledged.

Using the case of food insecure households in the district of Humla in northwestern Nepal, the study demonstrates that the same social and power relations that are driving local vulnerability dynamics, such as caste, gender, and access to social and political networks, also play important roles in shaping the impact of CCA policies. By tracing Nepal's CCA programs, starting with the local level, through district to international-national level dynamics, the study adds insights into the barriers to exclusion that embed power relations all the way through the chain of policy development. The purpose is to better understand how CCA can perpetuate rather than alleviate the conditions that create differential vulnerability patterns at village level. It raises questions about how whether CCA programs are an adequate response to increasing vulnerability for some of the world's most marginalized people. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Their structure is being dealt with by institutions at the national and international level (OECD, Eurostat). Correct predictions of public finance development and the entrepreneurship sphere are very important for competitiveness of the country. The aim of the paper is to propose a new Composite Leading Indicator (CLI) to monitor and predict the German economy. The analysis of 140 quantitative and qualitative indicators of industry, services, retail, construction, foreign trade, labor market, money aggregates, stock indices, confidence indicators, consumer expectations was performed for the needs of the indicator. As the reference series represents the German economic cycle, the GDP indicator is selected at constant prices for 2010. All selected quarterly time series are applied with seasonal index methods, the Hodrick-Prescott filter (HP filter) in the R program, cross-correlation with time shifts, methods selection and scoring, data standardization, identification of the same and different data and the subsequent construction of the CLI of the German economic cycle. The generated CLI can predict the German economy cycle two quarters ahead with a cross-correlation value of 0.867. The forecasting capabilities of the assembled indicator were better than the prediction capabilities of OECD, Eurostat and IFO indicator.","[Tkacova, Andrea] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Finance, Kosice, Slovakia; [Gavurova, Beata] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Banking & Investment, Kosice, Slovakia; [Behun, Marcel] Tech Univ Kosice, Inst Earth Resources, Kosice, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice; Technical University Kosice; Technical University Kosice,"Tkacova, A (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Finance, Kosice, Slovakia.",andrea.tkacova@tuke.sk; beata.gavurova@tuke.sk; marcel.behun@tuke.sk,"Tkáčová, Andrea/ABC-9384-2021; Gavurová, Beáta/N-9159-2018; Behun, Marcel/AAZ-6591-2020","Tkáčová, Andrea/0000-0002-6025-1261; Gavurová, Beáta/0000-0002-0606-879X; Behun, Marcel/0000-0001-8130-9664",,,,,68,3,4,3,11,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

This paper explores the validity of this explanation by studying how three decisive stages in the history of the EMU affected public borrowing in EU member states: the signing of the Maastricht Treaty, the introduction of the Euro, and the suspension of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). The methodology relies on difference-in-difference regressions for 26 OECD countries over the 1975-2009 period. The findings indicate that the Maastricht treaty reduced deficits especially in traditionally high-deficit countries. In contrast, the introduction of the Euro and the watering down of the original SGP led on average to higher borrowing. These results indicate that the introduction of the Euro and the suspension of the SGP led to soft budget constraints in the EMU.","[Baskaran, Thushyanthan] Univ Siegen, Sch Econ Disciplines, Unteres Schloss 3, D-57072 Siegen, Germany; [Hessami, Zohal] Univ Konstanz, Dept Econ, Constance, Germany",Universitat Siegen; University of Konstanz,"Baskaran, T (通讯作者)，Univ Siegen, Sch Econ Disciplines, Unteres Schloss 3, D-57072 Siegen, Germany.",baskaran@vwl.uni-siegen.de,,"Hessami, Zohal/0000-0002-0669-6913","German National Science Foundation (DFG) at the University of Mannheim [SFB 884]; Young Scholar Fund (Project title: Public debt, political institutions, and successful budget consolidations); Zukunftskolleg","German National Science Foundation (DFG) at the University of Mannheim; Young Scholar Fund (Project title: Public debt, political institutions, and successful budget consolidations); Zukunftskolleg","Zohal Hessami gratefully acknowledges funding by the German National Science Foundation (DFG) through SFB 884 (Political Economy of Reforms) at the University of Mannheim.

J,"Bureau, D",,,,"Bureau, Dominique",,,"Funding Urban Infrastructure: Value Creation, Property Tax and other Revenues",REVUE D ECONOMIE POLITIQUE,,,English,Article,,,,,,local public goods; land value taxes; optimal taxation; pricing policy,,"The common idea underlying new approaches to funding urban infrastructure and other city facilities is that they create value which can be used to finance their provision. Two types of arrangements are possible for this: by capturing the land value they generate; or by increasing their ability to generate additional revenues, e.g. from retail outlets. The former approach has been strongly advocated by economists. However, that recommendation is based on an assumption of perfect capitalization, which does not usually occur. The experience of major airports illustrates the latter approach. It appears necessary to clarify the assignment of funding instruments in an urban context: what roles should be assigned respectively to land value capture and to the development of new revenues from shops and additional services? To answer these questions we consider a standard monocentric urban model but we do not assume perfect mobility between cities. This allows us to analyze situations with incomplete capitalization of the benefits of the projects into land rents. Moreover, we take into account the fact that, in actual tax systems, the property tax is a source of distortions since its tax-base includes the value of buildings. This places limitations on the funding urban infrastructure by property taxes. However, additional revenues should not be viewed primarily as financial tools for covering its fixed costs. Local taxes remain the most natural tools for that purpose, the development of other activities being conceived as an element of a strategy for global value creation.","[Bureau, Dominique] Econ Council Sustainable Dev, Paris, France; [Bureau, Dominique] Ecole Polytech, Paris, France",,"Bureau, D (通讯作者)，Econ Council Sustainable Dev, Paris, France.;Bureau, D (通讯作者)，Ecole Polytech, Paris, France.",Dominique.Bureau@developpement-durable.gouv.fr,,,,,,,14,1,1,2,4,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Using export data at the firm/product/destination level for the period 2004-2006, it finds positive forward spillover on export value and quantity, related to quality upgrading. Conversely, it finds negative (or insignificant) backward and horizontal spillover on export flows, related to quality downgrading. When aggregating data at the firm level and considering that a firm can operate in several sectors, the paper shows that the presence of foreign input suppliers allows domestic firms to export additional varieties of lower quality and upgrade the average quality of existing varieties, whereas the presence of foreign customers generates the opposite effect.","[Ciani, Andrea] Univ Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf Inst Competit Econ, Univ Str 1, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany; [Imbruno, Michele] Univ Clermont Auvergne, CNRS, CERDI, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Imbruno, Michele] Univ Nottingham, GEP, Nottingham, England",Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); University of Nottingham,"Imbruno, M (通讯作者)，Univ Clermont Auvergne, CNRS, CERDI, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France.;Imbruno, M (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, GEP, Nottingham, England.",michele.imbruno@uca.fr,"Imbruno, Michele/AAR-9387-2020",,Agence Nationale de la Recherche of the French government through the program Investissements d'avenir [ANR-10-LABX-14-01],Agence Nationale de la Recherche of the French government through the program Investissements d'avenir(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"The authors are extremely grateful to the editor and two anonymous referees for their constructive comments.

While taking decisions regarding the time allocation of their children between work and leisure, parents do keep an eye on their relative position in the society. We develop a theoretical model of household decision making to show that child labor supply from a poor family can increase even with improvements in its economic conditions, if the family's relative position in the society deteriorates and if the relative status effect is sufficiently strong.","[Dwibedi, Jayanta Kumar] Brahmananda Keshab Chandra Coll, 111-2 BT Rd, Kolkata 700108, India; [Marjit, Sugata] Ctr Studies Social Sci, R-1 Baishnabghata Patuli Township, Kolkata 700094, India",,"Dwibedi, JK (通讯作者)，Brahmananda Keshab Chandra Coll, 111-2 BT Rd, Kolkata 700108, India.",jayantadw@gmail.com,,,,,,,43,5,5,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Technology adoption or imitation and the diminishing marginal return to capital are the two driving forces of the catch-up cycle. Technical gap and speed/efficiency of technical catching-up are two fundamental determinants for successful catching-up. Market competition, a beneficial financial system for resource allocation and openness are essential factors associated with speed/efficiency of technical catching-up and thus with successful catchingup.

Although it is often assumed that oil wealth leads to the formation of a distributive state that generously provides services in the areas of water, sanitation, education, health care, or infrastructure, this study shows that the spread of political dissent conditions the effect of oil wealth on the actual patterns of service distribution. Quantitative tests reveal that oil-rich nations who experience demonstrations or riots provide better water and sanitation services than oil-rich nations who do not experience such dissent. Subsequent tests find that oil-rich nations who experience nonviolent, mass-based movements provide better water and sanitation services than those who experience violent, mass-based movements. The causal mechanisms between oil, dissent, and distribution are evaluated through a case study of Saudi Arabia's oil-rich Eastern Province. The analysis begins with the early days of Aramco and examines how mobilization activities and the rise of Sunni-Shiite sectarianism altered service distribution in the province. This study provides evidence that social forces can shape the extent to which oil wealth benefits the nation and improves the population's quality of life. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Among the pricing models, the model equipped with the Gaussian copula has become the market benchmark for a long time. Albeit thereafter some other copulae were employed to improve the Gaussian model, yet a lot of them have suffered from shortcomings, especially in destitution of heterogeneous sectoral dependence, asymmetric dependence and fat tail dependence. For increasing the pricing accuracy and also keeping the model parsimonious, we propose in this paper an approach of convex combination of copulae (cc-copula) in pricing CDX tranches. Copulae from elliptical and Archimedean families were chosen as the components to construct the cc-copula models. In order to support the effectiveness of the cc copula models, two distinct empirical studies were conducted to reproduce the spreads of the CDX tranches of two different contracts covering crisis and non-crisis periods. The results evince that the cc-copula based pricing models have dominant performance compared with the benchmark models. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Often these are concerning quality management systems, work safety and the environment. Organisations are now striving to integrate them, usually because of lowering of administration and improving their performance. They address the difficulties and ignorance of the theory of management systems. The development of these systems continues. Substantial surroundings are changing dynamically. Organisations must react to survive. The article presents a pilot study on new aspects of integration of management systems. It interconnects knowledge about quality, environment, work safety and information, corporate social responsibility and performance. Based on the results of the literature research, according to the analysis of the state of management systems in the selected organisations and according to the experience of authors, it sets out the basic features for an integrated management system aimed at sustainability and social responsibility. Using these characters, the current status of this area is detected in organisations. Then the article compares the current EFQM requirements with these characters. With the help of TQM basics, recommendations and a simplified sustainable EFQM model are presented. The methods used in the article are: common mathematical statistics, observation, controlled interview, data analysis and synthesis, brainstorming, the Triangular Table, the EFQM model and other quality tools. The article is based on the assumption that the convergence of management system concepts will continue. The result is to set recommendations on management systems and lay the foundations for a sustainable management system for the organisation.","[Pelantova, Vera; Slaichova, Eva] Tech Univ Liberec, FM, Liberec, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Pelantova, V (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, FM, Liberec, Czech Republic.",vera.pelantova@tul.cz,"Šírová, Eva/AAC-8968-2020; Šírová, Eva/IZQ-0668-2023","Šírová, Eva/0000-0003-2110-1698; Šírová, Eva/0000-0003-2110-1698",EU; Transnational Educational project - Sustainable and Efficient Use of Sources [PN 100246598],EU(European Union (EU)); Transnational Educational project - Sustainable and Efficient Use of Sources,This article was partially supported by the EU program for cross-border cooperation between the Free State of Saxony and the Czech Republic 2014 - 2020.

This paper derives an intergenerational transmission function that can theoretically explain how the hukou system can give rise to different patterns for the intergenerational transmissionre of human capital from urban residents and rural-urban migrants to their children. Further, it empirically examines the existence of heterogeneity using multiple Chinese household datasets and different subsamples. Compared to urban residents, we find lower marginal positive effects of migrated parental educational attainment on children's schooling outcomes. The heterogeneity can only partially be explained by the observed socioeconomic characteristics. Although the hukou system plays an adverse role, evidence suggests that there is potential upward mobility for migrants, as staying longer with parents in an urban area improves the migrated children's school performance. This comparative study elucidates policy options for improving opportunity equality and modifications of urban segmentation.","[Zhou, Dong] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Cultural Ind & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Xu, Junling] Cent China Normal Univ, Sch Publ Adm, 152 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Central China Normal University,"Xu, JL (通讯作者)，Cent China Normal Univ, Sch Publ Adm, 152 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.",dzhou002@sjtu.edu.cn; angelaxu03@126.com,,,Shanghai PuJiang Program [16PJC060],Shanghai PuJiang Program(Shanghai Pujiang Program),"We gratefully acknowledge the support of Shi Li and Donald Lien, who shared their insights, thereby helping to greatly improve the paper.

However, biased perceptions of the target may arise due to imperfect information flows. We allow agents to revise expectations over time and we model their recursive choice among prediction strategies as an optimization problem under rational inattention. We then investigate whether a simple policy rule can steer the economy toward the targeted equilibrium. Our findings suggest that determinacy under rational expectations may not be sufficient to reach the target. Instead, monetary policy should be fine-tuned to correct agents' biased beliefs.","[Agliari, Anna; Massaro, Domenico; Pecora, Nicolo; Spelta, Alessandro] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Milan, Italy; [Massaro, Domenico; Spelta, Alessandro] Complex Lab Econ, Milan, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Agliari, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Milan, Italy.",anna.agliari@unicatt.it; domenico.massaro@unicatt.it; nicolo.pecora@unicatt.it; alessandro.spelta@unicatt.it,"Agliari, Anna/Q-6612-2019","Agliari, Anna/0000-0002-5230-9304; Massaro, Domenico/0000-0001-9652-1174","EU [288501]; Ministry of Education, Universities and Research of Italy (MIUR), program SIR [RBSI144KWH]","EU(European Union (EU)); Ministry of Education, Universities and Research of Italy (MIUR), program SIR(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","Financial support from the EU 7th framework collaborative projects Complexity Research Initiative for Systemic InstabilitieS (CRISIS), grant no. 288501 and from the Ministry of Education, Universities and Research of Italy (MIUR), program SIR (grant no.

An alternative perspective is that market discipline is limited (e.g., due to deposit insurance and/or enhanced capital regulation) and that internal demand for funding by banks determines rates. Using branch-level deposit rate data, we find little evidence for market discipline as rates are similar across bank capitalization levels. In contrast, banks' loan growth has a causal effect on deposit rates; for example, branches' deposit rates are correlated with loan growth in other states in which their bank has some presence, suggesting internal capital markets help reallocate the bank's funding.","[Ben-David, Itzhak] Ohio State Univ, Fisher Coll Business, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Ben-David, Itzhak] Ohio State Univ, Natl Bur Econ Res, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Palvia, Ajay] Off Comptroller Currency, Washington, DC USA; [Spatt, Chester] MIT, Carnegie Mellon Univ, Tepper Sch Business, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Spatt, Chester] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; United States Department of the Treasury; Office of the Comptroller of the Currency; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Carnegie Mellon University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Ben-David, I (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Fisher Coll Business, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.;Ben-David, I (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Natl Bur Econ Res, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",bendavid@fisher.osu.edu; ajay.palvia@occ.treas.gov; cspatt@andrew.cmu.edu,"Ben-David, Itzhak/I-3233-2012","Ben-David, Itzhak/0000-0001-9743-7441",GARP Foundation; Dice Center; Ohio State University,GARP Foundation; Dice Center; Ohio State University(Ohio State University),"We thank an anonymous referee, Allen Berger, Stephen Brown (the editor), Isil Erel, Darius Palia, Alberto Pozzolo, and Christian Rauch for helpful comments.

To investigate this issue, we examined whether the monitoring of personal finances is influenced by peoples' perceptions of their progress toward financial goals and their regulatory focus (i.e., whether the goal involves attaining a positive outcome or avoiding a negative outcome). Study 1 examined how often participants logged into their online bank accounts to check their balance and found that the worse they perceived their progress toward their most important financial goal to be, the more often they checked. In Studies 2 and 3 we developed a simulation of personal financial management in which participants were given financial goals that involved attaining a positive outcome and avoiding a negative outcome. Goal progress was manipulated via the balance in participants' account at the start of the simulation (Studies 2 and 3) and the rate at which their balance increased (Study 3). Participants in Study 2 checked their balance more often when they perceived their progress toward financial goals to be poor and when they considered avoiding the negative outcome to be important. In Study 3, the frequency with which participants checked their balance was influenced by an interaction between goal progress, the regulatory focus of the goal, and the importance of the goal. Participants who felt that gaining money was relatively important were more likely to check their balance when their progress was good, whereas participants who felt that avoiding losing money was relatively important were more likely to check their balance when progress was both good and bad. Taken together, these findings contribute to our understanding of how people manage their personal finances, and self-regulation more generally, by revealing that how often people monitor their personal finances depends on perceptions of goal progress, regulatory focus, and the importance of the goal.

In this paper, we examine ZIP code-level monthly lottery sales data from Maryland between July 2009 and February 2014, in order to test the impact of casino proximity on lottery sales, by type of game.

We contribute to the literature by investigating the impact of bank competition on the cost of credit in a cross-country setting. Using a panel of firms from 20 European countries covering the period 2001-2011, we consider a broad set of measures of bank competition, including two structural measures (Herfindahl-Hirschman index and CR5), and two non-structural indicators (Lerner index and H-statistic). We find that bank competition increases the cost of credit and observe that the positive influence of bank competition is stronger for smaller companies. Our findings accord with the information hypothesis, whereby a lack of competition incentivizes banks to invest in soft information and conversely increased competition raises the cost of credit. This positive impact of bank competition is however influenced by the institutional and economic framework, as well as by the crisis. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We also find that the probability of home improvements depends on the recent change of housing equity position and, more importantly, on the causes of the change.

A political agency model suggests that politicians with stronger re-electoral incentives would raise more tax revenues and use more the less transparent tax tool to enhance their probability of re-election. This prediction is tested by studying a reform that in 1999 allowed Italian municipalities to partially substitute a more accountable source of tax revenue (the property tax) with a less transparent one (a surcharge on the personal income tax of residents). Exploiting the existence of a term limit for mayors, we use a Difference in Difference approach, to estimate how mayors facing re-electoral concerns reacted to the introduction of the less transparent tax tool compared to mayors facing term limit. We find results in line with theory. We also show that the reduction in the property tax is larger in smaller municipalities and in municipalities with lower level of social capital.

We show that with perfectly inelastic energy services demand, crediting efficiency measures can recover the first-best allocation. However, when demand for energy services exhibits some elasticity, crediting energy efficiency can no longer recover first-best. While crediting removes the relative distortion between energy generation and energy efficiency, it distorts the absolute level of energy services. Building on these results, we derive the conditions determining the second-best intensity standard and crediting rule. Simulations calibrated to the electricity sector in Texas find that while some form of crediting is generally welfare-improving, the proposed one-for-one crediting of energy savings is unlikely to achieve efficient outcomes.","[Fell, Harrison] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Kaffine, Daniel] Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Steinberg, Daniel] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Golden, CO USA",North Carolina State University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; United States Department of Energy (DOE); National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA,"Fell, H (通讯作者)，North Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",hfell@ncsu.edu; daniel.kaffine@colorado.edu; daniel.steinberg@nrel.gov,"Kaffine, Daniel/V-9996-2019","Fell, Harrison/0000-0002-5749-3040",,,,,24,3,7,2,17,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

What is not taken into account is that economic systems are dissipative structures that are complex, but incompletely connected, networks of rules. It is explained why a degree of prior commitment in decision-making is inevitable in complex economic systems and the implications of this are examined. It is argued that economic analysis must begin with the reality that choices are made in relation to pre-existing commitments, both with regard to economic structures built in the past and to prevailing systems of belief, when deciding what to do in a future characterised by uncertainty. It is explained how conventional economic incentives can be dealt with in such a complex historical context building upon the neoclassical perspective of Alfred Marshall over a century ago. It is argued that econometric modelling remains viable and useful in understanding behaviour in complex economic systems.

The novelty of this paper lies in its investigation of how the long-run effects of a land productivity conservation subsidy and an agricultural R&D subsidy are affected by the possible emergence of the indeterminacy of equilibria in Rivera-Batiz and Romer's endogenous growth model with elastic labor. The analysis shows that if the technology growth rate is more sensitive to a change in the land productivity conservation subsidy policy than the consumption growth rate, the policy will generally enhance (harm) long-run growth when the balanced growth path is indeterminate (determinate). Furthermore, the agricultural R&D subsidy will enhance (harm) economic growth when the balanced growth path is determinate (indeterminate).","[Lai, Chung-Hui] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Accounting, Taichung, Taiwan; [Hu, Shih-Wen; Wang, Vey] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Econ, Taichung, Taiwan; [Chao, Chi-Chur] Deakin Univ, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Feng Chia University; Feng Chia University; Deakin University,"Chao, CC (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",chichurchao@gmail.com,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC 100-2410-H-035-029]","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","The authors are indebted to two anonymous referees for constructive suggestions and insightful comments.

While Bolivia has a long history of mineral and natural gas extraction, the agricultural sector's highly mechanized and capital-intensive character are relatively new developments. Referred to here as agrarian extractivism this paper reveals the very extractive nature of soybean production in Bolivia based on four interlinked dimensions: (1) large volumes of materials extracted destined for export with little or no processing; (2) value-chain concentration and sectoral disarticulation (3) high intensity of environmental degradation; and (4) the deterioration of labor opportunities and/or conditions. It is argued here that agrarian extractivism is a politically and analytically useful concept for understanding new dynamics and trajectories of agrarian change as it reveals the very extractive nature of capitalist agriculture, particularly in the context of contemporary land grabbing, flex crops, and the increasingly corporatized agro-food system. Rather than a form of industrial agricultural development which implies value-added processing, sectoral linkages, and employment generation, agrarian extractivism challenges this dominant discourse, revealing the various dimensions of social, economic and environmental exploitation and its negative implications for rural development.

Under each contract, agents of the young generation invest a share of their labor income in pollution mitigation in exchange for a transfer in the second period of their lives. The transfer is financed in a pay-as-you-go manner by the next young generation. Different from previous work we assume that the transfer is granted as a subsidy to capital income rather than lump sum. We show that the existence of a contract which is Pareto improving over the situation without contract for any two generations requires a sufficiently high level of income. In a steady state with social contracts in each period, the pollution stock is lower compared to a steady state without contracts. Analytical and numerical analysis of the dynamics under Nash bargaining suggests that under reasonable conditions, also steady state income and welfare are higher. Delaying the implementation of a social contract for too long or imposing a contract with too low mitigation can be costly: Net income may inevitably fall below the threshold in finite time so that Pareto improving mitigation is no longer possible and the economy converges to a steady state with high pollution stock and low income and welfare. In the second part of the paper, we study a game theoretic setup, taking into account that credibly committing to a contract might not be possible. We show that with transfers granted as a subsidy to capital income, there exist mitigation transfer schemes which are both Pareto improving and give no generation an incentive to deviate from any of its contracts even in a dynamically efficient economy. Social contracts coexist with private savings.","[Nguyen Thang Dao; Burghaus, Kerstin; Edenhofer, Ottmar] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Torgauer Str 12-15, D-10829 Berlin, Germany; [Edenhofer, Ottmar] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, POB 601203, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Edenhofer, Ottmar] Tech Univ Berlin, Dept Econ Climate Change, Berlin, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Technical University of Berlin,"Dao, NT (通讯作者)，Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Torgauer Str 12-15, D-10829 Berlin, Germany.",daonguyen@mcc-berlin.net; burghaus@mcc-berlin.net; edenhofer@pik-potsdam.de,"; Edenhofer, Ottmar/E-1886-2013","Dao, Thang/0000-0002-6097-4881; Edenhofer, Ottmar/0000-0001-6029-5208",,,,,39,5,5,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Per capita, the new series are termed church densities. A pattern emerges in the series that corresponds to the main development in the economy: until 1750, the economy was in the traditional steady state, where church densities were high and did not decline substantially. Modern development set in after 1750. Since then, church densities have declined more than five times. Moreover, capacity utilization of church rooms has declined, which means that the reduction in the demand for churches must have been even larger. We argue that this large decline is caused by a fall in religiosity that is caused by economic development as measured by the rise in incomes.

Our approach picks up rising imbalances in the U.S. financial system through the mid-2000s, presaging the financial crisis. We also highlight several statistical properties of our approach: most importantly, our summary measures of system-wide vulnerabilities lead the credit-to-GDP gap (a key gauge in Basel III and related research) by a year or more.

This paper adds empirical insight into both issues. Using data from the promotional campaign of a bank and a laboratory experiment that closely mimics the same decision, we find similar levels of risk taking controlling for gender and age. We also compare behavior on this same risky choice across three distinct experimental payoff procedures: a single salient choice as in the field, multiple responses for similar choices with one selected at random for payment, and a single salient choice that has only a small probability of being implemented. We find nearly identical behavior across these three payment procedures. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Strengthening resilience to climate-related hazards is an urgent target of Goal 13 of the Sustainable Development Goals. Preparing for a disaster such as stockpiling of emergency supplies or having a family evacuation plan can substantially minimize loss and damages from natural hazards. However, the levels of household disaster preparedness are often low even in disaster-prone areas. Focusing on determinants of personal disaster preparedness, this paper investigates: (1) pathways through which education enhances preparedness; and (2) the interplay between education and experience in shaping preparedness actions. Data analysis is based on face-to-face surveys of adults aged >= 15 years in Thailand (N = 1,310) and the Philippines (N = 889, female only). Controlling for socio-demographic and contextual characteristics, we find that formal education raises the propensity to prepare against disasters. Using the KHB method to further decompose the education effects, we find that the effect of education on disaster preparedness is mainly mediated through social capital and disaster risk perception in Thailand whereas there is no evidence that education is mediated through observable channels in the Philippines. This suggests that the underlying mechanisms explaining the education effects are highly context-specific. Controlling for the interplay between education and disaster experience, we show that education raises disaster preparedness only for those households that have not been affected by a disaster in the past. Education improves abstract reasoning and anticipation skills such that the better educated undertake preventive measures without needing to first experience the harmful event and then learn later. In line with recent efforts of various UN agencies in promoting education for sustainable development, this study provides a solid empirical evidence showing positive externalities of education in disaster risk reduction.

There are two types of cross-border lobbying: (i) lobbying from member-nation firms to the governments of other CU countries, and (ii) lobbying by firms from outside to the CU nation governments. Within this context, we analyze the effect of regulations on foreign lobbying on the equilibrium lobbying levels, and on the CET. If lobbying levels are strategic complements, tightening of restrictions on lobbying from outside the CU unambiguously reduces all types of lobbying.

The push and pull factors influencing diversification decisions of households are widely discussed in the literature; however, no study to date has taken into account spatial interdependence of household decisions in spite of various channels of neighborhood effects such as information flow, learning from others, social networks and agglomeration economies. This paper fills in the gap by incorporating spatial dependence in the choice model of diversification using a spatial auto-regressive probit model and an advanced Bayesian strategy to its estimation. Empirical analysis is run taking advantage of the Nigerian General Household Survey Panel, 2010-11 providing GIS coordinates for the surveyed households. The results imply endogeneity of the neighbors' decisions to allocate their productive assets among various occupations and signal the importance of social learning and agglomeration effects favoring the spillover of diversification activities through neighbors' networks and local markets. The households' decisions respond to local environment factors such as weather shocks or infrastructural constraints. As shown by the regional differences, taking into account spatial interdependence is particularly important in the event of a wide divide of the data available into different zones, as for example in case of the Nigerian northern region where the states are larger.

This finding remains robust, even after controlling for the pre-opening returns of index futures, which suggests that pre-opening trading in index options plays a critical and unique role in price discovery prior to the opening of the spot market. Such predictive ability is stronger for short-term options, near-the-money options, and for options that are away from expiration days. We also find that pre-opening options trading reflects the uncertainty transmitted from overseas markets, showing lower predictive ability on days with less definite overnight information (greater CBOE VIX).

Evidence from British elections 1950-2015,PUBLIC CHOICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Marginal; British; Election; Swing; Voting,,"We analyse the results of British general elections from 1950 to 2015. In our model, voting is both instrumental and expressive, and is driven both by ideology and the perceived valence of different parties. On most assumptions the model predicts that the safer the seat the lower the swing. The exception is where ideological factors are relatively dominant in instrumental voting, and valence factors are relatively dominant in expressive voting. In this case the highest swings might be in the safest seats. Alternatively swing might peak at intermediate majorities, and this is what we find when we look at swings between Conservative and Labour in seats held by one or other of these parties. We also find that marginals behave more distinctively when the national result is expected to be close or when there has been another general election recently; and that at least some voters have a sense of what is a 'bellwether' seat i.e. one that would be marginal in a close election. However in those seats where the main contest has been between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, the swing is positively related to the closeness of the contest.","[Barkovic-Parsons, Caladan; Maloney, John] Univ Exeter, Sch Business, Rennes Dr, Exeter EX4 4PU, Devon, England; [Hodgson, Robert] Univ York, Dept Hlth Sci, Heslington YO10 5DD, England",University of Exeter; University of York - UK,"Maloney, J (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Sch Business, Rennes Dr, Exeter EX4 4PU, Devon, England.",J.Maloney@ex.ac.uk,,"Maloney, John/0000-0003-3249-8926; Hodgson, Robert/0000-0001-6962-2893",Leverhulme Trust,Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust),"We would like to thank the Leverhulme Trust for funding the project of which this article is a part, and for comments and suggestions, the participants in the seminars at Exeter University's economics department and Centre for Elections, Media and Studies; also the reviewers of the first version of this article.

Our findings suggest that institutional investors' bid prices are negatively correlated with pre-IPO EM. The results are more pronounced for accrual-based EM than real EM. The findings are robust to a battery of different bid prices. We also document that retail investor oversubscription ratio is negatively or not associated with pre-IPO accrual based EM. However, such oversubscription ratio is positively correlated with pre-IPO real EM. Additional results show that IPO offer prices (relative to the proposed IPO price range) are negatively correlated with pre-IPO EM, suggesting that institutional investors' ability to recognize EM pressures IPO issuing firms into setting a lower offer price. Lastly,, we find that, the long-run IPO performance is mostly unrelated to EM, which is different from what the literature depicts.","[Gao, Shenghao] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Meng, Qingbin] Renmin Univ China, Sch Business, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Chan, Kam C.] Western Kentucky Univ, Dept Finance, Bowling Green, KY 42101 USA; [Wu, Weixing] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Banking & Finance, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Beijing Jiaotong University; Renmin University of China; Western Kentucky University; University of International Business & Economics,"Meng, QB (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Business, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.;Wu, WX (通讯作者)，Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Banking & Finance, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",gaosh@bjtu.edu.cn; mengqingbin@rbs.org.cn; Johnny.Chan@wku.edu; wxwu@uibe.edu.cn,"Gao, Shenghao/AAF-8120-2021","Gao, Shenghao/0000-0001-8705-958X","Foundation of Youth for Humanity and Social Sciences from the Ministry of Education of China [16YJC630024]; Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities [2015RC080]; National Science Foundation of China [71372162, 71572009]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71302156, 71373043]; Research Grant of Renmin University of China [2017030185]; Scientific Research Project Achievement of UIBE Networking and Collaboration Center for China's Multinational Business [201502YY003A]","Foundation of Youth for Humanity and Social Sciences from the Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Research Grant of Renmin University of China; Scientific Research Project Achievement of UIBE Networking and Collaboration Center for China's Multinational Business","We acknowledge the helpful comments from an anonymous reviewer, Alex Tang, and the seminar participants at Sun-Yat Sen University, I-Shou University, the University of International Economics and Business, and Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, and session participants at the 24th Conference on the Theories and Practices of Securities and Financial Markets.

Using a unique dataset on bank branch locations in Poland and firm-, county-, and bank-level data, we conclude that a strong position for local cooperative banks facilitates access to bank financing, lowers financial costs, boosts investments, and favours growth for SMEs. Moreover, counties in which cooperative banks hold a strong position are characterized by a more rapid pace of new firm creation. The opposite effects appear in the majority of cases for local banking markets dominated by foreign-owned banks. Consequently, our findings are important from a policy perspective because they show that foreign bank entry and industry consolidation may raise valid concerns for SME prospects in emerging economies.

The United States has stated in its Paris Conference of the Parties (COP) 21 submission that this is its aspiration. I suggest that this goal can be reached at a net cost in the range of $37 to $135 billion/year. I assume that the goal is to be reached by extensive use of solar photovoltaic and wind energy (66 percent of generating capacity), in which case the cost of energy storage will play a key role in the overall cost. I draw the tentative conclusion that a more limited use of renewables (less than 50 percent) together with increased use of nuclear power might be less costly.","[Heal, Geoffrey] Columbia Business Sch, 516 Uris Hall, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Heal, G (通讯作者)，Columbia Business Sch, 516 Uris Hall, New York, NY 10027 USA.",gmh1@gsb.columbia.edu,,,,,,,34,12,15,0,13,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",1750-6816,1750-6824,,REV ENV ECON POLICY,Rev.

We also compare investors' vulnerability to these heuristics based on their economic association, their type and demographic factors such as income, education and experience. For the data collection, a self-constructed questionnaire was administered to investors in the Malaysian and Pakistani stock exchanges. Data has been analyzed through description, correlation and regression analysis. The results indicate that all three heuristics are likely to affect the investors' stock buying decisions. The effect of heuristics is similar across the sample countries, the type of investors, and the income groups. However, the investors with a higher level of education and more experience are less likely to be affected by the heuristics. Copyright (C) 2017, Borsa Istanbul Anonim Sirketi.

The model is consistent with Merton's intertemporal CAPM (ICAPM) framework, and the key risk factor is the innovation on a short-term interest rate, the federal funds rate, or the T-bill rate. This model explains a large fraction of the dispersion in the average returns of the joint market anomalies.

We draw from neuroscience literature on the malleability of human perception to disentangle the impact of loss aversion and attachment on the endowment effect. Through a visual manipulation, we first examined how valuation of an object changed. After this, participants as buyers and sellers provided their willingness to pay (WTP) and willingness to accept (WTA), respectively. The results across the studies offer important insights into the role of attachment and loss aversion in the WTA-WTP disparity. The loss aversion account would not predict any change in WTA-WTP disparity across control and experimental groups, whereas the attachment account would predict an increase in both WTP and WTA from control to experimental conditions. Our results are inconsistent with both accounts and hint at a more nuanced view of a multiplicative or joint influence of loss aversion and attachment on WTA-WTP disparity.","[Masters, Tamara] Brigham Young Univ, Marriott Sch Business, 685 Tanner Bldg, Provo, UT 84602 USA; [Mishra, Arul; Mishra, Himanshu] Univ Utah, Dept Mkt, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",Brigham Young University; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Masters, T (通讯作者)，Brigham Young Univ, Marriott Sch Business, 685 Tanner Bldg, Provo, UT 84602 USA.",tamara.masters@byu.edu,,"Masters, Tamara/0000-0002-1502-6145",,,,,33,0,0,0,11,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

One question that immediately comes to mind when studying ecosystem performance is what the proper unit of analysis is: the country, the state, the city, the region, or something smaller, like an incubator or accelerator? This paper suggests that the open, innovative American frontier that closed at the end of the twentieth century has reemerged in the entrepreneurial economy on the U.S. campus. The contemporary campus entrepreneurial ecosystem offers the characteristics of Turner's frontier: available assets, liberty, and diversity while creating opportunity, and fostering entrepreneurship and innovation. A case study of the University of Chicago explores governance of the campus as an entrepreneurial ecosystem and the output produced by that campus ecosystem.","[Miller, David J.; Acs, Zoltan J.] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22201 USA",George Mason University,"Miller, DJ (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22201 USA.",dmillerq@gmu.edu; Zacs@gmu.edu,"acs, zoltan j/I-5496-2013",,,,,,56,112,119,11,176,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

This paper quantifies the daycare effects on employment of mothers with preschool children, analyzing newly constructed municipality-level data covering 1758 municipalities for 2000,2005, and 2010. The results suggest that 5%-11% of the increase in maternal employment rate during 2000-2010 was attributable to the improvement in daycare accessibility. However, the daycare effects on maternal employment are quite limited compared with those on enrollments at licensed daycare centers. Our new evidence suggests that such discrepancy could emanate from the fact that better access to licensed daycare centers encouraged working mothers to switch from kindergartens.

In the absence of central grid electrification, mini-grids offer significant potential for an immediate pathway toward rural electrification and the attendant gains in economic growth and productivity. Yet private investment in mini-grids has been virtually absent in India. Using a comprehensive life-cycle cost analysis, we find that mini-grids based on solar PV power and storage are more economical than incumbent energy services available to households without central grid connection. Under current law, a prospective entrepreneur in India does not require a license or certification in order to build a mini-grid and subsequently provide electricity services in the area covered by said installation. Conversely, there is no legal or regulatory framework that specifies what is to happen if the central grid were to be extended to an area that is already covered by a mini-grid. We report detailed survey evidence from interviews with entrepreneurs, analysts and policymakers whose assessments converge on the same point: mini-grid investments would be jeopardized in the event of central grid extension, precisely because discoms would, by regulatory order, provide electricity services at highly subsidized rates, well below their full economic cost. Our fieldwork suggests that the threat of central grid extension is a gateway barrier preventing mini-grid development in India. The issues associated with the gateway barrier have common elements with the so-called holdup problem as identified in the economics of organizations. There have been two recent federal policy guidelines and one actual state-level policy addressing the regulatory status of mini-grids. We examine the effectiveness of these policies/proposals in terms of an entrepreneur's willingness to develop mini-grids in the future. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We also consider factors representing orthogonalized realized volatility components of S&P 500 in the HAR-DL framework. The full sample analysis provides evidence of significant short-term realized volatility transmission from crude oil to the given equity sectors. The findings based on the time-varying analysis support the evidence that volatility transmission from crude oil to equity sectors is structurally unstable and exhibits structural breaks. Incorporating structural breaks in the realized volatility partially explains the structural breaks in realized volatility transmission from crude oil to equity sectors. We also examine the influence of conditional heteroskedasticity in volatility series on the measured volatility transmission and find that conditional heteroskedasticity plays a significant role in explaining the measured volatility transmission from crude oil to equity sectors.

Design/methodology/approach: We suggest a model to select companies that effectively use unique intangibles (in contrast to the generic intangibles). To test whether these results can be explained by skill we implement a bootstrap procedure. Companies that are able to use unique intangibles efficiently are combined in a portfolio. Findings: Only 22% of companies have the skills to use unique intangibles, but all of them are characterized by the efficiency of their use. The created portfolio demonstrates a higher cumulative return, Sharpe ratio and lower drawdown than S & P500. We also find the increasing importance of intangibles for investors during the crisis.

However, these approaches can also reinforce social hierarchies and political exclusion if they are not developed and implemented carefully. In particular, participatory approaches can be problematic if they too simplistically conceptualize democratic engagement as the folding of individuals into pre-existing governance structures. Utilizing a combination of feminist and postcolonial theories, this paper argues that practitioners of participatory methods must extend their thinking to the ways in which their projects foster engagement across multiple social and epistemological perspectives. Participatory geographic information systems (PGIS) methodologies are particularly effective at enabling these cross-perspectival engagements-geospatial technologies have unique capabilities for storing and visualizing knowledge from different types of knowledge systems. These different forms of knowledge can not only be visualized as multi-facetted and multi-scalar layers, but they can be directly placed in conversation with one another within the space of the map. In this way, they can be used to fundamentally transform historically unjust governance practices, rather than simply folding new subjects into unjust political structures. The authors examine these claims in the context of a case study with the Maijuna indigenous group of the northeastern Peruvian Amazon. The authors collaborated with the Maijuna to create and use a digital, spatial database to influence policy decisions about land tenure and environmental management. We show that geospatial technologies were uniquely capable of encouraging dialog and integration across indigenous, Western scientific, and state-based perspectives of the Amazon. These technologies are particularly effective at empowering traditionally marginalized perspectives within governance processes. This project therefore offers lessons about the benefits and dangers of geospatial technologies and methodologies for improving the democratic potential of development. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Using two structural vector autoregressive (VAR) models and a counterfactual scenario analysis, the results show that monetary policy shocks, as identified by changes in Treasury yields following changes in the central bank's target interest rates, lead to a substantial increase in pension funds' allocation to equity assets. Notably, the shift from bonds to equity securities is greater during the period where the US Federal Reserve launched unconventional monetary policy measures.

How does funding from external NGOs influence the responsiveness of local government policy to the sector-specific needs and policy preferences of local citizens? Using a unique longitudinal dataset from surveys of local governance actors in 200 municipalities in Bolivia and Guatemala, we explore these questions in the context of local natural resource policy. We find preliminary support for the hypothesis that external NGOs gain disproportionate influence over local policy processes in forestry by donating to local governments, and that this influence crowds out the influence of local grassroots actors, leading to less responsive local governance as rated by councils of local citizens. However, political pressure on local government officials from organized local groups in the forestry sector counteracts this negative relationship. Although NGOs can contribute to technical capacity for local governments and are generally seen as supportive of decentralized and participatory governance, our findings suggest that NGOs exert political pressure on local governments in pursuit of their own policy goals, and that NGO support may sometimes steer local governments away from responding to the specific livelihood needs of local resource users. More generally, our findings underscore the importance of local political contexts in moderating the effects of NGO interventions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The TSSV model framework permits infinite activity jump behaviors of returns dynamics and time varying volatility consistently observed in financial markets by introducing time changing volatility into tempered stable processes which specially refer to normal tempered stable (NTS) distribution as well as classical tempered stable (CTS) distribution, capturing leptokurtosis, fat tailedness and asymmetry features of returns in addition to volatility clustering effect in stochastic volatility. Through employing the analytical characteristic function and fast Fourier transform (FFT) technique, the closed form formulas for probability density function (PDF) of returns, value at risk (VaR) and conditional value at risk (CVaR) can be derived. Finally, in order to forecast extreme events and volatile market, we perform empirical researches on Hangseng index to measure risks and construct portfolio based on risk adjusted reward risk stock selection criteria employing TSSV models, with the stochastic volatility normal tempered stable (NTSSV) model producing superior performances relative to others.

An impatient firm sells shares to competitive investors. The firm can signal its private information about the fundamental by retaining a fraction of the shares. In addition, the firm can commit to disclosing information according to a set of accounting rules chosen ex ante. Information disclosure reduces signaling cost so that perfect disclosure is optimal. When perfect disclosure is impossible, the optimal accounting rule features a lower bound and a summary statistic of the fundamental. The interpretation of the lower bound is consistent with accounting conservatism, and the statistic summarizes the information most relevant to the firm's valuation. The justification for accounting conservatism relies on the existence of information asymmetry and the infeasibility of perfect accounting disclosure. This is consistent with the conjecture of LaFond and Watts (2008) that information asymmetry calls for accounting conservatism. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this paper is to empirically demonstrate the importance of accounting for potential spatial dependence between observations in the specification of spatial interaction models. As a case study, we analyze travel flows on the public transport system in an urban region in the Netherlands. We develop five distinct spatial interaction models (SIMs) of increasing complexity, each encompassing a lower and upper level model. At the lower level, the attractiveness of neighborhoods for boarding and alighting is modeled based on spatial and transit supply characteristics. At the upper level, spatial interactions among zones are modeled taking into account competing origins, competing destinations as well as network characteristics. We systematically compare more traditional SIM formulations with a SIM that explicitly accounts for spatial and network autocorrelation. The results show a substantial difference between the former models and the latter, in terms of the estimated total marginal impacts of the different variables and the pattern of the error terms. The results of our study underscore that the failure to incorporate autocorrelation effects in travel models is likely to influence model outcomes, which in turn may have profound implications for the very design of public transport networks in cities and regions.

We validate most of the major determinants found in the previous literature, generally based on earlier time-periods, except for the role of institutional quality. Agricultural trade, hitherto relatively neglected, is found to be one of the main factors causing deforestation. Focusing on the effect of international trade, we show that countries with different levels of relative forest cover react differently to a shock in agricultural exports' value. We also emphasize that taking countries' development into account may be critical in assessing global deforestation trends. The impact of trade is high in countries still endowed with a large proportion of forest cover while it is lower in countries with smaller remaining forest cover. We finally estimate, through a simple calibration exercise, the requirements for a cost-effective REDD+ policy for compensating trade losses in an open economy exporting agricultural commodities and endowed with tropical forests. We conclude that, in a world with increasing global demand, it might be costly to compensate totally and thus to offer the right incentives for developing countries to limit deforestation.

Thus, stock market efficiency is prone to systematic fluctuations, and, consistent with recent theories, events and policies that impact funding liquidity can affect the aggregate degree of price efficiency.","[Rosch, Dominik M.] SUNY Buffalo, Buffalo, NY USA; [Subrahmanyam, Avanidhar] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; [van Dijk, Mathijs A.] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Rösch, DM (通讯作者)，SUNY Buffalo, Jacobs Management Ctr 366, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",drosch@buffalo.edu,"Roesch, Dominik/ABA-9428-2020",,SURF Foundation; Vereniging Trustfonds Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research,SURF Foundation; Vereniging Trustfonds Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"We thank Stefan Nagel (the editor), two anonymous referees, Yakov Amihud, Tarun Chordia, Carole Comerton-Forde, Thierry Foucault, Amit Goyal, Terry Hendershott, Craig Holden, Sreeni Kamma, Andrew Karolyi, Ed Lin, Marc Lipson, Steve Mann, Christophe Perignon, Veronika Pool, Vikas Raman, Raghu Rau, Matti Suominen, Kumar Venkataraman, Avi Wohl, Hong Yan, and participants at the 2012 Brazilian Finance Conference (Sao Paulo), the 2012 EFMA meetings (Barcelona), the 2012 Frontiers of Finance Conference (Warwick Business School), the 2013 Campus for Finance conference (WHU Otto Beisheim School of Management), the 2013 EFA meetings (Cambridge), and at seminars at Deakin University, Erasmus University, Goethe University Frankfurt, Indiana University, UCLA Anderson, University of Cambridge, University of Manchester, and University of South Carolina for valuable comments.

The enhancement of important services such as biodiversity and carbon sequestration requires modifications in land-use that can lead to the decline in other ecosystems services. Targeting the most suitable areas for particular land-uses based on comparative advantages requires opportunity cost information across large regions. This is a demanding task because the input- output relations are ill-defined and determined by spatially heterogeneous operational and environmental conditions. To address this methodological challenge, this paper presents a two- stage semiparametric technique that enables multi-dimensional production possibility frontiers to be estimated from data provided by biophysical models. Specific advantages of the proposed frontier approach are its flexibility with regard to assump- assumptions for the input-output space and the space of the heterogeneous background variables. The method is illustrated for a case study of 18 Central and Eastern European countries. Results show that opportunity costs of changes in ecosystem services provision differ substantially between regions. Those areas having already relatively high levels of carbon sequestration have a comparative advantage in sequestering carbon. Opportunity costs of biodiversity are generally positively related with the level of biodiversity up to a turning point after which they are negatively related. To illustrate the policy consequences of the observed economies and diseconomies of scope we compare two management regimes to illustrate the potential gains from smart land management.","[Ruijs, Arjan] PBL Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, POB 303, NL-3720 AH Bilthoven, Netherlands; [Kortelainen, M.] VATT Inst Econ Res, POB 1279, Helsinki 00101, Finland; [Wossink, A.] Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Econ, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Schulp, C.

We examine gender differences in adoption rates, likelihood and determinants of adopting strategy sets that enhance yields, protect crops, and restore soils in the West African Sahel, based on analysis of cereal production in Burkina Faso. Applying a multivariate probit model to a nationally representative household panel, we exploit the individual plot as unit of analysis and control for plot manager characteristics along with other covariates. Reflecting the socio-cultural context of farming combined with the economic attributes of inputs, we find that female managers of individual cereal fields are less likely than their male counterparts to adopt yield-enhancing and soil-restoring strategies, although no differential is apparent for yield-protecting strategies. More broadly, gender-disaggregated regressions demonstrate that adoption determinants differ by gender. Plot manager characteristics, including age, marital status, and access to credit or extension services do influence adoption decisions. Furthermore, household resources influence the probability of adopting intensification strategy sets differently by gender of the plot manager. Variables expressing the availability of household labor strongly influence the adoption of soil-restoring strategies by female plot managers. By contrast, household resources such as extent of livestock owned, value of non-farm income, and area planted to cotton affect the adoption choices of male plot managers. Rectifying the male bias in extension services along with improving access to credit, income, and equipment to female plot managers could contribute to sustainable agricultural intensification.

We use data for 109 large international banks headquartered in 14 major advanced economies for the period 1995-2012. Overall, we find a positive relationship between the level of short-term rates and the slope of the yield curve (the 'interest rate structure', for short), on the one hand, and bank profitability-return on assets-on the other. This suggests that the positive impact of the interest rate structure on net interest income dominates the negative one on loan loss provisions and on non-interest income. We also find that the effect is stronger when the interest rate level is lower and the slope less steep, that is, when non-linearities are present.

To address this limitation, this paper employs the cross-correlation function (CCF) approach and reports evidence that this reform has led to a time-varying dimension in the dynamics of the mean and variance linkages between the international oil market and the Chinese stock market. The estimated results indicate that the causality-in-mean between the two markets strengthened after the reform of March 27, 2013, whereas the causality-in-variance almost disappeared after that date.

The International Skating Union developed team events in figure skating for the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia and for other major competitions. In this article, we show how the Shapley-Shubik and Banzhaf indices can be used to analyze contributions of athletes to their countries' teams in figure skating team events.

Researchers instead rely on observational designs. Observational designs that use panel data are widely portrayed as superior to time-series or cross-sectional designs because they provide opportunities to control for observable and unobservable variables correlated with outcomes and exposure to a program. The most popular panel data evaluation designs use linear, fixed-effects estimators with additive individual and time effects. To assess the ability of observational designs to replicate results from experimental designs, scholars use design replications. No such replications have assessed popular, fixed-effects panel data models that exploit repeated observations before and after treatment assignment. We implement such a study using, as a benchmark, results from a randomized environmental program that included effective and ineffective treatments. The popular linear, fixed-effects estimator fails to generate impact estimates or statistical inferences similar to the experimental estimator. Applying common flexible model specifications or trimming procedures also fail to yield accurate estimates or inferences. However, following best practices for selecting a nonexperimental comparison group and combining matching methods with panel data estimators, we replicate the experimental benchmarks. We demonstrate how the combination of panel and matching methods mitigates common concerns about specifying the correct functional form, the nature of treatment effect heterogeneity, and the way in which time enters the model. Our results are consistent with recent claims that design trumps methods in estimating treatment effects and that combining designs is more likely to approximate a randomized controlled trial than applying a single design.","[Ferraro, Paul J.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Carey Sch Business, 100 Int St, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA; [Ferraro, Paul J.] Whiting Sch Engn, 100 Int St, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA; [Miranda, Juan Jose] World Bank, Environm & Nat Resources Global Practice, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; The World Bank,"Ferraro, PJ (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Carey Sch Business, 100 Int St, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA.;Ferraro, PJ (通讯作者)，Whiting Sch Engn, 100 Int St, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA.",pferraro@jhu.edu; jjmiranda@worldbank.org,"Ferraro, Paul/B-4435-2014","Ferraro, Paul/0000-0002-4777-5108",,,,,55,69,76,1,11,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

The challenges of renewable intermittency could be offset by storing power, and many engineering studies consider the role and value of storage which is properly integrated into the 'smart grid'. Such a system with holistic optimal control may fail to materialise for regulatory, economic, or behavioural reasons. We therefore model the impact of naive prosumage: households which use storage only to maximise self-consumption of FY with no consideration of the wider system. We find it is neither economic for arbitrage nor particularly beneficial for shaving peaks and filling troughs in national net demand. The extreme case of renewable selfsufficiency, becoming completely independent of the grid, is still prohibitively expensive in Britain and Germany, and even in a country like Spain with a much better solar resource.","[Green, Richard] Imperial Coll London, Imperial Coll Business Sch, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Staffell, Lain] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Environm Policy, London SW7 1NA, England",Imperial College London; Imperial College London,"Green, R (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll London, Imperial Coll Business Sch, London SW7 2AZ, England.",r.green@imperial.ac.uk,,"Green, Richard/0000-0002-8671-8966","Engineering and Physical Science Research Council [EP/L014386/1]; Business, Economics, Planning and Policy for Energy Storage in Low-Carbon Futures; Alan and Sabine Howard Charitable Trust; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/L014386/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/L014386/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Engineering and Physical Science Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Business, Economics, Planning and Policy for Energy Storage in Low-Carbon Futures; Alan and Sabine Howard Charitable Trust; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","Research Support from the Engineering and Physical Science Research Council, under grant EP/L014386/1, Business, Economics, Planning and Policy for Energy Storage in Low-Carbon Futures, and the Alan and Sabine Howard Charitable Trust is gratefully acknowledged.

Evidence From Age-of-Youngest-Child Exemptions,JOURNAL OF POLICY ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,,EARLY MATERNAL EMPLOYMENT; INCOME-TAX CREDIT; CARE SUBSIDIES; SINGLE MOTHERS; LABOR-MARKET; REFORM; IMPACT; HEALTH; POLICY; PARTICIPATION,"This paper assesses the impact of welfare reform's parental work requirements on low-income children's cognitive and social-emotional development. The identification strategy exploits an important feature of the work requirement rules-namely, age-of-youngest-child exemptions-as a source of quasi-experimental variation in first-year maternal employment. The 1996 welfare reform law empowered states to exempt adult recipients from the work requirements until the youngest child reaches a certain age. This led to substantial variation in the amount of time that mothers can remain home with a newborn child. I use this variation to estimate the impact of work-requirement-induced increases in maternal employment. Using a sample of infants from the Birth cohort of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, the reduced form and instrumental variables estimates reveal sizable negative effects of maternal employment. An auxiliary analysis of mechanisms finds that working mothers experience an increase in depressive symptoms, and are less likely to breastfeed and read to their children. In addition, such children are exposed to nonparental child care arrangements at a younger age, and they spend more time in these settings throughout the first year of life.

This paper performs risk-neutral valuation for the non-recourse protection in the Korean reverse mortgage market. Specifically, we adopt a multivariate DCC-GARCH model that incorporates different forms of correlations between the economic variables.

Yet the literature generally deals with them separately. This paper bridges the gap by analyzing their interaction (or indirect bargain') in a dynamic two-sided market. It shows that in the symmetric equilibrium, the classic result that the first-period price is U-shaped in switching costs does not emerge, but instead switching costs always intensify the first-period price competition. Moreover, an increase in switching costs on one side decreases the first-period price on the other side.

Their importance can be understood by the observation that the money at the core of these systems, central bank money, is injected into the economy on terms, not defined in a market, but by the collateral frameworks and interest rate policies of central banks. Using the collateral framework of the Eurosystem as a basis of illustration and case study, the paper brings to light the functioning, reach, and impact of collateral frameworks. A theme that emerges is that collateral frameworks may have distortive effects on financial markets and the wider economy. They can, for example, bias the private provision of real liquidity and thereby also the allocation of resources in the economy as well as contribute to financial instability. Evidence is presented that the collateral framework in the euro area promotes risky and illiquid collateral and, more generally, impairs market forces and discipline. The paper also emphasizes the important role of ratings and government guarantees in the Eurosystem's collateral framework. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

If the only enforcement mechanism is the threat of exclusion from future insurance markets upon default on existing contracts, the introduction of UAs implies stricter no-default conditions, restricts the set of individually rational contracts, and then limits the private risk sharing.","[Platoni, Silvia] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Via Emilia Parmense 84, I-29122 Piacenza, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Platoni, S (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Via Emilia Parmense 84, I-29122 Piacenza, Italy.",silvia.platoni@unicatt.it,,,,,,,41,0,0,0,3,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,1614-0974,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,MAR,2017,73.0,1,,,,,42,76,,10.1628/001522116X1474450192144,0.0,,,35,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EQ1JY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397827300002,0

Exogenous administration of oxytocin has been shown to increase trust in humans. However, one may argue that, except the administration of oxytocin in nonhealthy patient groups (e.g., those with autism or anxiety disorders) to alleviate negative symptoms, external administration of oxytocin has little relevance in normal life. Music, a ubiquitous stimulus in human society, has been shown to increase oxytocin in medical therapy scenarios. Considering this evidence, we conducted a trust game experiment with a sample of healthy humans and investigated music's effects on the (a) trustor's oxytocin levels (blood sample measurement), (b) investment amount (trust behavior measurement), and (c) perception of the other player's trustworthiness (self-report). The results of our exploratory study show that an increase in oxytocin levels over 40 trials in a trust game increased perceived trustworthiness in the no-music condition but had no impact on investment amount (i.e., trust behavior). Moreover, music had no effect on oxytocin, trust behavior, or perceived trustworthiness. Thus, unlike prior research showing that music listening may increase self-reported trust in another individual, in the present study we found no effect of music on trust (on either a physiological or behavioral level). We surmise that this finding is a result of both the type of music played during task execution and music preferences. Thus, future research must carefully manipulate music features (e.g., pitch, rhythm, timbre, tempo, meter, contour, loudness, and spatial location) and consider a listener's music preferences to better understand music's effects on physiological, perceived, and behavioral trust.","[Riedl, Rene] Univ Appl Sci Upper Austria, Digital Business Management, Sch Management, Wehrgrabengasse 1-3, A-4400 Steyr, Austria; [Riedl, Rene] Univ Linz, Business Informat Informat Engn, Linz, Austria; [Javor, Andrija] Univ Linz, Kepler Univ Clin, Linz, Austria; [Gefen, David] Drexel Univ, Decis Sci & MIS, LeBow Coll Business, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Felten, Andrea; Reuter, Martin] Univ Bonn, Dept Psychol, Bonn, Germany; [Reuter, Martin] Univ Bonn, Ctr Econ & Neurosci, Bonn, Germany",Johannes Kepler University Linz; Kepler University Hospital; Johannes Kepler University Linz; Drexel University; University of Bonn; University of Bonn,"Riedl, R (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci Upper Austria, Digital Business Management, Sch Management, Wehrgrabengasse 1-3, A-4400 Steyr, Austria.",rene.riedl@fh-steyr.at,"Reuter, Martin/B-3456-2010; Campailla, Jasmin/AAK-2420-2021; , DaviD/JNS-4036-2023",,Linzer Hochschulfonds Grant [VII-508-2012/Ha],Linzer Hochschulfonds Grant,Special thanks for the constructive comments that were provided during the review process.

However, preexisting structural imbalances in the US economy were the reason why the burst of speculative bubbles induced a general economic collapse. This article argues that the imbalance created by the combination of stagnant labor earnings and surging corporate profits not only played a leading role in the run-up to the downturns but also was chiefly responsible for the slow recoveries. On the one hand, the relative stagnation of labor income represented a key factor behind rising income inequality and a potential drag on consumption which was temporarily alleviated by credit expansion; hence, the rising household debt levels eventually became unsustainable. On the other hand, rising corporate profits created an overhang of idle money, eager to lend itself to speculative ventures, which played a key role in fueling the stock market bubble of the 1920s and the housing bubble of the 2000s. The article further argues that despite various superficial and deeper similarities between the circumstances surrounding the Great Recession and the Great Depression, some fundamental differences in the structure of the US economy then and now suggest vastly different future prospects for American capitalism.","[Ivanova, Maria N.] Goldsmiths Univ London, Polit, London, England",University of London; Goldsmiths University London,"Ivanova, MN (通讯作者)，Goldsmiths Univ London, Polit, London, England.",m.ivanova@gold.ac.uk,,,,,,,83,11,11,1,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

The diagnostic pro-poor growth toolbox has so far focused on the income dimension as well as key non-income achievements in education and health. This article contributes to the literature by expanding the toolbox with several new measures that take into account the extraordinary importance of agricultural productivity for poverty reduction in developing countries. We distinguish between land productivity and labor productivity and find that the poor identified by low incomes, poor education outcomes, low land productivity and low labor productivity overlap only to a small degree, suggesting that analyses of pro-poor growth from these different perspectives are complementary. The toolbox is then applied to three comparable household surveys from Rwanda (EICV data for the years 1999-2001, 2005-06, and 2010-11), a country that has experienced impressive economic growth since the genocide in the mid-1990s and that has undertaken considerable efforts to increase agricultural productivity and improve the population's access to social services over the first decade of the 2000s. Our application shows that the enormous progress made in the income, education, and health dimension of well-being has been pro-poor according to most definitions of the concept. The new tools reveal that the land productivity-poor experienced pro-poor growth in the relative (and absolute) sense while the labor productivity-poor increased their labor productivity relatively (but not absolutely) faster than the labor productivity-rich even though the former dispose of considerably lower education levels.

Thus, the main reasons of the present study are at first, establishing a common understanding on the term quality and presenting the relationship between customer satisfaction and service quality. Secondly, the study summarizes the identified factors, which mostly influence the customer satisfaction, as well as the common methods used to measure service quality in relation to these factors. Thirdly, the authors introduce and explain the newly developed six step model for establishing an effective measurement method for service quality and the proposed three level service quality model with the related measurements and outcomes. Both models will assist business service providers to protect and improve their service quality and with that their customer satisfaction. The methodology used for this research is a systematic literature review focused on subjects of quality, customer satisfaction and best-practice metrics for service quality. In addition, surveys and studies from well-known research companies were evaluated.

We explore the extent to which height captures the effects of endowments set before entry in the labour market. Physical and cognitive skills, co-determined with stature early in life, do not explain much of the height earnings premium directly. Yet, human capital more broadly, including cognition, educational attainment and other factors related to childhood conditions, explains around half of the height premium and does so through occupational sorting. Indeed, taller workers tend to have more education, and educated workers tend to work in more lucrative occupations that require brain and social skills, not brawn. The unexplained share of the height earnings premium may reflect a specific role of stature on social interaction, labour market advantages or self-assurance. We also find a height premium in happiness, half of which simply accounts for the educational and earnings advantages of taller workers.","[Bargain, Olivier; Zeidan, Jinan] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, Marseille, France; [Bargain, Olivier; Zeidan, Jinan] EHESS, Marseille, France; [Bargain, Olivier] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Aix-Marseille Universite; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Bargain, O (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, Marseille, France.;Bargain, O (通讯作者)，EHESS, Marseille, France.;Bargain, O (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.",olivier.bargain@univ-amu.fr,"Bargain, Olivier/A-5972-2019",,,,,,62,10,12,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

The analysis relates to the Spanish market during 1997-2010, given that the Spanish market covers a very diverse range of listed companies. Some companies are comparable to companies listed on U.S. markets while others are smaller in size and have a lower trading volume and inferior quality of information. The methodology is based on a modification of the model proposed by Avramov, Chordia, and Goyal [2006]. The authors' proposal incorporates the change in the proportion of informed transactions, calculated with intraday data, into the volatility model. The results are also presented using a conditional volatility model in which the change in the proportion of informed transactions is incorporated. These results attest to the influence of informed trading as a price-stabilizing factor in heavily traded and highly capitalized stocks (familiar stocks). Informed trading leads to a marked decrease in volatility for these particular stocks both in periods of calm and crisis.","[Blasco, Natividad] Univ Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain; [Corredor, Pilar] Univ Publ Navarra, Pamplona, Spain",University of Zaragoza; Universidad Publica de Navarra,"Blasco, N (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Dept Accounting & Finance, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Gran Via 2, Zaragoza 50005, Spain.",nblasco@unizar.es,"Corredor, Pilar/G-7800-2015; Blasco, Natividad/K-5607-2017","Corredor, Pilar/0000-0003-1739-0095; Blasco, Natividad/0000-0001-5629-7526","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2012-35946-C02-01, ECO2016-77631-R AEI/FEDER, ECO2013-45568-R]; Government of Aragon/European Social Fund [S14/2]",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Government of Aragon/European Social Fund,"This article has received financial support from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (ECO2012-35946-C02-01, ECO2016-77631-R AEI/FEDER, UE, and ECO2013-45568-R), and from the Government of Aragon/European Social Fund (S14/2).",,78,2,2,5,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

This potentially impedes refinancing of senior mortgages because replacement mortgages are junior unless the existing junior lienholders consent to resubordination. We exploit legal variation across states to provide evidence that time priority reduces refinancing, especially of smaller mortgages (suggesting a significant fixed cost of obtaining resubordination) and of mortgages close to the conforming loan limit. On the contrary, we find evidence that time priority renders second mortgages more valuable to lenders, increasing the likelihood that a borrower obtains a second mortgage.","[Bond, Philip] Univ Washington, Foster Sch Business, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Elul, Ronel] Fed Reserve Bank Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Garyn-Tal, Sharon] Max Stern Yezreel Valley Coll, Jezreel Valley, Israel; [Musto, David K.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, 3620 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Philadelphia; University of Pennsylvania,"Musto, DK (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, 3620 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",musto@wharton.upenn.edu,"Bond, Philip/Q-3302-2019",,,,,,32,7,7,2,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

We show that agglomerations can provide favorable conditions for their development. The reason is that HGEs (and gazelles) often include those activities that are often present in agglomerations. Agglomerations, in our approach, may not only be large cities, but also smaller or medium-sized locally organized clusters of enterprises that create long-term development space for the realization of specific or heterogeneous products and services with a certain degree of technological, business, marketing or research interdependence. Examples of these specific quasi-urban agglomerations are, e.g., Silicon Valley or Medicon Valley. Supporting the development of such highly innovative agglomerations means space for development of HGEs, more dynamic transfer of knowledge and more efficient mechanisms of commercial use of inventions. The conditions for the emergence and development of HGEs and their cooperative-competitive linkages are formed by agglomeration's environment that assists in constantly improving ability of HGEs to identify market opportunities and commercially use new ideas, products, services and processes. The transformation of the economy is substantially enhanced by agglomerations that create and develop innovation-supporting assets and attractors. In addition, the effects of changes from interactions among different knowledge bases also contribute to all actors (stakeholders) in the agglomeration. Environmental technologies, internal security, business services, programming, biotechnology, nanotechnology and medicine are becoming examples of existing attractive areas where agglomerations can serve substantially. Agglomerations will have a more favorable position if they have interactions between different platforms and between different knowledge bases.","[Brzica, Danes] Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Econ Res, Sancova 56, Bratislava 81105, Slovakia",Slovak Academy of Sciences,"Brzica, D (通讯作者)，Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Econ Res, Sancova 56, Bratislava 81105, Slovakia.",danes.brzica@savba.sk,,,[VEGA 2/0086/15],,This work was supported by the research grant VEGA 2/0086/15.,,9,0,0,0,1,"TECHNICAL UNIV KOSICE, FAC ECONOMICS",KOSICE,"RAMPOVA 1731-7, KOSICE, DZUNGL A-DZUNGL A 040 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-553-2906-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,119,127,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO1YB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000503056700012,0

However, an in-depth analysis of the mechanism of payments to the concessionaire shows that the amount of availability risk transferred to the private sector was in practice almost negligible. As the transfer of risk is a key driver of efficiency, this finding raises questions about the performance and management of the contract and suspicions that the potential benefits of using PPP are not being accrued.

This demand is not only embodied in quantity, but also in the requirements for quality. As the forward position of talent training, colleges and universities play an irreplaceable role in it. The construction of the contingent of cadres in colleges and universities is the core issue of the whole construction of colleges and universities in the new historical period. Integrating the idea of the unity of knowledge and action into the construction of the contingent of cadres in colleges and universities is not merely the teaching requirement of university education under specific historical conditions, but the development trend of the construction of the contingent of cadres. The cause of higher education exerts a profound impact on the long-term development of any country. After years of development, China's cause of higher education has made remarkable achievements both in the quantity and quality of running schools. The development of China's higher educational cause is not only closely related to the hard work of the vast majority of educators, but inseparably associated with national policies. In the meanwhile, it has a direct relationship with our attention to the construction of the contingent of cadres in colleges and universities. It is a powerful organizational guarantee to promote the development of higher education in China by cultivating and shaping a contingent of cadres in colleges and universities that can stand the test, maintain a strong cohesion and combat effectiveness in any case and be able to adapt to the needs of practical work, is good at innovation in theory and full of vitality and determination in practice. Unify knowledge and action was first proposed by Wang Yangming, a famous thinker in China's Ming Dynasty. The core of the unity of knowledge and action is to guide practice with a scientific knowledge system, achieve the combination of knowledge and action, promote action with knowledge and practice knowledge with action, inspect and enrich knowledge in practice and constrain and regulate practice with knowledge. The knowledge practice view of the unity of knowledge and action has a particularly important guidance value for the construction of the contingent of cadres in colleges and universities.","[Chang, Lijuan] Xian Univ, Sch Marxism, Xian 710065, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Xi'an University,"Chang, LJ (通讯作者)，Xian Univ, Sch Marxism, Xian 710065, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,3,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-463-7,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,53.0,,,,,,386,391,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL5MW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000452213200077,0

It shows that demand shock, instead of supply shock, plays a dominant role in real exchange determination. Monetary policy has little effect but central bank intervention plays a role in keeping exchange rate persistence for RMB/ USD and Yen/USD. Risk premium shock is almost irrelevant to exchange rate dynamics for Yen/USD and GBP/USD. In the case of China, capital control plays a critical role in exchange rate determination. The results show that social welfare losses of China is the largest, suggesting that capital account liberalization would benefit the country in the long term. Therefore, the central bank of China should gradually open up the capital account, give up the fixed exchange rate or the managed floating exchange rate regime, and reduce central bank intervention to improve the effectiveness of monetary policy and social welfare.

Analyses reveal traditional and new forms of population mobility and migrant selectivity, including gendered forms of marriage migration and rural-urban moves driven by education.

Demographic pressure on nature means the development of anthropogenic factors, caused by an increase in population and, consequently, by increased production and growth of the agrosphere. Analysis of demographic pressure on nature includes the following procedures: forecasting the population growth; forecasting the necessary growth in production and the necessary growth of the agrosphere; prediction of anthropogenic pressure; analysis of the consequences of demographic pressure; analysis of the possibility of a stable and balanced development of the world economy in conditions of demographic pressure; technological, economic opportunities and the limits of production growth in conditions of demographic pressure; assessment of countries in terms of socio-demographic risk. The general principles and the scheme of the analysis and forecasting of demographic pressure are developed. The results of forecasting the growth of the population according to three scenarios - pessimistic, optimistic and average, are stated. Together with the growth of the population, humankind will face a need to increase production. The forecast of growth of consumption for one inhabitant of the USA up to 2050 is made. It is defined if it is necessary to increase manufacture in the world if the world consumption level will be like in the USA. For comparison, a realistic forecast for the growth of the total world domestic product was compiled. The article outlines the consequences of demographic pressure: social, economic and environmental. An estimation of countries in terms of convergence and divergence of indicators of social processes development in conditions of demographic pressure is shown.","[Didenko, N., I; Skripnuk, D.
