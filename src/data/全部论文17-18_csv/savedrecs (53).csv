In the meantime, business environment is experiencing ongoing transformation which involves socio-economic changes, traveller habit alterations and emergence of new business forms. For tourism operators and other traditional tourism and hospitality management organizations these are new challenges and they require prompt reaction to transform existing business models in order to maintain competitiveness. The purpose of this paper is to explore and identify peculiarities of the tourism operators in contemporary business environment. Results of the paper are based on quantitative research involving 118 respondents, representing tourism operators from different countries and of different size. Respondents have been question and results have been processed based on survey consisting of 45 questions, aiming to analyse present market situation, market transformation changes, the role of customer and supplier relations, as well the understanding and ability to interpret factors related to the tourism enterprise management. Based on acquired results, author identifies most substantial characteristics of contemporary business environment. They give several indications in relation to tourism operator perception and operation as well develops ideas regarding tourism product distribution, emphasizes the importance of employee social skills additionally to practical knowledge. Results confirm author's assumption that contemporary business environment is a substantial basis to state that the management of tourism operators is increasingly dependent on enterprise ability to respond ongoing international tourism market changes.","[Lingeberzins, Eriks] Turiba Univ, Fac Int Tourism, Riga, Latvia",,"Lingeberzins, E (通讯作者)，Turiba Univ, Fac Int Tourism, Riga, Latvia.",eriks.lingeberzins@inbox.lv,"Lingeberzins, Eriks/AAI-3496-2021","Lingeberzins, Eriks/0000-0002-2214-3876",,,,,30,0,0,0,7,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-47732-9; 978-3-319-47731-2,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,107,120,,10.1007/978-3-319-47732-9_7,0.0,,,14,"Business; Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BI3AM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000410645700007,0

An attenuated Science, Technology, EI-mode prevails internally, with R&D more pivotal than either embodied or disembodied non-R&D knowledge, depending on the EI strategy. Externally, synthetic knowledge matters more than the analytical one, suggesting instead a Doing, Using, Interacting El-mode. Hence, a dichotomic combination of the two modes emerges across the firm's boundaries. However, remarkable differences are in place, depending on whether EIs target efficiency or non-efficiency related environmental improvements.

Public procurement procedures function as auctions: requiring bidders to compete against each other making auctions to be price and time efficient. The theoretical argumentation behind successful auctioning, when compared to bilateral negotiation, is that bidders tend to pay more attention towards potential actions of their competitors and are less focused on the bilateral arrangement with actual buyer or seller. For that reason, auctions are efficient in obtaining goods or services whenever the bidder believes that competition is fierce. This effect is likely in auctions with competitive sealed bids, where information about the presence and the identity of others bidders is hidden until the end of the bidding process. Another expected advantage of auctions with sealed bids is constricting corruption i.e., sealed bids auctions are mode of choice for organizing public procurement in EU. In this research we present the result of an empirical study about the public procurement processes in Croatian local administrative units (LGUs). Online survey was conducted containing 29 questions that gathered response from 201 LGU. Statistical analysis is deployed for establishing patterns and reaching conclusions. We were unable to statistically confirm the influence of either LGU capacity or object of transaction/bidding on the efficiency of the public procurement process which led us to conclusion that the dominant impact on public procurement durations is made by its strict regulation.","[Mrak, Marija Kastelan; Vretenar, Nenad; Antonic, Jelena Jardas] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Mrak, MK (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka, Croatia.",kastelan@efri.hr; vretenar@efri.hr; jelena.jardas.antonic@efri.hr,"Kaštelan Mrak, Marija/AAG-7846-2022; Jardas Antonić, Jelena/S-2677-2018; Vretenar, Nenad/AAP-7064-2020; Kaštelan Mrak, Marija/AFL-7893-2022; Vretenar, Nenad/IUM-2028-2023","Kaštelan Mrak, Marija/0000-0001-8247-7467; Jardas Antonić, Jelena/0000-0001-6872-9293; Vretenar, Nenad/0000-0003-4689-0865; Kaštelan Mrak, Marija/0000-0001-8247-7467;",,,,,13,0,0,1,3,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,506,514,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500048,0

ELGON; BIODIVERSITY; STAKEHOLDERS; MANAGEMENT,"The approach to governance of protected areas has been in transition over last decades, partly driven by evolving policy discourses that shape the ways in which conservation is thought to be delivered. The most influential discourses are the fortress approach, community conservation and back-to-the-barriers How different discourses translate and are instituted on-ground are, however, complex and disputed. Inclusive policy strategies in relation to local involvement in developing countries are of particular concern. The study analyses how conservation policy discourses have become manifested, taking the case of Mount Elgon National Park (MENP), Uganda. It outlines main conservation policy discourses, analyses actor's interests and power relations and further examines how institutions for park governance have evolved and changed according to the different discourses. The results indicate that conservation discourses and donor support come and go, while MENP seems to outlast all. The worrying reality is that MENP administration, strongly influenced by the interplay of path-dependent institutional forces rooted in the fortress discourse, simply sticks to its guns - maintaining the application of law enforcement as key management instruments in its approach to governance, especially to local people interactions. There is an apparent gap between rhetoric and reality in protected area governance. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

While stated-preference valuation methods have been applied extensively to public goods valuation in individual countries, applications to global public goods with surveys in multiple countries are scarce due to complex and costly implementation. Benefit transfer is effectively infeasible when there are few existing studies valuing similar goods. The Delphi method, which relies on expert opinion, offers a third alternative. We explore this method for estimating the value of protecting the Amazon rainforest, by asking more than 200 environmental valuation experts from 37 countries on four continents to predict the outcome of a contingent valuation survey to elicit willingness-to-pay (WTP) for Amazon forest protection by their own countries' populations. The average annual per-household values of avoiding a 30% forest loss in the Amazon by 2050, assessed by experts, vary from a few dollars in low-income Asian countries, to a high near $100 in Canada, Germany and Norway. The elasticity with respect to average (PPP-adjusted) per-household incomes is close to unity. Results from the Delphi study match remarkably well those from a recent population stated-preference survey in Canada and the United States, using a similar valuation scenario.

It can be assumed that models predict the behavior of a healthy, well-functioning plant. Hence, the difference between model-predicted values and accurate measurements can serve as a criterion of the status of the crop. A mechanistic transpiration model that predicts actual crop transpiration from the measured climate in the greenhouse was implemented in the process control computers of commercial tomato greenhouses to demonstrate the possibilities of this idea. In the same process, actual transpiration was available as measured with a ProDrain weighing gutter. Occasionally, measured transpiration was lower than predicted, which may indicate suboptimal crop function. When the difference exceeded a threshold value for a certain period, the process computer generated an alarm in order to warn the grower. Lower measured than predicted transpiration is probably caused by partial closing of stomata. To have an indication of the impact of stomatal behavior on crop production, a photosynthesis model was also implemented, and photosynthesis rate was calculated for theoretical as well as actual stomatal resistance. This study demonstrates that simulation models, when implemented in a greenhouse process computer and combined with the appropriate measurements, can automatically alert the grower of potentially damaging conditions, e.g., reduced crop performance or a system malfunction in the greenhouse, can provide the grower insight into factors affecting crop function and, finally, can help the grower reduce mistakes, optimize crop growth, maximize yield and save energy.","[Tsafaras, I.; de Koning, A.

This situation can be seen in Argentina and Chile through the effects of biodiversity loss caused by the introduction and expansion of beavers in Southern Patagonia. This case is interesting because, despite the Beagle conflict (i.e., the border dispute) between these countries some decades ago, nowadays Argentina and Chile are facing shared environmental problems and both are actively seeking solutions. The main question in this paper is, how did Argentina and Chile search for a solution to shared environmental problems caused by the expansion of beavers in Southern Patagonia? This paper tackles this question and presents the results of the conducted qualitative research. The results indicate that, in order to understand what Argentina and Chile are doing to achieve a solution to their shared environmental problems, research cannot be exclusively focus on domestic affairs. Instead, this issue requires taking into account how international dimensions influenced domestic policies. As this paper argues, in Argentina and Chile, international cooperation is a method of influencing biodiversity governance through funds granted by international organizations and international expert recommendations.","[Lorenzo, Cristian; Martinez Pastur, Guillermo; Vanessa Lencinas, Maria] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Ctr Austral Invest Cient CADIC, Bernardo Houssay 200, RA-9410 Ushuaia, Argentina; [Lorenzo, Cristian] Univ Nacl Tierra Fuego UNTDF, Inst Ciencias Polares Ambiente & Recursos Nat ICP, Ushuaia, Argentina; [Kelly, Julian] Univ Nacl Tierra Fuego UNTDF, ICSE, Ushuaia, Argentina; [Estenssoro Saavedra, Fernando] Univ Santiago Chile, Inst Estudios Avanzados, Ushuaia, Argentina",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"Lorenzo, C (通讯作者)，Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Ctr Austral Invest Cient CADIC, Bernardo Houssay 200, RA-9410 Ushuaia, Argentina.;Lorenzo, C (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Tierra Fuego UNTDF, Inst Ciencias Polares Ambiente & Recursos Nat ICP, Ushuaia, Argentina.",clorenzo@conicet.gov.ar,"Martínez Pastur, Guillermo J./H-8188-2014; Lencinas, Maria Vanessa/K-6208-2019","Martínez Pastur, Guillermo J./0000-0003-2614-5403; Lencinas, Maria Vanessa/0000-0002-2123-3976; Estenssoro, Fernando/0000-0001-6010-7115; Lorenzo, Cristian/0000-0002-7990-5157",,,,,53,5,5,1,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

We examine an emerging alternative system, in which self-identifying clubs of users are allocated a share of a total allowable extraction, that they manage with considerable autonomy. When multiple clubs concurrently extract under different self-selected rules, users gravitate toward more profitable regulations in subsequent seasons, putting evolutionary pressure on less profitable systems. We show experimentally that strong individual property rights, and the efficiencies associated with them, emerge endogenously from this process. A taste for competition among some individuals limits realized efficiency, but not extensive adoption of individual rights. Thus, regulators need not directly implement strong individual rights to achieve their benefits; regulators may instead assign a collective property right and provide a self-governance pathway toward management that supports better outcomes.","[Wakamatsu, Mihoko] Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Urban & Environm Engn, Nishi Ku, 744 Motooka, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan; [Anderson, Christopher M.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, 1122 Boat St,Box 355020, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Kyushu University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Anderson, CM (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, 1122 Boat St,Box 355020, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",cmand@uw.edu,,"Wakamatsu, Mihoko/0000-0002-1340-8801",Policy Simulation Laboratory at the University of Rhode Island; Joint Japan/World Bank Graduate Scholarship Program (JJ/WBGSP),Policy Simulation Laboratory at the University of Rhode Island; Joint Japan/World Bank Graduate Scholarship Program (JJ/WBGSP),This work was funded by the Policy Simulation Laboratory at the University of Rhode Island.

Here, we introduce a new methodology for simulating crop-water production functions using process-based crop growth models, which captures explicitly the interacting effects of farmers' intraseasonal irrigation decision-making, stochastic weather conditions, and physical and socio-economic water supply constraints on seasonal crop yield response to water. Through a case study application for groundwater irrigated corn production in the Texas High Plains, we demonstrate that constraints to irrigation scheduling caused by aquifer depletion, combined with farmers' limited foresight of future weather conditions, have significant impacts on estimated seasonal crop-water production functions. Our results highlight that the failure to account for these factors fully in previous simulation approaches will lead to errors in estimates of the impacts of groundwater depletion on farmers' future resilience to drought and climate change. Our proposed simulation methodology is generalizable to different production systems or crop growth models, and provides a tool for assessing how economic benefits derived from irrigation vary spatially and temporally due to heterogeneity in biophysical conditions and irrigation practices.","[Foster, T.] Univ Manchester, Sch Mech Aerosp & Civil Engn, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Brozovic, N.] Univ Nebraska, Robert B Daugherty Water Food Global Inst, Lincoln, NE USA",University of Manchester; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Foster, T (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Mech Aerosp & Civil Engn, Manchester, Lancs, England.",timothy.foster@manchester.ac.uk,"Foster, Timothy/JRY-8775-2023","Foster, Timothy/0000-0001-9594-1556",,,,,94,41,46,5,61,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

We use a quasi-experimental study design to estimate changes in several income measures, as well as land cover using three waves (2003, 2007, and 2012) of household survey and remote sensing data. Overall, we find no significant impact of CMAs on any of our income measures. However, when disaggregating households by income quartile, we find that access to forest resources in RMNP may have had an income stabilizing effect for poor households. Forest income grew significantly faster among the poorest quartile of treatment relative to control households, partially because poor households recorded very low income from forests at baseline. The effect of CMAs on forest cover is minimal, although we find that conversion of woody savanna and savanna to cropland is more pronounced in villages with CMAs. These findings suggest that in the medium-term, CMAs have failed to deliver conservation or development benefits related to enhancing livelihoods or conserving forests near RMNP. Practitioners should consider different CMA models or other strategies for improving welfare and forest health outcomes in communities neighboring protected areas.","[Jagger, Pamela; Das, Ipsita] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Publ Policy, Abernathy Hall CB 3435, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Jagger, Pamela] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Carolina Populat Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Jagger, Pamela] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Curriculum Environm & Ecol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Sellers, Samuel] Univ Washington, Ctr Hlth & Global Environm, 4225 Roosevelt Way NE 100, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Kittner, Noah] Univ Calif Berkeley, Energy & Resources Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bush, Glenn K.] Woods Hole Res Ctr, 149 Woods Hole Rd, Falmouth, MA 02540 USA",University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Woodwell Climate Research Center,"Jagger, P (通讯作者)，Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Publ Policy, Abernathy Hall CB 3435, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",pjagger@unc.edu; sellers@uw.edu; nrkittner@berkeley.edu; ipsitad@live.unc.edu; gbush@whrc.org,"Das, Ipsita/T-3524-2019","Kittner, Noah/0000-0002-3449-7823; Jagger, Pamela/0000-0001-7148-432X","Center for International Forestry Research; Collective Action and Property Rights Initiative of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research; National Science Foundation [DDIG 0622392, 1159440]; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Social Science Research Council; Carolina Population Center; NIH/NICHD [P2C HD050424]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1159440] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Center for International Forestry Research; Collective Action and Property Rights Initiative of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Social Science Research Council; Carolina Population Center; NIH/NICHD(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","This project would not have been possible without the cooperation and advice of P.

To guide management intervention for sustainable development after natural disasters, scientists and policymakers need a better understanding of the linkages between livelihood changes after natural disasters and recovery outcomes. Despite the growing body of disaster research, systematic evaluation of the relationship between post-disaster changes in rural livelihoods and recovery outcomes is rare, largely due to the lack of relevant data. By taking advantage of the long-term data collection and research conducted in China's Wolong Nature Reserve (Wolong), we empirically evaluated livelihood changes after the catastrophic 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake and how those changes are linked to the recovery of human well-being. Our results show that households' livelihood portfolios in Wolong conspicuously changed after the earthquake and that human well-being had been recovering. However, we found most of these livelihood changes negatively affected, instead of facilitated, human well-being recovery. The enriched understanding of the linkages between post-disaster livelihood changes and recovery outcomes has important management implications for achieving Sustainable Development Goals amid natural disasters in Wolong and beyond.","[Yang, Hongbo; Dietz, Thomas; Liu, Jianguo] Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Ctr Syst Integrat & Sustainabil, E Lansing, MI 48823 USA; [Dietz, Thomas] Michigan State Univ, Dept Sociol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Dietz, Thomas] Michigan State Univ, Environm Sci & Policy Program, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Yang, Wu] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Environm & Resource Sci, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jindong] China West Normal Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Southwest China Wildlife Resources Conser, Nanchong 637009, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Michigan State University; Michigan State University; Michigan State University; Zhejiang University; China West Normal University,"Liu, JG (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Ctr Syst Integrat & Sustainabil, E Lansing, MI 48823 USA.",yanghon8@msu.edu; tdietz@msu.edu; wyang@zju.edu.cn; zhangjd224@163.com; liuji@msu.edu,"Yang, Wu/JPK-4460-2023; Liu, Jianguo/G-5211-2015; Yang, Hongbo/AAL-4818-2021","Yang, Wu/0000-0002-1682-3349; Liu, Jianguo/0000-0001-6344-0087; Yang, Hongbo/0000-0001-5935-6595; Dietz, Thomas/0000-0001-9399-0784",U.S. National Science Foundation [130313]; Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2016YFC0503404]; Michigan State University; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41571517],"U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Ministry of Science and Technology of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, China); Michigan State University; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","We thank Sue Nichols and the anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments on an early draft of this paper.

Product differentiation is along an environmental quality dimension and countries are asymmetric in average income. Analysing the equilibrium configuration, we find that, when relative preferences are relegated to the poorer country producing the brown good, the process of trade liberalization can favor the polluting firm, while penalizing the green rival. In these circumstances, trade liberalization can be environmentally detrimental. At the opposite, trade liberalization always favors the green producer when relative preferences are observed in both countries, with possibly positive effects on global emissions.","[Ceccantoni, Giulia] Univ Rome, MEMOTEF, La Sapienza Via Del Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy; [Tarola, Ornella] Univ Rome, DISSE, La Sapienza Piazzale Aldo Moro 5, I-00100 Rome, Italy; [Zanaj, Skerdilajda] Univ Luxembourg, CREA, 162A,Ave Faiencerie, L-1511 Luxembourg, Luxembourg",Sapienza University Rome; Sapienza University Rome; University of Luxembourg,"Zanaj, S (通讯作者)，Univ Luxembourg, CREA, 162A,Ave Faiencerie, L-1511 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.",giulia.ceccantoni@uniroma1.it; ornella.tarola@uniroma1.it; skerdilajda.zanaj@uni.lu,,"ZANAJ, Skerdilajda/0000-0001-6115-2583",,,,,64,7,7,1,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

This study deals with the hospital wage index (HWI) adjustment to Medicare hospital payments, an area-level adjustment intended to compensate hospitals in high-cost labor markets. Since the HWI adjustment is based on hospital-reported labor costs, some argue that it incentivizes hospitals in concentrated markets to pay higher wages to nurses and other workers (the circularity critique). We investigate this critique using market-level data on the relative wages reported by nurses and hospital-level data on the average hourly wage for healthcare workers. For identification, we exploit a 2005 change in the geographic area used to define labor markets, which resulted in exogenous changes in the ability of some hospitals to influence their area's wage index. We find that worker-reported relative nurse wages and hospital-reported healthcare worker wages are higher in some locations where hospitals experienced increased opportunities to game the circularity of the wage index, but these effects appear to be driven by pre-existing wage growth. Medicare's HWI adjustment method does not appear to suffer from inefficiency due to circularity.","[McHenry, Peter; Mellor, Jennifer] Coll William & Mary, Dept Econ, Tyler Hall Room 317,300 James Blair Dr, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA; [McHenry, Peter; Mellor, Jennifer] Coll William & Mary, Publ Policy Program, Tyler Hall Room 317,300 James Blair Dr, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA",William & Mary; William & Mary,"McHenry, P (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, Dept Econ, Tyler Hall Room 317,300 James Blair Dr, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA.;McHenry, P (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, Publ Policy Program, Tyler Hall Room 317,300 James Blair Dr, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA.",pmchenry@wm.edu; jmmell@wm.edu,,,,,,,45,2,2,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",2199-9023,2199-9031,,INT J HEALTH ECON MA,Int.

Consumers choose to change channels to avoid TV ads, click away from paid online video ads, or discard direct mail without reading advertised details. As technological advances give firms improved abilities to target individual consumers through various media, it is becoming increasingly important for models to reflect the endogenous nature of ad consumption and to consider the implications that ad choice has for firms' targeting strategies. With this motivation, we develop an empirical model of consumer demand for advertising in which demand for ads is jointly determined with demand for the advertised products. Building on Becker and Murphy (The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 108(4), 941-964 1993)'s ideas, the model treats advertising as a good over which consumers have utility and obtains demands as the outcome of a joint utility maximization problem. Leveraging new data that links household-level TV ad-viewing with product purchases, we provide empirical evidence that is consistent with the model: ad-skipping is found to be lower when a household has purchased more of the advertised brand, and purchases are higher when more ads have been watched recently, suggesting that advertising and product consumption are jointly determined. Fitting a structural model of joint demand to the data, we evaluate consumer welfare and advertiser profitability in advertising targeting counterfactuals motivated by an addressable future of TV. We find that targeting on the predicted ad-skip probability is an attractive strategy, as it indirectly selects consumers that value the product. Reflecting the positive view of advertising in the model, we also find that net consumer welfare may increase in several targeting scenarios. This occurs because under improved targeting, firms shift advertising to those who are likely to value it. At the same time, consumers that do not value the ads end up skipping them, mitigating possible welfare losses. Both forces are relevant to assessing advertising effects in a world with improved targeting and ad-skipping technology.","[Tuchman, Anna E.] Kellogg Sch Management, 2211 Campus Dr, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Nair, Harikesh S.; Gardete, Pedro M.] Stanford GSB, 655 Knight Way, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Northwestern University,"Tuchman, AE (通讯作者)，Kellogg Sch Management, 2211 Campus Dr, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",anna.tuchman@kellogg.northwestern.edu; harikesh.nair@stanford.edu; gardete@stanford.edu,"Nair, Harikesh S/A-3999-2012; Tuchman, Anna/IWU-5116-2023","Tuchman, Anna/0000-0003-1345-184X; Gardete, Pedro/0000-0002-2057-5552",,,,,52,23,26,3,57,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

This is heightened by the fact that the production of goods and services is becoming increasingly global with countries relying on each other through trade. As such, it is important to have a mechanism in place to understand the environmental burden shifts from one country to another. To this end, this paper exploits a paradox in global environmental analysis, which stems from a false decoupling between economic and production systems as observed in most developed nations, which results in improved territorial emissions of these developed countries at the expense of developing countries. Ecological unequal exchange is one such contemporary ecological economic concept that is used to highlight such asymmetric transfer of embodied natural resources and biophysical indicators between countries. Attempts at environmental impacts reduction efforts has largely focused on carbon emissions but given the complex supply chain created through globalisation and international trade, it is important to consider other important metrics such as land and water use alongside carbon emissions to drive environmental policies that will holistically address ecologically unequal exchanges. For developing countries in Africa where the dependence on land use and water use for agricultural activities are crucial to the development of national economies and in combating poverty, an assessment of these metrics has become even more paramount. Against this backdrop, the current work draws upon the theoretical constructs of multi-regional input-output (MRIO) framework to trace country specific sectorial-level flows of the aforementioned metrics between a representative developed nation, UK, and 27 African regions in order to fully examine their ecological exchanges. Key findings in the study suggest that for water consumption and land use, there is a net externalisation of these impacts for all the 27 African regions by the UK. It was also determined that the extent of the imbalance between the UK and the African region is exceedingly far greater for water consumption. It is recommended that in formulating a robust multi-national environmental policy where so many factors are at play, country specific and industry targeted approach to ecological unequal exchange between nations provides better and improved insight into addressing ensuing environmental issues.","[Oppon, Eunice; Ibn-Mohammed, Taofeeq; Koh, Lenny] Univ Sheffield, Ctr Energy Environm & Sustainabil, Sheffield S10 1FL, S Yorkshire, England; [Oppon, Eunice; Ibn-Mohammed, Taofeeq; Koh, Lenny] Univ Sheffield, Adv Resource Efficiency Ctr, Sheffield S10 1FL, S Yorkshire, England; [Acquaye, Adolf] Univ Kent, Kent Business Sch, Canterbury CT2 7PE, Kent, England",University of Sheffield; University of Sheffield; University of Kent,"Oppon, E (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Ctr Energy Environm & Sustainabil, Sheffield S10 1FL, S Yorkshire, England.",epoppon1@sheffield.ac.uk,"Oppon, Eunice/JOK-0459-2023; Ibn-Mohammed, Taofeeq/AAE-3181-2021","Ibn-Mohammed, Taofeeq/0000-0003-2454-0303; Acquaye, Adolf/0000-0003-0430-2498; Oppon, Eunice Pokuaa/0000-0002-5959-3221",,,,,71,18,18,4,56,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

This study explores whether and to what extent age-and-gender-specific labor force participation rates affect regional and global economies and associated emissions, using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. Assuming that labor supply is proportional to the population size will underestimate future economic growth and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in India, but overestimate economic growth and emissions substantially in the key aging regions of United States, European Union, Japan, Russia and China. Further, results show that participation of the elderly population in the labor market has the potential to considerably mitigate the negative impact of aging on the economy, although their effects differ across regions.","[Wei, Taoyuan; Glomsrod, Solveig] CICERO Ctr Int Climate Res, POB 1129, N-0318 Oslo, Norway; [Zhu, Qin] Fudan Univ, Sch Social Dev & Publ Policy, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Fudan University,"Zhu, Q (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Sch Social Dev & Publ Policy, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",taoyuan.wei@cicero.uio.no; zhuqin@fudan.edu.cn; solveig.glomsrod@cicero.uio.no,"Wei, Taoyuan/B-1788-2013","Wei, Taoyuan/0000-0002-6007-148X; Zhu, Qin/0000-0001-6337-0779","Research Council of Norway [209701, 244119]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71490735]; Shanghai Pujiang Program [16PJC019]; School of Social Development and Public Policy at Fudan University",Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Pujiang Program(Shanghai Pujiang Program); School of Social Development and Public Policy at Fudan University,"This study has been funded by the Research Council of Norway (Grant no 209701 and 244119).

In this paper, we explore how PES programs can be designed so as to maximize the amount of additional ecosystem services provided for a given budget. We also provide a brief summary of the use of auction mechanisms in real world PES programs. To explore the potential additionality of different PES program designs we use a conceptual agent based simulation model where payments are either fixed, or set through a uniform or discriminatory auction. The program can also be designed to target payments to land-owners based on their provision of ecosystem services. Theoretically, auctions should be the most effective design, especially if payments are differentiated and targeted by ecosystem service provision. However, what we find is that the context in which the PES program is implemented baseline compliance with program standards among the participants, correlation between opportunity costs and ecosystem services in the landscape, heterogeneity in costs and budget size has a determining impact on the relative effectiveness of the different payment designs, with fixed payments schemes being much more effective than auctions in certain settings. Our findings suggest that context should be taken into serious consideration when a PES program design is chosen.","[Lundberg, Liv; Persson, U.

Through a one-year quarterly income survey of 7978 households in 24 countries across Latin America, Asia, and Africa, we show that 39% of the sampled households, by extrapolation representing 150 million households in the Global South, 'harvest' wild meat. On average, wild meat makes up 2% of households' income of which own consumption accounts for 89%. Reliance on wild meat is highest among the poorest households and inversely related to their reliance on domestic animal income. Seasonally, reliance on wild meat is inversely related to other incomes, suggesting a gap filling function. The fact that hunting is of low economic importance but widespread and mostly for subsistence suggests that wild meat is important in rural households' diets. Through an approximated yield-effort curve estimation, we show that hunting appears economically sustainable in 78% of the observed communities although in most cases this might represent post-depletion sustainability.

Given the simultaneous (environmental -economic) risks of total uncertainty and systemic aftermath, several paradigmatic turns are required. Ecological economics is a cutting-edge field that tackles this issue. An integrative framework involving co-evolutionary modelling offers methods for addressing the regulation issue that arises from the significant uncertainty driven by global economic and ecological risks. We tackle the issue of adaptive policy for SESM regulation by answering the call for paradigmatic turns, which leads us to support tychastic vs. stochastic uncertainty, in time adaptation vs. optimal belated solutions, viability vs. stationary equilibrium, and interdisciplinarity and participatory processes in modelling and policy action. We describe step by step how to conceive SESM modelling through the lens of the mathematical viability theory (MVT), and we argue that this lens, when adjusted for anticipatory and adaptive governance (AAG), is relevant to examining sustainability for complex adaptive SESMs from a local or global perspective.","[Bates, Samuel] Univ Paris 09, PSL Res Univ, LEDa, Pl Marechal Lattre de Tassigny, F-75775 Paris 16, France; [Saint-Pierre, Patrick] LASTRE, Bordeaux, France",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine,"Bates, S (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 09, PSL Res Univ, LEDa, Pl Marechal Lattre de Tassigny, F-75775 Paris 16, France.",samuel.bates@dauphine.fr,,"BATES, Samuel/0000-0002-2059-8332",program Agrobiosphere (Gaia-Trop) by the French Government; ANR [ANR-12-AGRO-0009-05]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-12-AGRO-0009] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR),program Agrobiosphere (Gaia-Trop) by the French Government; ANR(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),This work has received support under the program Agrobiosphere (Gaia-Trop) launched by the French Government and implemented by ANR with the references ANR-12-AGRO-0009-05.,,89,9,9,3,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

The demographic trends of declining household size and dense urbanization therefore produce countervailing effects with respect to emissions. We posit that both household and urban economies are driven by proximity and realized through sharing carbon-intensive goods. With detailed data from the United States Consumer Expenditure Survey, we construct a dataset of CO2 emissions at the household level and leverage a unique measure of residential density to estimate household and urban economies. Our estimates show that dense urban areas have per capita emissions roughly 20% lower than rural areas, and that adding an additional member to a household reduces per capita emissions by about 6%. We also find that household economies are about twice as large in rural areas as in dense urban areas and develop an explanation for this phenomenon. In theory, the carbon benefits of dense urbanization have the potential to offset the effects of declining household size. However, using historical US Census data and extrapolating from our estimates, we find that lost household economies have outpaced increased urban economies over the past fifty years.","[Fremstad, Anders; Zahran, Sammy] Colorado State Univ, Econ Dept, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Underwood, Anthony] Dickinson Coll, Econ Dept, Carlisle, PA 17013 USA",Colorado State University; Dickinson College,"Underwood, A (通讯作者)，Dickinson Coll, Econ Dept, Carlisle, PA 17013 USA.",anders.fremstad@colostate.edu; underwoa@dickinson.edu; sammy.zahran@colostate.edu,,,,,,,57,62,68,8,88,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Our answer is based on the German official income and expenditure survey (EVS) of 2013, which allow us to disaggregate total household expenditures into 44 consumer good categories (COICOP) and their respective GHG intensities. Results show that the density effect of cities saves some greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Germany, but singularisation of households, higher Incomes and greater consumption opportunities in cities work in the opposite direction. Thus, smaller and larger municipalities are more or less on par with each other in terms of per capita emissions. Rural households are found to be more affected by environmental taxes which are imposed on direct rather than on indirect energy use in the course of German Energiewende policy reform. This is discussed in the article as a rural-urban social equity problem.","[Gill, Bernhard; Moeller, Simon] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Inst Sociol, Konradstr 6, D-80801 Munich 6, Germany",University of Munich,"Gill, B (通讯作者)，Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Inst Sociol, Konradstr 6, D-80801 Munich 6, Germany.",Bernhard.Gill@lmu.muenchen.de,,"Gill, Bernhard/0000-0001-8640-8557",German Ministry for Education and Research within sustainability research framework (FONA) [01UN1208A],German Ministry for Education and Research within sustainability research framework (FONA),"This article is part of the results of the research project Lokale Passung (http://www.lokale-passung.de/) which was supported by a grant from the German Ministry for Education and Research (01UN1208A) within its sustainability research framework (FONA).

This paper draws attention to two important elements that are not covered by this theory: uncertainty and relocation costs. It develops a theoretical model where agents face uncertainty, but may accumulate savings as a form of self-insurance. It shows that uncertainty pushes up relocation costs due to the option value of waiting, while self-insurance helps to reduce this lock-in problem. Moreover, the model suggests that the implicit price of environmental quality increases with uncertainty even if agents are risk-neutral.","[Mense, Andreas] FAU Erlangen Nurnberg, Chair Econ & Social Policy, Nurnberg, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Mense, A (通讯作者)，FAU Erlangen Nurnberg, Chair Econ & Social Policy, Nurnberg, Germany.",Andreas.Mense@fau.de,,"Mense, Andreas/0000-0002-5755-865X",,,,,27,5,4,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

Heavy reliance on fuelwood is associated with numerous negative externalities. Due to decades of rapid economic growth in China, we hypothesize that the increase in rural household income would reduce reliance on fuelwood. Using data from a survey of 481 households conducted in 2014, we examined the effects of two payments for ecosystem services programs, the Conversion of Cropland to Forest Program (CCFP) and the Ecological Welfare Forest Program (EWFP), on energy use, along with other factors. We found that the CCFP did not significantly affect fuel choice nor the quantity of fuelwood used, but households with more forestland in EWFP were less likely to adopt modern fuels and likely to use more fuelwood. Household per capita annual income was the main factor promoting adoption of modem fuels, while household size was the most important factor determining the quantity of fuelwood used per capita. Overall, the gradually increasing adoption of modern fuels has thus far not resulted in any significant abandonment of fuelwood. Fuelwood remains the dominant fuel across all income groups, suggesting that households in the study area are in the early stages of the energy transition.","[Song, Conghe; Bilsborrow, Richard; Zhang, Qi; Chen, Xiaodong] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Geog, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Jagger, Pamela] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Publ Policy Curriculum Environm & Ecol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Bilsborrow, Richard; Jagger, Pamela] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Carolina Populat Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Bilsborrow, Richard] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Geog & Curriculum Environm & Ecol, Dept Biostat, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Huang, Qingfeng] Anhui Agr Univ, Sch Forestry & Landscape Architecture, Hefei 230036, Anhui, Peoples R China",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; Anhui Agricultural University,"Song, CH (通讯作者)，Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Geog, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",csong@email.unc.edu,"Chen, Xiao/JBJ-7561-2023; chen, xin/IQW-3432-2023; chen, xia/GYR-3948-2022; chen, xia/GXM-5435-2022; chen, xi/GXH-3653-2022; Zhang, Qi/I-9741-2016; Song, Conghe/E-3087-2016","Chen, Xiao/0000-0002-9797-8384; Zhang, Qi/0000-0002-4242-7614; Song, Conghe/0000-0002-4099-4906; bilsborrow, richard/0000-0002-0053-7356",National Science Foundation [DEB-1313756]; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences [1313756] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),This study is supported by the National Science Foundation (Grant No. DEB-1313756) to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Given that they operate under high levels of government imposed regulatory constraints, it is imperative to study their efficiency levels. Given that capital is a relatively scarce resource in developing countries like India, it is important to obtain efficiency in the short-run where some inputs are fixed as well as over the long run, where all inputs are variable. The technique used for capturing efficiency is Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). A key possible limitation of DEA models based on physical inputs and outputs is that for an inefficient firm, reduction in some or all inputs may be recommended. It may often be desirable for an inefficient firm to increase some less expensive inputs while reducing the use of relatively expensive ones. Hence, when market price data is available, it is advisable to use the cost variant of DEA. Also, it is possible to determine variable cost efficiency in the short run when some inputs cannot be varied. Such inputs are referred to as quasi-fixed inputs. In this paper, we examine short and long term efficiencies of select bus companies in India known as State Transport Undertakings (STUs) over a period of 10 years. Fleet strength has been used as the quasi-fixed input. It is possible to ascertain, through a comparison of shadow price of the quasi-fixed input, vis-a-vis its market price, as to whether the quantity of this input is sub-optimally small or large. It is found that by adopting efficiency enhancing practices, STUs can cumulatively reduce their operating costs to the extent of 9123.35 million dollars. Also the tendency to minimize costs is found to be declining over time. In the short run some STUs are found to operate with a sub optimally low fleet size. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Its production often drives forest degradation and deforestation which have impacts on the local people that remain poorly understood. We present a novel methodology for analysing the contribution of woodland ecosystem services (ES) to rural wellbeing and poverty alleviation, which takes into account access mechanisms to ES, trade-offs between ES, and human response options. Using a participatory approach, a set of land use change scenarios were translated into a probabilistic model that integrates biophysical and social data. Our findings suggest that in highly forested areas woodland degradation does not have a critical impact on the local use of the three ES studied: charcoal, firewood and grass. Social factors show the largest impact on the quantity of charcoal produced, e.g. female headed households experience the greatest barriers to access charcoal production. Participating in forest associations and diversifying income activities lead to greater charcoal production. Results show that charcoal production increases some aspects of well-being (e.g. household assets), but does not decrease acute multidimensional poverty. Great efforts are required to reach a charcoal production system that alleviates poverty, improves environmental sustainability, and provides a reliable charcoal supply.","[Zorrilla-Miras, Pedro; Metzger, Marc J.; Vollmer, Frank; Woollen, Emily; Patenaude, Genevieve; Ryan, Casey M.; Paterson, James] Univ Edinburgh, Sch GeoSci, Drummond St,Geog Bldg, Edinburgh EH8 9XP, Midlothian, Scotland; [Mahamane, Mansour; Baumert, Sophia; Sitoe, Almeida A.; Ribeiro, Natasha Sofia] Univ Eduardo Mondlane, Fac Agron & Forest Engn, Maputo, Mozambique; [Nhantumbo, Isilda; Matediane, Maria Julieta] Int Inst Environm & Dev, London, England; [Luz, Ana Catarina] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Environm Changes CE3c, Lisbon, Portugal; [Grundy, Isla M.] Univ Zimbabwe, Dept Biol Sci, Harare, Zimbabwe",University of Edinburgh; Eduardo Mondlane University; Universidade de Lisboa; University of Zimbabwe,"Zorrilla-Miras, P (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Sch GeoSci, Drummond St,Geog Bldg, Edinburgh EH8 9XP, Midlothian, Scotland.",pedro.zorrilla-miras@ed.ac.uk,"Metzger, Marc/S-3976-2019; Sitoe, Almeida/AAL-8650-2020; Zorrilla-Miras, Pedro/AAA-1477-2019; Ryan, Casey/B-7967-2008; Patenaude, Genevieve/F-3115-2010","Metzger, Marc/0000-0002-5119-5894; Sitoe, Almeida/0000-0001-7583-2387; Zorrilla-Miras, Pedro/0000-0002-5019-1015; Ryan, Casey/0000-0002-1802-0128; Paterson, James/0000-0003-3264-8242; Vollmer, Frank/0000-0002-7135-5525; Woollen, Emily/0000-0002-6504-4835; Luz, Ana Catarina/0000-0003-3466-2929; Ribeiro, Natasha/0000-0002-5369-5905; Patenaude, Genevieve/0000-0001-7552-7470","Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation (ESPA) programme [NE/K010395/1]; Department for International Development (DFID); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC [NE/K010395/1, NE/I002952/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/I002952/1, NE/K010395/1] Funding Source: researchfish",Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation (ESPA) programme; Department for International Development (DFID); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This work (ACES project, NE/K010395/1) was funded with support from the Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation (ESPA) programme (funded by the Department for International Development (DFID), the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)).",,79,34,35,1,32,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Meanwhile, government intervention and consumer pressure are the external reasons to implement HFS. Findings also indicated that Malaysian food manufacturers are proactive in implementing HFS. Practical implications The knowledge from this research could encourage non-certified firms to implement HFS and entices halal-certified firms to remain certified. It guides managers toward adopting a better strategy, particularly in prioritizing the internal factors and resources for a more sustainable and positive implication. Originality/value This research is among the few studies that scrutinized the rationale behind the rapid growth of halal food industry. It argues that the pursuit of HFS is not solely a religious obligation, but it is also driven by safety, quality and marketing motives.","[Ab Talib, Mohamed Syazwan; Chin, Thoo Ai] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Management, Skudai, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Ab Talib, MS (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Management, Skudai, Malaysia.",mohamedsyazwan@utm.my; acthoo@utm.my,"Ab Talib, Mohamed Syazwan/U-8627-2018","Ab Talib, Mohamed Syazwan/0000-0001-8190-9096",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia Zamalah PhD Scholarship,Universiti Teknologi Malaysia Zamalah PhD Scholarship,This research was financially supported by the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia Zamalah PhD Scholarship.

Croatia and especially its eastern part has and still is witnessing a sizable emigration. Demographic literature identifies most of the emigrants to be in working age and significant amount of them leaving with children and their families, thus substantially affecting labour supply. The main purpose of this paper is to identify and explain profound effects of changes in labour supply due to high emigration rates on source economies, focusing on wages. There is insufficient number of empirical findings on wage effect in source countries to give general conclusions but majority of them show significant positive correlation between emigration and wage level in source country. Nevertheless, that positive correlation is reported to be a short-term effect. In case of severe and prolonged emigration, especially that of high skilled workers even the short term positive effect may well miss. In the analysis of emigration's effect on wages, it is crucial to distinguish the effect of education, skill, productivity or other variables that could potentially lead to wage rise in source country. Overall effect of emigration on economic growth and human capital formation is still not unambiguous and needs further empirical research, particularly in the countries of interest - EU13.","[Bogdan, Zeljko; Ivanda, Kresimir] Fac Econ & Business Zagreb, Trg JF Kennedya 6, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Bogdan, Z (通讯作者)，Fac Econ & Business Zagreb, Trg JF Kennedya 6, Zagreb, Croatia.",zbogdan@efzg.hr; kivanda@efzg.hr,,,,,,,20,2,2,0,8,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,234,241,,,,,,8,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900024,0

Concludes, the distribution of the relevance of the criteria as qualitative attributes points to the elements which designers need to focus on when designing a banking application. The key aspects include the necessity to maintain high quality of the application in terms of security, user-friendliness, i.e. the clarity and comprehensibility of the texts and a greater focus on navigating the application. The features included in the last criterion are related to the speed and ease of finding the information in the application. From the point of view of the users, these aspects are more important than the functionalities which are available in the application.

Hence, for ports it is necessary to understand the choice behavior of decision-makers in the maritime hinterland to remain competitive. Therefore, a discrete choice model is developed to investigate the preferences of shippers and forwarders for transport services in the maritime hinterland. Transport services are evaluated regarding transport costs, transit time, frequency and IT services by shippers and forwarders operating in South-West Germany. Unsurprisingly, the results reveal that costs, time and frequency are highly important for both decision-makers. However, IT services require a differentiated consideration. Shippers prefer tracking and tracing, whereas forwarders prefer no IT services and reject the introduction of an eMarketplace, which indicates the perceived threat to their business model.","[Elbert, Ralf; Scharf, Katrin] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany",Technical University of Darmstadt,"Elbert, R (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany.",elbert@log.tu-darmstadt.de; scharf@log.tu-darmstadt.de,,"Elbert, Ralf/0000-0002-9337-9173",,,,,12,1,1,0,5,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2194-8917,,978-3-319-74225-0; 978-3-319-74224-3,LECT NOTES LOGISTICS,,,2018,,,,,,,199,203,,10.1007/978-3-319-74225-0_28,0.0,,,5,Business; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BL3JG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000449752500028,0

Design/methodology/approach A mixed methods approach combined in-depth interviews with 22 box scheme customers with a quantitative survey of 416 consumers, analysed by means of principal component analysis and an ordered logit model. Findings Consumers of small local organic box schemes in England are both altruistically and hedonistically motivated. This includes a strong political motivation to change the current food system, as shown by the strong influence of an anti-globalisation factor and wanting to support small farmers. They perceive local organic food as a more environmentally sustainable alternative to the mainstream food system. The box schemes offer consumers a practical alternative by providing high quality products combined with convenience illustrating the importance of the latter also in local food shopping. This reinforces the possibility to successfully combining the attributes of local and organic. Research limitations/implications The study was conducted in only one country (England) with about 400 consumers of ten organic farmer-led box schemes. It was based on a self-selecting sample of consumers of such schemes, which included a large proportion of females and people with high level of education.

In order to ascertain the methods selected by such companies for IFRS implementation, I carried out my own research based on semi-structured interviews. The aim of this research was to determine the individual stages of implementation, which would be helpful for business anticipating IFRS implementation. Generalization of the individual interviews revealed that the process of IFRS implementation may be divided into four stages: project preparation, opening stage, trial operation and adaptation operation. The most important thing in the initial stage is to create a project plan. The opening stage contains preparation of the areas affected by the implementation and the changes in the information system; the output of this stage consists in draft statements or a financial statement. In the third stage, trial operation is launched and tested and errors are eliminated; the result is an opening balance sheet. The final stage of adaptation operation includes inspection, evaluation and corrections of possible errors. IAS/IFRS implementation is a multi-stage process, which is time-consuming and demanding in terms of qualified staff and funds.","[Honkova, Irena] Univ Pardubice, Pardubice, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Honková, I (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",irena.honkova@upce.cz,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,2,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",2464-6059,2464-6067,978-80-7435-700-8,HRADEC ECON DAYS,,,2018,8.0,,1,,,,319,327,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL2ZZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000449443500031,0

Makerspaces have gained traction in Ontario classrooms, particularly in the last two years. These spaces and their pedagogies facilitate the development of students' global competencies (Hughes, 2017; Somanath et al., 2016). We welcomed eleven teacher candidates (TCs) into our STEAM 3D Maker Lab as part of their internship course for professional development (PD) to provide them with pedagogical experience in a makerspace environment. Our research focused on exploring how the TCs developed a better understanding of maker pedagogies and the associated tools through this PD. As the internship was created and facilitated by an education graduate student in the lab, we extended the research to also investigate this student's development in identifying and understanding some of the best practices associated with making as learning.

This paper introduces a project with the overarching aim to develop and evaluate a new decision support system (DSS) to inventory and support decision-making for improved accessibility in multi-family housing in Sweden. The specific aim is to describe the initial app development phase and to investigate the design-team interactions and their impact on the outcome. The app will constitute the core part of the new DSS. This phase involved co-design to fit the practice context at target and meet users' needs and expectations. The co-design process served to identify user requirements to guide the development. Housing Enabler (an internationally acknowledged instrument for assessment and analysis of accessibility problems) was the methodological starting point. The prototype app enables professional inventory of environmental barriers and registration of subsequent work for accessibility improvements. A fully functional prototype of an app including an example apartment database is ready for usability studies and further iterative refinements.","[Jonsson, Oskar; Slaug, Bjorn; Schmidt, Steven M.; Iwarsson, Susanne] Lund Univ, Fac Med, Dept Hlth Sci, Box 157, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Martensson, Knut; Hansson, Adrian] MiThings, Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Jonsson, O (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Fac Med, Dept Hlth Sci, Box 157, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden.",oskar.jonsson@med.lu.se,"Jonsson, Oskar/AAO-2689-2020","Jonsson, Oskar/0000-0002-6492-8102; Slaug, Bjorn/0000-0001-7386-2224",Swedish Research Council for Sustainable Development (FORMAS); hub for innovation and commercialization (LU innovation); Tech Transfer Office at Lund University (LU innovation),Swedish Research Council for Sustainable Development (FORMAS)(Swedish Research Council Formas); hub for innovation and commercialization (LU innovation); Tech Transfer Office at Lund University (LU innovation),"The project was funded by the Swedish Research Council for Sustainable Development (FORMAS) and the hub for innovation and commercialization and the Tech Transfer Office at Lund University (LU innovation).

The paper found that the most low-paid sectors in the country's economy are the following sectors: agriculture, education, health and services. Forced saving on wages was a tool for restraining prices for rising food costs on the one hand, as well as inadequate opportunities for preserving products until the spring, on the other hand, lead to the fact that processors of agricultural raw materials have an excellent opportunity to extract huge profits to their advantage throughout long period of time.

Design/methodology/approach Milk coagulum rings were prepared from milk coagulum. Milk at four different level of milk fat (0.1, 1.5, 3 and 4.5 percent) were used to obtain milk coagulum of four different fat level for preparing milk coagulum rings. Unripe banana powder (UPB) and banana peel powder (BPP) were incorporated at three different levels separately. The incorporation levels were also optimized to be 11 percent for UPB and 6 percent for BPP on the basis of sensory evaluation. Findings The yield, ash, moisture and total dietary fiber content of products with optimized level of UPB and BPP were significantly higher as compared to control while the protein and fat contents were lower. Incorporation of extenders resulted in a significant reduction in the color value of the treated products. The water activity was highest for T-2 and lowest for control at the end of 42 days. TBARS as lipid oxidation parameter was highest for control and the microbial count was comparable in T-1 and T-2 where as it was higher in control. The sensory scores of the control was higher than the two treated products during the entire storage period.

Design/methodology/approach - Changes in moisture content, acid value, peroxide value, thiobarbituric acid value, total volatile basic nitrogen content, and the sensory score of frozen pork patties with 10 and 15 percent fat contents during storage at -5, -15, and -23 degrees C for six months. Findings - Although microbiological quality remained unchanged, moisture content decreased, and lipid rancidity and protein putrefaction increased significantly during storage. More rapid deterioration in quality was observed in patties stored at -5 degrees C than those stored at lower temperatures. Lipid rancidity and protein putrefaction increased more rapidly (but not significantly) in patties with 15 percent fat than those with 10 percent fat. Overall acceptance of the sensory properties was closely correlated with the above quality indicators, except thiobarbituric acid value. Acceptable qualities of the samples were maintained for the first two, four, and six months under storage at -5, -15, and -23 degrees C, respectively. Practical implications - The current shelf life of frozen pork patties set by manufacturers, assuming a storage temperature of -18 degrees C, needs to be readjusted considering practical storage temperatures. Originality/value - No studies have comprehensively explored the effects of fat content and storage temperatures on the quality of ground meat products during frozen storage. These approaches to determine quality changes may be useful for manufacturers to predict and control the quality of their products.","[Lee, Hyeoung-Su] Korea Agrofisheries & Food Trade Corp, Dept Qual & Safety Management, Seongnam, South Korea; [Bae, Dong-Ho] Konkuk Univ, Dept Food Sci & Biotechnol Anim Resources, Seoul, South Korea",Konkuk University,"Bae, DH (通讯作者)，Konkuk Univ, Dept Food Sci & Biotechnol Anim Resources, Seoul, South Korea.",donghoya@konkuk.ac.kr,"Bae, Dong Ho/D-2954-2011",,,,,,57,1,2,0,35,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

So, both the income and consumption expenditure are used to measure the overall conditioning of the households. Here the question arises weather consumer behaviour is determined more by income or expenditure. Some policy makers and economists believe that poverty can't be displayed by current income and it is not a stable measure to provide an exact description of individuals well-being (Meyer and Sullivan in The American Economic Review, 2221-2241, 2008). Consumption expenditure is not determined by consumers current income, but the measures of consumers permanent income are representative by his/her ability to earn income over a longer time period and also Expectations of future earnings and wealth (Friedman in A theory of the consumption function: A study by the National Bureau of Economic Research. Princeton University Press 1957). and the income which Friedman talks about is the annual incomes of consumers expect to earn over the years. It has been observed that income and expenditure didn't remain similar among households. Income is concerned as a good indicator of well-being for various reasons which are Housing, Food, Child care, Health care and other necessities. In low income households there is a possibility of consumption without expenditure and earnings. Income and expenditure are the two key fundamentals by which people make the best efforts to live a good life. Everyone wants to have a handsome income to live in a comfortable way. This study examines the income and expenditure pattern of slums dwellers and their financial requirements among the key financial services (i.e. savings, credit, insurance, micro-leasing and pension schemes) of Lucknow city, Findings suggest that poor people can and do save, particularly when institutional barriers to saving are cut off. Institutional polices should target poor people on the bases of poverty so that poor can get an opportunity to promote their poverty into more sustainable and inclusive wealth endorsement policies that will assist them to create own pathways out of poverty.","[Malik, Firdous Ahmad; Yadav, D.

Division by median was used for the kind of standardization. Four groups of regions are identified by means of cluster analysis: sensitive, adaptive, robust and outliers. Then the first selection of significant explaining variables is performed by means of parametric (Student t) and nonparametric (Mann-Whitney U) tests for the two expected values. The final list of important and independent factors is obtained through the stepwise multivariate logistic regression. The final goal is to find some spheres of smart development having the highest influence on robustness against economic crisis improvement. ROC curves with AUC measures prove models identifying robust regions, and separately vulnerable to crisis regions, to be fairly good.","[Markowska, Malgorzata] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Markowska, M (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Wroclaw, Poland.",malgorzata.markowska@ue.wroc.pl,"Oleh, Matviyenko/AHI-3630-2022","Oleh, Matviyenko/0000-0003-2469-3772; Markowska, Malgorzata/0000-0003-4879-0112",National Science Centre [2015/17/B/HS4/01021],"National Science Centre(National Science Centre, Poland)","The study carried out within the framework of the project no. 2015/17/B/HS4/01021, entitled Smart growth vs. sectoral transformations in the European regional space -measurement methods, financed by the National Science Centre.",,17,0,0,0,2,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",2464-6059,2464-6067,978-80-7435-701-5,HRADEC ECON DAYS,,,2018,8.0,,2,,,,19,30,,,,,,12,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL3AA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000449443600002,0

The final projects developed by the students were based on the demands presented by SORRI BAURU's rehabilitation team, and results reveal that the theoretical-practical approach based on interdisciplinarity was shown to provide the design students a learning experience that, ultimately, supports the quality decision-making in the design process.

We integrated remotely-sensed forest cover images, georeferenced landscape information, field-level forest inventories and face-to-face landowner surveys to quantify avoided deforestation and degradation within the context of Ecuador's Socio Bosque Program (PSB). We found the PSB prevented 9% of enrolled forest area in Ecuador's Amazon Basin from being deforested over the 2008-2014 period. This value is higher than previous assessments conducted in other Latin American nations. Inventory data suggest that forests within PSB-enrolled areas exhibited less evidence of degradation although statistical differences were only marginally significant On average, PSB-enrolled forests had between one and two more tree species per hectare than non-enrolled forests. These additional tree species'were twice as likely to be of commercial timber value and at greater threat of extinction. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this paper is to understand the lived experience of food in the context of poverty amongst Pakistani and white British women in Bradford, including perspectives on food aid. Design/methodology/approach A total of 16 Pakistani and white British women, recruited through community initiatives, participated in three focus groups (one interview was also held as a consequence of recruitment difficulties). Each group met for two hours aided by a moderator and professional interpreter. The transcripts were analysed thematically using a three-stage process. Findings Women in low-income households employed dual strategies to reconcile caring responsibilities and financial obligations: the first sought to make ends meet within household income; the second looked to outside sources of support. There was a reported near absence of food insecurity amongst Pakistani women which could be attributed to support from social/familial networks, resource management within the household, and cultural and religious frameworks. A minority of participants and no Pakistani respondents accessed charitable food aid. There were three reasons for the non-use of food aid: it was not required because of resource management strategies within the household and assistance from familial/social networks; it was avoided out of shame; and knowledge about its existence was poor. Originality/value This case study is the first examination of varying experiences of food insecurity amongst UK white British and Pakistani women. Whilst the sample size is small, it presents new evidence on perceptions of food insecurity amongst Pakistani households and on why households of varying ethnicities do not use food aid.","[Power, Maddy; Doherty, Bob; Pickett, Kate E.] Univ York, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Small, Neil] Univ Bradford, Bradford, W Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK; University of Bradford,"Power, M (通讯作者)，Univ York, York, N Yorkshire, England.",madeleine.power@york.ac.uk; n.a.small@bradford.ac.uk; bob.doherty@york.ac.uk; kate.pickett@york.ac.uk,"Baldissera, Annalisa/AHD-6334-2022","Power, Maddy/0000-0002-9571-1782; Pickett, Kate/0000-0002-8066-8507","NIHR Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care Yorkshire and Humber (NIHR CLAHRC YH) [IS-CLA-0113-10020]; IKnowFood Research Programme at the University of York; BBSRC; ESRC; NERC; Scottish Government; BBSRC [BB/N02060X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; MRC [MR/N024397/1, G0601005] Funding Source: UKRI; National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR) [IS-CLA-0113-10020] Funding Source: National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)",NIHR Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care Yorkshire and Humber (NIHR CLAHRC YH); IKnowFood Research Programme at the University of York; BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Scottish Government; BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR),"One of the authors of this paper (MP) was supported by the NIHR Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care Yorkshire and Humber (NIHR CLAHRC YH) (Grant number IS-CLA-0113-10020).

Chinese economy is also, at least partially, a market economy which transformed from planned economy.

Several economic studies show indeed that the personal income taxes currently in force in Europe no longer properly address the taxpayers' ability to pay as only few incomes' categories are actually subject to progressive taxation, meaning that the personal income taxes are no more shaped as comprehensive income taxes. Moreover, the development of these tax systems has led to very complex tax rules for the taxpayers to comply with - this characteristic, combined with high marginal tax rates often deemed confiscatory and with the lack of protection of the minimum of subsistence, has encouraged tax evasion phenomena. In order to address the before mentioned weaknesses of the progressive taxation systems, some proposed to turn to a flat taxation design. Being already adopted in more than 60 countries all around the world as of the Fifties, this model is awarded as the one able to solve most of the problems at stake, notably to remarkably simplify personal income taxation, enhance compliance, and to certain extent - increase the tax yield. In this paper I'll analyse pros and cons of the flat tax system, taking into account those countries which have already experienced the adoption of this model, with a particular focus on the current Italian political proposal to turn the progressive personal income tax rate structure to a flat one, combined with personal deductions to respect the principle of progressivity held at art. 53 It.

Therefore, a discrete-event simulation of an automotive SC evaluates the usage of quality data. Different scenarios of control mechanisms are developed in three test cases characterized by different quality failure probabilities. For each of the test cases, the effect on stocks is described. The investigations show the positive effect of using real-time quality data to reduce stocks. The most positive effect is related to methods like special transports, but their cost-intensive structure has to be optimized. In conclusion, sensor-based quality data can face the rising volatility.

The research is based on models the authors created for each sector in 2015 and identifies the explanatory power of these models from 2012 to 2014 based on samples of the respective companies. Thanks to the VCM model being developed and tested along with the EVA indicator, the results of the model from other years under review are equally compared with the EVA results. It turns out that the model is stable in the food industry, i.e. it achieves comparable results in the years 2012 - 2014 as in 2015, while in the engineering sector it was necessary to modify the model significantly (similarly in transport). It turns out that it is appropriate to specialize complex indices capable of evaluating the performance of companies not only by industry, i.e. the indices are not universal but also in time, that the indices need not be stable (static), but may need to be dynamized.","[Suchanek, Petr; Sterba, Martin] Masaryk Univ, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Suchánek, P (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Brno, Czech Republic.",suchy@econ.muni.cz; martin.sterba@mail.muni.cz,"Suchanek, Petr/R-9626-2019","Suchanek, Petr/0000-0002-2606-4040",,,,,13,1,1,0,0,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",2464-6059,2464-6067,978-80-7435-701-5,HRADEC ECON DAYS,,,2018,8.0,,2,,,,333,345,,,,,,13,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL3AA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000449443600033,0

Findings The results indicate that the original nine-factor model is only partially applicable to Hungary. This study successfully managed to distinguish the following factors: health and natural content, mood, preparation convenience, price and purchase convenience, sensory appeal, familiarity, and ethical concern. The FCQ scales proved to be suitable for the description of clusters based on specific food choices and demographic characteristics. By using the factors, the following five clusters were identified: modern food enthusiast, tradition-oriented, optimizer, easy-choice and un-concerned, all of which could be addressed by public health policy with individually tailored messages.

Design/methodology/approach Different brands and batches of commercially available retail UHT milk packages were bought from different supermarkets, during different seasons and tested for the presence of B. sporothermodurans. Sterile UHT milk was spiked with B. sporothermodurans vegetative cells and incubated at 37 degrees C for up to 172 hours. Total plate counts, pH, spore counts, UHT milk proteolysis and the headspace volatiles dynamics were analysed at different intervals. Findings The contamination of retail UHT milk packages by B. sporothermodurans was found to be prevalent. The growth of B. sporothermodurans in spiked UHT milk reached a maximum of 1.9x105cfu/ml; however, the significant proteolytic activity in UHT milk due to B. sporothermodurans only occurred long after the exponential growth phase had been attained. Furthermore, the growth of B. sporothermodurans in UHT milk did not lead to significant changes in the headspace volatile profiles of spiked UHT milk samples. Proteolytic activity in retail UHT milk packages, contaminated with B. sporothermodurans, was significantly higher when the use-by dates were reached. Practical implications Significant proteolysis in UHT milk means the assurance of high-quality UHT milk with extended storage stability for up to 10-12 months is compromised. Proteolysis of casein may lead to rapid sedimentation in UHT milk compared to UHT milk without sedimentation. Originality/value This paper is of interest to manufacturers because it raises the awareness that UHT milk containing B. sporothermodurans may not have the same storage stability when compared those without B. sporothermodurans. The presence of B. sporothermodurans in commercial UHT milk packages may lead to international and national trade restrictions for manufacturers.","[Tabit, Frederick Tawi] Univ South Africa, Dept Life & Consumer Sci, Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa,"Tabit, FT (通讯作者)，Univ South Africa, Dept Life & Consumer Sci, Pretoria, South Africa.",tabitft@unisa.ac.za,"Tabit, Frederick Tawi/AGK-2529-2022","Tabit, Frederick Tawi/0000-0001-8004-8415",,,,,23,3,4,1,18,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The idea that internal resources (tangible, intangible, and human) have become more significant than the industrial structure in gaining and keeping competitive advantage of a company has had its full affirmation since the 1990s onwards. This has been prompted by ever growing complexity and hyper changeability of the environment, which have limited the possibility for successful strategic positioning and making advantages based on the usage of unique positions in the industrial and macro environment. That is why in this paper particular attention is given to the analysis of the commitment of BiH companies to base their competitiveness and strategic operations on their own internal potentials. The paper presents the results of the empirical research that included 100 companies in BiH surveyed by means of a questionnaire with the content created in line with the research goals. The research results indicate that BiH companies build their competitiveness, to a significant degree, on human and intangible resources, which is in accordance with the recent tendencies of gaining and keeping competitive advantage under the contemporary business conditions. However, the research results imply that when compared to other companies that offer similar products and/or services, the companies surveyed do not have the strategic orientation, which can significantly reduce their success on the market. Hence the paper provides specific guidelines that might serve as a significant input to the management of BiH companies in generating their solutions for the improvement of their competitiveness.","[Umihanic, Bahrija; Delic, Adisa] Univ Tuzla, Fac Econ, Univ Ska 8, Tuzla 75000, Bosnia & Herceg; [Mahmutovic, Isada] Elektroremont Dd, Patriotske Lige 16, Banovici 75290, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Tuzla,"Umihanic, B (通讯作者)，Univ Tuzla, Fac Econ, Univ Ska 8, Tuzla 75000, Bosnia & Herceg.",bahrija.umihanic@untz.ba; adisa.delic@untz.ba; mahmutovic.isada@hotmail.com,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,0,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,619,626,,,,,,8,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900064,0

Virtual services offer new examples of ICT support to business and form an important and fast-growing part of service market which, in turn, is a part of labour market. We claim that each market beside its demand and supply has its own organizer who sets, often informally, rules for its demand-supply game. These three market actors (people, institutions, firms, etc.) are connected by formal and/or informal relations what can be pictured as a triangle, called the market triple. For each virtual service the rules of the demand-supply game are strictly formalized and presented by the organizer as its application (computer program) which matches virtually, through an internet platform, the demand for a given service with the supply equalizing it. We study economic aspects of that matching, including a division of responsibility for the demand-supply game among the three market actors. By an example of Uber, we introduce a concept of the organizer and study its role on the Uber's market. We show that each virtual service beside its market has its own market triple which indicates who of the three actors does the matching. For instance, it is the supply side in the case of Uber, but the demand side in the case of Airbnb, while the organizer matches demand and supply on the Forex market. In conclusion, we discuss a contribution of virtual services to a development of the on-demand economy, and demonstrate how our methodology can be used in debates on the Uberisation of contemporary economy.","[Walukiewicz, Stanislaw] Bialystok Tech Univ, Fac Engn Management, Bialystok, Poland",Bialystok University of Technology,"Walukiewicz, S (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Fac Engn Management, Bialystok, Poland.",s.walukiewicz@pb.edu.pl,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,434,448,,,,,,15,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540733700048,0

Farmers' markets, as examples of direct to consumer channels and shorter supply chains, are studied in the framework of game theory in both uncapacitated and capacitated versions.

Several recent studies demonstrate that consumers prefer ecolabeled wild seafood over unlabeled seafood. In addition, there is increasing evidence of a preference for wild fish relative to farmed fish, despite the rapid increase of aquaculture production. Recently, ecolabels have also been introduced for farmed fish. An interesting question is whether the preference for wild fish is primarily related to the perceived lack of environmental sustainability in aquaculture, or whether it is a perceived quality difference. In this paper, a choice experiment is used to investigate these issues in Germany for salmon using the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) ecolabel for farmed salmon and the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) ecolabel for wild salmon. Using a mixed logit model, the random parameter specification indicates substantial variation in consumer preferences beyond demographic variables. With respect to, the main question, the ASC ecolabel not only makes up for the negative association of farmed salmon, but gives a similar price for the ASC labeled salmon as for MSC labeled wild salmon. This is an indication that environmental concerns and not quality differences are the major issue in segmenting the market between farmed and wild fish. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

To improve incentives to join an international climate agreement (ICA), the Nash bargaining solution can be used to distribute cooperative gains across signatories. In this paper, we examine how the formation of ICAs and their mitigation efficiency are impacted by the use of the Nash bargaining solution. In a Nash bargaining game with heterogeneous players, bargaining powers are unequal and may be driven by different characteristics of the players. We employ different sets of asymmetric bargaining weights in order to examine the effectiveness of climate coalitions that emerge as stable agreements. Using the Nash bargaining solution, we obtain results from the stability of coalition model (STACO). We find that the Nash bargaining solution can improve the participation incentives and performances of ICAs as compared to agreements that do not redistribute gains from cooperation, but its capacity to overcome free-riding incentives is limited. However, if Nash bargaining accounts for outside options of players, we find larger stable coalitions and higher global abatement levels. In fact, Nash bargaining with outside options can stabilise the largest coalitions that can possibly be stable in our game.","[Yu, S.; van Ierland, E.

By far the largest market benefit is $75 billion ($46-$95 billion) in consumer surplus from lower natural gas prices to residential, commercial, and industrial consumers. There are also environmental benefits resulting from the switch by some electric utilities from coal to natural gas ($13.25 billion, range $3.9-$21.9 billion). However, there are also substantial environmental costs associated with hydraulic fracturing. These are dominated by $27.2 billion ($12.5-$41.95 billion) health damages from air pollution. Costs also include $3.8 billion ($1.15-$5.89 billion) in greenhouse gas emissions, $4 billion ($3.5-$4.45 billion) in wildlife habitat fragmentation, and $1 billion ($0.5-$1.6 billion) in pollution of private drinking water wells. Opportunity costs of water usage and property value losses are less than one-quarter of a billion dollars. The market and non-market benefits of hydraulic fracking are widespread geographically but many of the non-market costs are concentrated in the areas of drilling, creating a distributional disconnect that we believe drives much of the controversy over hydraulic fracturing.

Although the mobility of apprentices was high and contracts were uncertain, no complaints arose from masters or guilds. Wages paid to these apprentices demonstrate that their labour made a gradually increasing contribution to the workshop from the start of their term. This enticed masters to take on apprentices and removed the need for contract enforcement. After the guilds were abolished, the number of apprenticed orphans in the crafts grew, suggesting that guilds previously hampered access to training. Additional data collected for regular (non-orphan) apprentices corroborates these findings.","[Schalk, Ruben] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Schalk, R (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands.",,,"Schalk, Ruben/0000-0003-1991-5289",,,,,98,10,12,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Concerns are often raised about negative impacts on local communities, including impacts on property values. Some of these negative impacts may be offset by compensatory payments made by wind developers. Community involvement in the planning and development process may also reduce negative perceptions associated with wind facilities. However, if the development is near a border between municipalities, states, or even countries, it is often the case that one or more jurisdictions will not be involved in the process or receive compensation, but will, nonetheless, face some costs or impacts from the development. We explore exactly this situation at the border between Canada and the United States in the Thousand Islands region where a wind farm is currently operating on the Canadian border island of Wolfe Island. Using a parcel-level hedonic analysis of property sales transactions, we find that properties in New York with a view of and/or in close proximity to the turbines significantly depreciated in value after construction of the turbines while no negative impacts were observed on properties in Ontario. We highlight a number of factors that could contribute to these differences in impacts on property values, which may also explain the variation in results that currently exists in the literature.

However, an overview taking stock of the peer-refereed degrowth literature is yet missing. Here, we review 91 articles that were published between 2006 and 2015. We find that the academic degrowth discourse occupies a small but expanding niche at the intersection of social and applied environmental sciences. The discourse is shaped by authors from high-income, mainly Mediterranean, countries. Until 2012, articles largely constitute conceptual essays endorsed by normative claims. More recently, degrowth has branched out into modelling, empirical assessments, and the study of concrete implementations. Authors tend to agree in that economic growth cannot be sustained ad infinitum on a resource constraint planet and that degrowth requires far reaching societal change. Whether degrowth should be considered as a collectively consented choice or an environmentally-imposed inevitability constitutes a major debate among degrowth thinkers. We argue that the academic discourse could benefit from rigid hypotheses testing through input-output modelling, material flow analysis, life-cycle assessments, or social surveys. By analyzing the potentials for non-market value creation and identifying concrete well-being benefits, the degrowth discourse could receive wider public support and contribute to a paradigmatic change in the social sciences.

However, NPIs have adverse impacts on the environment. But what do we know about the impact of technological green NPIs on firm profitability? Can technological green products help limit or off-set the negative impact of NPIs on the environment? Accelerating the number of NPIs imposes additional costs for firms as well as environmental costs, particularly with greater resource depletion and waste generation. A well-supported solution to reconcile the economic-environmental preservation imperative is to create incentives for firms to use green technologies to offset the negative impact of new products on the environment Using data on 1020 technological green products which were introduced between 2007 and 2012 by 79 global firms, we investigate whether there are any win win situations in terms of financial advantages for firms, while reducing the adverse impacts of NPIs on the environment. The results show that the relationship between technological green NPIs and firm profitability is positive.

The main objective of the paper is to analyse a specific house-pricing mechanism which reflects the utility of being Green Offline, i.e. having access to green areas, versus the utility derived from the ability to be Green Online. The focus will be on data from European Union countries, and in particular Germany. Our results show that on an aggregate level for the EU there appears to be a clear indication for an irrational house-pricing mechanism, ignoring the negative trade-off effect from Green Online and Green Offline public investments (goods and assets). Meanwhile, on an individual level, for the case of Germany, more detailed bounded rationality effects of fashion-driven supply on house pricing are observed, positively related to Green Online values but negatively related to high Green Offline preferences. In conclusion, we find that house prices throughout Europe do not reflect a rational social change in green preferences, but tend to irrationally overprice Green Online values, which may create instability on the local housing market in the long run.

One valuable source of information regarding demand is the growing empirical literature that has applied stated preference methods to estimate households' willingness to pay (WTP). Because it is difficult to generalize and support planning based on this scattered literature, we conduct a meta-analysis to take stock of the worldwide sample of household WTP for improved drinking water services. Using 171 WTP estimates drawn from 60 studies, we first describe this sample and then examine the potential factors that explain variation in WTP estimates. Our results suggest that households are willing to pay between approximately $3 and $30 per month for improvements in water access. Specifically, in line with economic theory and intuition, WTP is sensitive to scope (the magnitude of improvement in drinking water services), as well as household income, and stated-preference elicitation method. We demonstrate how our results can be used to predict household-level WTP for selected improvements in drinking water access in regions with low coverage, and find that private benefits exceed the cost of provision.

This can be empirically demonstrated at the example of the unexpectedly large inflow of fees for the registration of clean development mechanism (CDM) projects and issuance of emission credits on the political influence of staff in the UNFCCC Secretariat. Through document analysis, interviews and econometric analysis, we show that CDM staff was able to gain substantial influence over concrete policy decisions and even change the structure of relevant decision-making and consultation processes. We also show that this may reinforce rather than reduce the role of special interests expressed via country representatives in the CDM Executive Board. While one might be worried about the erosion of democratic principles at the international level, from a normative perspective, the overall effect is difficult to assess. If the international civil service is competent and committed to the delivery of the global public good, its increasing autonomy and influence may also be socially advantageous.","[Michaelowa, Katharina; Michaelowa, Axel] Univ Zurich, Ctr Comparat & Int Studies CIS, Affolternstr 56, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Michaelowa, A (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Ctr Comparat & Int Studies CIS, Affolternstr 56, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland.",axel.michaelowa@pw.uzh.ch,"Michaelowa, Katharina/B-4931-2018","Michaelowa, Katharina/0000-0002-0317-209X; Michaelowa, Axel/0000-0001-5053-3700",,,,,44,18,18,1,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

An extensive anthropometric literature purports to show that heights in the United States declined between the 1830s and the 1890s, which is when the U.S. economy modernized. Most anthropometric research contends that declining heights reflect the negative health consequences of industrialization and urbanization. This interpretation, however, relies on sources subject to selection bias. Our meta-analysis shows that the declining height during industrialization emerges primarily in selected samples. We also develop a parsimonious diagnostic test that reveals, but does not correct for, selection bias in height samples.

From an urban planning and economics perspective, this represents a spatial task: if more land is allocated to various types of green, how do the economic effects propagate throughout urban space? This paper focuses on the spatial marginal effects of forests, parks, and fields and estimates spatial hedonic models on a sample of apartment transactions in Helsinki, Finland. The results indicate that the capitalization of urban green in apartment prices depends on the type of green, but also interacts with distance to the city centre. Additionally, the effects contain variable pure and spatial spillover impacts, also conditional on type and location, the separation of which highlights aspects not commonly accounted for. The planning of green infrastructure will therefore benefit from parameterizing interventions according to location, green type, and character of spatial impacts. (C) 2016 The Author.

We address our objective econometrically, assessing the quality of industrial relations as a driver of environmental innovation adoption, through the use of micro-data on manufacturing firms. The results yield two interesting main findings: being a unionised firm is not associated with the adoption of environmental innovation; however, when we consider the industrial relations climate, we observe a positive relationship between a cooperative industrial relations climate (union involvement) and the propensity to introduce environmental innovation. Two models are relevant: a managerially oriented model (unions are informed) and a participatory model (unions bargain on innovation adoption).

Design/methodology/approach - A combination of cluster and systematic random sampling was used to select 40 households in each local government area of the selected two states. This gives a total of 160 households per state and 320 households in all for the first data collection. Visiting the same households during the second data collection, only 150 households' data were useful for analysis. Panel primary data were adopted and they were collected in two periods of late and early rain, respectively, over a period of nine months. Primary data were collected with the aid of a well-structured questionnaire, administered on farming households in the area of study. The needed information was collected through the use of interview schedules/questionnaires. Findings - The transition of food insufficiency households to food sufficiency indicated a differential of 4.25 percent, and the transition of food sufficiency to food insufficiency a differential of 9.33 percent. During the agricultural harvest season more households moved to food sufficiency status (16 percent), while off season insufficiency status was 25.3 percent. The probability of households escaping food insufficiency is 0.25, and the probability of households entering food insufficiency is 0.38. The study provides evidence of transient and high incidence of food insufficiency. Originality/value - Past studies of this nature only captured the food insufficiency status of households using a snapshot study. Hence, this study brought in innovation by examining the dynamics of food sufficiency/insufficiency in two periods. Therefore the question this study asks is: can a farm-household be food sufficient over a particular period of time and food insufficient in other time?","[Apata, Temidayo] Fed Univ Oye Ekiti Nigeria, Dept Agr Econ & Extens, Ikole, Nigeria",,"Apata, T (通讯作者)，Fed Univ Oye Ekiti Nigeria, Dept Agr Econ & Extens, Ikole, Nigeria.",dayo.apata@fuoye.edu.ng,"Apata, Temidayo/M-9583-2018","Apata, Temidayo/0000-0001-5742-2026",,,,,62,0,0,0,3,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The purpose of this paper is to examine how a broad-based information session would affect consumers' perceptions and attitudes about an edible insect product. Design/methodology/approach - During a taste testing session, preceded or followed by an information session about entomophagy, participants rated the organoleptic characteristics of two bread samples on nine-point hedonic scales. The two bread samples were identical, though one was faux-labelled as containing an insect product. Findings - Generalised linear model (GLM) analysis showed effects of gender, information session exposure, entomophagy familiarity, and entomophagy experience on participants' ratings of the samples. Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney ranked sum tests showed that appearance, flavour, and overall liking were significantly better rated for the bread sample labelled as insect free by participants who attended the presentation a priori. Potential ways to improve information content and delivery in favour of encouraging dietary shifts are discussed. Practical implications - This study shows that information about insect-based products could change consumers' perceptions of such products. The results provide clues regarding how the food industry can adapt communication for target audiences. Originality/value - Actual edible insect products were not used in this study. Paradoxically, it is the first to show the impact of an information session on the acceptability of edible insect products, by revealing participants' perceptual expectations.","[Barsics, Fanny; Megido, Rudy Caparros; Brostaux, Yves; Blecker, Christophe; Haubruge, Eric; Francis, Frederic] Univ Liege, Gembloux Agrobio Tech, Gembloux, Belgium; [Barsics, Catherine] Univ Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland",University of Liege; University of Geneva,"Megido, RC (通讯作者)，Univ Liege, Gembloux Agrobio Tech, Gembloux, Belgium.",r.caparros@ulg.ac.be,,"Haubruge, Eric/0000-0002-8138-0476; Caparros Megido, Rudy/0000-0001-9368-7072; Francis, Frederic/0000-0001-7731-0849; Brostaux, Yves/0000-0001-6172-7869",,,,,66,76,79,2,59,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

In this paper we argue that deliberation is central to reflexive governance, mainly because it can reconcile many if not most of the sometimes contradictory claims that are made in the literature about its drivers. We take four key dimensions along which reflexivity may be sought, each of which features a binary that puts two plausible drivers of reflexivity in tension with one another: (i) sources of knowledge (public participation versus expertise); (ii) composition of public discourse (diversity versus consensus); (iii) institutional architecture (polycentricity versus centralization); (iv) institutional dynamics (flexibility versus stability). In each case, we demonstrate that deliberative ideas can manage the tension between the two plausible drivers of reflexivity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The need to research management innovation in the public sector is gaining in importance due to the ongoing public administration reforms which are often, through the implementation of new methods and management concepts, aimed at increasing public service efficiency and effectiveness. Empirical research was conducted on local government units in Croatia. The research results show the dual relationship between management innovation and effectiveness. In addition to a direct relationship with effectiveness, this paper also confirmed an indirect relationship between implementation of management innovation and effectiveness, through influencing a higher level of implementation of other innovations. This implies that continuous innovation of management creates the basis for a faster, easier and more efficient implementation of other innovation, i.e. efforts are invested in increasing the effectiveness of local government in general. Further, results suggest that institutional isomorphic pressures are evident in Croatian local government units, leading them to adopt similar structures, strategies and processes.","[Fabic, Mirjana Grcic; Kutnjak, Goran] Fac Econ, I Filipovica 4, Rijeka, Croatia; [Fabic, Marko] Univ Rijeka, Fac Engn, Vukovarska 58, Rijeka, Croatia",University of Rijeka; University of Rijeka,"Fabic, MG (通讯作者)，Fac Econ, I Filipovica 4, Rijeka, Croatia.",mirjana.grcic.fabic@efri.hr; goran.kutnjak@efri.hr; marko.fabic@kbc-rijeka.hr,"Grčić Fabić, Mirjana/GNP-4472-2022; Fabić, Marko/JKJ-3082-2023; Fabić, Mirjana Grčić/R-3492-2018; Fabic, Mirjana Grcic/ABC-6230-2020","Grčić Fabić, Mirjana/0000-0002-8995-7452; Fabić, Marko/0009-0004-4900-9556; Fabić, Mirjana Grčić/0000-0002-8995-7452;","University of Rijeka, Croatia, under the project Management development in the function of integration of the Croatian economy in the EU [13.02.1.3.06]","University of Rijeka, Croatia, under the project Management development in the function of integration of the Croatian economy in the EU","This paper has been supported by the University of Rijeka, Croatia, under the project Management development in the function of integration of the Croatian economy in the EU, no. 13.02.1.3.06.",,41,0,0,0,4,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,165,182,,,,,,18,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500015,0

In particular, the study examines how switching intention drives customers to either replace the current store or cross to others. In addition, the study examines the role of cross-shopping in total-switching behaviour. Design/methodology/approach - The study employs data collected from a sample consisting of 247 food grocery shoppers. The conceptual framework and hypothesis were analysed using the partial least squares approach. Findings - The empirical results support the author's claim that the research approach applied in this study better explains the switching intention-actual behaviour relationship. Specifically, the analysis provides strong support for the effect of switching intention and various moderating barriers on both cross-shopping and total-switching behaviour. Additionally, the study results point to the positive relationship between cross-shopping and total-switching, indicating that crossing to competing stores is the first step towards utilising the total-switching behaviour. Practical implications - Implications for food retail providers are identified, together with a discussion of the study's limitations and avenues for future research. Originality/value - The study extends previous research in that it proposed and tested a conceptual framework for investigating the relationship between switching-intention and actual behaviour, claiming that switching intention drives customers to either replace their current store or cross to others, whereas the crossing pattern is a predictor of the total-switching behaviour.","[Hino, Hayiel] Ariel Univ, Ariel, Israel",Ariel University,"Hino, H (通讯作者)，Ariel Univ, Ariel, Israel.",hayielh@ariel.ac.il,"hino, hayiel/S-4315-2016",,,,,,52,3,4,0,25,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Findings - Respondents were able to differentiate between the importance of wine attributes. Taste was the most important wine attribute followed by someone recommended it. Alcohol level below 13 per cent was least important. Firm controlled information such as information on back label was of little importance. South African Generation Y consumers seem to select wine similarly to those in the USA.

Behaviorism is a science studying and analysing the people's behaviour which seeks to explain, describe, and predict certain human behaviour, what people do and how they work, think, and why certain behaving decisions are made. Behaviorism finds its place in various areas, including the economy, because it deals with the issue how psychology impacts the individuals (market participants in the economic context) from individual to institutional investors, on the economic decision-making, as well as the price movements. The theme of this paper is the specific research area studying different effects on the behaviour and decisions of market participants which is the area of behavioral finance. Although seemingly incompatible, the economy, especially financial one, can be put in the context of psychology through behaviour of market participants and their decision-making. Erroneous, irrational financial decisions are the result of different unpredictable reactions of individuals faced with losses and high market risks. Therefore, for decision-making it is essential to consider all the factors in the market, which creates place for behavioral finance. As a new approach to the field of finance, when studying market participants' behaviour, behavioral finance considers different aspects of individuals (market participants), with psychological factors as extremely influential ones. Behavioral finance focuses on determining how and why market participants make certain decisions in a specific way, or how they respond to and interpret information from the environment. Therefore, the task of behavioral finance, and at the same time the main objective of this paper, is to explore the ways and the extent to which human behaviour can affect financial decisions of individuals and institutions, price trends, as well as the results it can have.","[Liovic, Dina; Novakovic, Drazen] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Trg Ljudevita Gaja 7, Osijek 31000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Liovic, D (通讯作者)，JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Trg Ljudevita Gaja 7, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",dinali@efos.hr; dnovakov@efos.hr,"Novaković, Dražen/AAN-7378-2021; Bičvić, Dina/AAL-1438-2021; Bičvić, Dina/AAT-6475-2021","Novaković, Dražen/0000-0002-8365-7248; Bičvić, Dina/0000-0002-5296-7788; Bičvić, Dina/0000-0002-5296-7788",,,,,15,0,0,0,4,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,1073,1082,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500104,0

The research was done from September to November 2016 in Nitra region. We focused on companies where we had supposed that the employees worked in creativity supporting work environment. A short questionnaire was delivered to 109 employees of five companies in which searched for subjective importance of impact of working conditions on the respondents. To make it clear, it is important to note that in 3 cases they were companies where the employees worked in offices (each employee had their own office or they shared it with a colleague) and in two cases they were companies where the employees shared, open space office. We evaluated 86 questionnaires and the findings were interesting. Respondents, who go to work every day, cannot choose their work place. A free choice of a work place brings new ideas. Moreover, important is the colour of the room or the desk and fact that a person can be all alone for a while as well. Creative corners might be a part of several other companies and they could support interesting ideas of the employees. Open space office on emotional level within employees can evoke impression that emotional climate in the company is more relaxed and the company supports mutual responsiveness and compatibility. This type of work environment supports mutual awareness about issues even though the employees might feel discomfort in loud noise or low attention which might result in lower creativity. Other findings are a part of the paper.","[Lusnakova, Zuzana; Sajbidorova, Maria; Hrda, Veronika] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Lusnáková, Z (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",zuzana.lusnakova@uniag.sk; maria.sajbidorova@uniag.sk; veronika.hrda@uniag.sk,"Lušňáková, Zuzana/AAL-8249-2020","Lušňáková, Zuzana/0000-0001-6331-9930",,,,,14,0,0,0,5,SLOVAK UNIV AGRICULTURE NITRA,NITRA,"TR A HLINKU2, NITRA, 94976, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-552-1739-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,401,407,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6FH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426613300049,0

This knowledge is understood in the constructivist sense, i.e. as the current effect of the beliefs. It is possible to use this condition when a certain level of ubiquity of this phenomenon is achieved, which manifests itself as the accumulation of various statements and utterances about it. These statements and utterances may be of any character and may be made by any means. The volume of these statements is presented as a discourse (or a bunch of discourses) about this phenomenon, which can be reconstructed by existing methods. This reconstruction takes place by creating a model that draws inspiration from the sciences, especially from physics, where a construction so-called space states, phases, etc. exists and is intended for multidimensional presentation of physical massive phenomena. In this work, the internet is a phenomenon that is undergoing such modeling. The internet is mature enough and possesses a great literature of the subject in which one can observe some historical tendencies. This makes it possible to portray the Internet dynamically and to include a time variable. The hypothesis which is presented by this model is a claim that it is a representation of certain knowledge about the phenomenon under investigation, assuming that the nature of this knowledge has a specific, discursive character. To describe the concept of discursive space as well as the nature of its presence in the knowledge space, it is necessary to trace three separate theoretical constructs: knowledge, configuration space, state space, phase space, or space-time(7), and discourse(8). Each of them opens the extensive library of the publications. For this reason, only these threads that are relevant to the idea of discursive space are shown in this paper. This idea refers to a constructivist approach, claiming in general that knowledge is socially and culturally created, so it is local in a temporal and spatial sense. This knowledge is also variable, and remains in controversial relation to such a feature as truth. This controversy is manifested as skepticism and a pragmatic approach to the problem of truth(9). It is therefore necessary to take into account the development and meaning of the three constructions.","[Maciag, Rafal] Jagiellonian Univ Krakow, Inst Culture, Krakow, Poland",Jagiellonian University,"Maciag, R (通讯作者)，Jagiellonian Univ Krakow, Inst Culture, Krakow, Poland.",rafal.maciag@uj.edu.pl,"Maciąg, Rafał/S-6549-2016",,,,,,50,0,0,0,0,UNIV WROCLAW,WROCLAW,"PL UNIWERSYTECKI 1, WROCLAW, 50-137, POLAND",,,978-83-64389-64-1,ICT MAN GLO COM EC G,,,2017,,,,,,,398,414,,,,,,17,Development Studies; Economics; Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BP9OZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000570154500034,0

Design/methodology/approach - A total of 15 focus group discussions including 94 participants were conducted. A semi-structured approach was applied to discussions about the comprehension of food safety, the responsibility for food safety, the barriers hindering food safety practices, and the food safety influence of other people. Findings - Differences related to the field of study and level of education were identified. The results demonstrate the diversity of interpretations of food safety with control of biological hazards strongly emphasized. The responsibility for food safety is perceived differently by position in the FSC. Different barriers related to the working environment and personal factors were identified. Parental influence on the target population is decreased as focus is shifted to the teachers of practical classes and especially to the instructors in food enterprises. Research limitations/implications - Considering the response rate and the small number of schools offering a specific study programme not all the study fields and educational levels were equally represented. Practical implications - The findings could assist educators, policy makers, and food business operators in their efforts to develop educational programmes that will more effectively contribute to the safety of food.

Using a mixed-methods approach, cross-sectional survey (n = 428), and structural equation modelling (SEM) the results of this study reveal community perceptions of rising economic inequality, collective sense of uncertainty about the future, and negative impacts on the standard of living in the affected regions. For example the majority of the respondents are concerned about: the rising cost of living in the area (83.4%), the long-term impacts on groundwater (77.4%), and how their community is being affected (77.3%). We found that perceptions of fairness and inequity weigh heavily, especially on farmers, and correlate to negative psychosocial effects. Our analysis shows that unresolved concerns of community residents about environmental and social issues and the loss of confidence in the local government, contribute to lower life-satisfaction, inhibit the community's ability to plan for the future, and lead to a weaker local economy.

Cybernetic-physical system (CPS) provides that from the moment of product selection to the time it is finished and packed for delivery machines do everything themselves. This approach to the production process will greatly change the current mode of production and allow endusers, customers to create their own product. Interview with the production director in socks factory Miro and owner of the production craft Drvomont gave an overview of the possibilities of production facilities which in accordance with the third industrial revolution used electronics and IT for production. In socks factory Miro it is possible, with a minimal amount (10 pairs), to order design, color and size according to the customer's wishes. Personalized stockings are designed in collaboration with the designer and via USB transmitted to the machine. Craft Drvomont is producing furniture according to customers' wishes, and in collaboration with designers craft can arrange shape, color, material and equipment of each product. The design is transferred to the CNC machining center. In these subjects is possible to fully individualize product and make it unique. This paper presents a schematic representations of possible use of CPS in the observed subjects. Further development and implementation of Industry 4.0. the whole process could be carried out from house where customers can design a product and put it into production. It remains only to courier to deliver it to your home.

The first is technical and the second is in the area of the humanities. Most people, especially in the sphere of business, think that any form of innovation is made only in technology. We want to show that this type of thinking is not always correct. Innovation also applies to the world of humanities. This point of view is the creed of this article. The humanistic sense of innovation can be realized in three aspects: 1) methodological, 2) cognitive or cognitive context, 3) purely scientific. This article considers all three aforementioned ideas. For example, firstly we introduce a new method called definition, in German called Treffsicherheits. As stated earlier, most people think that innovation is done mainly in business or technology, which is a mistake, of course. Innovation in the humanities takes place in many practical activities and ideas. This process is quite up-to-date. All these issues will be discussed in detail in further parts of this abstract. Innovation can also be realized in the cognitive sphere. It means progress (increase) of knowledge or education. This is a fundamental issue in all innovations. Finally, innovation can be realized in pure abstract science and plays a key role in science. All these issues will be described in detail in an article. We will give more examples that show how innovation can be useful in the humanities. Our point of view is based on hard scientific arguments. We hope that our presentation will provide valuable insights.","[Rzepka, Katarzyna; Czerny, Janusz] Coll Management Edukacja, Wroclaw, Poland",,"Rzepka, K (通讯作者)，Coll Management Edukacja, Wroclaw, Poland.",,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,UNIV WROCLAW,WROCLAW,"PL UNIWERSYTECKI 1, WROCLAW, 50-137, POLAND",,,978-83-64389-64-1,ICT MAN GLO COM EC G,,,2017,,,,,,,235,239,,,,,,5,Development Studies; Economics; Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BP9OZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000570154500019,0

Transport industry and related transport infrastructure networks are seen as key drivers in the promotion of economic growth and development. With around (sic) 1.5 billion in Gross Value Added (GVA), the transport and storage services industry accounted more than 4.5 % of total GVA in Croatia in 2014, while it was 5% at the EU level. This paper surveys the theoretical and empirical literature on the linkages between transport industry and economic growth. The aim of the research is to analyze the role of transport industry in Croatian economy, distinguishing among different modes of transport. It is analyzed the economic performance of transport industry and trends of each mode of transport by using statistical methods. In the paper is estimated the impact of different variables on transport industry, moreover on gross value added of transport industry. It is used panel data analysis on data spanning 15 years, from 2001 to 2015 for 28 EU Member states, in order to estimate the effects of the most important variables that affect grow value added of transport industry. Fixed effects estimator shows that gross value added of manufacturing industry and compensation of employees have a significant impact on the gross value added of transport industry. Considering the trends in the transport industry in the past 14 years, among all modes of transport, the land transport e.g. road transport still counts for the most important factor in growth of transport industry on the both EU level and in each member state by itself.","[Skender, Helga Pavlic; Mirkovic, Petra Adelajda; Host, Alen] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Skender, HP (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia.",helga.pavlic.skender@efri.hr; petra.adelajda.mirkovic@efri.hr; alen.host@efri.hr,"Zaninović, Petra Adelajda/Q-5366-2018; Host, Alen/R-8180-2018","Zaninović, Petra Adelajda/0000-0002-0741-4826;",,,,,13,0,0,0,0,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,230,238,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500021,0

Totalitarian regimes are disappearing, new countries and nations are born, large new global markets are being opened. All of these facts raise the question about the world governance based on these new circumstances. The European Union, as one of the forms of European countries unification, is facing a problem related to its functioning and development. The fact that the EU consists of highly developed economies, but also of several economies in transition, imposes the need for new thinking about the unity of so diversified economies. The issues of: economics, politics, civil society, human relations, human rights, democracy and others have their foundations in knowledge and the level of education of the society. Knowledge is a key factor of development. It must be understood by politicians who govern the European nations. The former East-West relations widened the difference between the developed and transition economies. The idea to establish new North-South relations can not only relieve negative tensions arising from the East-West, but with time it can reduce them. Croatia and Poland put forward an initiative to link economies in the triangle: the Adriatic, the Baltic and the Black Sea. It is called the Three Seas initiative, which covers 12 countries, of which only Austria was not within the communist totalitarian regime. Thus, the Three Seas initiative has a special significance, not only for the relations in the European Union, but also for the whole world development policy. The idea of the Three Seas was presented on 29 September 2015 by the President of the Republic of Croatia on the preparatory meeting on the side-lines of the UN General Assembly in New York. The goal of the initiative is to strengthen the overall Central European cooperation, creating neither new international organizations nor new mechanisms of cooperation. The expected advantages and potential disadvantages of this initiative will be the subject of the research presented in this paper. The aim of the work is collate and evaluate factors that can support or weaken the Three Seas initiative. In this paper the research methods used were: the methods of the analysis of strategic documents, the historical method and the methods of analysis and synthesis. Moreover the multi-criteria analysis of the level of development of the project's initiators economies was used.","[Skrzeszewska, Katarzyna] Gdynia Maritime Univ, Ul Morska 81-87, PL-81225 Gdynia, Poland; [Lukovic, Tihomir] Univ Dubrovnik, Lapadska Obala 7, Dubrovnik 20000, Croatia",Gdynia Maritime University; University of Dubrovnik,"Skrzeszewska, K (通讯作者)，Gdynia Maritime Univ, Ul Morska 81-87, PL-81225 Gdynia, Poland.",k.skrzeszewska@wpit.am.gdynia.pl; tihomir.lukovic@unidu.hr,,,,,,,9,1,1,0,0,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,558,566,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500053,0

In parallel, the aim was to determine if there are differences in pasteurized organic and conventional milk samples delivered on the market. Design/methodology/approach - Raw milk samples were analyzed for aerobic colony count (ACC), somatic cell count (SCC), acidity, temperature, fat and protein content. On the other side, final products of organic and conventional pasteurized milk with 2.8 percent declared milk fat were analyzed for Raman spectroscopy, color change and sensorial difference. Findings - Results of raw milk analysis showed statistically significant differences in fat content, SCC, acidity, temperature and ACC (p < 0.05). It is of note that ACC for organic milk were lower for approx. 1 log CFU/ml compared to conventional milk samples. Pasteurized organic milk samples had a significantly higher L* value than those samples originating from conventional farms, indicating that organic is more white compared to conventional milk.

Its purpose is to identify the current taxation problems relevant not only for (Eastern) Croatia, but for Central and Eastern Europe in general. The paper also aims to establish the difference in Eastern Croatian taxpayers' perceptions in comparison with the rest of Croatia, including the causes of such differences and their implications. The sample of individual taxpayers from Eastern Croatia was stratified using demographic data available for Eastern Croatia. The questionnaire was filled in using our interviewers' phone calls. The data are analysed using descriptive statistics and the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test. Taxpayers from Eastern Croatia strongly support the introduction of bank taxation and extending of the scope of the lower VAT rate to cover all food (as allowed by the EU harmonisation rules). The strongest disagreement is related to the inheritances and gifts tax as well as introduction of interest taxation. For all of the statements, there is a statistically significant difference between taxpayers from Eastern Croatia and taxpayers from other parts of Croatia. These differences are explored in the paper in detail as well as their causes and implications.","[Stambuk, Ana; Blazic, Helena] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Stambuk, A (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia.",ana@efri.hr; helena@efri.hr,"Blažić, Helena/Q-3836-2018; Štambuk, Ana/Y-9689-2018","Blažić, Helena/0000-0003-4602-3665; Štambuk, Ana/0000-0002-5138-1662",Croatian Science Foundation [IP-2013-11-8174]; University of Rijeka [13.02.1.2.02]; University of Zagreb [DP 097-2015],Croatian Science Foundation; University of Rijeka; University of Zagreb,"This work has been supported in part by the Croatian Science Foundation under project number IP-2013-11-8174, in part by the University of Rijeka under project number 13.02.1.2.02., and in part by the University of Zagreb under project number DP 097-2015.",,10,0,0,0,0,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,1174,1183,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500115,0

Expectations for the Pact are high, evidenced in particular by its multiple and overlapping objectives: to serve as a generic binding instrument of international environmental law (IEL) principles; to integrate, consolidate, unify and ultimately entrench many of the fragmented principles of IEL; and to constitute the first global environmental human rights instrument. In the wake of the impending intergovernmental process, the paper offers a thorough critique of the draft Pact in its present iteration. We do so with the aim of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the present draft Pact by interrogating: (a) its diplomatic and symbolic relevance and possible unique contribution at the policy level to global environmental law and governance, and (b) its potential at the operational level of IEL and global environmental governance, focusing on the extent to which the draft Pact accommodates both existing and more recent rules and principles for environmental protection. As the Pact's primary ambition is to become a universally binding global treaty, it would be churlish not to recognise its potential for innovation, as well as the considerable opportunity that the negotiation of the Pact will have to generate broad-sweeping and positive impacts. However, our central thesis is that only if the Global Pact were to incorporate ambitious normative provisions to strengthen those public and private global governance efforts that aim to halt the deterioration of Earth system integrity, as well as to maintain and improve integrity, will it be able to offer a firm foundation of the type of Anthropocene Law, termed here as the Lex Anthropocenae, required to confront head-on the deep socio-ecological crisis of the Anthropocene.","[Kotze, Louis J.] North West Univ, Potchefstroom, South Africa; [Kotze, Louis J.; French, Duncan] Univ Lincoln, Lincoln Law Sch, Lincoln LN6 7TS, England",North West University - South Africa; University of Lincoln,"Kotzé, LJ (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Potchefstroom, South Africa.;Kotzé, LJ (通讯作者)，Univ Lincoln, Lincoln Law Sch, Lincoln LN6 7TS, England.",lkotze@lincoln.ac.uk,,"Kotze, Louis/0000-0001-5820-168X; French, Duncan/0000-0001-6422-7579",,,,,69,41,43,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Quantifying the economic benefits of biodiversity for human well-being is not straightforward. Here, we expand the ecosystem service cascade by (i) attributing a methodology to the different steps of the cascade to assess the effects of changes in functional group diversity on economic activities; (ii) including multiple attributes for defining functional diversity and (iii) integrating a dynamic ecological model simulating complex interactions and feedbacks between species with an economic model assessing the effects of changes in functional group diversity for gross revenues. The stepwise methodological framework integrates a production function approach with a market price-based approach in order to investigate the indirect use value of functional group diversity based on the ecological role of species in the ecosystem. The methodology is applied to estimate the relationship between the gross economic value of Chinook salmon (Pacific Northwest, United States) and the diversity of freshwater macroinvertebrates. The results of our analysis emphasize the importance of biological diversity for sustaining ecosystem goods and services. The analysis provides a tractable framework for quantitatively exploring the economic consequences of changes in functional group diversity.","[Daniels, Silvie; Witters, Nele; Vangronsveld, Jaco; Van Passel, Steven] Hasselt Univ, UHasselt, Ctr Environm Sci, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium; [Bellmore, J.

Using the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) as a case, our study examines the politics of rigor, understood as value-chain traceability and on-the-ground requirements, within private environmental standards. We use polytomous variable latent class analysis to cluster RSPO members' reported challenges in sustainable palm oil and model the membership in clusters expressing concerns that the standard is either insufficiently rigorous or too difficult using random effects panel logistic regression. We find that more brand-exposed members are more likely to request greater rigor. Members in the middle of the value chain are more likely to voice concerns about the standard being excessively difficult, particularly noting costs and the challenge of securing supplies. We argue that avoiding reputational risk is a primary motivator for standards adherence, and, as a result, demands for increased rigor come primarily from firms with higher brand exposure. We conclude that the distribution of standard members across the supply chain can be a significant determinant of the way private environmental standards evolve and the level of rigor they achieve.","[Gallemore, Caleb] Lafayette Coll, Int Affairs Program, Oeschle Ctr Global Educ 217, 730 High St, Easton, PA 18042 USA; [Guisinger, Amy] Lafayette Coll, Dept Econ, Easton, PA 18042 USA; [Kruuse, Mikkel; Jespersen, Kristjan] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Management Soc & Commun, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Ruysschaert, Denis] Univ Liege, Fac Gembloux, Dept Biose, Liege, Belgium",Lafayette College; Lafayette College; Copenhagen Business School; University of Liege,"Gallemore, C (通讯作者)，Lafayette Coll, Int Affairs Program, Oeschle Ctr Global Educ 217, 730 High St, Easton, PA 18042 USA.",gallemoc@lafayette.edu,,"Gallemore, Caleb/0000-0003-1703-0241",Governing Responsible Business Research Environment at Copenhagen Business School,Governing Responsible Business Research Environment at Copenhagen Business School,"We would like to thank the Governing Responsible Business Research Environment at Copenhagen Business School for funding support to attend the 2016 European Roundtable meeting of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO).

However, there is still little evidence of how PES programmes interact with existing motivations to conserve, the extent to which funded conservation is additional, and the likely permanence of changes. We categorized the outcome of contracts aiming to reduce cattle grazing in riparian forest (n = 428) and deforestation (n = 912) by Bolivian farmers in terms of whether they were unsuitable, non-compliant, non-additional, or additional (the holy grail of PES programmes) and explored the relationship between farmers' reported motivations and the extent to which the conservation funded was additional. Up to 39% of contracts to exclude cattle, and 14% to prevent deforestation appear to be additional. Where participation is motivated by the instrumental values of nature (such as provision of clean water) contracts to exclude cattle from riparian forest are more likely to represent additional conservation. We suggest that the programme is partly acting as what we term 'payment for environmental self-service'; i.e. the external incentives enable changes in behaviour motivated by farmers' perceptions of environmental benefits they receive from the management changes incentivized.","[Bottazzi, Patrick; Wiik, Emma; Jones, Julia P.

Economic assessment of adaptation options needs to explicitly incorporate the uncertainty of future climate conditions and should recognise that uncertainties may diminish over time as a result of improved understanding and learning. Real options analysis (ROA) is an appraisal tool developed to incorporate concepts of flexibility and learning that relies on probabilistic data to characterise uncertainties. It is also a relatively resource-intensive decision support tool. We test whether, and to what extent, learning can result from the use of successive generations of real life climate scenarios, and how non-probabilistic uncertainties can be handled through adapting the principles of ROA in coastal economic adaptation decisions. Using a relatively simple form of ROA on a vulnerable piece of coastal rail infrastructure in the United Kingdom, and two successive UK climate assessments, we estimate the values associated with utilising up-dated information on sea-level rise. The value of learning can be compared to the capital cost of adaptation investment, and may be used to illustrate the potential scale of the value of learning in coastal protection, and other adaptation contexts.","[Dawson, David A.] Univ Leeds, Sch Civil Engn, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Hunt, Alistair] Univ Bath, Dept Econ, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Shaw, Jon] Univ Plymouth, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Gehrels, W.

While urban shops have been explored in detail, often in ways that highlight their role in a parallel transformation in consumption patterns, little attempt has been made to look inside village shops or examine the character and practices of rural retailers. This article addresses this lacuna and offers fresh insights into the shifting position of village shops in these broader economic, business, and social changes. Taking a long view of the period c. 1660-1860, it draws on a wide range of sources to examine the stock sold and the degree of specialization exhibited by village shops, and the changing trading practices of village shopkeepers, including the provision of credit, the pricing of goods, and marketing activities. In doing so, the article highlights both long-term continuities and important innovations of the type that also characterize urban shops, and argues that village shops, while central to rural social and economic networks, were also intimately bound into broader retail systems.","[Stobart, Jon] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Bailey, Lucy] Univ Northampton, Northampton, England",Manchester Metropolitan University; University of Northampton,"Stobart, J (通讯作者)，Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Manchester, Lancs, England.",,,"Stobart, Jon/0000-0002-9771-4741",,,,,76,8,9,1,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

The objective is evaluating the Paris Agreement feasibility regarding the INDCs and its economic and environmental constraints. The criteria through which the 161 INDCs are analysed are as follows: i/ socio-economic impact of the transition; ii/ focus on energy management; substitution of non-renewable sources; iv/ the role of technology; v/ equality of the transition; vi/ compliance with emission reductions. The results obtained show that the Paris Agreement excessively relies on external financial support (41.4%). Moreover, its unilateralist approach, the socio-economic and biophysical constraints could be the underlying cause of the ineffectiveness of the 2 degrees C objective. This way, each country would emit an average of 37.8% more than in the years 2005-2015. When this is weighted, the figure would be a 19.3% increase, due mainly to the increases in China and India, These figures would lead the temperatures up to 3 degrees-4 degrees C.","[Nieto, Jaime; Carpintero, Oscar] Univ Valladolid, Dept Appl Econ, Ave Valle Esgueva 6, Valladolid, Spain; [Nieto, Jaime; Carpintero, Oscar; Miguel, Luis J.] Univ Valladolid, Res Grp Energy Econ & Syst Dynam, Paseo Cauce S-N, Valladolid, Spain",Universidad de Valladolid; Universidad de Valladolid,"Nieto, J (通讯作者)，Univ Valladolid, Dept Appl Econ, Ave Valle Esgueva 6, Valladolid, Spain.",jaime.nieto@eco.uva.es,"Miguel, Luis Javier/I-2829-2015; Nieto, Jaime/AAC-6050-2020; Carpintero, Oscar/Q-9065-2016","Miguel, Luis Javier/0000-0002-8243-8596; Nieto, Jaime/0000-0002-8925-4319; Nieto Vega, Jaime/0000-0003-4843-250X; Carpintero, Oscar/0000-0001-9142-8931",European project Guiding European Policy towards a low-carbon economy [691287],European project Guiding European Policy towards a low-carbon economy,We are grateful for the support in the elaboration of this article from the European project H2020-LCE-2015-2 (691287) Guiding European Policy towards a low-carbon economy.

However, to date, ES assessments in Philippine reefs are mostly concentrated only on fisheries and tourism or on few areas in the Philippines (e.g., Pangasinan and Bohol Marine Triangle). This study fills research gaps by assessing coral reefs across 15 regions in the Philippines by estimating the following: (1) potential reef fisheries and Willingness-To-Pay (WTP) biodiversity values using underwater surveys and literature data, (2) reef fisheries value using Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BEAR) and literature data, (3) tourism value using Department of Tourism (DOT) and literature data, and (4) Total Economic Value (TEV). The TEV of Philippine reefs' ES amounted to 4 billion US $/yr or 140,000 US$/km(2)/yr. Furthermore, in each region of the Philippines, annual TEV ranged from 100 to 800 million US$, with potential reef fisheries value contributing the most in the TEV, followed by reef fisheries, tourism, and WTP biodiversity values. In addition, the Visayas regions have the highest values of benefits from coral reefs. Although the Philippines is deriving millions to billions of dollars of economic benefits from coral reefs, the observed degradation and temporal decline in coastal ecosystems could lead to a decline in the potential reef fisheries value, subsequently the TEV. The Philippines need to improve accounting and managing the derived benefits from coral reefs to ensure the sustainability and continuous flow of these benefits for present and future Filipino beneficiaries.","[Tamayo, Natasha Charmaine A.; Anticamara, Jonathan A.] Univ Philippines, Coll Sci, Inst Biol, Quezon City 1101, Philippines; [Acosta-Michlik, Lilibeth] UPLB, Coll Human Ecol, Dept Community & Environm Resource Planning, Los Banos, Philippines; [Acosta-Michlik, Lilibeth] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany",University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Diliman; University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Los Banos; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung,"Tamayo, NCA (通讯作者)，Univ Philippines, Coll Sci, Inst Biol, Quezon City 1101, Philippines.",natamayo1@up.edu.ph; lilibeth@pik-potsdam.de,"Anticamara, Jonathan/L-5591-2019","Acosta, Lilibeth/0000-0002-0733-3751","Foundation For the Philippine Environment FPE, University of the Philippines (UP) OVCRD OPEN [151504OG]; UP OVPAA Creative Writing Grant; UP OVCRD PhDIA Grant [131307]","Foundation For the Philippine Environment FPE, University of the Philippines (UP) OVCRD OPEN; UP OVPAA Creative Writing Grant; UP OVCRD PhDIA Grant","We thank the Foundation For the Philippine Environment FPE, University of the Philippines (UP) OVCRD OPEN Grant 151504OG, UP OVPAA Creative Writing Grant, and UP OVCRD PhDIA Grant 131307 for funding the national reef field surveys.

In the present study, the role of continuous and discontinuous urban expansion as a driver of high-quality soil consumption has been investigated in 66 southern European metropolitan regions. Landscape metrics and socioeconomic indicators were considered together in a multivariate exploratory analysis with the aim to assess the intensity of recent urban expansion (2000-2010) and the consequent depletion of different soil types in Portuguese, Spanish, French, Italian and Greek cities. Overall, urban expansion involved preferentially high-quality soils in the study area. A Principal Component Analysis identified diverging city profiles as far as spatial patterns of soil consumption are concerned. Per-capita declared income, income growth rate, population density and landscape diversity were highest in metropolitan regions where urban expansion consumed soils with lower quality than non-urban soils. Urban expansion consumed high-quality soils in metropolitan regions with low per-capita built-up area, low soil quality index and peri-urban landscapes dominated by forests. Results of our study inform policies for urban containment. Design of effective measures mitigating loss of high-quality peri-urban soils requires a comprehensive understanding of multiple impacts of local socioeconomic contexts on land consumption processes.","[Zambon, Ilaria] Univ Tuscia, Dept DAFNE, Via S Camillo de Lellis Snc, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy; [Benedetti, Anna] Council Agr Res & Econ, Res Ctr Agr & Environm, Via Navicella 2-4, I-00184 Rome, Italy; [Ferrara, Carlotta; Salvati, Luca] Council Agr Res & Econ, Res Ctr Forestry & Wood, Viale S Margherita 80, I-52100 Arezzo, Italy",Tuscia University; Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA); Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA),"Ferrara, C (通讯作者)，Council Agr Res & Econ, Res Ctr Forestry & Wood, Viale S Margherita 80, I-52100 Arezzo, Italy.",carlotta.ferrara@crea.gov.it,"Salvati, Luca/AAS-6179-2021","FERRARA, Carlotta/0000-0001-5249-1196",,,,,69,153,155,0,117,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

This paper studies enrollment in a wellness program offered along an employer-provided health insurance plan. Two factors are considered in the choice of health plan with wellness: the effect of peer choices and family health on plan choice. Using exclusively obtained data of health insurance plan choice and utilization, this paper compares similar plans and focuses on a subsample of new employees. Result show that peers affect own choice of health insurance: a 10 percentage point rise in the share of colleagues enrolled in Aetna Wellness increases the probability of own enrollment in the plan by up to 3.9 percentage points. This result suggests that lack of experience with a wellness program are key to employee reluctance to enroll. Health effect on probability of enrollment in Aetna Wellness ranges from a 3 percentage point decline to a 3 percentage point rise depending on the measure, suggesting that while wellness programs appeal to low- to medium-intensity users of medical services, they do not appeal to individuals with more severe medical conditions which might benefit most from better coordinated medical care.","[Danagoulian, Shooshan] Wayne State Univ, Dept Econ, Detroit, MI 48202 USA",Wayne State University,"Danagoulian, S (通讯作者)，Wayne State Univ, Dept Econ, Detroit, MI 48202 USA.",fr4523@wayne.edu,,"Danagoulian, Shooshan/0000-0002-9916-5571",,,,,19,3,3,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",2199-9023,2199-9031,,INT J HEALTH ECON MA,Int.

This paper introduces theoretical insights from environmental political science research, which suggests that CO2 emission models would gain explanatory leverage if moderators gauging political institutions were considered. We test these theories by estimating the potentially moderating effects of democracy, corruption, number of veto points and players, and civil society activity. We find that the per capita CO2 elasticity of GDP becomes non-monotonic and diminishing as GDP per capita increases in countries with democratic non-corrupt governments and high civil society participation. The moderating impact of this political-institutional configuration is relatively small, suggesting only limited support for theories in environmental political science. However, the results are robust and add an important specification to the studies in environmental economics that find positive and monotonic GDP-CO2 relationship: the adverse effect of GDP per capita on CO2 emissions is not profound in rich well governed countries with active civil societies.","[Laegreid, Ole Martin] Uni Res Rokkan Ctr, Nygardsgaten 5, N-5015 Bergen, Norway; [Laegreid, Ole Martin; Povitkina, Marina] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Polit Sci, Box 711, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Povitkina, Marina] Qual Govt Inst, Box 711, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Lægreid, OM (通讯作者)，Uni Res Rokkan Ctr, Nygardsgaten 5, N-5015 Bergen, Norway.",ole.legreid@unl.no; marina.povitkina@gu.se,"Povitkina, Marina/V-3108-2017","Povitkina, Marina/0000-0003-2548-5027",,,,,84,62,64,2,32,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

One key concern is whether participants attentively respond to survey questions or whether they exert less than full effort. To determine the prevalence and consequences of inattention bias in surveys, we estimate how meat demand varies across people who do and do not miss trap questions. Using a split-sample design with discrete choice experiments for meat products, we explore three different trap questions to determine how many potentially inattentive respondents are identified by each method. We find that individuals who miss trap questions respond differently to the choice experiment than individuals who correctly answer the trap question. Inattention generates vastly different compensating variation estimates of a carbon tax, ranging from 3.56 cents per meal choice for the least attentive to 6.13 cents per meal choice for the most attentive.","[Malone, Trey] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Lusk, Jayson L.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Michigan State University; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Malone, T (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",tmalone@msu.edu,"Malone, Trey/IAN-7333-2023","Malone, Trey/0000-0001-8456-0862",,,,,55,21,24,0,17,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

On the one hand, this is explained by the crucial and more visible part that exports played in fostering economic growth. On the other, the reason why imports have been less studied is the high level of disaggregation of the data available. In this paper, we analyse the official Argentine statistics as the main source for a reconstruction of imports. Then, we recalculate the balance of trade using our corrected export series. Additionally, we propose a research agenda based on gaps in the specialised literature and the possibilities given by the use of the official statistics.","[Rayes, Agustina] UNCPBA, CONICET, IGEHCS, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Rayes, Agustina] Univ Nacl Ctr Prov Buenos Aires, Inst Geog Hist & Ciencias Sociales, 399 Pinto St, RA-7000 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Comision Nacional de Energia Atomica (CNEA),"Rayes, A (通讯作者)，UNCPBA, CONICET, IGEHCS, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.;Rayes, A (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Ctr Prov Buenos Aires, Inst Geog Hist & Ciencias Sociales, 399 Pinto St, RA-7000 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",arayes@utdt.edu,,"Rayes, Agustina/0000-0002-5335-0675",,,,,65,4,4,0,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,2041-3335,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

Currently, this model is hindered by the fact that estimation relies on very restrictive distributional assumptions on the behavior of incomplete information on both sides of the market. However, this reliance on specific parametric distributional assumptions can be eschewed if the scaling property is invoked. The scaling property has been well studied in the stochastic frontier literature, but as of yet, has not been used in the two-tier frontier setting.","[Parmeter, Christopher F.] Univ Miami, Miami, FL 33136 USA",University of Miami,"Parmeter, CF (通讯作者)，Univ Miami, Miami, FL 33136 USA.",cparmeter@bus.miami.edu,,"Parmeter, Christopher/0000-0001-6123-0107",,,,,33,21,21,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

It focuses on analyzing the return properties of securities on the stock market using higher moments of the return distribution viz., skewness and kurtosis. This is in recognition of the fact that return distributions are not normally distributed as assumed by Standard Mean-Variance portfolio models. Consequently, it would help the investors in their forecast of market risk and portfolio adjustments with the help of studying these higher moments to access the risk and return trade-off. This particular analysis, which tests for the significance of higher moments, is likely to yield a deeper insight into the dynamics of stock market crises and booms. Moreover, the attempt here is to describe the stylised facts at a fundamental level to comprehend the extent of diversion from the normal and the reason's causing the difference. Thus, when the fluctuating nature of Indian stock market is correlated with these rudimentary factors it would yield a model of the risk factors of the stock market in different phases of the market.","[Barodawala, Rubina; Ranawat, Diksha] Maharaja Sayajirao Univ Baroda, Fac Arts, Dept Econ, Vadodara 390002, Gujarat, India",Maharaja Sayajirao University Baroda,"Barodawala, R (通讯作者)，Maharaja Sayajirao Univ Baroda, Fac Arts, Dept Econ, Vadodara 390002, Gujarat, India.",rubina.barodawala-be@msubaroda.ac.in; diksharanawat10@gmail.com,"Barodawala, Rubina/JJF-6250-2023","Barodawala, Rubina/0000-0003-4124-4055",,,,,37,0,0,0,5,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-99555-7; 978-3-319-99554-0,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,69,86,,10.1007/978-3-319-99555-7_5,0.0,,,18,"Business; Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BL7MM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455194200006,0

The article proposes a way to model the empirical data for societal utilization; supporting future efforts to promote UD. First, we analyze the relationships between personal, processual, organizational and societal factors, and how the different critical success criteria work together to positively influence the projects in our sample. Next, we apply Hertzberg and Fogg's theories to classify the CSC as triggers, facilitators, motivators or hygiene factors. Based on this deeper understanding, we model the data and propose 3 trigger factors for UD of ICT. Using our model, we propose the following three strategies, which have a high effect potential for triggering the triggers: 1) Legal interventions, 2) Awareness interventions, and 3) Training interventions. The contribution of the article is theoretical: a) providing richer insights into empirical data, by modeling their relationships, and b) predicting the impact of future interventions on the ICT-industry based on our modeled findings.","[Begnum, Miriam Eileen Nes] NTNU Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Design, Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Begnum, MEN (通讯作者)，NTNU Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Design, Trondheim, Norway.",,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,1,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-9630,1879-8365,978-1-61499-923-2; 978-1-61499-922-5,STUD HEALTH TECHNOL,,,2018,256.0,,,,,,161,170,,10.3233/978-1-61499-923-2-161,0.0,,,10,"Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7JT,30371471.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455118100016,0

The main reason for visiting, for most tourists, is a favourable Mediterranean climate and the sea, so most of the arrivals take place during the summer (very seasonal) and in the coastal part of Croatia. Along with relatively low rates of expenditure per tourist, these are the biggest problems of Croatian tourism. At the same time, tourism is a very dynamic phenomenon and competition is increasing at international tourism market. That is why receptive tourist destinations must constantly improve tourist offer to keep the old tourists and attract new ones. Therefore, in recent years, Croatia has had a strong tendency to extend the tourist season and to attract tourists to other parts of Croatia, too. One of the ways to do so, is to stimulate the development of various forms of special interest tourism, among which the Event tourism is one of its most promising forms in Croatia. In this process, the city of Zagreb stands out, because in the last decade, there has been noticed a rapid development and growth of tourism, which was mostly influenced by the development of various events in Zagreb. The aim of the paper is to show the influence of events in the development of tourism in Zagreb. Secondary sources of data will be used mostly. After a brief theoretical overview of the importance of event tourism in the development of tourist destinations, the second part analyses the impact of event planning in Zagreb on the increase of tourist revenue over the past decade. At the beginning there will be a theoretical overview of the development of events and their role in the development of tourist destinations. In second part analyses the impact of event planning in Zagreb on tourism development over the past decade. The following section gives analyse the role of the Croatians tourism boards in crating and planning events which take over the role of destination management organizations, especially in sphere of developing event tourism in some tourists' destinations. They do that with an idea of developing more quality tourist offer in Croatia, and in paper that will be shown on example of event tourism development in the city Zagreb. The last part of the paper will consist of the conclusion and suggestions that can help further the development of sustainable tourism in the city of Zagreb in order to focus on the numerous positive effects of tourism on a local level, through careful planning and development of tourism, and to minimize or completely neutralize negative effects of tourism development in a tourist destination.","[Bucar, Kristina; Hendija, Zvjezdana] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia; [Juratek, Zrinka] Turisticka Zajedn Grada Zagreba, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Bucar, K (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia.",kbucar@efzg.hr; zhendija@efzg.hr; juratek@infozagreb.hr,"Bucar, Kristina/AAY-4377-2021; Bučar, Kristina/AAJ-6934-2020","Bučar, Kristina/0000-0002-0920-0661",,,,,26,1,1,0,7,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,728,737,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900075,0

In practice, this equates to contemporary legal understandings vs religious understandings. The paper further aims to provide an overview of competing Muslim understandings regarding the concept of What does or does not constitute halal slaughter? In practice, this equates to evaluating the application of no stunning at all upon an animal (unanimous acceptance) vs the application of reversible stunning upon an animal (contested). Design/methodology/approach The study includes a review of prior literature and considers the current scenario of the halal poultry trade and raises important questions regarding Islamic dietary practices, halal food integrity, religious and animal welfare understandings. Three key questions were raised: To what extent does stunning impact halal slaughter?; Who determines what is halal slaughter?; and What are the variations and tensions between legal and religious understandings of halal slaughter?. Findings The examination of such requirements and concomitant consumer and provider expectations is underpinned by a study of an operational framework, i.e. industry practices with poultry (hand slaughter, stunning, mechanical slaughter, etc.), ethical values and market forces to appraise whether there is a point of convergence for these that can be beneficial for both seller and consumer concerns. This paper has considered different perspectives on the religious slaughter and provided an overview of competing understandings regarding the above concepts. Originality/value This study although academic and philosophical in nature, raises questions on route to suggesting future research directions. It provides real value in stimulating more research in the area of halal food production and contributes to the understanding of different slaughter requirements for religious slaughter and the meat industry. It further sheds light on not only the religious and secular legal frameworks on animal slaughter and welfare but also the variations in understanding between them and provides examples of attempts to bridge any gap. The paper highlights the importance of halal food based on religious values and its implications for wider society.","[Chandia, Mahmood] Univ Cent Lancashire, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Preston, Lancs, England; [Soon, Jan Mei] Univ Cent Lancashire, Sch Sport & Wellbeing, Preston, Lancs, England",University of Central Lancashire; University of Central Lancashire,"Soon, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Cent Lancashire, Sch Sport & Wellbeing, Preston, Lancs, England.",mchandia@uclan.ac.uk; jmsoon@uclan.ac.uk,,"Soon-Sinclair, Jan Mei/0000-0003-0488-1434",,,,,94,12,14,0,27,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Also, the study offers food companies the most relevant motivations and barriers of consumers for their engagement to this initiative. Also, the study provides categories of foods that consumers would purchase via these chains in each country.

Design/methodology/approach A total of 20 children (age 4-6) performed one open sort and four closed card sorts about food preferences, perceived healthiness and perceived parental preferences using branded and non-branded food image cards. Descriptive statistics were calculated and major themes were identified from the verbatim transcripts. Findings The children chose whole fruit over branded and bagged apple slices, stating whole fruit would be tastier, healthier and more likely parent approved. When apples were sliced and bagged, perceived taste and healthiness perceptions were variable. Packaged foods were more challenging for the children to conceptualize. Presented with eight options, french fries were the favorite choice as the children did not believe fruit or vegetable side dishes should accompany a cheeseburger. Research limitations/implications Only children's perceptions and not actual eating behaviors were measured. It was a small sample (n=20) with limited sample diversity that would not be representative of all children. Practical implications Packaging and branding a healthy food item with a fast food logo did not increase the item's appeal to the children. Branding healthy foods in this manner may not lead to increased consumption. Originality/value The impact of branding healthy items on very young children's perceptions has rarely been examined. Most of the research on branded food items has focused on high calorie processed foods. Using a card sort exercise allowed children, too young to read and write, to articulate similarities, differences and motivations around food preferences.","[Kellershohn, Julie; Walley, Keith; Vriesekoop, Frank] Harper Adams Univ Coll, Dept Food Sci & Agri Food Supply Chain Management, Newport, Shrops, England",Harper Adams University,"Kellershohn, J (通讯作者)，Harper Adams Univ Coll, Dept Food Sci & Agri Food Supply Chain Management, Newport, Shrops, England.",juliekellershohn@gmail.com; kwalley@harper-adams.ac.uk; FVriesekoop@harper-adams.ac.uk,"Kellershohn, Julie/AAR-4556-2020; Vriesekoop, Frank/ABC-4768-2020","Kellershohn, Julie/0000-0002-6616-5989",,,,,32,4,4,3,15,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Through Universal Design, the aim is to enable students to 'Get connected' and 'Stay connected'. Universal Design for Learning is explored through changes in curriculum design as a means of enhancing student engagement [1]. The Universal Design framework is structured into three strands; providing multiple means of representation; providing multiple means of action and expression and providing multiple means of engagements. The broader perspectives of Universal Design are considered at Institutional level. Resources, practices and attitudes, Michael Fullan suggests, are the three critical elements required for change to occur [2]. 'The Power of Moments' [3] and why certain experiences have extraordinary impact, coupled with underpinning Universal Design for Learning guidelines is considered in curriculum design and how they may enable meaningful engagements.The role of creativity and innovation suggests a way of interlacing universal design with the power of moments, acknowledging the critical elements for change to move from UDL exploration to integration. This paper highlights case studies where all these interrelated forces intertwine with emotional learning and how embedding Universal Design enables transformation. These are design models and are still to be evaluated.","[Kinsella, Margaret] Inst Technol, Blanchardstown Rd North, Dublin 15, Ireland",,"Kinsella, M (通讯作者)，Inst Technol, Blanchardstown Rd North, Dublin 15, Ireland.",margaret.kinsella@itb.ie,,,,,,,11,0,1,1,11,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-9630,1879-8365,978-1-61499-923-2; 978-1-61499-922-5,STUD HEALTH TECHNOL,,,2018,256.0,,,,,,107,118,,10.3233/978-1-61499-923-2-107,0.0,,,12,"Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7JT,30371465.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455118100011,0

As independent directors (IDs) have been viewed as a mechanism to deter corporate misconducts, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the influences of the ratio of IDs on the board, IDs' industrial experience and their participation in corporate governance training courses on food firms' unethical production practices. Design/methodology/approach This study is based on a sample of 239 firm-year observations in Taiwanese food industries. The Poisson model with fixed effects was used to test the research hypotheses. Findings The results show that board independence and IDs with food industry expertise were not effective in deterring food firms from unethical production practices. The expected monitoring function of IDs would only realize when they complete a sufficient number of corporate governance training courses. These courses can make IDs aware of their responsibilities and roles in governing firms. Originality/value This study is the first to identify the effects of corporate governance practices on food firms' unethical production practices. The value of this study may provide food firms practical solutions that enable corporate executives to behave ethically.","[Liu, Chia-Yi] Tunghai Univ, Management Div, Dept Food Sci, Taichung, Taiwan; [Lee, Cheng-Yu] Southern Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Management & Informat, Tainan, Taiwan; [Tsai, Hsin-Ju Stephie] Univ Manchester, Sch Mat, Manchester, Lancs, England",Tunghai University; Southern Taiwan University of Science & Technology; University of Manchester,"Lee, CY (通讯作者)，Southern Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Management & Informat, Tainan, Taiwan.",cylee@mail.stust.edu.tw,"Tsai, Stephie/O-6469-2015","Tsai, Stephie/0000-0003-1208-2333; Lee, Cheng-Yu/0000-0003-4310-5331; Liu, Chia-Yi/0000-0002-4078-2313",,,,,60,1,1,1,13,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Ecosystem satellite accounts should be able to include cultural ecosystem services, which raise numerous assessment difficulties. A new assessment method is proposed, which uses the production for own use of households who carry out recreational activities depending on cultural ecosystem services. An application is carried out in the Gulf of Saint-Malo (France). A survey was implemented in order to collect the accounting data. Six recreational activities mixing the consumption of pure leisure (mainly sport) and marine cultural ecosystem services (mainly fishing and seascape watching) were considered: onshore fishing and shellfish gathering; hiking; recreational boating and offshore fishing; canoeing and kayaking; light sailing; scuba-diving and underwater fishing. The results show that the household production value for these six marine and coastal recreational activities in the Gulf of Saint-Malo ranges between 210 M and 276 M, contributing to 97% of the output of recreational services for these activities. It means that the current national accounting system captures only 3% of the output of marine recreational activities. About 82% of production means are devoted to the consumption cultural ecosystem services, while the remaining part of the production value is assigned to the consumption of sportive services. Hence, the production value associated to the main uses of marine cultural ecosystem services can be estimated at between 172 and 226 M, with respective value-added of 110 M and 154 M. These results definitively point out the necessity of distinguishing recreational services which depend only on human activities from cultural ecosystem services which depend on outputs from ecosystem processes, in order to avoid over-estimating or confusing estimates of marine cultural ecosystem services.

Furthermore, attitudes towards the application of carmine, being technically important and ubiquitously used to impart red shades, are assessed and analysed. Originating from insects, carmine is considered as natural but may arouse disgust. Design/methodology/approach - In total, 625 individuals were surveyed using an online, self-administered questionnaire to represent a broad cross-section of the German population. Findings - Independent of their origin, the application of colourants was rejected by 57.0 per cent of the interviewees. In total, 31.8 per cent of the participants stated a neutral attitude, while only 11.2 per cent expressed a positive notion. Most respondents preferred colourants from natural sources to artificial ones. While consumers perceive natural food colourants composed of genuine plant pigments positively, 61.6 per cent of respondents disliked the application of animal-derived colourants, 24.8 per cent of them did neither reject nor like it, and only 13.6 per cent of the interviewees stated a positive attitude towards them. The findings of this paper further indicate consumers' preference for colourants to be either artificial or plant-derived rather than carmine. Food colourants are being rejected, possibly due to misleading information and confusing labelling. Consequently, information about carmine, including its origin and production, did not increase the aversion to products that are dyed with it, but increased their acceptance. Originality/value -This study outlines consumer perception and attitudes towards food colourants. For the first time, the findings of this paper report the effect of revealing information about an additive, which initially aroused disgust, and its influence on consumer perception.","[Mueller-Maatsch, Judith; Henn, Katharina; Gras, Claudia; Carle, Reinhold] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Food Sci & Biotechnol, Dept Plant Foodstuff Technol & Anal, Stuttgart, Germany; [Jasny, Johannes] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Agr Policy & Markets, Dept Agr Markets & Mkt, Stuttgart, Germany; [Carle, Reinhold] King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",University Hohenheim; University Hohenheim; King Abdulaziz University,"Müller-Maatsch, J (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Inst Food Sci & Biotechnol, Dept Plant Foodstuff Technol & Anal, Stuttgart, Germany.",J.Mueller-Maatsch@uni-hohenheim.de,,"Jasny, Johannes/0000-0003-3014-522X; Henn, Katharina/0000-0002-9883-5238; Muller-Maatsch, Judith/0000-0001-6782-6315",,,,,42,2,2,1,17,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

This paper builds a framework for understanding two current notions of UD and accessibility in Denmark. Implications are that understandings and motivations of UD and accessibility from architects' and users' perspective are asymmetrical. In collaborative relationships, UD and accessibility are seen from an architectural design perspective and a human rights perspective respectively. This influences the dialogue and cooperation of the two parties. Reflecting the possibility to further a comprehensive understanding of spatial implication of UD, this paper aims to contribute with a clarification and a discussion of the two perspectives. Within the architectural field, Disabled People's Organisations Denmark (DPOD) is one of the key actors in user participatory processes related to UD and accessibility, and the organisations play an important role in a Danish discourse. Through observations and interviews with DPOD user representation and practicing architects, the paper sheds light on the central notions of UD and accessibility - a spatial quality perception and a spatial equality perception.

That leads to a necessity for consolidation of HEIs and optimization of their administrative structures. At the same time, higher education (HE) normative regulations apply new tasks and responsibilities for HEIs (e.g., the development of internal quality management systems, strategy management,- etc.) which require new administrative functions, structures and additional resources. These controversial circumstances aren't supportive for HEIs' institutional management to develop processes in accordance with management by objectives (MBO) approach and to reach goals and objectives in HE studies and research. The aim of the paper is to research problems which interfere the development of organizational structures in accordance with the MBO approach in HEIs in Latvia. The authors have used the results from the HEIs' survey (DU, LLU, LU, LiepU, RSU, RTU) and interviews (ViA, VeA, JVLMA, BA, RPIVA (since 2017 consolidated with LU), LSPA) in Latvia. The paper is developed using research of the promotional thesis,Implementation of management by objectives approaches at higher education institutions in Latvia (Stefenhagena, 2017). The research of the promotional thesis was carried out from 2010 to 2017. The conclusion of the paper is that HEIs' organizational structures are fragmented, and there is a tendency of duplicating administrative functions and duties. In order to apply MBO approach, a more sufficient analysis of administrative functions, processes, goals and objectives have to be carried out. Horizontal instead of vertical (hierarchic) cooperation among administrative units is encouraged.","[Stefenhagena, Dita] Latvian Trade Union Educ & Sci Employees LIZDA, Riga, Latvia; [Bariss, Voldemars] Latvia Univ Life Sci & Technol LLU, Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,"Stefenhagena, D (通讯作者)，Latvian Trade Union Educ & Sci Employees LIZDA, Riga, Latvia.",,,,,,,,10,0,1,1,11,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,2255-9930,978-9984-48-294-1,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2018,49.0,,,,,,411,418,,10.22616/ESRD.2018.160,0.0,,,8,Development Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO1ZQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000503493500048,0

This experiment explores the potential to leverage valuation research for the purpose of enhancing charitable contributions in a manner consistent with developing markets for ecosystem-service public goods; we focus on individuals' willingness to contribute revenue. The direct-mail marketing experiment collected over $16,000 through four provision point, money-back guarantee mechanisms: a voluntary contribution mechanism with a proportional rebate; a pivotal mechanism based on the Clarke tax; and two novel uniform price mechanisms, each presented in discrete choice and open-ended response formats. We find thatcitizens do respond strategically: consistently lower offers in the open-ended format suggest a high incidence of cheap riding, but also a significant effect of higher suggested offer thresholds. These framing effects dominated differences among mechanisms, as revenue generated from the proportional rebate and one of the uniform price mechanisms approached the potential for revenue generation estimated under the incentive compatible pivotal mechanism.

Design/methodology/approach Data related to solid and liquid food waste were recorded from 100 households for one week. The study primarily focussed on avoidable food waste, however, unavoidable and potentially avoidable food waste were also measured. Appropriate tools and manual were provided to the households to ensure data consistency. Findings Estimated quantity of total food waste (including liquid waste) per capita is 68.04kg/year. In all, 48.70 per cent of total food waste would have been avoidable (equals to 33.14kg/capita/year). Most frequently wasted food categories were meals and bakery products. In case of some demographic categories, different wastage levels were observed. It was also confirmed that income has effect on food waste production that varies by foodstuff categories: bakery product waste was mainly dominant for middle income consumers and fresh fruits were typically wasted by more affluent households. Apart from that, higher income resulted in higher food waste production in general. Practical implications This primary data set about avoidable food waste in Hungary contributes with relevant information to the refining of international estimates. Having specific data on food wastage and the most affected target groups, as well as information on the impact of the income can be applied in planning awareness raising campaigns. Originality/value The research is based on measurement of food waste categories in households resulting in detailed data sets. This study is one of the first investigations based on primary data collection from the eastern part of Central Europe and the very first related to Hungary. The study draws attention also to the influence that household income exerts on the issue of food waste.","[Szabo-Bodi, Barbara; Kasza, Gyula; Szakos, David] Natl Food Chain Safety Off, Directorate Food Safety Risk Assessment, Budapest, Hungary",,"Szabó-Bódi, B (通讯作者)，Natl Food Chain Safety Off, Directorate Food Safety Risk Assessment, Budapest, Hungary.",bodiba@nebih.gov.hu; kaszagy@nebih.gov.hu; szakosd@nebih.gov.hu,,"Kasza, Gyula/0000-0003-3120-2820; Szakos, David/0000-0002-0280-0090",European Union's LIFE Programme [LIFE15 GIE/HU/001048],European Union's LIFE Programme,"This research is co-funded by European Union's LIFE Programme, identification number: LIFE15 GIE/HU/001048.

The most common way of such cooperation is functioning within purchasing organizations. They are a type of organizations where there are no capital ties. They are created in all industries and are managed through a separate company, a central unit. This unit is often called a purchasing group or a central group of the purchasing group. It is the 'brain' of the entire organization, and in principle it depends on its effectiveness whether the purchasing group will achieve the intended results. In order the central unit could run effectively the entire purchasing group, it must have a stable financial base and, above all, have a positive working capital.

Using Bresnahan and Reiss (1991) as the conceptual framework, we study how competition and firm heterogeneity relate to premiums in 36 states using Federally Facilitated or Supported Marketplaces in 2016. Our primary data source is the Qualified Health Plan Landscape File, augmented with market characteristics from the American Community Survey and Area Health Resource File as well as insurer-level information from federal Medical Loss Ratio annual reports. We first estimate a model of insurer entry and then investigate the relationship between a market's predicted number of entrants and insurer-level premiums. Our entry model results suggest that competition is increasing with the number of insurers, most notably as the market size increases from 3 to 4 entrants. Results from the premium regression suggest that each additional entrant is associated with approximately 4% lower premiums, controlling for other factors. An alternative explanation for the relationship between entrants and premiums is that more efficient insurers (who can price lower) are the ones that enter markets with many entrants, and this is reflected in lower premiums. An exploratory analysis of insurers' non-claims costs (a proxy for insurer efficiency) reveals that average costs among entrants are rising slightly with the number of insurers in the market. This pattern does not support the hypothesis that premiums decrease with more entrants because those entrants are more efficient, suggesting instead that the results are being driven mostly by price competition.","[Abraham, Jean Marie; Drake, Coleman] Univ Minnesota, Div Hlth Policy & Management, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [McCullough, Jeffrey S.] Univ Michigan, Hlth Policy & Management, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Simon, Kosali] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN USA; [Simon, Kosali] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Abraham, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Div Hlth Policy & Management, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",abrah042@umn.edu,,"Drake, Coleman/0000-0002-0618-0626; simon, kosali/0000-0002-3231-1466",Federal Office of Rural Health Policy [5U1CRH03717],Federal Office of Rural Health Policy,Funding was provided by Federal Office of Rural Health Policy (Grant No. 5U1CRH03717).,,35,11,15,1,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",2199-9023,2199-9031,,INT J HEALTH ECON MA,Int.

We analyse the role of trust in participant's willingness to self-restrict resource use and collaborate with the authorities. Contrary to game behaviour in the industrialized world, we find that amongst the Tsimane' extractions decrease across rounds. We also find that participants who trust a) non-Tsimane' and b) the authorities extract less than other participants, but findings are not robust across rounds. Using the economic and anthropological literature, we interpret the findings arguing that trust in non-Tsimane', which is strongly correlated with market access, may capture generalized trust levels and that people with higher levels of generalized trust interact more easily in non-personal transactions, like the situation presented in the game. As co-management also entails non-personal interactions with and trust in the authorities, our findings seem relevant for community-based conservation and co-management. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A. Lewis, exports of primary products have been deemed the main or sole source of growth in tropical countries before the Great Depression. However, this conventional wisdom relies on very limited evidence. This article analyses the growth of exports with a constant market share analysis for 84 tropical polities. Exports grew a lot, but less than total trade, while relative prices of tropical products remained roughly constant. We thus tentatively infer that the decline in the tropical shares of world trade reflects an insufficient demand for tropical products. Asia dealt well with these headwinds throughout the whole period, while African polities blossomed after the First World War. The loser was (South) America, and most notably the Caribbean former slave colonies, especially before 1870.","[Federico, Giovanni] Univ Pisa, Pisa, Italy; [Tena-Junguito, Antonio] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Getafe, Spain",University of Pisa; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Federico, G (通讯作者)，Univ Pisa, Pisa, Italy.",,,"Tena-Junguito, Antonio/0000-0002-7845-5406","European Research Council [230484]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2011-25713, ECO2014-58784-P]; European Research Council (ERC) [230484] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)",European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"Early versions of this article benefited from the discussions at African Economic History Workshop (London School of Economics, 24-5 Oct. 2014), IV Asian Historical Economics Conference (Istanbul, 19-20 Sept. 2014), III Center for Economic Policy Research Workshop (Oslo, 19-20 June 2015), and Seminario Internacional 'La era de las exportaciones' (El Colegio de Mexico, 17 Feb. 2015).

However, choosing the right measures demands considering their potential contribution in reducing the environmental impact and advancing urban sustainability. In recent years, some attempts to assess the contribution of implementing various measures have been advanced by various researchers focusing on different components of urban environmental interactions. While these studies make a significant contribution towards the understanding of the impact of various measures taken for a specific environmental issue, they mostly ignore the diversity and complexity of the urban interface with the environment at different spatial scales, as well as the ecological economics perspective, which approaches the city as a system. This paper uses the UBSI index published recently in this journal, to evaluate the urban biophysical sustainability of the city of Tel Aviv-Jaffa (Israel) in 2014. Based on this data, future scenarios are developed, which examine the potential contribution of various policy measures and different technological processes to the city's sustainability.

Traditional views on female entrepreneurship in nineteenth- and twentieth-century England point towards a decline in the number and relevance of women as business owners in comparison to the eighteenth century, and their retreat into a 'separate sphere' away from the world of trade and production. Recent studies, however, have deeply challenged this view, suggesting that women still played an important role as entrepreneurs during industrialization and beyond. Nevertheless, a number of questions remain unanswered with regard to the features of female entrepreneurship during these phases of British history, and issues such as scale of operation, attitude to risk, credit structure, and managerial styles are still widely debated. Using original sources, this article provides a novel view on these issues, analysing female entrepreneurship from the perspective of bankruptcy. Analysing statistics on women's bankruptcy derived from Board of Trade reports, as well as a sample of archival cases, this article argues that overall female business owners traded in ways similar to their male counterparts in terms of business size, risk-taking, and, eventually, success.","[Aston, Jennifer] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Di Martino, Paolo] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",University of Oxford; University of Birmingham,"Aston, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford, England.",,"Aston, Jennifer/AAH-8023-2020","Aston, Jennifer/0000-0002-6392-4652",Birmingham Business School; Economic History Society; Institute of Historical Research,Birmingham Business School; Economic History Society; Institute of Historical Research,"We are indebted for comments and criticisms to participants at the Economic History Society Annual Conference (Warwick, March 2014) and the Association of Business Historians Annual Conference (Newcastle, June 2014), as well as at seminars at the University of Birmingham, Oxford, and Pisa, at the Institute of Historical Research London, and at the 15eme Journee d'etudes sur les faillites, Universite Paris Ouest, Nanterre.

Therefore, the proposed model is offering a more flexible approach to intertemporal efficiency assessment. The other main contribution is the establishment of indicators, TPR and IPR, which are used to identify the influences of frontier shift and individual change on efficiency.

The influence of this small country was substantial at some point in the negotiation processes and on important features of the protocols. The main explanatory factors for this influence are identified as the competence and the tactical skills of the Swiss delegations as well as the flexible and timely mandates they received. This was reinforced by the way the position formation process was organized at the domestic level, namely a lead ministry strongly committed to the process and an efficient coordination between domestic actors, including the delegations. The Swiss delegations were thus able to support the progress of the negotiations, and in parallel to secure some of their interest, by assuming entrepreneurial and intellectual leadership strategies in function of the evolution of domestic and international constraints and opportunities.","[Schulz, Tobias] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Hufty, Marc] Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies IHEID, Chemin Eugene Rigot 2, CH-1201 Geneva, Switzerland; [Tschopp, Maurice] Univ Bern, CDE, Hallerstr 10, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; University of Bern","Hufty, M (通讯作者)，Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies IHEID, Chemin Eugene Rigot 2, CH-1201 Geneva, Switzerland.",tobias.schulz@wsl.ch; marc.hufty@graduateinstitute.ch; maurice.tschopp@cde.unibe.ch,"Schulz, Tobias/E-8129-2014","Schulz, Tobias/0000-0003-1307-778X; Hufty, Marc/0000-0003-2502-6867",Swiss State Secretariat for Education and Research (COST Section),Swiss State Secretariat for Education and Research (COST Section),"We acknowledge the financial support of the Swiss State Secretariat for Education and Research (COST Section) for the project 'Can small players make a difference?

By matching hedonic happiness in a nationally representative survey with daily air quality data according to the dates and counties of interviews in China, we are able to estimate the relationship between local concentration of particulate matter and individual happiness. By holding happiness constant, we calculate the tradeoff between the reduction in particulate matter and income, essentially a happiness-based measure of willingness-to-pay for mitigating air pollution.

Do households view the different modes of recycling as substitutes or complements of each other? Does this perceived relationship depend on the type of material recycled? Using data for all of the UK's local governments from 2004Q2 to 2013Q3 we analyse the nature of the relationship between the two main channels of recycling. In the case of dry recycling, the empirical findings are ambiguous on the trade-off between kerbside and non-kerbside recycling. On the one hand, the findings suggest that there is no trade-off when considering the effect of expanding kerbside provision. On the other hand, the findings also suggest that there is a trade-off when we focus on the effect of expanding non-kerbside provision. However, putting together the empirical findings with theory (in particular, the symmetry property of the Hicksian substitution effect) suggests that there is a trade-off irrespective of whether we consider expansion of kerbside or non-kerbside provision. In the case of green (compost) recycling the empirical findings on their own or together with theory unambiguously suggest that there is a trade-off. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Multi-criteria assessments (MCAs), which allow the comparison of alternative actions when multiple interests collide, are considered adequate to support landscape management. However, there is no consensus about how they should be applied and can integrate both multiple views and spatial dimension. We conducted an extensive quantitative and qualitative literature review targeting MCAs with a participatory and spatial approach. Our results suggest that (1) for sustainability assessments, participatory and spatial approaches endorse different rationales and hybrid methods are not so common; (2) within those methods, only scenario selection methods (as opposed to design methods) can integrate spatially-explicit, spatially-implicit, place specific, and overall values; and (3) current applications, which aggregate values ignoring their spatial and social distribution, do not coincide with the nature of landscape-management challenges. In addition, they give little importance to the structuration of information and to collective deliberation. We conclude that, in the absence of a good match between spatiality and participation, MCAs should, for now, be handled as insightful but distorted tools to explore and structure landscape-level management problems.

The data used in the analysis includes all firms employing 19+ workers in Turkish manufacturing industry. Growth accounting results show that the contributions of conventional and ICT capital to value added growth are not significantly different from each other. On the other hand, results based both on static (fixed-effects) and dynamic panel data analysis highlight the positive influence on firms' productivity exerted by ICT capital. The findings show that the impact of ICT capital on productivity is larger by about 25 to 50% than that of conventional capital. This contribution of ICT capital is higher than that of non-ICT capital for small sized and low-tech firms. Our findings imply that investing in ICT capital increases firm productivity by increasing the productivity of labor and also that convention growth accounting approaches may not be adequate to identify such linkages.","[Kilicaslan, Yilmaz] Anadolu Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, TR-26470 Eskisehir, Turkey; [Sickles, Robin C.] Rice Univ, Dept Econ, Houston, TX USA; [Kayis, Aliye Atay] Suleyman Demirel Univ, Dept Econometr, Isparta, Turkey; [Gurel, Yesim Ucdogruk] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Dept Econ, Izmir, Turkey",Anadolu University; Rice University; Suleyman Demirel University; Dokuz Eylul University,"Kiliçaslan, Y (通讯作者)，Anadolu Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, TR-26470 Eskisehir, Turkey.",ykilicaslan@anadolu.edu.tr,"Gürel, Yeşim/T-1247-2019; Sickles, Robin/IRZ-2742-2023; KILICASLAN, YILMAZ/T-6263-2018","KILICASLAN, YILMAZ/0000-0003-0222-2259; Sickles, Robin/0000-0002-5575-7137","Scientific Research Commission of Anadolu University, Eskisehir, Turkey [BAP-1210E155]","Scientific Research Commission of Anadolu University, Eskisehir, Turkey","This study is a part of project BAP-1210E155 supported by the Scientific Research Commission of Anadolu University, Eskisehir, Turkey.

This article investigates how the Bureau du Commerce, a small state agency in charge of commerce and the supply side, handed out rents and privileges to private entrepreneurs. We coded how the Bureau investigated and decided all 267 voluntary submissions received between 1724 and 1744. It is shown that the Bureau's formal, rule-based decision-making process could actually differentiate between alternate policy aims and target them consistently over time, with more or less powerful sets of rents. From this, a hierarchy of revealed policy preferences is derived. First comes technical innovation and diffusion, then local economic development; import substitution is only in the third position, followed by consumers' welfare. Lastly, and in contrast to a long line of authors, it is shown that the production of luxury goods was not a significant or valued objective.","[Beuve, Jean] Univ Paris 01, Paris, France; [Brousseau, Eric] Univ Paris 09, PSL Res Univ, Paris, France; [Sgard, Jerome] Sci Po, Paris, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po),"Beuve, J (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, Paris, France.",,,,,,,,83,3,6,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

However, the bioenergy industry faces a well-established chicken and egg conundrum where biorefineries cannot be built until adequate farmers' participation in cellulosic biomass production is ensured; on the other hand, farmers will not commit to growing cellulosic biomass until a market is established. We assume that individual farmers in a future biofuel market are boundedly rational, and will endure the risk of growing switchgrass if they are likely to receive a better payoff in the future. After the number of switchgrass farmers reaches a certain threshold, sufficient biomass can be procured to build an economically viable biorefinery. If a biorefinery is built in a region, the reductions of logistics costs and economies of scale lead to the realization of a public good, and all farmers can be benefited from it; otherwise, the efforts of early switchgrass adopters could be unsuccessful.

This paper analyses the heterogeneity of motivations to adopt silvopastoral practices, a social-ecological innovation for soil conservation and carbon emission reduction. We use Qmethodology to identify smallholders' views with regard to these practices in a community in the forest frontier in Chiapas (Mexico). The analysis uncovers three main perspectives: self-sufficient pioneers, environmentally-conscious followers and payment-dependent conservatives. We discuss these perspectives around three topics: smallholders' predisposition to adopt silvopastoral practices, their views about needing external payments to sustain their livelihood and the diffusion of innovative sustainable practices. We relate these perspectives with livelihood characteristics and with observed adoption levels under a pilot programme to promote silvopasture. Our findings suggest that incentives other than payments may be more appropriate for those more likely to adopt, and that payments could encourage rent-seeking strategies and not necessarily promote permanent behavioural change. We suggest ways for designing more effective and adaptive environmental conservation programmes to foster adoption and continuation of social-ecological innovations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

With a view to close this research gap, the article empirically assesses the assumption that TMNs are a viable substitute for ambitious international action under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It addresses the aggregate phenomenon in terms of geographical distribution, central players, mitigation ambition and monitoring provisions. Examining thirteen networks, it finds that membership in TMNs is skewed toward Europe and North America while countries from the Global South are underrepresented; that only a minority of networks commit to quantified emission reductions and that these are not more ambitious than Parties to the UNFCCC; and finally that the monitoring provisions are fairly limited. In sum, the article shows that transnational municipal networks are not (yet) the representative, ambitious and transparent player they are thought to be.","[Bansard, Jennifer S.] Univ Potsdam, DFG Res Training Grp WIPCAD 1744 1, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Sigmaringerstr 34, D-10713 Berlin, Germany; [Pattberg, Philipp H.; Widerberg, Oscar] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Environm Policy Anal Dept, Inst Environm Studies, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Potsdam; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Pattberg, PH (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Environm Policy Anal Dept, Inst Environm Studies, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",Jennifer.bansard@gmail.com; philipp.pattberg@vu.nl; oscar.widerberg@vu.nl,"; Pattberg, Philipp/J-4141-2012","Widerberg, Oscar/0000-0002-8088-3709; Pattberg, Philipp/0000-0003-1136-7791",,,,,74,113,118,2,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Ecological challenges and conditions of growth during the agricultural revolution in southern Sweden, c. 1700-1900",ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Was there an agro-ecological crisis in Europe which preceded and contributed to pushing forward the agricultural revolution? This article presents a new theoretical and empirical approach to this controversial perspective on agricultural transformation and relates to an ongoing debate on conditions of growth in pre-industrial societies. The results demonstrate that there were indeed indicators of a crisis, which grew stronger during the eighteenth century and culminated in the early nineteenth century. The crisis was, however, not general, but was rather restricted to areas that stand out due to poor natural conditions for agriculture. In other words, the crisis was conditional. Furthermore, the findings show that the crisis could push forward changes that were important for enabling agricultural transformation and growth. However, both the emergence and reversal of the crisis were connected to new opportunities opened up by market development. Enough differences were found between different types of regions to suggest that there were many development paths within the agricultural transformation process, and that they were not necessarily linear.","[Bohman, Magnus] Umea Univ, Dept Geog & Econ Hist, Umea, Sweden",Umea University,"Bohman, M (通讯作者)，Umea Univ, Dept Geog & Econ Hist, Umea, Sweden.",magnus.bohman@ekhist.umu.se,,,Ebbe Kock's Foundation; Crafoord Foundation; Birgit and Gad Rausing's Foundation,Ebbe Kock's Foundation; Crafoord Foundation; Birgit and Gad Rausing's Foundation,"The author wishes to acknowledge Ebbe Kock's Foundation, the Crafoord Foundation, and Birgit and Gad Rausing's Foundation for financial support during the work on this research.

J,"Tong, YD",,,,Yen Dan Tong,,,"Rice Intensive Cropping and Balanced Cropping in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam - Economic and Ecological Considerations",ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Agricultural economics; Balanced cropping; Environmental economics; Intensive cropping,BIODIVERSITY,"Rice intensification in Vietnam relies on the construction of high dykes in the Mekong Delta floodplain to prevent flood waters from entering fields during the flood season. This enables three rice crops to be grown annually instead of two. On the floodplain, two rice crops can be described as balanced cropping since it has a long fallow period, which conforms to good agricultural practices, and also takes advantage of the flood's benefits. For example, it integrates the natural fish, other aquatic animals, and flood sediments during the flood season as part of the rice field ecosystem. This study surveys agriculture practices among three crop and two crop farmers on the floodplain. It is argued that planting three crops (intensive cropping) cannot provide a sustainable alternative to balanced cropping, either from an economic or an ecological viewpoint. Study findings emphasise the need to recognise the ecological value of balanced cropping systems for an efficient and environmentally sound production of food. In connection with this, it is suggested a case for limiting further dyke heightening since rice intensification, which is the aim of this large-scale water control, does not make economic sense.

On the other hand, many questions cannot even be answered truthfully, because the human brain receives a huge amount of information every millisecond, which is then being filtered, and as a result, the person fails to fully recognize and realistically assess all the aspects of decision-making. Until recently marketers and traders could not see into the heads of consumers' and learn about their needs, but the current advanced technology allows them to explore the human brain through neuroscience and biometric methods. The paper points to the new possibilities of market research and underlines the growing need for their implementation in the form of innovative research solutions that can be used in different economic sectors (retail and services).

Using data from the Italian regions, we run a panel data regression model to test whether the EMC hypothesis holds. Results confute it, evidencing a U-shaped relationship. In the authors' opinion, the combined effect of market conditions, lifestyle evolution and institutional and political factors have produced an adverse effect on environment.

The model has the following key features. First, monetary and physical stocks and flows are explicitly formalised taking into account the accounting principles and the laws of thermodynamics. Second, Georgescu-Roegen's distinction between stock-flow and fund-service resources is adopted. Third, output is demand-determined but supply constraints might arise either due to environmental damages or due to the exhaustion of natural resources. Fourth, climate change influences directly the components of aggregate demand. Fifth, finance affects macroeconomic activity and the materialisation of investment plans that determine ecological efficiency. The model is calibrated using global data. Simulations are conducted to investigate the trajectories of key environmental, macroeconomic and financial variables under (i) different assumptions about the sensitivity of economic activity to the leverage ratio of firms and (ii) different types of green finance policies.

The application of wavelet analysis to long-term historical price series allows us to detect long waves in prices whose periodization is remarkably similar to those provided in the literature for the pre-World War II period. Moreover, we find evidence on the existence of long waves in prices also after World War II, a period in which long waves are generally difficult to detect because of the positive trend displayed by prices. The comparison between the long wave components extracted through wavelets and the Christiano-Fitzgerald band-pass filter suggests that wavelets provide a reliable and straightforward technique for analyzing long waves dynamics in time series exhibiting quite complex patterns such as historical data.","[Gallegati, Marco; Gallegati, Mauro] Univ Politecn Marche, Fac Econ G Fua, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Piazzale Martelli 8, I-60121 Ancona, Italy; [Ramsey, James B.] NYU, Dept Econ, 19 West 4th St, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Semmler, Willi] New Sch Social Res, Dept Econ, 79 Fifth Ave, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Semmler, Willi] Univ Bielefeld, CEM, Bielefeld, Germany",Marche Polytechnic University; New York University; The New School; University of Bielefeld,"Gallegati, M (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, Fac Econ G Fua, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Piazzale Martelli 8, I-60121 Ancona, Italy.",marco.gallegati@univpm.it,"GALLEGATI, MARCO/AFU-0857-2022; Gallegati, Marco/AAE-5194-2019","GALLEGATI, MARCO/0000-0001-5028-2235; Semmler, Willi/0000-0002-8384-8159",,,,,84,11,12,0,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,JAN,2017,11.0,1.0,,,,,127,151,,10.1007/s11698-015-0137-y,0.0,,,25,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,EK0BL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000393591300005,0

This is surprising given the fact that large-scale decommodification may be our best option for a post-growth transition so dear to many ecological economists. Based on Heinsohn and Steiger's theory of ownership, we seek to provide an institutional foundation to processes of (de)commodification. These two authors distinguish between 'property' and 'possession', two bundles of rights generating different logics and consequences. We illustrate this approach with three cases taken from an advanced capitalist economy, Switzerland, showing how commodification and decommodification processes may appear together or vigorously oppose each other. Cooperatives, forests and municipal land are examples of (partial) decommodified assets that follow a logic of possession and are therefore more likely to be sustainable. It is high time that the study of decommodification becomes central to ecological economics. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We demonstrate that the pursuit of these goals is subject to an intergenerational equity-efficiency trade-off. Our analysis highlights two salient characteristics of intergenerational problems and policy: (i) temporal irreversibility, i.e. the inability to revise one's past actions; and (ii) uncertainty of future consequences of present actions in human-environment systems. We employ a two-non-overlapping-generations model that combines an intragenerational production decision on the use of circulating capital and a non-renewable resource, with a negative intergenerational externality as an unforeseen contingency. If initially unknown problems become apparent and policy is enacted after irreversible actions were taken, policy-making faces a fundamental trade-off between ex-post Pareto-efficiency and sustainability. That is, one can achieve either one of these two goals, but not both. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This work explores the observations that both deceivers as well as those trying to recognize lies possess about communication media and how this corresponds to their behavior. Outcomes from questionnaire-based studies showed that both the features of deception and media affect individuals' apparent discomfort and credibility when deceiving and the media selections while preparing to deceive.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the attitudes of green consumers towards food waste, reasons for wasting edible food and acceptance of policy actions that could help address the food waste challenge. Design/methodology/approach - Based on a quantitative survey of 346 respondents, frequency distributions, cross tabulations and non-parametric tests were performed. Findings - This study finds that there is inconsistency between attitudes and behaviours. Green consumers, including those who value organic food and vegetarianism, waste quite a lot of edible food. Food is thrown away mainly due to spoilage, short shelf life, being forgotten in the fridge and eating outside the home. Hence, consumers, even those with the best of intentions, face behavioural constraints when it comes to reducing food waste. A surprising finding is that some consumers lack awareness of the environmental burden posed by food waste. Several policy measures to reduce food waste are acceptable to the respondents Research limitations/implications - Reliance on self-reported data for food waste.

The stronger the rule of law, the more attractive the investment conditions; investors feel secure, and their capital is protected. Although in recent years Croatia made some progress with disburdening of the economy, this is still not a strong incentive for investors who complain about the lack of long-term development strategy, frequent legislative changes, and legal insecurity. According to the World Bank's ease of doing business criteria, Croatia is still at the bottom of the European list. Judicature is still inefficient, despite the fact that we have the largest number of judges per population in the EU. The procedures are long and unpredictable. The mismatch of land register and cadastral records generates incalculable losses and damage to the Croatian economy every day, hindering the investment potential. Organising land register and cadastral records is a precondition without which there can be no investment wave, nor business security. Frequent legislative changes are a great obstacle to investments and economic growth. The laws keep changing and the reason for these changes is unknown, because regulations are not evaluated. In the last two convocations, the Croatian Parliament adopted about 1800 laws, of which 800 in an emergency procedure. Along with by-laws, regulations and ordinances, it is an impenetrable jungle of regulations that entrepreneurs and investors have problems with. In order for the effect of the rule of law to be as stimulating as possible for the growth of economy, it is necessary to evaluate the impact of the already passed laws on the economy and then leave some time for the implementation of new ones. Instead of frequent legislative changes, it would be far more effective to establish a system that would quickly detect and eliminate bureaucratic obstacles and inconsistencies, and make sure that new regulations do not bring new obstacles and problems to businesses. The objective of this paper is to define key problems in the functioning of the rule of law that prevent investment security and economy development, to analyse the current situation, set goals and propose possible solutions, especially regarding problems with ownership registration, functioning of commercial courts, and legislation.",,,,vesna.skareozbolt@gmail.com; i.herak@yahoo.com; m.herak@yahoo.com,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,2,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,527,536,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500050,0

The purpose of this research is to evaluate the total-factor energy efficiency in EU countries and to examine the impact of undesirable outputs on these countries energy efficiency. We used DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) SBM Bad output model, incorporating multiple inputs and two kinds of multiple outputs: desirable and undesirable as the result of input utilization. Undesirable outputs are an anomaly, which should not be ignored when measuring total-factor energy efficiency. Namely, in case of emissions or pollution, regulatory standards define the maximum amount of undesirable outputs. The empirical results confirm that the DEA scores for total-factor energy efficiency incorporating undesirable outputs are more realistic then those obtained based only on desirable outputs as they do not calculate the negative impact on the environment. Results show significant differences in environmental total-factor efficiencies among developed and less developed EU countries. For every relatively inefficient country the projected values on efficient frontier are determined, as targets. These targets are useful in policy decision-making regarding environmental total-factor energy efficiency. Therefore, in order to solve their environmental problems, inefficient countries should aim to change their energy structure and consume behaviour. On the other hand, efficient countries whose governments have already directed their energy policy to environmental energy should serve as good practice examples.","[Segota, Alemka; Vlahinic-Lenz, Nela; Maradin, Dario] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Segota, A (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia.",alemka.segota@efri.hr; nela@efri.hr; dario.maradin@efri.hr,"Maradin, Dario/Q-9380-2018","Maradin, Dario/0000-0001-9642-6038",Croatian Science Foundation [IP-2013-11-2203]; University of Rijeka [13.02.1.3.05],Croatian Science Foundation; University of Rijeka,This work has been fully supported-supported in part by Croatian Science Foundation under the project IP-2013-11-2203 and has been supported in part by the University of Rijeka under the project number 13.02.1.3.05.,,17,0,0,0,3,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,675,685,,,,,,11,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500065,0

Using resource-based and contingency theories as framework, differences in barriers perceptions between exporters classified by five organizational factors were tested. Design/methodology/approach - Secondary data collection for literature review, conceptualization and hypotheses setting, and primary data collection for hypotheses testing were employed. Survey's variables and their measurement were derived from previous studies, so exploratory factor analysis was utilized to test dimensionality. A total of 224 agri- food exporters were surveyed and 86 usable responses were collected. The single export venture was used as unit of analysis. ANOVA and t test were utilized for hypotheses testing. Findings - Results indicate that the biggest barriers are price competitiveness and insufficient government support. Larger firms and foreign-owned ones perceive researched export barriers as lower than smaller firms and domestic-owned ones.

Research has investigated COO effects and consumer responses to organic food, but there is little research on the combination of the two. Design/methodology/approach - A narrative review of two research streams and their intersection, forming the basis for the development of a research agenda. Findings - There are few studies analysing the possible interaction between the effects of organic and COO on consumers' food preferences and choices. In general, COO seems to lose impact when other quality cues are salient. This suggests a lower impact of COO for organic than for conventional food products. However, there is still no research on the possible impact of organic labelling in categories where products from a foreign country are able to demand a premium, and little is known about consumer preferences for different import countries regarding organic food. Six potential future research directions are suggested. Research limitations/implications - There is a need for research that more systematically investigates the possible interactions between COO and organic labelling on consumers' food product preferences and choices. A research agenda is suggested as a starting point. Originality/value - This literature review highlights the lack of research on the interaction between COO effects and consumer responses to organic food.

While the focus of last year's paper was on 5 years from 2011 to 2015, in this year's paper those 5 years were being compared with the previous year 2016 that can be perceived as a kind of turning point in the relations of countries concerned, primarily through relations of EU (28 member countries, including Croatia) and Canada (10 provinces and 3 territories). With regard to research purpose of this paper, it can be explicitly defined as: to conduct unbiased, purposeful and multi-year research into changes to significance that Croatia had in Canadian import and export within specific industries. For that purpose, authors have decided to utilise exclusively websites created by Government of Canada that provide direct access to sufficient quantity of indorsed, relevant and official statistic data. Those were the main reasons why aforementioned websites were chosen as the central source of data in order to accomplish the research purpose of this paper. In relation to used research methods and approaches, in this paper authors have intentionally used only the most appropriate data from website by Government of Canada's Office of the Chief Economist under Trade and Economic Statistics section as well as under Trade Investment and Economic Statistics subsection. Those datasets were utilized as the central source of numerical data for this wide-ranging research mostly because of their constancy, dependability and accessibility. Additionally, supplementary data by other carefully selected associations and organizations were used to further explicate import-export interrelations between Croatia and Canada. Conclusions that authors have drawn from the study of numerical data that included years 2011-2016 and from the detailed analyses and syntheses of the most relevant numerical data that link Croatia and Canada as well as their industries, actually represent the major research results of this paper. For these obvious reasons, major research results that were so clearly formulated can be used in a variety of professional purposes and in wide range of scientific researches. Finally, main implications of this paper were multiple logical deductions that can be made based on analyses and syntheses of numerical data as well as on proper comprehension of discussions within this paper. Those logical deductions should be perceived as stepping stones towards better import-export interrelations between Croatia and Canada that have the potential to improve, but only if previous experiences (including mistakes and omissions) will be properly used in future import-export endeavours that must take in consideration both previously mentioned countries.","[Uroda, Ivan; Prohaska, Zdenko] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia; [Veckie, Edward] Unified Engn Com Corp, 171 Niagara St, Hamilton, ON L8L 6A8, Canada",University of Rijeka,"Uroda, I (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia.",ivan.uroda@gmail.com; zdenko.prohaska@ri.t-com.hr; eveckie@unifiedengineering.com,"Prohaska, Zdenko/R-8232-2018; Uroda, Ivan/S-6792-2018","Uroda, Ivan/0000-0003-3635-126X",,,,,6,0,0,0,0,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,587,597,,,,,,11,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500056,0

This study aims at showing the relationship between SF innovation and terrestrial strategies directed at implementing this kind of food also on terrestrial tables. Design/methodology/approach - This research focusses on a case study. The subject of the case study under analysis is Argotec, an internationally recognised Italian aerospace engineering company, dealing with research, innovation and development in various sectors, including engineering, information technology, system integration, small satellites and Human Space Flight and Operations. The company produces innovative SF for European astronauts performing long-duration missions on-board the ISS. Moreover, the SF is made available also for terrestrial beings as a solution for everyday eating necessities. Findings - Argotec is characterised by strong innovation in terms of products and processes. Throughout the case study, the authors focus on the relationship between SF innovation and its terrestrial applications, since this company also manufactures products, traded under the brand ReadyToLunch, suitable for daily meals on Earth. Innovation applied to SF can thus offer advantages also for terrestrial daily meals and therefore help the company achieve other competitive advantages: as to the authors' knowledge, this is a unique case. Research limitations/implications - This study also has some limitations, typical of the applied methodology. In relation to the interview technique, further interviews would be required in order to fully understand the end-user perspectives regarding the importance and interest of this kind of ready-to-eat food. Practical implications - Practical implications relate to astronauts and to terrestrial consumers. For astronauts, SF is not any more intended only to satisfy humans' basic needs, and to provide the necessary nutrients during space missions, but has become an important factor in the quality of life in space. For terrestrial consumers, SF may represent a healthy, tasty and nutritious ready-to-eat choice: single courses for the main meals and snacks for a break. Originality/value - This research fills a gap in literature: to the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper presenting a case study on a company responsible for the development and supply of SF for European astronauts on-board the ISS, as well as encouraging the consumption of SF by terrestrial beings, as an ordinary ready-to-eat lunch/dinner.","[Varese, Erica] Univ Turin, Management, Commod Sci Area, Turin, Italy; [Cane, Paola] Argotec, Turin, Italy",University of Turin,"Varese, E (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Management, Commod Sci Area, Turin, Italy.",erica.varese@unito.it,"Varese, Erica/F-9503-2018","Varese, Erica/0000-0002-5172-8187",,,,,76,4,4,4,38,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Hence, conservation measures of these ecosystems are urgently needed and should be combined with their sustainable uses. To address these issues, new research avenues for decision support systems have emphasized the role of the assessment of ecosystem services for establishing conservation priorities by avoiding monetarization approaches. These approaches, because they flatten the various values of nature by projecting them on the single monetary dimension, are often rejected by the stakeholders. We undertake a Q analysis to identify levels of consensus and divergence among stakeholders on the prioritization of ecosystem services provided by two French Mediterranean coastal lagoons areas. The results highlighted that there is a strong consensus among categories of stakeholders in the study sites about the paramount importance of regulation and maintenance services. Three groups of stakeholders, each sharing the same points of view regarding ecosystem services conservation, were identified for each study site. As a non-monetary valuation, Q methodology is very instrumental for the new pluralistic approach of decision support by capturing the values expressed by the stakeholders, without triggering a rejection reflex due to the monetarization.","[Sy, Mariam Maki; De Wit, Rutger] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, IFREMER, MARBEC,IRD, Pl Eugene Bataillon, F-34095 Montpellier 5, France; [Rey-Valette, Helene] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, INRA, Montpellier SupAgro,Ctr Econ Environm Montpellier, Ave Raymond Dugrand, F-34000 Montpellier, France; [Simier, Monique] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, IFREMER, IRD,MARBEC, Ave Jean Monnet, F-34203 Sete, France; [Pasqualini, Vanina] Univ Corse, UMR SPE, BP 52, F-20250 Corte, France; [Pasqualini, Vanina] Univ Corse, UMS Stella Mare, CNRS, BP 52, F-20250 Corte, France; [Figuieres, Charles] Aix Marseille Univ, Univ Aix Marseille, Ecole Cent Marseille, EHESS,UMR AMSE,CNRS, 5 Blvd Maurice Bourdet,CS 50498, F-13205 Marseille 01, France",Ifremer; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Montpellier; INRAE; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Universite de Montpellier; Ifremer; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Aix-Marseille Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"De Wit, R (通讯作者)，Univ Montpellier, CNRS, IFREMER, MARBEC,IRD, Pl Eugene Bataillon, F-34095 Montpellier 5, France.",rutger.de-wit@umontpellier.fr,"SIMIER, Monique/O-4797-2019; De Wit, Rutger/KBD-4717-2024; Pasqualini, Vanina/D-7255-2012","SIMIER, Monique/0000-0002-8436-5925;","DRIIHM LabEx, Device for Interdisciplinary Research on human-environments Interactions; human-environment observatory Mediterranean coastline; program Investment in the future (ANR)","DRIIHM LabEx, Device for Interdisciplinary Research on human-environments Interactions; human-environment observatory Mediterranean coastline; program Investment in the future (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR))","This study was financed by the DRIIHM LabEx, Device for Interdisciplinary Research on human-environments Interactions and the human-environment observatory Mediterranean coastline.

However, these processes are acknowledged to require decades to achieve their intended changes, a timeframe that is too long to adequately address many of the environmental and social issues many industrialized and industrializing nations are facing. An approach that involves incumbents and does not consider targets that look beyond reasonably foreseeable technology is likely to advance a model where incumbents evolve rather than being replaced or displaced. On the other hand, approaches that focus on creating new entrants could nurture niche development or deployment of disruptive technologies, but those technologies may only be marginally better than the technologies they replace. Either approach may take a long time to achieve their goals. Sustainable development requires both radical disruptive technological and institutional changes, the latter including stringent regulation, the integration of disparate goals, and changes in incentives to enable new voices to contribute to new systems and solutions.

Using Q methodology, we asked residents to sort outcomes such as food security, trustworthy governance, harvest and recreational opportunities, education, and employment in terms of their importance to community well-being. We also asked them to discuss the strategies they used when faced with difficult tradeoffs, and their feelings throughout the sorting process. We identified four strategies that people used for resolving trade-offs and four social discourses that informed participants' sorts: the strategies for prioritization reflect aspects of people's ethical standpoint, as well as whether they are employing short or long-term thinking; the discourses reflect concerns regarding state-based governance, local autonomy, and peoples desire to be engaged and connected with the marine environment. Our findings shed light on how people in natural resource dependent areas think about environmental governance and negotiate among multiple priorities. Our findings also offer explanations for why people agree or disagree with policies and management actions, especially in cases where peoples preferences appear inconsistent with their stated values. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for natural resource management and research.","[Loring, Philip A.; Hinzman, Megan S.] Univ Saskatchewan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, 332-117 Sci Pl, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5C8, Canada",University of Saskatchewan,"Loring, PA (通讯作者)，Univ Saskatchewan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, 332-117 Sci Pl, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5C8, Canada.",phil.loring@usask.ca; msh840@mail.usask.ca,"Loring, Philip A/I-1716-2019","Loring, Philip A/0000-0001-6039-2331","Marine Environmental Observation Prediction and Response (MEOPAR) Network, a Canadian Tri-Council Network Centres of Excellence [2.7]; Ocean Tipping Points program - Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; Parks Canada","Marine Environmental Observation Prediction and Response (MEOPAR) Network, a Canadian Tri-Council Network Centres of Excellence; Ocean Tipping Points program - Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; Parks Canada","We would like to thank the Carlos Ormond and his team at the Haida Gwaii Higher Education Society, as well as the Council of the Haida Nation, Russ Jones, Molly Clarkson, and Catherine Rigg, for their help with this research.

By using a unique and geolocated database on natural disasters in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, I test whether variables related to public policies - e.g. forest cover and urban infrastructure - affect the occurrence of natural disasters, conditional on the existence of extreme rainfall. Results point to a significant role for public policies in order to mitigate effects of extreme weather events. More specifically, results point to an important role for urban infrastructure, as proper sewage and waste collection, and forest cover in reducing the impacts of extreme rainfall. Moreover, I discuss how these heterogeneous effects have distributional consequences and can be linked to the Environmental Justice literature. Finally, this paper reinforces the idea that adaptation policies to disasters are essential in reducing local vulnerabilities and can yield distributional and fiscal benefits.","[Sant'Anna, Andre Albuquerque] Brazilian Dev Bank, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil",,"Sant'Anna, AA (通讯作者)，Brazilian Dev Bank, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.",andre.santanna@bndes.gov.br,,,,,,,57,17,18,3,47,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

While ecological economics has aspired to be transdisciplinary, its framing of justice is hardly pluralistic. Feminist perspectives and justice frameworks offer a structure for appraising the human condition that bridges social and ecological issues. Through a brief overview of the uptake of feminist perspectives in other social sciences, this paper outlines an initial justice-integration strategy for ecological economics by providing both a point of entry for readers to the vast and diverse field of feminist economic thought, as well as a context for the process of disciplinary evolution in social sciences. We also critique ecological economics' toleration of neoclassical mainstays such as individualism that run counter to justice goals. The paper concludes with a call for ecological economics practitioners and theorists to learn from other social sciences and elevate their attention to justice, to open possibilities for more dynamic, interdisciplinary, community-oriented, and pluralistic analysis.","[Spencer, Phoebe; Erickson, Jon D.] Univ Vermont, Rubenstein Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Spencer, Phoebe; Perkins, Patricia E.; Erickson, Jon D.] Univ Vermont, Gund Inst Environm, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Perkins, Patricia E.] York Univ, Fac Environm Studies, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Vermont; University of Vermont; York University - Canada,"Spencer, P (通讯作者)，Univ Vermont, Rubenstein Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.;Spencer, P (通讯作者)，Univ Vermont, Gund Inst Environm, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",pspencer@uvm.edu,"Erickson, Jon D/C-4020-2009","Erickson, Jon D./0000-0002-2235-7428",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; McGill University; York University; University of Vermont [SSHRC 895-2013-1010],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); McGill University; York University; University of Vermont,"The authors gratefully acknowledge Dr. Peter Brown, Dr. Julie Nelson, Courtney Hammond Wagner, and three anonymous reviewers for their thoughtful insights on this manuscript.

The increased use of geographic information systems in VT means that many VT exercises now include spatial elements such as distance decay and population density. This paper explores impact of distance decay on welfare estimates as well as the impact from the modifiable area unit problem (MAUP) when population density is included as an explanatory variable. These issues can have a large effect on a VT estimate. In this study the overall value for achieving GES for Atlantic member states varied between e2.37billion and e3.64 billion. It was found that the different distance decay specifications changed values between - 3% and 82% with a mean absolute difference of 25% and by adjusting the spatial scale in an effort to overcome the MAUP changed aggregate values between 13% and 25% with a mean of 17%.,"[Norton, Daniel; Hynes, Stephen] NUIG, Whitaker Inst, SEMRU, Galway, Ireland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway,"Norton, D (通讯作者)，NUIG, Whitaker Inst, SEMRU, Galway, Ireland.",daniel.d.norton@nuigalway.ie,,,"Beaufort Marine Research Award; Marine Institute; Irish Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","Beaufort Marine Research Award; Marine Institute; Irish Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","This work was funded through the Beaufort Marine Research Award, with the support of the Marine Institute and the Irish Department of Environment, Community and Local Government.

Shipping, potentially, has negative impacts on marine fauna and flora and air quality, with implications for public health. The Regional Coordinating Unit seeks to strengthen implementation of the Abidjan Convention by party-states through co-operation with state actors using various pathways based on its internal resources and competencies but the Unit is also starting to explore engagement with potential non-state actors. The ability of the Unit to exert influence on implementation is constrained by domestic politico-administrative institutions. This paper seeks to understand the influence of the Regional Coordinating Unit on the implementation of the Abidjan Convention in the field of shipping pollution. It uses three theoretical perspectives for the analysis: the influence of international environmental bureaucracies, domestic regulatory-politics and transnational governance. The paper shows how these theories are complementary because the influence of international bureaucracies such as the Regional Coordinating Unit cannot be adequately understood through factors internal to their organisation alone but needs to be analysed in relation also to external factors, both domestic politico-institutional ones in states that international bureaucracies work with, and the role of relevant non-state actors in the implementation of multilateral environmental agreements. It is concluded that, although influence cannot be measured directly, it is likely that Regional Coordinating Unit's influence through its autonomy-centred efforts are quiet strong but negatively constrained by the traditional state-centric responsibility for implementation of international legal instruments where domestic regulatory-politics lack sufficient political will and support from and engagement with non-state actors.","[Barnes-Dabban, Harry] Wageningen Univ & Res, Environm Policy Grp, POB 8700,Hollandsweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Karlsson-Vinkhuyzen, Sylvia] Wageningen Univ & Res, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, POB 8700,Hollandsweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research,"Barnes-Dabban, H (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ & Res, Environm Policy Grp, POB 8700,Hollandsweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",harry.barnesdabban@wur.nl,"Karlsson-Vinkhuyzen, Sylvia I/C-4889-2009","Karlsson-Vinkhuyzen, Sylvia I/0000-0001-7632-8545; Barnes-Dabban, Harry/0000-0002-0928-9459",,,,,60,4,5,1,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Inspired by this conjecture, I trace the Coptic-Muslim SES gap in Egypt to self-selection-on-SES during Egypt's conversion from Coptic Christianity to Islam. Selection was driven by a poll tax on non-Muslims, imposed from 641 until 1856, which induced poorer Copts to convert to Islam leading Copts to shrink into a better-off minority. Using novel data sources, I document that high-tax districts in 641-1100 had in 1848-1868 relatively fewer Copts, but greater SES differentials.

Through the review of CBC initiatives in developing countries, we contribute to the debate by analysing how players influence different factors that determine the outcomes of CBC. We highlight several points. First, the promise of benefits has been overshadowed by constraints on the extraction of natural resources, along with the use of governmental schemes to extract partially the rents from CBC, which has left little to share inside the communities. Second, CBC design and implementation has often overlooked the asymmetries of power within the community and at the individual level, which has produced unequal access to the design, decision-making and outcomes of this activity. Third, while the elites have had a determinant role in shaping the governance of CBC, external agents' promotion of CBC has tended to reproduce the existent negotiating power at the community, local and national levels. Fourth, land contestation plays a key role in the dynamics of relationship and conflict between the governments, corporate interests and the communities. Finally, CBC adaptation to new scenarios depends critically on the process of community empowerment and the building of networks with external agents. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Our dependent variable includes the economic opportunities identified by the cities; our independent variables are the adaptation plans, adaptation actions, climate change risks, incentive types, and incentivized stakeholders. To explore the effects of climate change risks, adaptation plans, adaptation actions, incentive types, and incentivized stakeholders, we used polychoric factor analysis and logistic regression analysis. The results show that a city's climate change adaptation plan and GDP have significant positive relationships with the economic opportunities present in the cities. Meanwhile, climate change risks also have a positive relationship with economic opportunities. Furthermore, economic opportunities present in cities have a negative relationship with three variables: one group of climate actions and two groups of stakeholders.

We employ a simultaneous equations model to investigate the differential effects of adaptation on adapters and non-adapters. An endogenous switching mechanism is employed to account for selectivity bias. Based on a survey of 422 rice farmers in Nepal, our results show that farmers' education, access to credit and extension services, experience with climate change impacts such as drought and flood, information on climate change issues, belief in climate change and the need to adapt all variously determine their decision-making. We find that the adaptation strategies employed by farmers significantly increase rice yields. Furthermore, results indicate that both adapters and non-adapters would benefit from the adaptation of the identified strategies. This study, therefore, provides supportive evidence for policy makers to take into consideration farmers' existing knowledge and skills in adapting to climate change. The findings show that it is imperative to involve fanners in climate change adaptation planning processes if the full benefits of such policy action are to be realized.","[Khanal, Uttam; Wilson, Clevo; Viet-Ngu Hoang; Lee, Boon] Queensland Univ Technol, QUT Business Sch, Level 8,Z Block,2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Wilson, C (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, QUT Business Sch, Level 8,Z Block,2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia.",clevo.wilson@qut.edu.au,"Lee, Boon/K-5178-2019","Lee, Boon/0000-0002-3594-0575; Wilson, Clevo/0000-0002-3885-0495; Hoang, Viet-Ngu/0000-0002-9742-2378",,,,,49,169,180,10,132,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Many scholars and environmental activists have long hoped that global restrictions in mercury trade would drive up mercury prices and decrease mercury use and pollution in ASGM. However, in Indonesia, despite global mercury trade restrictions, recent increases in domestic mercury supplies through new cinnabar mining developments have made mercury less expensive and more available, destabilizing efforts at reducing mercury use. This article discusses implications of domestic cinnabar mining for controlling mercury in Indonesia's ASGM sector, highlighting obstacles to implementing the Minamata Convention, a treaty that aims to restrict mercury use. We link discussion of mercury mining to other socioeconomic processes, labour relations and power dynamics shaping mercury use in gold mining and hindering collectivised mercury-free technology uptake. Examining new evidence regarding the social metabolism of a changing extractive economy, we underscore why an integrated ecological economics paradigm carefully grounding analysis in the context of local labour situations is needed to challenge assumptions and inform new strategies for mercury reduction/elimination in ASGM.","[Spiegel, Samuel J.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Agrawal, Sumali; Mikha, Dino; Vitamerry, Kartie; Konolius, Kulansi; Paul, Bardolf] Yayasan Tambuhak Sinta, Cent Kalimantan, Indonesia; [Le Billon, Philippe] Univ British Columbia, Liu Inst Study Global Issues, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Veiga, Marcello] Univ British Columbia, Inst Min Engn, Vancouver, BC, Canada",University of Edinburgh; University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia,"Spiegel, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",sam.spiegel@ed.ac.uk,,"Spiegel, Samuel/0000-0003-2163-3512",Canadian International Resources and Development Institute (CIRDI) [2014-077]; Global Affairs Canada; UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC); ESRC [ES/N006240/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Canadian International Resources and Development Institute (CIRDI); Global Affairs Canada(CGIAR); UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We would like to express thanks to Susan Keane, Peter Maxson, Ken Davis and this journal's peer reviewers for insightful comments on earlier versions of this paper.

In particular, the presented findings should answer the question regarding the importance of Value Proposition (being, according to most of the business model concepts, its central element), as well as show the influence of using outsourcing on changes made within the business model. The paper presents the results of research among 281 Polish companies, and the main research method was a questionnaire survey. The research presented here confirms the systemic nature of the business model. Statistically important dependencies were observed between the changes made in specific elements of the business model, both quantitative and qualitative. The use of outsourcing by the companies forming the research sample was reflected in modifications of their business models. The research results seem to prove the empirical importance of Alexander Osterwalder's business model framework. Firstly, all the nine elements of Osterwalder's business model framework are interrelated; secondly, the Value Proposition appears to be indeed the central element of a business model. From managerial perspective, the results show the importance of business model approach in strategic management, especially when planning and managing strategic changes within a company.","[Drzewiecki, Jakub] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Drzewiecki, J (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Wroclaw, Poland.",jakub.drzewiecki@ue.wroc.pl,,,National Science Centre [DEC-2013/09/D/HS4/00583],"National Science Centre(National Science Centre, Poland)",The research project was financed by the funds granted by National Science Centre based on the decision no.

New legislation has recently been introduced in Northern Ireland from April 2017, requiring domestic households to recycle all domestic food waste items. Resulting increases in the volume of such waste which is collected by the local council has driven technologies for the safe recycling of such material including commercial composting. Little is known about the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profile of such composted food waste materials and hence the purpose of this paper is to characterise total AMR in bacteria isolated from such composted domestic food waste and to consider the potential public health consequences of such material. Design/methodology/approach Finished compost containing food waste material was obtained in the Spring 2017 from a local authority recycling amenity site, which freely distributes such material to the public. Total culturable populations of bacteria were isolated from the composted material and antibiotic susceptibility to six classes of antibiotics, namely florfenicol, fluoroquinolone, aminoglycoside, lincosamide, tetracycline and -lactam was examined. Findings ABR was greatest for lincomycin > tobramycin > minocycline/amoxycillin > ciprofloxacin > florfenicol. In this study, there was one compost, which showed complete resistance to all antibiotics tested. No compost displayed complete antibiotic sensitivity. Two composts were considered pan-resistant, whilst four were considered multi-resistant. Originality/value This study showed that the total ABR profile of food waste compost is significant, with bacterial populations within the compost having ABR to several classes of antibiotics, which are important and sometimes critical to human health. The application of such materials to enrich and fertilise garden soils in significant volumes inadvertently allows for the artifical and man-made transfer of AMR bacteria and their genes to new environments, which have been hitherto niave to the presence of such AMR properties. The application of such compost horticulturally to enrich soils used to cultivate flowers, fruits and vegetables may have important consequences for human and animal health. Urgent work is now needed to quantify the fate of such antibiotic resistant bacteria from compost to their new environment and risk assessments made to estimate the carriage through to human health.","[Furukawa, Maika; Moore, John E.] Belfast City Hosp, Dept Bacteriol, Northern Ireland Publ Hlth Lab, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Furukawa, Maika; Moore, John E.] Queens Univ Belfast, Ctr Med Expt, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Furukawa, Maika; Misawa, Naoaki] Univ Miyazaki, Fac Agr, Dept Vet Med Sci, Lab Vet Publ Hlth, Miyazaki, Japan; [Misawa, Naoaki] Univ Miyazaki, Ctr Anim Dis Control, Miyazaki, Japan; [Moore, John E.] Ulster Univ, Sch Biomed Sci, Coleraine, Londonderry, North Ireland",Belfast City Hospital; Queens University Belfast; University of Miyazaki; University of Miyazaki; Ulster University,"Moore, JE (通讯作者)，Belfast City Hosp, Dept Bacteriol, Northern Ireland Publ Hlth Lab, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland.;Moore, JE (通讯作者)，Queens Univ Belfast, Ctr Med Expt, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland.",maika.furukawa@gmail.com; a0d901u@cc.miyazaki-u.ac.jp; jemoore@niphl.dnet.co.uk,,"Moore, John/0000-0002-5243-5108",Japan Public-Private Partnership Student Study Abroad Program TOBITATE Young Ambassador Program - Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS); Great Britain Sasakawa Foundation (GBSF) [4731],Japan Public-Private Partnership Student Study Abroad Program TOBITATE Young Ambassador Program - Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS); Great Britain Sasakawa Foundation (GBSF),"Author MF was supported by a Japan Public-Private Partnership Student Study Abroad Program TOBITATE Young Ambassador Program awarded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).

The authors start by providing an overview of the procedure before the Court of Honour in the period between 2000, when the Court was established, and the most recent developments of adapting its rules and practice to the new legislation in 2017. The authors also describe how the Court was continuously adapting to EU policies and legislation on consumer alternative dispute resolution over the course of its practice, and how it built trust and gained recognition among consumers and traders as an independent, transparent and efficient dispute resolution body. Furthermore, the changes that were necessary to make after the Consumer Alternative Dispute Resolution Act was passed in 2016 are described, as well as the impact that those changes made on the Court's practice. The authors proceed by analyzing benefits of consumer alternative dispute resolution before the Court of Honour of Croatian Chamber of Trades and Crafts and proposing possible solutions to questions that remain open. In conclusion, the authors put forward the opinion on how positive experience of nearly 20 years of the Court's practice in consumer alternative dispute resolution can be utilized to increase efficiency of this procedure in certain types of disputes in regular courts.","[Kolesar, Suzana; Pudak, Mirna] Croatian Chamber Trades & Crafts, Ilica 49-2, Zagreb, Croatia",,"Kolesar, S (通讯作者)，Croatian Chamber Trades & Crafts, Ilica 49-2, Zagreb, Croatia.",suzana.kolesar@hok.hr; mirna.pudjak@hok.hr,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,436,445,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Law",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies; Government & Law,BP1SI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540727600050,0

The aim of this article is to present the results of a comparative analysis of changes in innovativeness and competitiveness of V4 economies over a period of 5 years. The Summary Innovation Index (Sit) was used in the European Innovation Scoreboard, as well as the Global Competitiveness Report and Global Competitiveness Index (GCI). The analysis shows that all members of V4 are so called moderate innovators; however, there are some differences among analyzed countries. The Czech Republic begins to diverge from other member states of V4 in terms of SII, and it has been increasing its GCI as well. Poland occupies one of the last positions in the V4 innovation ranking, where Hungary was the weakest in terms of competitiveness in 2016.

We propose a general framework for the analysis of the conjunctive implementation of both land management options. This general framework provides an empirical rule of selection that can easily be implemented by a land-planner without specific knowledge of optimization procedures. Our main finding is that both the environmental benefit to cost ratio and the benefit difference (between a sharing and a sparing management option) to cost difference ratio matter for selection of parcels. We then develop an empirical application of this framework for the Seine-Ource river catchment in Burgundy, France. We look for the best land management option to implement for water quality preservation. We show that it is more cost-effective to implement land sharing and land sparing management options conjunctively than separately. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, it is highly instructive to identify selected aspects of the GDPR, discuss their impact on businesses and especially their corporate administration, predict challenges and problems, and, most importantly, propose solutions in re how to adjust and comply with the GDPR requirements. This can be achieved based on both a fresh primary investigative data yield from Czech Businesses and comparatively explored secondary data which originated in different EU member states. Indeed, the mandatory and direct application of the GDPR is on its way to inevitably create new duties and will change many features of the corporate administration.

Traditionally care homes are designed for elderly with physical impairment. However, people with dementia have others and supplementary needs. An important challenge is therefore to identify differences and similarities in what makes supportive, pleasant environments for both groups. As the group of people with Alzheimer's disease is numerous, this paper focuses on characteristics related to Alzheimer's - typically difficulties related to orientation, coping with larger groups of residential units and a lack of ability to handle welfare technology. In these respects, care homes for people with dementia differ from other settings. However, people with dementia are known to be positively sensitive to a wide range of architectural qualities such as sensory experiences, atmosphere and access to green outdoor areas. The paper argues that since these qualities have importance for a wider group of elderly, the design of care homes in this respect can be considered as an example of universal design in general. Pointing out some similarities and differences in demands for elderly with and without dementia the paper raises the question in how far it might be possible to apply some architectural qualities to care homes in general. If possible, it may lift the quality of the physical environment and at the same time make fewer alterations necessary when care homes are changed to house other inhabitants. The analysis is based on existing literature combined with own studies.","[Mathiasen, Nanet; Kirkeby, Inge Mette; Sigbrand, Lone] Aalborg Univ, Danish Bldg Res Inst, Copenhagen, Denmark",Aalborg University,"Mathiasen, N (通讯作者)，Aalborg Univ, Danish Bldg Res Inst SBi, AC Meyers Vaenge 15, DK-2450 Copenhagen SV, Denmark.",nam@sbi.aau.dk,,,,,,,27,3,4,4,14,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-9630,1879-8365,978-1-61499-923-2; 978-1-61499-922-5,STUD HEALTH TECHNOL,,,2018,256.0,,,,,,336,344,,10.3233/978-1-61499-923-2-336,0.0,,,9,"Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7JT,30371493.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455118100032,0

The purpose of this paper is to determine the incidence of psychographic variables in the purchasing frequency of this product in an emerging market. Design/methodology/approach A face-to-face survey was applied to a stratified sample in the Biobio Region (Chile). The food neophobia scale (FNS) and list of values (LOV) were used simultaneously to measure psychographic variables. A multinomial logit model was estimated to determine the relationship between olive oil purchasing frequency and psychographic variables. Findings Results suggest that psychographic variables can explain olive oil purchasing frequency in the Chilean market. For a new food product, neophilia and the values of external and hedonistic dimensions can explain the higher purchasing frequency of the product. Just as in other research studies, the combined use of psychographic and sociodemographic variables performed well in segmenting a new food market. Research limitations/implications Results should be interpreted for the purchasing behavior of a new food in the context of an emerging market. Future research should expand the geographic zone to apply the survey and incorporate other variables such as ethnocentrism or ethnic identity. Originality/value Most available research studies have investigated separately the incidence of both variables in food consumption in developed, cosmopolitan and intercultural markets. This is the first approach in jointly applying the psychographic variables FNS and LOV in an emerging market and using olive oil as a case study.","[Romo-Munoz, Rodrigo] Univ Bio Bio, Dept Business Management, Chillan, Chile; [Romo-Munoz, Francisca] Univ Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile; [Stefano Dote-Pardo, Jairo; Troncoso-Sepulveda, Ricardo] Univ Bio Bio, Chillan, Chile",Universidad del Bio-Bio; Universidad de Concepcion; Universidad del Bio-Bio,"Romo-Muñoz, R (通讯作者)，Univ Bio Bio, Dept Business Management, Chillan, Chile.",rodrigoromo77@gmail.com; fromo2016@udec.cl; jdote@ubiobio.cl; rtroncos100@gmail.com,"Dote, Jairo/IAQ-2057-2023","Dote, Jairo/0000-0001-9609-0407; Romo Munoz, Rodrigo/0000-0001-6839-8834",,,,,52,6,6,0,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

This can make it unacceptable for human consumption.. In food emulsion, oxidation reaction can be occurred by either diradical triplet oxygen or nonradical singlet oxygen. The singlet oxygen can be formed from triplet oxygen by photooxidation. The purpose of this research was to study the effect of singlet oxygen quencher such as tocopherol on lipid oxidation rate in the erythrosine-sensitized photooxidation of oil-in-water emulsion. Palm oil-inwater emulsion, containing erythrosine 100 ppm and tocopherol 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 ppm, were prepared with polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20). The mixtures were stored under 4,000 lux fluorescent light for 10 h and peroxide values were measured at 2 h interval. Erythrosine greatly increased the photooxidation of palm oil-in-water emulsion, as expected. Lipid oxidation rates, as determined by the formation of lipid hydroperoxides in palm oil-in-water emulsions containing erythrosine decreased with increasing tocopherol concentration. At pH 3, the peroxide value was higher than at pH 7 ,ie., from 8,03 to 6.08 respectively. The results indicate that tocopherol is an effectively singlet oxygen quencher in palm oil-in-water emulsion.","[Sibuea, Posman; Pandiangan, Maruba; Panjaitan, Delima] Unika Santo Thomas, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Prod Technol, Medan, Indonesia; [Raharjo, Sri] Univ Gadjah Mada, Fac Agr Technol, Dept Food & Agticultural Prod Technol, Yogyakarta, Indonesia",Gadjah Mada University,"Sibuea, P (通讯作者)，Unika Santo Thomas, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Prod Technol, Medan, Indonesia.",posman_sibuea@yahoo.com,"Pandiangan, Maruba/GPX-5982-2022; RAHARJO, SRI/AAG-3300-2021",,,,,,27,0,0,0,9,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1755-1307,,,IOP C SER EARTH ENV,IOP Conf.

At a certain time, an investor may invest their capital in an enterprise from another country. There are various factors that affect a potential investor's decision of to enter a new (foreign) market. The goal of this paper is to present the structure of all foreign direct investments in the Republic of Croatia according to activities, the origin of funds, and the type of foreign direct investments, in the period between 1993 and 2016. Furthermore, the attractiveness of the Republic of Croatia for foreign direct investments will be presented. The decision to invest in a certain country can be affected in certain ways (incentives, tax deductions), even though the two key conditions that must be fulfilled in order for a country to become attractive for investments are stability and profitability. During the transition process, the investments in the countries in the region have increased, and this paper will present the position of the Republic of Croatia in relation to those countries. The methods used in the paper are the historical method and the comparative method. The results of the research conducted on the basis of secondary data have shown that the Republic of Croatia is at the very top regarding the inflow of foreign direct investments per capita when considering the surrounding countries, which is definitely a positive indicator. However, the structure of foreign direct investments shows that despite the positive indicators regarding the amount of investments in the Republic of Croatia, the total amount of greenfield investments is not significant. Greenfield investments are the factor that has a positive effect on the exports of the country receiving the investments and they also affect the increase in employment. This fact demonstrates that an appropriate strategy for incentives should be used to change the structure and increase the share of greenfield investments in the total foreign direct investments.","[Stimac, Helena] Fac Econ Osijek, Trg Ljudevita Gaja 7, Osijek, Croatia; [Lozic, Zvonimir] Trg Nikole Subica Zrinskog 24, Dakovo, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Stimac, H (通讯作者)，Fac Econ Osijek, Trg Ljudevita Gaja 7, Osijek, Croatia.",helena.stimac@efos.hr; zvonimir.lozic@gmail.com,"Štimac, Helena/AAP-1248-2021","Štimac, Helena/0000-0003-3699-2112",,,,,12,0,0,0,1,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,1113,1122,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900117,0

Speaking of continental, eastern parts of Croatia, it is possible to conclude that it is the least developed region in this country. Great damage has been made in the population structure and development processes by the influence of a war, which has left great consequences in regional, as in demographical development. Empirical part of the paper is based on the identification of causes and consequences of slower development of the estern region of Croatia, and also on historical heritage in the tourism industry. The main objective of a paper is to define historical haritage of eastern Croatia, to perceive its influence during the making of a demmand, and to see in which way will agrotourism objects promote destination heritage. Cultural and historical attractions frequently have the effect on choosing the destination to travel to, as its elements of a supply. One of the first motives for traveling, is tendency to discover authentic heritage, which destinations use while creating promotion and reputation at the market. Concern areas differ. During a visit to tourism destination in its natural surroundings, tourists can see, feel, and fully comprehend regional, national, past and present cultural creativity, beauty of national dances, cultural and art wealth in museums, as in historical cities and its structures. Despite its poor development, eastern region of Croatia is full of cultural and historic heritage which not only has static elements, but also has its traditions and a way of living. These elements can be used while creating the brand of a destination. In order to follow contemporary trends, sustainable development should be applied to already mentioned elements, with an accent on ecological tourism. Despite all, the need has been shown for a faster regional development in order to stabilize migration of inhabitants of eastern Croatia, as to improve the effect of historical heritage in agrotourism, and sustainable effect of ecological tourism.","[Tvrdak, Mirela; Juric, Kristina; Tubic, Dejan] Coll Tourism & IT Management Virovitica, Matije Gupca 78, Virovitica 33000, Croatia",,"Tvrdak, M (通讯作者)，Coll Tourism & IT Management Virovitica, Matije Gupca 78, Virovitica 33000, Croatia.",mirela.tvrdak@gmail.com; jurickristina875@gmail.com; dejan.tubic@vsmti.hr,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,3,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,73,81,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900006,0

So the research question arises what are the quantitative differences in the output indicators for these two basic categories of the innovation typology? The answer is certainly not unambiguous and it depends on the selection of factors and indicators used by the research. Research on proposed topic is recently significantly intensified in developing or transition countries. Providing accurate data on the innovation outputs successfulness should facilitate in better shaping the innovation strategies, both, by the institutional framework and within firms themselves. Therefore, the aim of this paper, based on the basic typology of innovation, is to provide an answer whether the technology-oriented firms in the Republic of Croatia are more successful in innovating their products or innovating their services. The research was carried out on a sample of 89 technology-oriented companies in the Republic of Croatia. Simplified statistical methods including the correlation matrix and the arithmetic mean values of the stratified sample were applied, and the results of this paper show demonstrate higher levelof successfulness in commercialising innovative products in comparison with innovative services.

Due to the character of the individual questions and the scales on which the responses to them were expressed, the differences between the Mann-Whitneyev and Kruskal-Wallis test were used in the study of the significance of the differences. Research results can give an insight into the potential of functional food production in eastern Croatia which could reflect on economic development.","[Zavisic, Zeljka; Sipic, Neven] Zagreb Sch Business, Ulica Grada Vukovara 68, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Zavisic, Senka] Polytech Lavoslav Ruzicka Vukovar, Zupanijska 50, Vukovar 32000, Croatia",,"Zavisic, Z (通讯作者)，Zagreb Sch Business, Ulica Grada Vukovara 68, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",zeljka.zavisic@pvzg.hr; neven.sipic@pvzg.hr; senkaza@gmail.com,"Zavišić, Senka/ADY-9645-2022",,,,,,9,0,0,1,2,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,216,223,,,,,,8,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900022,0

Despite the binding nature of each country's emissions-limitation target, levels of compliance varied greatly. What explains this variation in compliance? This article shows that the amount of material consumption within each country may contribute to answering this question. Using cross-sectional time-series data analysis for 36 Annex I (developed) countries from 2000 to 2012 and controlling for a range of domestic and international factors, quantitative analysis shows that compliance with emissions targets is least likely to be realized in countries with higher levels of consumption. This tendency has vitally important implications for agreements on future emissions limitations because those agreements must include more of the large developing countries that are intent on raising their own citizens' consumption toward levels in the developed world. Without addressing consumption behaviors and the policy implications thereof, adequately mitigating GHG pollution in the future, notably through the 2015 Paris Agreement, will be extremely difficult.","[Lee, Taedong] Yonsei Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 50 Yonsei Ro 50, Seoul, South Korea; [Harris, Paul G.] Educ Univ Hong Kong, Dept Social Sci, 10 Lo Ping Rd, Tai Po, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Yonsei University; Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK),"Lee, T (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 50 Yonsei Ro 50, Seoul, South Korea.",pharris@eduhk.hk; tdlee@yonsei.ac.kr,"Lee, Taedong/AAJ-5234-2020; Harris, Paul G./D-5498-2012","Lee, Taedong/0000-0002-5671-7938; Harris, Paul G./0000-0003-3647-5692",National Research Foundation of Korea [2016S1A3A2924409],National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea),Funding was provided by National Research Foundation of Korea (Grant No. 2016S1A3A2924409).,,58,7,7,0,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

This study examines the current importance of Hara Biosphere Reserve (HBR) in local livelihood and welfare. Using a household survey, data were collected through a questionnaire, key informant interviews and direct observations. Two hundred and forty-four households were randomly selected from 10 villages through proportional sampling. Results showed that non-environmental income was the first driver of the total income, poverty alleviation and narrowing income inequality gap. Park income was the second. The results also showed that excluding park income from total income would significantly increase headcount poverty, widen the poverty gap, and raise the Gini coefficient. Wealthier households had the greatest absolute income from the environment, including forest, fishing and fodder. However, the poorest group had smallest absolute income from these sources. Thus, the study demonstrated that wealthier households are responsible for the overharvesting of environmental resources. Interestingly, the study showed that wealthier households are more dependent on profitable environmental incomes sources while the poorest are more dependent on non-profitable ones.

Regarding droughts, planning instruments are important for managing water resources and diminishing the losses. Under increasing demand scenario, varied criteria should be incorporated indicating society's capacity to bear the consequences. Here we present a Brazilian-contextualized insurance model and suggest its outputs as complementary criteria to assist water resources management and to inform the stakeholders. From the streamflow simulated using hydrologic models driven by a climate scenario, we applied the Hydrologic Risk Transfer Model (MTRH-SHS), an insurance fund simulator under a multi-year policy, to assess sustainability indicators and the premiums a community would pay to cover the expenses of water deficits. Multiple scenarios generated with MTRH-SHS link water yield and seasonality related to both premium and loss ratios. A 20% increase in water demand elevates the premium up to 0.1% of a local GDP. Even under current demand, premiums may surpass 0.5% of GDP because of changes in the hydrologic regime. Proportionally, more seasonal or varied regimes result in more heterogeneous loss events, which in turn is linked to higher insurance premiums. MTRH-SHS might raise awareness for decision-makers to cope with drought under changing water demand and climate in the Brazilian context. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The basic objective of this study is to provide empirical evidence on the effect of combining social health insurance (SHI) and private health insurance (PHI) on OOP payments. Further, this study examines the catastrophic impact of OOP payments on insured's welfare using the incidence and intensity methodological approach of measuring catastrophic health care expenditures. Conducting a cross-sectional survey in Greece in 2013, we find that the combination of SHI-PHI has a strong negative influence on insured OOP payments for inpatient health care in private hospitals. Furthermore, our results indicate that SHI coverage is not sufficient by itself to manage with this issue. Moreover, we find that poor people present a greater tendency to incur catastrophic OOP expenditures for hospital health care in private providers. Drawing evidence from Greece, a country with huge fiscal problems that has suffered the consequences of the economic crisis more than any other, could be a starting point for policymakers to consider the perspective of SHI-PHI co-operation against OOP payments more seriously.","[Grigorakis, Nikolaos; Tsangari, Haritini] Univ Nicosia, Sch Business, Nicosia, Cyprus; [Floros, Christos; Tsoukatos, Evangelos] TEI Crete, Sch Management & Econ, Iraklion, Greece",University of Nicosia; Hellenic Mediterranean University,"Floros, C (通讯作者)，TEI Crete, Sch Management & Econ, Iraklion, Greece.",nigrigor@yahoo.com; cfloros@staff.teicrete.gr; tsangari.h@unic.ac.cy; tsoukat@staff.teicrete.gr,"Grigorakis, Nikolaos/AAG-4528-2021; Tsangari, Haritini/ABF-6532-2021; Floros, Christos/O-2883-2013","Tsoukatos, Evangelos/0000-0002-2670-8555; Tsangari, Haritini/0000-0002-0074-6318",,,,,163,7,9,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2199-9023,2199-9031,,INT J HEALTH ECON MA,Int.

I use college majors to proxy for skill types among workers with a bachelor's degree. Workers with college training in information-oriented and technical fields (e.g., STEM areas such as engineering, physical sciences, and economics) are associated with economically important within-field agglomeration economies and also generate sizeable spillovers for workers in other fields. In contrast, within-field and across-field spillovers for workers with college training in the arts and humanities are much smaller and often nonexistent. While previous research suggests proximity to college-educated workers enhances productivity, these findings suggest that not all college-educated workers are alike. Instead, positive spillover effects appear to derive mostly from proximity to workers with college training in information-oriented and technical fields.","[Liu, Shimeng] Jinan Univ, Inst Econ & Social Res, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Jinan University,"Liu, SM (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Inst Econ & Social Res, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",shimengliu.econ@gmail.com,,,,,,,35,5,5,2,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

This article seeks to challenge the frequent assumption that the strength of family ties in southern Europe mitigated the need for welfare provision. It provides new data for men and boys entering the Barcelona workhouse in the period 1780-1803, and compares these with data from an earlier study of women and girls who entered the same institution over the period 1762-1805. We establish the characteristics of those who sought relief in terms of age, place of origin, marital status, and occupation. We use the information on reasons for entry and exit to ascertain family circumstances.

Even if a more eco-efficient use of natural resources cannot guarantee lower resource consumption, it can allow a better combination of desirable economic activity with undesirable resource use. However, more eco-efficient use of resources at the micro-level does not always lead to higher eco-efficiency at the macro-level. This is due to resource flows between actors at the micro-level. They use both virgin resources and resources that have been previously used. Virgin resources represent the relevant scarcity at the macro level, while eco-efficiency at the micro-level typically does not discriminate between virgin and used resources. We develop an eco-efficiency formula that closes this gap. Our formula not only allows the measurement of the eco-efficiency of virgin resource use at the micro-level, but also helps to identify the drivers of the eco-efficiency of virgin resource use. Application of the formula to the case of gold in smartphones points to the very limited potential of technical improvements and shows that behavioural and collaborative endeavours promise dramatically higher improvements in eco-efficiency. This calls for a reconsideration of the focus of efforts to increase eco-efficiency for sustainable development. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The paper elaborates a conceptual framework based on institutional interactions and distinguishes core, complementary, and supplementary synergies that may be realized between the SDGs and REDD+. Potential synergies are analyzed at the global level, as well as within two national-level contexts: Indonesia, with its long-standing REDD+ programme, and Myanmar, which is in the early stages of implementing REDD+. Both are now also engaging nationally with the SDG implementation process. Our research draws on literature review and document analysis, direct observations of global policy processes relating to REDD+ and SDGs, as well as extensive engagement (of one author) at national level in Indonesia and Myanmar. Our analysis reveals that there are currently significant opportunities to pursue synergies in the implementation of these international initiatives at the national level, although pro-active interaction management is necessary, especially to achieve complementary synergies.","[Lima, Mairon G.

Aiming at a more nuanced gender analysis, this study examines how husbands and wives within the same household perceive climate risks and use group-based approaches as coping strategies. The data stem from a unique intra-household survey involving 156 couples in rural Kenya. The findings indicate that options for adapting to climate change closely interplay with husbands' and wives' roles and responsibilities, social norms, risk perceptions and access to resources. A higher percentage of wives were found to adopt crop-related strategies, whereas husbands employ livestock- and agroforestry-related strategies. Besides, there are gender-specific climate information needs, trust in information and preferred channels of information dissemination. Further, it turned out that group-based approaches benefit husbands and wives differently. Policy interventions that rely on group-based approaches should reflect the gender reality on the ground in order to amplify men's and women's specific abilities to manage risks and improve well-being outcomes in the face of accelerating climate change.

The present study applies an interdisciplinary 'value landscapes approach' to water governance in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil, using conflicts around the construction of the Paraguay-Parana Waterway as a case study. Using material from interviews with major stakeholders in the region, the results demonstrate that supporters of the waterway hold similar 'value landscapes' around economic values of water, efficiency, order, and economic development, while opponents' 'value landscapes' centre on cultural and non-economic values of water, social justice, solidarity, conservation and tradition. This suggests that persistent conflicts around the Paraguay-Parana Waterway are only an expression of much deeper value conflicts that are also relevant to other water governance issues. Moreover, values expressed through the planned construction of the Paraguay-Parana Waterway disproportionately reflect values of powerful stakeholder groups such as the agribusiness sector, which significantly undermines its political legitimacy.

However, little is known yet about members' actual energy use and how it differs from that of individuals who do not participate in such projects. In particular, selection effects are likely to arise, i.e. community-based energy projects may attract people that are different from the underlying population in terms of energy use. This article empirically addresses the question of the selection into community-based energy projects in terms of energy use, focusing on the case of renewable energy cooperatives. Based on quantitative data from an original survey conducted with one renewable energy cooperative in Flanders and using probit regression analyses, it contrasts a sample of cooperative members with an appropriate comparison group in terms of electricity usage. The results show that electricity consumption is positively related with cooperative membership, suggesting that high use consumers have greater incentives to join a community-based organization which provides assistance and advice on the adoption of green technologies and energy efficiency measures. These findings contribute to an understanding of the relationship between community-based governance and sustainable energy practices.

In this paper we analysed the thematic scope of sustainability assessment tools, and compared assessment results from sustainability assessment tools. A coverage analysis of four tools (RISE, SAFA, PG and IDEA) demonstrated the diversity in approaches to assess sustainability at farm level. Tool developers select different (sub)themes and indicators, and apply different methods for measurement and aggregation of scores. This variability in approaches results not only in different tools, but can also result in different conclusions on the sustainability performance of farms. Decisions made in the development of a sustainability assessment tool need to be transparent to understand and explain the results of a tool and support farmers in a sustainable development of their farm. To improve the transparency in sustainability assessment tools we presented a framework describing decisions made in the development of a tool. An increased transparency in sustainability assessment tools can reduce the risk on distorted assessment results and actions, and contribute to the trust and relevance of future sustainability assessments.

One source that provides local food is urban agriculture, the farming in and around cities. A number of urban farmers are selling their products directly to consumers. In addition, consumers have the option to grow their own food on certain urban farms. Given this, we investigate how likely consumers are to purchase or grow their own food at urban farms and what determines this likelihood. Given that millennials are a key stakeholder of sustainable consumption and those with the greatest increase in numbers of food gardeners, we conducted an online survey with over 300 Generation Y respondents. We investigate whether young consumers perceive the health impacts and environmental benefits provided by urban agriculture, and what attitudes they hold towards this source of produce. Empirical results show that both psychological and personal factors affect consumer intentions to participate in urban agriculture. Among others, subjective knowledge regarding urban agriculture and a generally favorable attitude towards urban farms increases the likelihood to buy and grow produce at urban farms. Female and older consumers are more likely to grow their own produce. These findings,can be used by stakeholders in urban agriculture to design target-oriented marketing activities.

It finds that a high-quality urban textile industry was able to solve externalities using a range of ex ante and ex post monitoring mechanisms based on private market relationships and fair sanctions which effectively reduced adverse selection and information asymmetries. Instead, when guilds did use their quality regulations, the effect of the guild on information asymmetries and the industry as a whole was generally negative, by providing mechanisms that could be manipulated by entrenched interest groups for rent-seeking purposes.",,,,,"Caracausi, Andrea/AAV-1072-2021",,FIRB 'Futuro in Ricerca' Project [RBFR12GBQZ_002]; Royal Society of Edinburgh,"FIRB 'Futuro in Ricerca' Project(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)Fund for Investment in Basic Research (FIRB)); Royal Society of Edinburgh","I would like to thank Francesco Ammannati, Riccardo Cella, Samuel K.

Living in close proximity to the Bay improves access to these amenities and should be capitalized into local housing markets. We investigate these impacts in the largest hedonic analysis of water quality ever completed, with over 200,000 property sales across 14 Maryland counties. We use a spatially explicit water quality dataset, along with a wealth of landscape, economic, geographic, and demographic variables. These data allow a comprehensive exploration of the value of water quality, while controlling for a multitude of other influences. We also estimate several variants of the models most popular in current literature, with a focus on the temporal average of water quality. In comparing 1 year and 3 year averages, the 3 year averages generally have a larger implicit price. Overall, results indicate that water quality improvements in the Bay, such as those required by EPA's Total Maximum Daily Load, could yield significant benefits to waterfront and near-waterfront homeowners.","[Walsh, Patrick] Landcare Res, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Griffiths, Charles; Guignet, Dennis; Klemick, Heather] US Environm Protect Agcy, Natl Ctr Environm Econ, Washington, DC USA",Landcare Research - New Zealand; United States Environmental Protection Agency,"Walsh, P (通讯作者)，Landcare Res, Christchurch, New Zealand.",WalshP@LandcareResearch.co.nz,,"Klemick, Heather/0000-0003-2141-2023; Walsh, Patrick/0000-0001-9390-6538",,,,,56,40,50,0,20,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

We modeled the ecology (tree density and forest yields) and the production chain, including rents of the three major rubber products: Pressed Virgin Rubber (PVR), Liquid Latex (LL), and Liquid Smoked Sheet (LSS) from native forests and from plantations in Southern Acre, including the emblematic Chico Mendes Reserve. Our estimates show that, in native forests, tree density ranges from 0 to 4 trees/ha (average = 1.67 trees/ha), while productivity varies from 1 to 3 l/tree/year (average = 2.26 l/tree/year) with yields between 1 and 6 l/ha/year. Our model estimates a potential annual production of 890 tons of dry rubber in the 2.5 million ha of forests of Southern Acre (average = 0.36 kg/ha/year). Rubber extraction in native forests is not economically viable without government subsidies. Mean Equivalent Annual Annuity (EAA) for LL is US$ 3.24 ha/year in a scenario with subsidies and of 75% of potential annual harvest. LSS from plantations reaches an EAA of US$ 270 ha/year if costs of formation are subsidized. Public subsidies or Payments for Ecosystem Services are essential to sustain, at least temporally, rubber tapper identity-an important Cultural Ecosystem Service of the Amazon. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We here apply a cumulative long-term perspective to gain broader insights into the material requirements of human well-being, the role of trade and the history of environmental pressures than the usual perspective of annual or most recent flows would reveal. Furthermore, we investigate environmental pressures expressed as cumulative extraction per area over the last 60 years. To both ends, we utilize cumulative data on material flows on domestic material inputs (DMI) and domestic extraction (DE) for 148 countries from 1950 - to 2010 and the Social Progress Index. We find that a high level of well-being required at least 460 t/cap of cumulative material inputs from 1950- to 2010. An analysis of the relation between cumulative flows and current human well-being shows statistically significant that at similar levels of cumulative material inputs, biophysical export-orientation of a country has a weak negative influence on well-being. When the Sustainable Development Goals are to be achieved, the scientific community and policy makers have to consider the history of development of resource use to better understand the future challenges ahead.

This paper extends this discussion by taking up environmental regulations' implications for allocative efficiency. It establishes a model framework that allows disentangling managerial and regulatory induced allocative efficiencies, and utilizes Data Envelopment Analysis to a sample of 67 coal-to-gas substituting power plants observed from 2002 to 2008 to calculate Nerlovian profit efficiencies and their technical and allocative efficiency components. The empirical results illustrate that failing to control for environmental regulations leads to overestimation of managerial allocative efficiencies by ignoring compliance costs.

To explain this remarkable achievement, we study the relationship between trade costs and the intensive and extensive margins of trade. The establishment of a foreign diplomatic network that lowered beachhead costs and enabled the entry of new products was an essential fact of the trade boom. Interestingly, the expansion in trade in certain sectors did not translate into faster productivity growth.

J,"Long, LE",,,,"Long, Leah E.",,,Extracting economics from Roman marble quarries,ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Urbanization across the Roman Empire created a demand for building materials on an unprecedented scale. Quarrying was largely conducted by municipalities, institutions, or landed aristocrats, who owned or inherited the valuable land from which stone was extracted. By using principles of economics as a guide, and with greater coordination between theory and written and archaeological sources, this article examines the decision-making processes involved in opening a quarry. Theories of economic rationality, resource economics, and statistical methods are helpful for understanding the prices for marble recorded in Diocletian's Edict, Roman jurists' writings about exploitation on private land, and newly discovered quarries in the region of Aphrodisias, Turkey. Here it is argued that the exchange of local building stone took place in a competitive market where landowners actively tried to improve their financial situation, but did so at considerable risk. At Aphrodisias, examples of failed attempts exist alongside long-running and successful enterprises. Entrepreneurs there did not extract a homogeneous set of resources, but chose to target marbles with inconsistent physical properties at increasing distances from the city in response to greater demand and rising prices. Roman jurists, primarily interested in protecting property value, made landowners calculate whether potential profits earned from sales outweighed the degradation of land.","[Long, Leah E.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ Qatar, Ar Rayyan, Qatar",,"Long, LE (通讯作者)，Virginia Commonwealth Univ Qatar, Ar Rayyan, Qatar.",lelong@vcu.edu,,,,,,,64,14,15,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Concentration is one of the main measures of competition on every market. Banking has the major role in the development of an economy and thus concentration in banking is important for the entire national economy. Namely, bank loans ensure economic growth (they affect GDP, capital inflows). Concentration of banking in the region of eastern Croatia has been measured with concentration ratios, the Herfindahl-Hirschman index, the Lorenz's curve, the Gini's coefficient and Entropy index. The aim of this study is to stress the comparison of banking concentration in the Republic of Croatia and eastern Croatia, and to research whether the indicators for eastern Croatia give us greater, lower or equal measure of concentration in banking for the whole area in the Republic of Croatia. For the calculation of indicators that are applied in the analysis of the concentration individual exposures of the twenty largest clients of all banks operating in the Republic of Croatia have been taken into account, and especially individual exposures of twenty largest customers of all banks operating in the region of eastern Croatia. All these indicators have been taken on 31st of December and have been considered for a period of six years, in the period from 2010 to 2015.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors develop a conceptualization of the business model concept and some of its main components - considering an internal and external orientation - and how they can be applied to the gastronomic sector. On this basis, the authors propose, develop and test an empirical framework for the economic sustainability of gastronomic enterprises. Based on data from a publicly available database of the Danish hospitality sector, the authors conduct hierarchical cluster analysis to identify different business models for the Danish gastronomic sector. Findings - Given the diversity of the gastronomic sector, there can be a multitude of alternative business models and characteristics, which may enable the sector to create value through, for example, product differentiation, market segmentation, and so on. The analysis revealed nine different clusters, which represent different business models in terms of value creation, segmentation, and resource utilization highlighting either more closed or open business models. These business models offer a basis for considering the opportunities and barriers for business model innovation - for both startups and incumbent firms - within gastronomy and agri-food more generally. Originality/value - The gastronomic sector is diverse and heterogeneous with a multitude of possible alternative business models. This paper provides a basis for considering the key enablers of business model development in this sector.

It further investigates the impact of product knowledge on product choice cue utilisation and its moderating role on the impact of consumer involvement. Design/methodology/approach - The case of wine as an exemplary product category is considered, given the importance and variability of choice cues that have been found to affect product choice. Analysis is conducted on survey data from a sample of wine consumers in Ontario, Canada. Product choice cues are grouped into extrinsic, intrinsic and marketing mix. The importance of how these cues are influenced from different dimensions of consumer involvement is illustrated. Findings - The results show that product knowledge has a positive impact on intrinsic product cue utilisation and further moderates this relationship improving the predictability of the hypothesised model. Implications for theory and practice are also discussed. Practical implications - From an industry viewpoint, the focus in the past has mostly been on using packaging to attract attention/create awareness, create an image of desirability, etc., but not nearly as much on the functionality aspects thereof; for example alternative smaller packaging sizes to the standard 750 ml wine bottle. Originality/value - The study uses a multi-dimensional approach to measure the impact of enduring involvement on utilisation of product choice cues.","[Bruwer, Johan; Chrysochou, Polymeros] Univ South Australia, Sch Mkt, Ehrenberg Bass Inst Mkt Sci, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Bruwer, Johan] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Chrysochou, Polymeros] Aarhus Univ, MAPP Ctr, Dept Management, Aarhus, Denmark; [Lesschaeve, Isabelle] Univ Guelph, Dept Food Sci, Guelph, ON, Canada",University of South Australia; Stellenbosch University; Aarhus University; University of Guelph,"Bruwer, J (通讯作者)，Univ South Australia, Sch Mkt, Ehrenberg Bass Inst Mkt Sci, Adelaide, SA, Australia.;Bruwer, J (通讯作者)，Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Stellenbosch, South Africa.",johan.bruwer@unisa.edu.au,"Chrysochou, Polymeros/E-3176-2019; Bruwer, Johan/L-1280-2013","Chrysochou, Polymeros/0000-0002-7905-5658; Bruwer, Johan/0000-0001-7568-605X",,,,,53,40,41,7,62,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

This index system defines index coefficient through Uncertain Type Analysis of Hierarchy Process (UTAHP), and this index system represents five risk grades. In this way, we can propose one scientific means to define financing risk of agricultural products supply chain.

The target of young consumers was chosen because of its association with the choice of consumption behaviours often resulting in health and social issues related to alcohol. The focus on motivations, on the other hand, is justified by the need to assess the contents of appropriate and efficient communication campaigns for both producers and public institutions. Design/methodology/approach - A means-end approach was used on a sample of young consumers from Tuscany via face-to-face interviews. The interviews were carried out with students who were completing their last year of high school. The results were processed using an MEC analyst software for the construction of the hierarchical value maps and cognitive maps showing the links between products and consumers. Findings - The results highlighted the perception of a socialisation attribute that is stronger when linked to the consumption of beer and spirits; however, wine is still perceived as a non-friendly beverage. The aspect of socialisation underlines both the pleasure of sharing consumption experiences and the dangerous binge drinking behaviour. Thanks to this approach, the study identifies the main elements in the cognitive structure that, if used to define a communication strategy, may guarantee a high degree of efficacy. Originality/value - The findings of the study constitute valuable information that can be used to prepare stages of communication plans within larger corporate and social marketing strategies. The wine sector can benefit from understanding the motivations that prevent young people from drinking wine and can attempt to fill the psychological and cognitive gap between young consumers and the product. Public institutions, on the other hand, may benefit from understanding the motivations that lead young people towards dangerous drinking behaviours. In turn, the institutions may be able to send appropriate messages within their communication activities aimed at containing such behaviours.","[Fabbrizzi, Sara; Marinelli, Nicola; Menghini, Silvio; Casini, Leonardo] Univ Florence, GESAAF, Florence, Italy",University of Florence,"Marinelli, N (通讯作者)，Univ Florence, GESAAF, Florence, Italy.",nicola.marinelli@unifi.it,"Marinelli, Nicola/KDN-5547-2024","Marinelli, Nicola/0000-0003-1422-9183; Menghini, Silvio/0000-0002-5304-3536",,,,,64,12,13,1,36,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - In this paper a qualitative case study approach was used. Following a comprehensive literature review, based on factors known to be important in developing a food safety culture, in combination with national and international food safety standards, an interview guide was constructed and utilised in a series of semi-structured interviews. The interviewees represented different management levels involved in food delivery but did not include board level managers. Findings - Many of the factors considered important in good food safety management, including the presence of a formal food safety policy and the creation and maintenance of a positive food safety culture, were absent. Although a formal system of internal hygiene auditing existed and food safety training was provided to food handlers they were not integrated into a comprehensive approach to food safety management. Food safety leadership, communication and support were considered deficient with little motivation for staff to practise good hygiene. Originality/value - Food safety culture is increasingly recognised as a contributory factor in foodborne disease outbreaks and is the focus of increasing research. However, although every food business has a unique food safety culture there are relatively few published papers concerning its analysis, application and use within specific businesses. This case study has identified food safety culture shortcomings within a large food service facility suggesting there was a potentially significant food safety risk and indicates ways in which food safety could be improved and the risk reduced. The results also suggest further work is needed in the subject of food safety culture and its potential for reducing foodborne disease.","[Griffith, Christopher J.] Cardiff Metropolitan Univ, Sch Appl Sci, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Jackson, Linda M.; Lues, Ryk] Cent Univ Technol Free State, Dept Life Sci, Bloemfontein, South Africa",Cardiff Metropolitan University; Central University of Technology; University of the Free State,"Lues, R (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Technol Free State, Dept Life Sci, Bloemfontein, South Africa.",rlues@cut.ac.za,,,,,,,61,27,31,2,49,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - Jaew sauce was heated for six hours and samples were collected at 1.5 hours interval. The color of jaew sauce was measured using color spectrophotometer and consumers examined the underlying sensory qualities of jaew sauce using sorting technique. A total of 40 Thai and foreign consumers were asked to sort the commercial and the heated jaew sauce samples according to the similarities and dissimilarities in sensory characteristics and provide descriptions for explanation of each group. A consumer test with 100 Thai and foreign consumers was also conducted to determine the acceptance of jaew sauce. Findings - Alterations in the sensory qualities, mainly color, were observed. Prolong heating resulted in darker color. The sorting results showed that Thai and foreign consumers have similar perception of jaew sauce. Similar groupings of jaew sauce was observed, which could be divided into four groups, commercial, 0 hour heating, 1.5 and 3 hours heating, and 4.5 and 6 hours heating. Agreeing results of both Thai and foreign consumers showed that commercial and 0 hour heating samples were most preferred and the acceptance of jaew sauce decreased as it was heated. Originality/value - Despite the extensive usage of jaew, very few are available commercially in the market. The fact that Thai and foreign consumers have similar preference infer that jaew sauce has a high potential to be adopted and accepted among foreigners to a large extent if available commercially. This study also provides a basis into further research on an appropriate packaging and shelf-life study of jaew sauce for commercial purposes.","[Kitsawad, Kamolnate; Joseph, Blessing Amarachi; Tipvarakarnkoon, Tatsawan] Assumption Univ, Fac Biotechnol, Dept Food Technol, Bangkok, Thailand",,"Kitsawad, K (通讯作者)，Assumption Univ, Fac Biotechnol, Dept Food Technol, Bangkok, Thailand.",ploykts@gmail.com,,,,,,,35,1,1,0,11,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Thus, the purpose of this paper is to characterize the supply chain structure, and identify its major fragilities. Design/methodology/approach - Supply chain mapping was conducted based on the existing literature and primary data collection. Key stakeholders were detected and questioned through semi-structured interviews, which were later interpreted with content analysis. Findings - The results reveal a low degree of chain coordination from the Brazilian farm to the Chinese consumer, arising from an immature traceability mechanism, a limited flow of reliable information between the segments, and low trust between the stakeholders. Research limitations/implications - The infancy of the beef trade, the paucity of literature on the topic, and restricted accessibility to key governmental and official materials imposes limits on the available information. Language and cultural barriers might have also impacted the interviewees' responses. However, the participation of Brazilian and Chinese academics in both the interview analysis and chain mapping mitigates these shortcomings. Practical implications - The Brazilian public and private sectors need to establish a reliable traceability system and information platform. This, together with investments in marketing and branding, would facilitate differential responses among traders and consumers, and, hence, improve supply chain sustainability.

Design/methodology/approach - This study investigates the price transmission between international prices and the factories' purchasing prices on a daily basis. An auto-regressive asymmetric error correction model is estimated to find evidence for APT. In a subsequent step the rents that are redistributed from factories to farmers are calculated. The study then provides estimations of the size of this redistribution under different scenarios. Findings - The results suggest that factories do indeed transmit prices asymmetrically, which has substantial welfare implications: around USD3 million are annually redistributed from farmers to factories. If the price transmission was only half as asymmetric as it is observed, the majority of this redistribution was re-diverted. Originality/value - This study combines the approaches of non-parametric and parametric estimation techniques of estimating APT processes with a welfare perspective to quantify the distributional consequences of this intertemporal marketing margin manipulation. Especially the calculation of different scenarios of alternative price transmissions is a novelty. The data set of prices on such a disaggregated level and high frequency as required by this approach is also unique.","[Kopp, Thomas; Bruemmer, Bernhard] Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany; [Bruemmer, Bernhard] Univ Goettingen, Ctr Biodivers & Sustainable Land Use, Gottingen, Germany; [Alamsyah, Zulkifli] Univ Jambi, Fak Pertanian, Jambo, Indonesia; [Fatricia, Raja Sharah] Univ Jambi, Fak Ekon, Jambo, Indonesia",University of Gottingen; University of Gottingen; Universitas Jambi; Universitas Jambi,"Kopp, T (通讯作者)，Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany.",thomas.kopp@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Alamsyah, Zulkifli/AAQ-2384-2021; Brümmer, Bernhard/C-5067-2009; Kopp, Thomas/JYP-3141-2024","Alamsyah, Zulkifli/0000-0003-3927-2524; Brümmer, Bernhard/0000-0001-8052-4346; Kopp, Thomas/0000-0003-2181-4727; Fatricia, Raja Sharah/0000-0001-7312-4504",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [KO 5269/1-1],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),Thomas Kopp thanks Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) for generous support through project KO 5269/1-1.,,32,4,4,0,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The temporal stability of willingness to pay (WTP) has been tested extensively for contingent valuation, but rarely for stated preference choice experiments (CE). We use data from two identical CE surveys on different samples from the same population that occurred 17 months apart (Spring 2009 and Fall 2010) to estimate and compare mean WTP and preference parameters associated with threatened and endangered marine species protection. Our models account for both preference and scale heterogeneity, and the results suggest both types of heterogeneity matter. Tests of preference stability suggest stable preferences between 2009 and 2010. Furthermore, WTP values estimated from both surveys are not statistically different. This provides evidence that economic values estimated using CE methods are temporally stable.

These key food safety practices will help develop and design tailor-made training material for street food vendors in future. Design/methodology/approach - It is a cross-sectional study conducted in south Indian city of Hyderabad. Stratified random sampling method was employed. A total of 463 samples of street foods were collected from five zones of Hyderabad. They included 163 salad toppings, 150 fresh fruit juices and 150 panipuri samples. Identification and enumeration of foodborne pathogens and indicator organisms (S. aureus, E. coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Bacillus cereus, Yersinia spp.) were performed as described by USFDA-BAM. Information on food safety knowledge and handling practices from street vendors were collected using a structured questionnaire. Associations between hygiene practices and bacterial pathogens were done using ANOVA. Risk estimation of food safety practices was assessed by calculating odds ratio. Findings - Microbiological analysis indicated that a large number of carrot (98.1 percent) and onion (75.5 percent) samples were contaminated with E. coli. Peeled and cut fruits left uncovered have 13.4 times risk (OR: 2.40-74.8) of E. coli contamination compared to the covered ones. Panipuri samples picked from the vendors who did not have soap at the vending unit had significantly (p < 0.001) higher contamination of fecal coliforms than those who had.

Building on institutional theory, the authors empirically examine whether discourse in CSR reports aligns with commercial strategies. Design/methodology/approach - Employing a mixed method approach the authors quantify quotes related to key CSR themes in annual reports and claims on new private label products launched in nine key product categories using information from Mintel's Global New Products Database. These measures are grouped into eight distinct CSR themes across seven retailers and seven years (2006-2012). Findings - Health and safety and environment are the leading themes in both data sets. Animal welfare, community and biotechnology and novel foods take the middle ground with differing use across reports and products. Fair trade, labor and human resources and procurement and purchasing are the least commonly described themes in reports and on products. Retailers focus on different CSR themes in reports and new products, which may be evidence of competitive rather than pre-competitive strategies. Research limitations/implications - This research shows that UK food retailers CSR strategies between 2006 and 2012 were more competitive than pre-competitive, which is in line with theory that suggests economic pressures decrease incentives to cooperate. However, this research is limited to innovation data and analysis of CSR reports. A more complete analysis would need to consider sales or consumption data, wider sources of corporate communications and independent measures of social, environmental and economic impact. The authors' findings caution policy makers to be wary of retailers commitments to voluntary agreement pledges, particularly when the competitive environment and economic conditions are more challenging. Practical implications - Firms are increasingly pressured to contribute to social and environmental domestic and international commitments. Business should enhance coordination between CSR offices and commercial divisions to develop more consistent and effective social responsibility programs. Originality/value - This is the first attempt to compare the evolution of CSR discourse and marketing strategy over time and across businesses in a key retail market.","[Souza-Monteiro, Diogo] Newcastle Univ, Sch Agr Food & Rural Dev, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Hooker, Neal] Ohio State Univ, John Glenn Coll Publ Affairs, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Newcastle University - UK; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Hooker, N (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, John Glenn Coll Publ Affairs, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",hooker.27@osu.edu,,"Monjardino de Souza Monteiro, Diogo/0000-0002-3042-693X",,,,,47,23,24,4,62,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The leaf water content was estimated from leaf thickness in a continuous and non-destructive manner using an eddy current-type displacement sensor. Identification of model mechanisms was achieved and a dynamic model was built using neural networks. A three-layered neural network allowed such a complex system to be successfully identified and generated the model. Next, the control process was divided into six steps and the optimal six-step set points for water temperature that maximizes the leaf water content were examined by simulating the identified neural-network model, using genetic algorithms. The length of the control process was 10 hours, and each step took 90 minutes. The optimal 6-step set points for the water temperature were 40 -> 10 -> 40 -> 10 -> 40 -> 38 degrees C, under the constraint of a fixed water temperature from 10 to 40 degrees C. From simulation, it was confirmed that this operation is effective in maximizing the leaf water content of the tomato. Finally, this operation was applied to a real system. The resulting leaf water content in this operation was about 1.15 times larger than that in a conventional control. It is suggested that this control technique is useful for promoting water uptake of the root and associated higher leaf water content during a short-term period within a day.","[Yumeina, D.] Ehime Univ, United Grad Sch Agr Sci, Matsuyama, Ehime, Japan; [Yumeina, D.] Hasanuddin Univ, Dept Agr Engn, Makassar, Indonesia; [Aji, G.

We were interested in collectivism, individualism and the locus of control in young and middle-aged military leaders. We used three questionnaires in our research. We used The Problem Set- SET (by Mgczyliski, 1988, based on Vroom-Yetton, 1973), to assess what the decision-making style the participant prefers. The I-E Scale (elaborated by Gliszczyliska, 1990, based on Rotter, 1962, 1966) was employed to diagnose the locus of control. The third questionnaire, KIRH (prepared by Adamska, Retowski, and Konarski, 2005), measured collectivism and individualism. The research sample consisted of 168 randomly selected military leaders from military units in the Lower Silesia region. The study involved military leaders (managers) serving as officers in command positions, such as unit commanders, deputy unit commanders, platoon leaders, divisions, department chiefs, and section commanders. The main research questions concerned the levels of collectivism, individualism and the locus of control and their effects on the participation in decision making among military leaders in relation to age. Our findings showed a greater willingness to use participative leadership styles among military leaders. The older military leaders manifested higher egalitarian collectivism and internal locus of control compared with young ones. Young military leaders more often declared authoritarian leadership styles and hierarchical individualism.

It is often presented as an easy and low-cost intervention to alter individual behavior. However, there is limited insight into the cost effectiveness of these attempts and the impact of inserting behavioral policy instruments into an existing mix of traditional tools in a particular policy sector. Furthermore, there has been little focus on the intersection of large behavioral datasets and how they could complement behavioral insights. We present a conceptual overview of how the intersection of big data and behavioral knowledge would work in the renewable energy sector. We indicate that inserting behavioral insights into the energy instrument mix is complex due to technological trajectories, path dependencies and resistance from incumbent industries to change production patterns. We also highlight the underutilized role of large behavioral datasets that can inform not only policy implementation, but also policy design and evaluation efforts. Drawing on these findings, we introduce future research streams of government capacity in combining behavioral insights and data, the compatibility of this information with existing policy instruments and how this affects policy change.","[Giest, Sarah] Leiden Univ, Inst Publ Adm, Turfmarkt 99, NL-2511 DP The Hague, Netherlands; [Mukherjee, Ishani] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Social Sci, 90 Stamford Rd,Level 4, Singapore 178903, Singapore",Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Singapore Management University,"Mukherjee, I (通讯作者)，Singapore Management Univ, Sch Social Sci, 90 Stamford Rd,Level 4, Singapore 178903, Singapore.",im49@cornell.edu,"Mukherjee, Ishani/AAE-3694-2021","Giest, Sarah/0000-0001-8201-6943; Mukherjee, Ishani/0000-0002-1889-858X",,,,,67,14,15,1,31,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2018,123.0,,,,,,360,366,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.09.006,0.0,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HE6FW,,"Green Published, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000453499700036,0

That is, the Government expects to increase the current tax rates to the maximum levels set previously. In this instance, the tax on coal is intended to increase by 50%, while the tax on petroleum products is intended to increase by 33.33%. This study employs a computable general equilibrium model to assess the effects of these increases in taxes on the Vietnamese economy, focusing on energy, transportation, and the private sectors. Results show that an increase in tax on petroleum products will considerably affect the country with a reduction of real GDP by 1.99%. Exports and imports are also highly unfavorably affected. In this instance, the total emission level will be reduced by 7.12%. The increased tax on coal, however, will allow Vietnam to experience much lower un-favorable effects, while being able to cut a substantial amount of the emission level. For example, real GDP would only decline by 0.51%, while total emission level will be reduced by 10.25%. If these taxes are increased together, Vietnam will experience considerable contractions in the economy, but it is able to reduce a substantial emission level.","[Nong, Duy] Colorado State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Colorado State University,"Nong, D (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",duy.nong@colostate.edu,"Nong, Duy/AAH-5991-2019","Nong, Duy/0000-0002-4632-9835",,,,,32,21,22,0,22,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2018,123.0,,,,,,471,481,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.09.023,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HE6FW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000453499700047,0

The purpose of this study is to assess the impacts of these fixed power charges on the economics of PV systems under self-consumption schemes. Using real demand and generation data, simulations include detailed computation of annual billing savings, payback-time, self-consumption and self-sufficiency of a dwelling coupled with PV-battery system. A range of PV array and battery sizes are explored for different storage control strategies. Billing scenarios include a) only energy charges, b) Portuguese case (high energy charges and low fixed charges), c) Spanish case (low energy charges and high fixed charges), and d) only fixed charges. Results show that fixed charges require adding storage to residential PV systems. In spite of battery relative high costs, results also show that photovoltaics can be profitable with payback times below 10 years in all scenarios, as long as appropriately sized and with the suitable storage control strategy.","[Solano, J.

For this purpose annual reports from the company websites were analysed, which highlighted how biofuels were the main priority for investment for all three companies since the early 2000s, whereas Solar PV was also recently targeted by PIT and Bangchak Petroleum. The discourses formed to legitimize their investment varied according to energy source and company. Discourses on complying with government policy, enhancing national energy security, and increasing the uptake in environmental friendly energy were found repeatedly in the annual reports of all three companies. Finally, the study provides policy recommendations on how Thai authorities can take a proactive role in helping O&G companies' transition towards a low-carbon energy future.","[Chaiyapa, Warathida] Chiang Mai Univ, Sch Publ Policy, 155 Northern Sci Pk,Bldg B,Room 303-304, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand; [Esteban, Miguel] Waseda Univ, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Shinjuku Ku, 60-106,3-4-1 Okubo, Tokyo 1698555, Japan; [Kameyama, Yasuko] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Sustainable Social Syst Sect, Ctr Social & Environm Syst Res, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan",Chiang Mai University; Waseda University; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan,"Chaiyapa, W (通讯作者)，Chiang Mai Univ, Sch Publ Policy, 155 Northern Sci Pk,Bldg B,Room 303-304, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.",wwlnajah@gmail.com; esteban.fagan@gmail.com; ykame@nies.go.jp,,"Esteban, Miguel/0000-0003-3032-499X",,,,,73,39,42,6,50,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2018,120.0,,,,,,448,459,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.064,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO6DC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440123300042,0

For these years up to about 2065, fission energy from light water thermal reactors is relevant as an available, developed and proven non-carbon technology with the potential to make an essential contribution to the mitigation of global warming, in addition to renewable energy. Nuclear power is expected to have more economic advantages than intermittent renewable sources for generating base load electrical energy requirements. This would be especially important in the years from about 2025 up to 2065, during which one cannot expect a serious contribution from nuclear fusion and even less from fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage (CCS) facilities. In a strategy to eliminate all non-CCS coal power stations, some 1600 MW of nuclear power would be required and sufficient to cover the base load for the electrical energy supply system. This nuclear expansion should be accompanied by effective international safety assurances, including a mandate to stop construction of unsafe nuclear power plants. In the long term, after 2065, we expect inherently safe molten salt thorium reactors to compete with fusion reactors.","[Knapp, Vladimir; Pevec, Dubravko] Univ Zagreb, Fac Elect Engn & Comp, Unska 3, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Pevec, D (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Elect Engn & Comp, Unska 3, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",vladimir.knapp@fer.hr; dubravko.pevec@fer.hr,,,,,,,36,33,38,6,77,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2018,120.0,,,,,,94,99,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.027,0.0,,,6,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO6DC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440123300009,0

The structural changes in energy supply have served to reinforce the importance of national emissions accounting in promoting overall CO2 reduction policies. However, traditional approaches for evaluating industrial emissions have been criticized for their production-based perspective, which fails to consider emissions embodied in sectoral indirect consumption. The purpose of this study is therefore to understand the sectoral emission transfer. By applying economic input-output tables, detailed sectoral economic interactions can be usefully identified. It was found that the emissions embodied in final consumption generated largely by households. Besides, although emission intensity of manufacturing sector is extremely high in direct emission, agriculture sector is found to exceed other sectors in indirect emission intensities. From the consumption-side, these findings strongly suggest that a high priority be given to mitigation efforts aimed at reducing residential consumption, whist policy priorities are expected to be located on agriculture-related sectors from production-side. The study hence provides insights into how we can better allocate emissions responsibility and set reduction priorities among major economic sectors.","[Long, Yin; Yoshid, Yoshikuni; Sun, Lu] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Dept Environm Syst, 5-1-5 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778563, Japan; [Zhang, Runsen] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Int Dev & Cooperat, Hiroshima 7398529, Japan; [Dou, Yi] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Sun, Lu; Dou, Yi] NIES, Ctr Social & Environm Syst Res, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan",University of Tokyo; Hiroshima University; Nagoya University; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan,"Long, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Dept Environm Syst, 5-1-5 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778563, Japan.",long@globalenv.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Zhang, Runsen/HTN-9716-2023; Zhang, Runsen/U-1815-2017; Sun, Lu/L-2238-2019; Long, Yin/ABC-1391-2020","Sun, Lu/0000-0001-7356-7866; Long, Yin/0000-0002-6761-9735; Yoshida, Yoshikuni/0000-0002-8834-8671","Center for Low Carbon Society Strategy (LCS), Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)","Center for Low Carbon Society Strategy (LCS), Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)","This work was supported by Center for Low Carbon Society Strategy (LCS), Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST).",,37,32,32,1,52,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2018,119.0,,,,,,339,348,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.04.052,0.0,,,19,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO0XY,,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439671200031,0

The results indicate that energy and CO2 efficiency in China's commercial sector is generally low, and there are significant regional differences and enormous energy-savings and CO2 emission reduction potentials. Eastern China has the highest energy and CO2 efficiency of all the regions. From the perspective of dynamic performance, energy and CO2 efficiency performance in China's commercial sector improved by 3.8% annually over the period 1995-2015. Technological progress is the major driving factor improving energy and CO2 efficiency in the sector.

Firstly, we propose a novel integrated model to predict the quantity and intensity. The cumulative effects of several drivers for CO2 emissions are examined by Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index method. Secondly, the quantity and intensity are normalized to identify the feasible pathway of double control in various scenarios by multiple attribute decision model, and robustness test is carried out by a case study. The results show that per capita GDP has a significantly positive cumulative effect on CO2 emissions, whereas energy intensity has significantly negative one on it. The targeted carbon intensity by 2020 can be differentially realized in all scenarios. Both slow economic growth speed and substantial energy structure adjustment facilitate double control. The results suggest that the best pathway of double control depends on the policy makers' preferences on the quantity control and intensity control. The policy implications of the findings are discussed.","[Zhu, Bangzhu; Jiang, Minxing; Wang, Ping] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Business Sch, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Kefan] Wuyi Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Jiangmen 529020, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Chevallier, Julien] IPAG Business Sch, IPAG Lab, 184 Blvd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France; [Chevallier, Julien] Univ Paris 08, LED, 2 Rue Liberte, F-93526 St Denis, France; [Wei, Yi-Ming] Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Wuyi University; IPAG Business School; Universite Paris-VIII; Beijing Institute of Technology,"Zhu, BZ (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Business Sch, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Chevallier, J (通讯作者)，IPAG Business Sch, IPAG Lab, 184 Blvd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France.",wpzbz@126.com; julien.chevallier@ipag.fr,"Wang, Ke-Fan/H-1206-2013; Chevallier, Julien/AAY-9567-2020; Jiang, Minxing/HLQ-5718-2023","Chevallier, Julien/0000-0002-4423-9502;","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473180, 71201010, 71303174]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong [2014A030306031]; Department of Education of Guangdong [[2013]246, [2014]145]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); Department of Education of Guangdong,"We express our gratitude to the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71473180, 71201010 and 71303174), the Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Talents of Guangdong (2014A030306031) and the Department of Education of Guangdong ([2013]246, [2014]145) for funding supports.",,25,39,40,7,69,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2018,119.0,,,,,,377,+,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.04.025,0.0,,,21,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO0XY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439671200035,0

We use a McFadden's choice model to estimate willingness-to-pay for energy efficiency using data from a national residential energy efficiency grant scheme, estimating average marginal willingness-to-pay of (sic)0.127 /kWh/yr for retrofits that affect the efficiency of energy use required for space and water heating (e.g. boiler upgrades, heating controls). The results of this analysis are used to estimate the extent to which free-riding has occurred in the scheme. Less efficient and larger households are willing to pay more for energy efficiency improvements, while households that had previously retrofitted via the scheme were willing to pay over twice as much as those retrofitting for the first-time. Free-riding varies by retrofit measure, with solar collector retrofits possessing close to zero free-riders, while free-riders comprised over 33% of heating controls retrofits.","[Collins, Matthew; Curtis, John] Sir John Rogersons Quay, Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland; [Collins, Matthew] Sustainable Energy Author Ireland, Wilton Pk House,Wilton Pl, Dublin, Ireland; [Curtis, John] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin,"Curtis, J (通讯作者)，Sir John Rogersons Quay, Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland.;Curtis, J (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.",matthew.collins@esri.ie; john.curtis@esri.ie,"Curtis, John/Q-8539-2018","Curtis, John/0000-0002-6957-5684",Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland; ESRI's Energy Policy Research Centre,Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland; ESRI's Energy Policy Research Centre,"We acknowledge the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland for access to the anonymous dataset of Better Energy Homes scheme applications.

Introducing renewable electricity technologies (RETs) into community electrical systems could address both environmental and socioeconomic development issues. This paper identifies 71 RET projects developed in remote communities between 1980 and 2016 and uses the multi-level perspective (MLP) to examine the diffusion and governance processes influencing the transformation of these systems. The MLP framework explains the non-linear deployment of RETs through the shift from a utility driven phase focusing on hydroelectricity and small wind applications to a community driven phase concentrating on solar projects. Reasons for the development of projects in Yukon, Northwest Territories, British Columbia and Ontario include community interest in participating in local electricity generation, learning processes facilitated by multiple experiments, and the existence of supporting regulatory and fiscal policies that were negotiated and adapted to indigenous sustainability visions. The MLP framework indicates that remote indigenous communities now reject the role of passive recipients of technologies promoted by non-aboriginal interests. Instead, active participation in transforming electrical systems is sought, based on local sustainability agendas which further their goals of economic development and self governance.","[Karanasios, Konstantinos; Parker, Paul] Univ Waterloo, Dept Geog & Environm Management, Waterloo, ON, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Karanasios, K (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Dept Geog & Environm Management, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",kkaranasios@uwaterloo.ca,"Karanasios, Konstantinos/AAE-1555-2021","Karanasios, Konstantinos/0000-0003-4266-4609","Waterloo Institute of Sustainable Energy, Energy Council of Canada; Natural Resources Canada","Waterloo Institute of Sustainable Energy, Energy Council of Canada; Natural Resources Canada(Natural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest Service)","The Waterloo Institute of Sustainable Energy, Energy Council of Canada, and Natural Resources Canada supported this work.

While China is pioneering in including building sector in its Emission Trading System (ETS) pilots, there is few practical trading. This study investigates the reasons of lack trading via exploring a building owner's optimal strategy that is based on a multi-objective optimization model to achieve required carbon emissions reduction with minimal incremental costs. The investigated emissions reduction strategies include adopting low-carbon technologies, purchasing emission permits from ETS market, and non-compliance. A typical four-star hotel in Shenzhen, China is selected as an empirical case to validate the proposed model. The result shows that non-compliance is the preferable strategy by the owners, and there is no permits trading from the carbon market. Key influencing factors that affect the owners' strategic choice are further investigated with various scenarios and it is found that the probability of government environmental inspection, the penalty for non-compliance, and an owner's reputation loss will to a large extent change an owner's strategy. These findings provide a quantitative rationale for policymakers to reformulate existing initiatives and mechanisms to invigorate the ETS market in the building sector.","[Song, Xiangnan] Guangzhou Univ, Sch Management, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Song, Xiangnan; Lu, Yujie] Natl Univ Singapore, Sch Design & Environm, Dept Bldg, Singapore 117566, Singapore; [Lu, Yujie] Guizhou Univ, Sch Publ Adm, Guiyang 550025, Guizhou, Peoples R China; [Shen, Liyin] Chongqing Univ, Sch Construct Management & Real Estate, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China; [Shi, Xunpeng] Univ Technol Sydney, Australia China Relat Inst, 15 Broadway, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia; [Shi, Xunpeng] Hubei Univ Econ, Ctr Hubei Cooperat Innovat Emiss Trading Syst, Wuhan 430205, Hubei, Peoples R China",Guangzhou University; National University of Singapore; Guizhou University; Chongqing University; University of Technology Sydney; Hubei University of Economics,"Lu, YJ (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Bldg, 4 Architecture Dr, Singapore 117566, Singapore.",luy@nus.edu.sg,"Shen, Liyin/ABD-5171-2021; Lu, Yujie/AAF-1872-2020; Xunpeng, Roc Shi/I-5486-2019; Shen, Liyin/ABD-9631-2021","Lu, Yujie/0000-0002-9585-0192; Xunpeng, Roc Shi/0000-0001-9653-7395;",Singapore Ministry of Education [R-296-000-151-133]; Key Project of National Social Science Foundation of China [15AZD025],"Singapore Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education, Singapore); Key Project of National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences)",This study was partially funded by the Singapore Ministry of Education Tier 1 Research Grant that is administered by the National University of Singapore (R-296-000-151-133) and by the Key Project of National Social Science Foundation of China (No. 15AZD025).,,74,42,45,13,103,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUL,2018,118.0,,,,,,232,244,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.03.075,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GJ1TF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000435050000022,0

By improving local solar permitting processes, city governments can potentially reduce the soft costs of solar PV installations and facilitate the deployment of solar PV systems at the local level. Drawing data from California's annual statewide planning surveys, this paper examines the determinants for the adoption of solar approval processes and the policy impact on residential solar PV installations in California cities. The results demonstrate that cities with large population size, municipal utilities, and high proportions of pro-environment, educated constituents are more likely to adopt solar approval processes. Additionally, the presence of local solar approval processes is found to increase both total capacity and the number of small-scale residential solar PV installations in a city, holding all else equal. The empirical evidence presented in this research confirms the important role of local governments in the deployment of solar PV systems.","[Hsu, Jenneille Hwai-Yuan] Univ Southern Calif, Sol Price Sch Publ Policy, 650 Childs Way, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California,"Hsu, JHY (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Sol Price Sch Publ Policy, 650 Childs Way, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",jenneilh@usc.edu,,,,,,,64,28,31,3,16,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUN,2018,117.0,,,,,,463,472,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.03.008,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GF4KU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431932600046,0

Russian government identifies development of hydrocarbon refining as one of the priorities of the country's strategic development, and as such has included several goals as a part of the Energy Strategy of Russia up to 2035 project to serve as guidelines for the industry. In our research we have explored the implications and adequacy of these goals. Using the developed modeling tool, we composed a long term forecast of petroleum products output and investment up to 2035. The calculation show, that a full-scale renovation of the sector to meet the advanced global standards would require over 90 billion US$ of additional investment.

The core of the model is a standard macroeconomic DSGE framework that includes nominal and real frictions. The model includes oil as an input in multiple domestic sectors (consumption, intermediate goods, and transportation services). We include a domestic oil production sector for the United States to reflect the recent development in shale oil technology. The model also captures international trade in goods and oil. The model parameters are set through a combination of calibration and Bayesian estimation using quarterly data for 1991 through 2015. Baseline estimation of the model finds the elasticity of U.S. real GDP with respect to an oil price shock of 0.015, which is among the less elastic estimates in the literature. Using the model to conduct counterfactual analysis, we find that decreasing steady state U.S. oil consumption substantially reduces the response of real GDP to oil prices. Increasing U.S. domestic oil production only modestly reduces the response of real GDP to oil prices.","[Balke, Nathan S.] Southern Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, Dallas, TX 75275 USA; [Balke, Nathan S.] Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, Res Dept, POB 655906, Dallas, TX 75265 USA; [Brown, Stephen P.

In this study, we examine the fuel-price responsiveness across gas plant technologies and across the market structures in which the plants operate. We find that there are significant differences in the generation and efficiency responses of gas plants to fuel prices across generation technologies and market structures. Specifically, our results indicate that, regardless of market structure, generation from natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) plants is responsive to both coal and gas prices, but that generation from simple cycle (NGSC) plants only respond to gas prices. On the other hand, with respect to efficiency, we generally find that only NGCC plants operating in deregulated regions show statistically significant efficiency improvements in response to coal price increases and that, generally, neither NGCC or NGSC plants, regardless of market structure, respond in any significant way to gas prices. Finally, using these parameter estimates, we calculate emissions savings from efficiency improvements and fuel-switching possibilities. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Here we investigate alternative pathways for disruptive risks from such policies based on massive introduction on variable renewable electricity (VRE) with intersectoral coupling through Power-to-X technologies (P2X), also considering future demand uncertainties. We analyzed several risk involving scenarios for years 2030 and 2050 using a national energy system model with 1-h resolution, which includes power, heat and fuel sectors. The results indicate that even in case of worst-case energy policy risks with nuclear and bioenergy, a feasible energy system solution can be found. Renewable energy resources were employed to their maximum potential levels with P2X flexibility options, especially Power-to-Heat. However, without energy efficiency measures, the present renewable energy resource base was not able to compensate for all primary energy fall-out, which would lead to higher system costs and CO2 emissions. This implies that in case of high dominance of a few energy sources, an alternative pathway may require strong energy efficiency measures and developing further the renewable energy resource base.","[Pilpola, Sannamari; Lund, Peter D.] Aalto Univ, Sch Sci, New Energy Technol Grp, POB 15100, FI-00076 Espoo, Finland",Aalto University,"Pilpola, S (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Sch Sci, New Energy Technol Grp, POB 15100, FI-00076 Espoo, Finland.",sannamari.pilpola@aalto.fi,"Lund, Peter D/E-7563-2012","Lund, Peter D/0000-0002-4819-3847; Pilpola, Sannamari/0000-0002-2734-9566",Academy of Finland project DEFEND [285353]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [285353] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA),Academy of Finland project DEFEND; Academy of Finland (AKA)(Research Council of Finland),This work was financed from the Academy of Finland project DEFEND (285353).

Guidance on siting of these renewable energy facilities may help identify potential wildlife-facility conflicts with species of regulatory or economic concern. However, existing spatial guidance usually does not consider all wildlife that might use a potential facility location or corridors for its servicing infrastructure. We illustrate an approach toward assessing potential wildlife-facility conflicts using readily available vertebrate habitat models. The U.S. Geological Survey's Gap Analysis Program (GAP) has developed spatial models of potential habitat for vertebrate species across the entire nation. To illustrate their applicability, we used GAP models to estimate richness of all native, terrestrial vertebrates within Arizona and for those vertebrates grouped by class or by sensitivity to the type of facility infrastructure. We examined the spatial overlap of high species richness of each group with agency-developed guidance used to inform facility-siting decisions and found that GAP-based richness mappings augmented existing guidance. As the GAP vertebrate habitat models are publicly available for the entire USA, use of these data can provide a coarse view of potential wildlife-facility conflicts and inform facility planning early in the process.","[Thomas, Kathryn A.; Jarchow, Christopher J.; Jamwal, Pankaj; Borens, Amanda] US Geol Survey, Southwest Biol Sci Ctr, N Pk St,Suite 221, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA; [Arundel, Terence R.; Drost, Charles A.] US Geol Survey, Southwest Biol Sci Ctr, 2255N Gemini Dr, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA; [Jamwal, Pankaj] Pima Cty, Informat Technol Dept, 33 N Stone Ave, Tucson, AZ 85701 USA",United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey,"Thomas, KA (通讯作者)，US Geol Survey, Southwest Biol Sci Ctr, N Pk St,Suite 221, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA.",Kathryn_a_thomas@usgs.gov,,"Borens, Amanda/0000-0002-5695-3463","US Geological Survey Core Science Analytics, Synthesis & Library's National Gap Analysis Program; US Geological Survey Ecosystems Program","US Geological Survey Core Science Analytics, Synthesis & Library's National Gap Analysis Program; US Geological Survey Ecosystems Program(United States Geological Survey)","We thank Dr. Joyce Francis of the Arizona Game and Fish Department for providing the list of terrestrial vertebrate species in Arizona and advising the project on use of the Species and Habitat Conservation Guide.

The desire of decoupling has led us to analyse the driving forces behind the energy consumption changes during this expansion period through a structural decomposition analysis (SDA) based on the Spanish input-output tables. Previous decomposition has been supplemented by a Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) analysis of the energy consumption changes during a longer period: 2000-2013. The results show that the energy intensity was the main inhibitor effect of the energy consumption changes of sectors of production, not only during the recession but also during the expansion period. Secondly, the energy intensity was a driver of the energy consumption change of households during the expansion period. However, during the recession period, the energy intensity of private transport contributed to reducing energy consumption, having an inhibitor effect. Therefore, if the activity effect is still the most important driver, the energy intensity effect has become the main inhibitor of energy consumption changes. The energy policy recommendation is to focus on household energy consumption in the future if the Spanish Government aims to attain the EU energy efficiency objectives.","[Roman-Collado, Rocio] Univ Autonoma Chile, Providencia, Chile; [Roman-Collado, Rocio; Colinet, Maria Jose] Univ Seville, Seville, Spain",Universidad Autonoma de Chile; University of Sevilla,"Román-Collado, R (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Dept Anal Econ & Econ Polit, Ave Ramon & Cajal 1, Seville 41018, Spain.",rroman@us.es,"Román, Rocío/K-1240-2014","Román, Rocío/0000-0001-8636-2093",Andalusian Regional Government [SEJ 132]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2014-56399-R]; Universidad Autonoma de Chile (Chile); Chilean Education Ministry [018/FONDECYT/16],Andalusian Regional Government; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Universidad Autonoma de Chile (Chile); Chilean Education Ministry,"The authors acknowledge the funding received from the SEJ 132 project of the Andalusian Regional Government, the ECO2014-56399-R Project of the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness.

Considering six essential indicators, we developed an MCDM framework to evaluate and rank China-specific sustainability in line with the quantitative performance of four candidate options of fuel cycle transition scenarios from the existing to advanced nuclear energy systems through 2100. Four transition scenarios identified are 1) the direct disposal of PWR (Pressurized Water Reactor) spent fuel, 2) the mono-recycling of PWR spent fuel through PWR-MOX (Mixed Oxides), 3) the PWR-MOX followed by Fast Reactor (FR), and 4) the full recycling of PWR spent fuel using FR. We also further analyzed the roles of the different representatives of decision makers and their impacts on the overall ranking by applying AHP, TOPSIS, and PROMETHEE II methods from a weighting perspective. The results showed that Scenario 1 is the least sustainable and attractive fuel cycle option. Instead, Scenario 4 substantially satisfies the requirements underlying the current definition of nuclear sustainability, while remaining in line with China's closed nuclear fuel cycle policy. This strategic MCDM framework also provides flexibility to cope with the evolution and inherent uncertainties of technological development, which is conducive to identifying the trade-offs of future nuclear energy systems considered at a national level.","[Gao, Ruxing; Nam, Hyo On; Ko, Won Il; Jang, Hong] Korea Atom Energy Res Inst, Dept Nucl Fuel Cycle Technol, 989-111 Daedeok Daero, Taejon 305353, South Korea",Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI),"Nam, HO (通讯作者)，Korea Atom Energy Res Inst, Dept Nucl Fuel Cycle Technol, 989-111 Daedeok Daero, Taejon 305353, South Korea.",hnam@kaeri.re.kr,,,"Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning under the Nuclear Research and Development project [NRF-2017M2A8A5015072]","Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning under the Nuclear Research and Development project","This work was supported by the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning under the Nuclear Research and Development project (NRF-2017M2A8A5015072).",,54,19,19,1,37,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAR,2018,114.0,,,,,,221,233,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.12.009,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FW0DY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000424962800022,0

Most of the empirical analyses delving into this debate have focused on world countries, whose geographical and institutional conditions differ widely. Subnational analyses considering groups of countries with, in principle, more similar institutional and geographical conditions have been limited and tended to highlight that geography is more important than institutions at subnational level. This paper aims to address whether this is the case by investigating how differences in institutional and first-nature' geographical conditions have affected economic growth in Europe's regions in the period 1995-2009. In the analysis we use a newly developed dataset including regional quality of government indicators and geographical characteristics and employ two-stage least squares (2SLS) and instrumental variables-generalized method of moments (IV-GMM) estimation techniques with a number of regional historical variables as instruments. Our results indicate that at a regional level in Europe institutions rule. Regional institutional conditions - and, particularly, government effectiveness and the fight against corruption - play an important role in shaping regional economic growth prospects. This does not imply, however, that geography is irrelevant. There is evidence of geographical factors affecting regional growth, although their impact is dwarfed by the overriding influence of institutions.","[Ketterer, Tobias D.] European Commiss, DG Econ & Financial Affairs, Rue Loi 170B, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium; [Rodriguez-Pose, Andres] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Ketterer, TD (通讯作者)，European Commiss, DG Econ & Financial Affairs, Rue Loi 170B, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium.",Tobias.KETTERER@ec.europa.eu; a.rodriguez-pose@lse.ac.uk,"Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/B-8746-2008","Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/0000-0002-8041-0856",European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme/ERC [269868],European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme/ERC(European Research Council (ERC)),"The authors are grateful to Roberta Capello, the editor in charge, and to the anonymous referees for their stimulating suggestions to the earlier versions of this paper.

This understanding, combined with a focus on energy services (e.g. lighting, heating, telecommunications, mobility, etc.) helps to prioritize actions to achieve the goal of energy security. This paper conceptualizes energy security as low vulnerability of vital energy systems and sustained provision of modern energy services. Taking Tajikistan as a case, this paper highlights key vulnerabilities including neglect of environmental conditions, insufficient energy production capacity, unreliable and expensive energy imports, dwindling power infrastructure causing technical and economic losses, inadequate transparency in the power sector, lack of regional cooperation in energy and water resources sharing, and inadequate financial resources to address these challenges. Three major proposals presented by the World Bank, the United Nations Development Program, and the Government of Tajikistan to achieve energy security in Tajikistan are evaluated. Specifically, they lack a focus on energy services and therefore overlook people's socio-cultural context and appropriate energy needs.

This paper demonstrates the importance of socioeconomic, contextual, and local policy conditions in shaping the spatially heterogeneous response to a national policy. Through an assessment of the geographical and temporal variation in domestic energy-efficiency assessments provided under the United Kingdom's Green Deal, the factors underpinning the spatial diffusion of this policy are identified. Spatial regression models show that the presence of young families, university educated residents, detached homes, and large households positively affects the uptake of energy-efficiency assessments whereas property market activity, personal incomes, the presence of self-employed residents, and the efficiency levels of the existing housing stock has a dampening effect. National incentives for policy implementation that are distributed through selected local authorities also work to promote the uptake of energy-efficiency assessments. Overall, the analysis clearly shows the importance of local factors in determining how national policies are implemented on the ground. This has important implications for policymakers in designing and administering national policy frameworks, in trading-off targeted implementation with fairness and uniformity, and in evaluating the local effectiveness of national policies.","[Morton, Craig] Loughborough Univ Technol, Sch Architecture Bldg & Civil Engn, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England; [Wilson, Charlie] Univ East Anglia, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Anable, Jillian] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",Loughborough University; University of East Anglia; University of Leeds,"Morton, C (通讯作者)，Loughborough Univ Technol, Sch Architecture Bldg & Civil Engn, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",c.morton@live.co.uk; charlie.wilson@uea.ac.uk; j.l.anable@leeds.ac.uk,"Wilson, Charlie/D-4127-2011","Morton, Craig/0000-0003-0984-9580; Wilson, Charlie/0000-0001-8164-3566; Anable, Jillian/0000-0002-4259-1641",ClimateXChange centre; Engineering and Phyriscal Research Council [EPSRC EP/L024756/1]; European Research Council [678799]; EPSRC [EP/L024756/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ClimateXChange centre; Engineering and Phyriscal Research Council; European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"The research reported in this paper was supported by the ClimateXChange centre, by the Engineering and Phyriscal Research Council Grant EPSRC EP/L024756/1 and by the European Research Council Starting Grant #678799.

Yet, over a billion people continue to lack access, and financing electrification efforts poses a formidable challenge to resource-constrained governments. Resultingly, growing bodies of work focus on measuring consumer willingness to pay, viability of cost effective non-grid alternatives, and ways of reducing theft. We argue that these studies largely overlook a crucial policy issue - government capacity or willingness to collect revenues. We work with the public energy utility in Bihar, India, to evaluate levels of revenue collection among formally connected energy consumers. We run a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of offering an incentive to local contractors to collect revenues in rural Bihar. The program made significant improvements among small, hard to reach consumers billed on minimum monthly charges. While these improvements are significant, the level of nonpayment at endline remains unsustainably high. Appropriate incentives can increase the proportion of paying consumers, but additional programs, including incentives for meter reading, are needed to further reduce insolvency. We conclude that it is crucial to examine government capacity and willingness to collect revenues when analyzing financial sustainability of energy systems in the Global South.","[Rains, Emily] Duke Univ, 201 Sci Dr, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Abraham, Ronald J.] IDinsight India Off, 24-1,3rd Floor,Hauz Khas Village, New Delhi 110016, India",Duke University,"Rains, E (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, 201 Sci Dr, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",emily.rains@duke.edu; ronald.abraham@idinsight.org,,,Bihar State Power Holding Company Ltd.,Bihar State Power Holding Company Ltd.,"This work was supported by Bihar State Power Holding Company Ltd.

Using questionnaire method, this paper studies the residents' acceptance of and preferences for 24 energy-saving measures in Beijing, China. Conjoint and variance analysis are used to examine preferences for attribute levels of energy-saving measures and the heterogeneity in preferences, respectively. The results show that energy-saving measures are relatively highly acceptable overall, while technical energy-saving measures are almost the least acceptable. The energy-saving domain (home versus transport) is the most important attribute that determines the acceptance level. Home and behavioral energy-saving measures are preferred to transport and technical energy-saving measures, respectively. For households living within the fourth Ring Road in Beijing and for people with high environmental concern, their average acceptance levels of energy saving measures are 65% and 80% higher than those of their counterparts, respectively. Home energy-saving measures are more favored by households without elders over 60 years old, individuals with low educational level, and residents with low environmental concern, compared with their counterparts. Currently, effective policy tools targeting at behavioral energy conservation are scarce. Publicity about energy-saving measures contributes to improving residents' familiarity with these measures and environmental concern.

In this context, most of the studies related to fuel poverty are based on a diagnosis of existing conditions, but there is a lack of information focusing on how to predict the risk of fuel poverty in future dwellings considering a context of climate change. This research develops an index to assist policymakers in the decision-making process during the early stages of social housing allocation. The analysis is based on the applicability of adaptive comfort, the influence of climate change, the urban context and the building features. Energy use patterns and the ability to pay utility bills have been also considered for social housing in the Central South of Chile. After that, several future scenarios are discussed considering the probable income and energy inflation rates. The potential risk variables that influence the early stages of design are also discussed. The results reveal that the Fuel Poverty Potential Risk Index is an effective tool to select appropriate housing for the most disadvantaged and vulnerable segments of society, considering the future climate, income and energy price trends.","[Perez-Fargallo, Alexis; Pulido-Arcas, JestIs A.] Univ Bio Bio, Dept Bldg Sci, Fac Architecture Construct & Design, Avd Collao 1202, Concepcion 4051381, Chile; [Rubio-Bellido, Carlos; Guevara-Garcia, Fco.

In particular, we analyze a zonal pricing model that comprises consumers, producers, and storage facilities on a network with constrained transmission capacities. In its two limit cases, our zonal pricing model includes the reference nodal pricing model as well as the uniform pricing model with storage. To the best of our knowledge we are the first to analyze zonal pricing in the presence of storage. As our numerical results show, storage facilities do not only reduce the inter-temporal price volatility of a market, but may considerably change the inter-regional price structure. In particular, the inter-regional price volatility may increase in the presence of storage, which may imply a complete reconfiguration of optimal zonal boundaries as compared to the no-storage case. However, market participants may have an incentive to keep or implement a sub-optimal zonal design. Thus, storage facilities will in general challenge optimal congestion management with common heuristic approaches to configure optimal price zones (e.g., the use of congested transmission lines of a nodal pricing system) not always suggesting optimal zonal configurations. Therefore, we propose a model extension that allows policy makers to determine welfare maximizing zonal configurations, which account for the complex inter-regional price effects of storage facilities. Especially with regard to increasing storage investments, such a model may help to (at least partially) handle the described inefficiency problems regarding sub-optimal zonal designs that may challenge European or Australian zonal electricity markets in the near future.","[Weibelzahl, Martin] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Discrete Optimizat & Adv Analyt, Pontdriesch 10-12, D-52062 Aachen, Germany; [Maertz, Alexandra] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nuremberg, Dept Math, Cauerstr 11, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany",RWTH Aachen University; University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Weibelzahl, M (通讯作者)，Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Discrete Optimizat & Adv Analyt, Pontdriesch 10-12, D-52062 Aachen, Germany.",weibelzahl@math2.rwth-aachen.de; alexandra.maertz@fau.de,,"Weibelzahl, Martin/0000-0002-3145-6903",,,,,52,24,25,2,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2018,113.0,,,,,,778,794,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.11.018,0.0,,,17,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FT2XO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000423009500072,0

The combination weights are latent random variables that depend on past nowcasting performance and other learning mechanisms. The combined density scheme is incorporated in a Bayesian sequential Monte Carlo method which rebalances the set of nowcasted densities in each period using updated information on the time-varying weights. Experiments with simulated data show that CDN works particularly well in a situation of early data releases with relatively large data uncertainty and model incompleteness. Empirical results, based on U.S. real-time data of 120 monthly variables, indicate that CDN gives more accurate density nowcasts of U.S. GDP growth than a model selection strategy and other combination strategies throughout the quarter with relatively large gains for the two first months of the quarter. CDN also provides informative signals on model incompleteness during recent recessions. Focusing on the tails, CDN delivers probabilities of negative growth, that provide good signals for calling recessions and ending economic slumps in real time.","[Aastveit, Knut Are] Norges Bank, Oslo, Norway; [Ravazzolo, Francesco] Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Fac Econ & Management, Bozen Bolzano, Italy; [van Dijk, Herman K.] Erasmus Univ, Inst Econometr, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [van Dijk, Herman K.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Econometr Dept, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van Dijk, Herman K.] Tinbergen Inst, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Norges Bank; Free University of Bozen-Bolzano; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute,"Aastveit, KA (通讯作者)，Norges Bank, Oslo, Norway.",Knut-Are.Aastveit@norges-bank.no; Francesco.Ravazzolo@norges-bank.no; hkvandijk@ese.eur.nl,"; Ravazzolo, Francesco/G-1118-2016","van Dijk, Herman/0000-0003-3240-1020; Ravazzolo, Francesco/0000-0003-0645-1788",,,,,64,23,23,0,12,AMER STATISTICAL ASSOC,ALEXANDRIA,"732 N WASHINGTON ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-1943 USA",0735-0015,1537-2707,,J BUS ECON STAT,J.

The local linear method with the cross-validation (CV) bandwidth selection is applied to estimate the time-varying coefficient HAR (TVC-HAR) model, and a bootstrap method is used to construct the point-wise confidence bands for the coefficient functions. Furthermore, the asymptotic distribution of the proposed local linear estimators of the TVC-HAR model is established under some mild conditions. The results of the simulation study show that the local linear estimator with CV bandwidth selection has favorable finite sample properties. The outcomes of the conditional predictive ability test indicate that the proposed nonparametric TVC-HAR model outperforms the parametric HAR and its extension to HAR with jumps and/or GARCH in terms of multi-step out-of-sample forecasting, in particular in the post-2003 crisis and 2007 global financial crisis (GFC) periods, during which financial market volatilities were unduly high.","[Chen, Xiangjin B.; Gao, Jiti; Silvapulle, Param] Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia; [Li, Degui] Univ York, Dept Math, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",Monash University; University of York - UK,"Chen, XJB (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia.",bruce.chen@buseco.monash.edu.au; jiti.Gao@monash.edu; degui.li@york.ac.uk; param.silvapulle@monash.edu,,"Gao, Jiti/0000-0002-4261-0021; Li, Degui/0000-0001-6802-308X","Australian Research Council Discovery Grants Program [DP1314229, DP150101012]",Australian Research Council Discovery Grants Program(Australian Research Council),"The authors are grateful to the co-editor-professor Rong Chen, an associate editor, and two referees for their helpful comments that greatly improved the original version of the article.

The aim of the article is to describe the change in work relationships in Slovak companies and to identify the influence of globalization on this phenomenon. The employees enter in each company into a complicated system of positive and negative, formal and informal work relationships. Formal relationships are governed by the various rules and regulations that apply within a given group, company, nation or worldwide. Informal relationships are the result of mutual contacts and their formation is conditioned by social interests and ideals. Work relationships are influenced by an amount of internal as well as global factors. Internal factors lead to changes in areas such as the characteristics of employees and managers, the style of work, work satisfaction, the communication or the solution of the conflicts.

On the base of analysing and comparing of the surveys realized in the year 2012 and in the year 2018, the difference in the level of work relationships will be detected.

Literary research deals with lending in the credit market not only in the Czech Republic but also abroad. The article includes selected data on credit conditions and developments that enable users to get valuable information about developments in the credit market. The results in the main section show that the highest amount of loans has been drawn for a long period since 2009. By then, it was most borrowed for short-term loans. The least was borrowed for medium-term loans. The total amount of loans has a growing trend. As for the use of foreign resources, they also have a growing trend. At the same time, the amount of money lent abroad is increasing. As of January 1, 2018, the total funding from abroad was around 30%. Globalization also has a significant impact on sister companies of international corporations where individual transactions may be distorted by tax optimization efforts. Even the growing number of international corporations may affect the amount of foreign currency loans. Data for the main part was drawn mainly from the Czech National Bank.

The analysis of export disparity/dispersion confirmed the increased globalization levels for the EU-28 as well as for Poland and Czechia.

The European Union supports innovation, competitiveness and the opportunity for new working conditions created by the sharing economy. In the more developed countries, there are many platforms of the sharing economy. This phenomenon is only at the beginning in Slovakia. The identified research problem was to determine the interest in shared services and their use regarding the population of the Slovak Republic. To achieve the aim of the paper, primary research was conducted. The research was aimed to find the interest in the use of shared services in the Slovak Republic. The questionnaire was answered by residents from all regions of the Slovak Republic. Although, the Slovak Republic is a small country, it has the potential of further development of sharing economy services and thus to help people.

An analysis of two cases of collaborations between headquarters and subsidiaries of multinational companies highlights that specific power constellations indeed influence the effects of proximity. While some forms of proximity allow subsidiary-specific capabilities to diffuse throughout the organization and pose a threat to the powerful subsidiary, the weaker subsidiary considers proximity as a possibility to learn from the headquarters.","[Hansen, Teis] Lund Univ, Dept Human Geog, Lund, Sweden; [Hansen, Teis] Lund Univ, CIRCLE, Lund, Sweden; [Hansen, Teis] Nord Inst Studies Innovat Res & Educ NIFU, Oslo, Norway; [Mattes, Jannika] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Social Sci, Oldenburg, Germany",Lund University; Lund University; Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Hansen, T (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Human Geog, Lund, Sweden.;Hansen, T (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, CIRCLE, Lund, Sweden.;Hansen, T (通讯作者)，Nord Inst Studies Innovat Res & Educ NIFU, Oslo, Norway.",teis.hansen@keg.lu.se; jannika.mattes@uni-oldenburg.de,"Hansen, Teis/E-8032-2011","Hansen, Teis/0000-0001-9383-3471; Mattes, Jannika/0000-0003-0269-9540",Swedish Research Council [349200680]; Vinnova - the Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems [2010-07370]; German Research Foundation in the project 'Product Development in Multinational Companies',Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); Vinnova - the Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems(Vinnova); German Research Foundation in the project 'Product Development in Multinational Companies',This work was supported by the Swedish Research Council [grant number 349200680]; and Vinnova - the Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems [grant number 2010-07370].

The impact of globalization puts increasing emphasis on security, protection of human life and health, the environment. In today's globalized world, the society is aware of these risks and tries to develop progressive tools to address them in a comprehensive unity. Introducing socially responsible business into the economic sectors contributes to ensuring the environmental, economic and social sustainability of economic growth and contributes to maintaining the competitiveness of society on the global market. In the case of enterprises whose business focus is risky from the point of view of the threat of the population, it provides instructions for managing extraordinary situations by implementing the principles of crisis management. The objective of the paper is to point out the possibility of using crisis management in the concept of socially responsible business and characterize the risk assessment algorithm, which creates a framework for risk assessment to enterprises that may be a significant source of threat to the population in the event of a special occurrence due to their location near residential areas.

As theoretical considerations suggest, industrial clusters understood as concentration of specific kinds of industry in particular locations generate some positive externalities. The companies belonging to those industries may benefit from the fact that they are spatially concentrated. Globalisation creates conditions, under which those externalities may be especially important. To determine the existence of such externalities, the data on industrial value added per working person, GDP per capita and GDP growth was used as indicators of the condition of economy in particular area (NUTS 3 level). Then it was confronted with the results of own research on industrial clusters to determine whether the latter may be a source of competitive advantage of the area. The existing studies dealing with industrial clusters mainly use case study method or quantitative approach based on one particular cluster. In this paper, a more general approach is used and it tries to identify the influence of clusters on economies on a broader level. The results show, that on one hand, no connection between cluster creating and value added was revealed, on the other hand, the connection with both GDP per capita and GDP growth was shown.","[Kwasny, Jakub; Mroczek, Arkadiusz; Ulbrych, Marta] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Int Econ Relat, Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Kwasny, J (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Int Econ Relat, Krakow, Poland.",kwasnyj@uek.krakow.pl; mroczeka@uek.krakow.pl; ulbrychm@uek.krakow.pl,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1187,1195,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300153,0

Work precarious migrants in such places are likely to inhabit the urban outskirts that still preserve some availability to job chances. Third sector entities are frequently instrumental in backing work precarious migrants, i.e. individuals who generally fail to be within the established government policy social protection guarantees of professional security as a result of fluctuating legal statuses or ones that impede their admittance to safety nets applicable for immigrants who comply with duration of stay limits. The spatial relationship between the companies and precarious work migrants may considerably deteriorate further. Locational routines and resolutions by third sector entities are determined by characteristics incompatible with the location of contingent migrants and domestic precarious citizens, if the particularized regions point toward precarious work migrants.","[Lazaroiu, George] Spiru Haret Univ, Fac Sociohuman Sci, Ion Ghica St 13, Bucharest 030045, Romania; [Ionescu, Luminita] Spiru Haret Univ, Fac Econ Sci, Ion Ghica St 13, Bucharest 030045, Romania; [Meila, Alexandra Dana] Ion Mincu Univ Architecture & Urbanism, Fac Urban Planning, Acad St 18-20, Bucharest 010014, Romania; [Curteanu, Adrian Bogdan; Bogdan, Alexandru] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Theoret & Appl Econ, Piata Romana 6, Bucharest 010374, Romania",Spiru Haret University; Spiru Haret University; Ion Mincu University of Architecture & Urbanism; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Lazaroiu, G (通讯作者)，Spiru Haret Univ, Fac Sociohuman Sci, Ion Ghica St 13, Bucharest 030045, Romania.",phd_lazaroiu@yahoo.com; lionescu.mfc@spiruharet.ro; m_alexandra11@yahoo.com; adrian.bogdan.curteanu@gmail.com; alexandru.bogdan@gmail.com,"Lazaroiu, George/A-2262-2015",,,,,,25,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,251,256,,,,,,6,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300033,0

China has witnessed the orchestration of city-regionalism and two different regional-scale mechanisms have influenced this integration and cooperation: the top-down state-mandated process and the bottom-up process initiated by local governments. However, this has not been a smooth process and it is shaped by the internal politics generated by China's state configurations. Using the Yangtze River Delta as a case study, this paper argues that China's territorial administrative divisions are a historical configuration that is essential to understand the efforts to construct city-regions as well as to understand the failure to create a new sub-national state space.","[Li, Yi] Hohai Univ, Sch Publ Adm, Natl Res Ctr Resettlement, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wu, Fulong] UCL, Bartlett Sch Planning, London, England",Hohai University; University of London; University College London,"Li, Y (通讯作者)，Hohai Univ, Sch Publ Adm, Natl Res Ctr Resettlement, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",emilyliyi@hotmail.com; fulong.wu@ucl.ac.uk,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [41601157],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The first author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and publication of this article.

This paper reviews methodologies and data sources to determine the main sources of uncertainty in the estimation of the costs of wind, coal and natural gas generation, based on illustrative cost calculations for the US, Denmark and India. It finds that the cost elements most likely to confound generation cost calculations are fuel costs and, particularly for renewable generation, the cost of capital.

The text is based on qualitative research carried out in the form of partially structured interviews. This choice of method was a consequence of the aim and object of the study. Learning about organizational games requires very close, sometimes even informal, contact with respondents. It would be very difficult to achieve this by using quantitative methods, which, by definition, narrow the scope of research. Organizational games are a common, although difficult to identify, phenomenon. An organisational game may be initiated for different reasons, and the game itself may have various consequences. Globalization and uncertainty additionally accelerate the creation of games. The article briefly presents the concept and influence of organizational games on the functioning of an organization. The research allowed to identify the most important preconditions for the emergence of organizational games, as well as selected factors and mechanisms that make the games dysfunctional. The study identified some dysfunctional organizational games such as: scapegoating, making a good impression, the illusion of taking charge, forming coalitions, cost shifting, and more. The most important reasons for initiating the games were, among others: seeking formal power or informal influence, the desire to influence change, the improvement of material status, avoiding duty, and defense of one's own position.","[Pasieczny, Jacek] Univ Warsaw, Fac Management, Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Pasieczny, J (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Management, Warsaw, Poland.",pasiecznyjacek@gmail.com,,,,,,,24,0,0,2,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,2291,2297,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300293,0

According to corporate managers, increasing environment performance will lead to a decrease in competitivity on global scale in line with extra costs that do not generate on the spot financial benefits.

Attention to the crisis management is presented as a necessary condition for increasing the competitiveness of enterprises under conditions of globalization. The authors prove that it is possible to be affected by the risks of the crisis with any, even successful, management of the enterprise. Therefore, the need for anti-crisis management is conditioned by the need for both efficiently operating enterprises in order to prevent a crisis, and in enterprises, that are in a crisis situation, in order to overcome the crisis. The reasons for the increased requirements for the enterprise management under conditions of crisis globalization are the following: the aggravation of global market place competition in goods, the need to take into account the uncertainty factor of the external environment, the need for flexibility in managing production, the complexity of innovative technologies. The need of effective means under conditions of the global crisis is stated in order to forecast, prevent business failures and mitigate the negative consequences of globalization crises in enterprises that are in a difficult financial situation. The peculiarities of the personnel policy in the conditions of the turbulence of the global crisis and uncompromising competition are proposed.

Nevertheless, not only in stable countries such as the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, but in every globalized world today, it is very desirable, not for the profit from the investment but for the low investment risk. In a number of models (e.g., CAPM), even the ten-year government bond interest rate is considered a risk-free constant of these models. Of course, even with these bonds the investment risk is associated, albeit minimal. The price of these bonds depends mainly on the supply (i.e. the need of the state to cover the general government deficit) and demand for bonds. Bonds are in demand by both households and businesses. However, it is questionable whether the price offered by the state is really determined by its need, or whether the relationship between the interest rate of ten-year government bonds and selected macroeconomic indicators (indicating a higher or lower external financing requirement) can be observed. The aim of the paper is to examine the relationship between interest rates of ten-year government bonds and selected macroeconomic indicators. In order to meet the objective of this contribution, the following will be used: gross domestic product, inflation and unemployment. Regression using artificial neural networks was used as the basic method. Two types of networks were used - multilayer perceptron and radial basic function using fuzzy logic.","[Vrbka, Jaromir; Vochozka, Marek] Inst Technol & Business Ceske Budejovice, Okruzni 517-10, Ceske Budejovice 37001, Czech Republic","Institute of Technology & Business, Ceske Budejovice","Vochozka, M (通讯作者)，Inst Technol & Business Ceske Budejovice, Okruzni 517-10, Ceske Budejovice 37001, Czech Republic.",vrbka@mail.vstecb.cz; vochozkam@email.cz,"Vrbka, Jaromir/AAH-4429-2019; Vochozka, Marek/L-3154-2019","Vochozka, Marek/0000-0001-9923-7814",,,,,18,1,1,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1935,1942,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300247,0

The results show that political boundaries and historical patterns of socio-economic integration are strikingly visible, and the effects of overlapping physical, economic, cultural and administrative spaces on regional integration are apparent. The authors conclude that both notions of 'territory' and 'network' come together as the YRD region is spatially configured, while 'regional path dependence' also seems to be relevant for understanding its relational formation.","[Zhang, Weiyang; Derudder, Ben] Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, Ghent, Belgium; [Wang, Jianghao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Shen, Wei] Univ Lancaster, Confucius Inst, Lancaster, England; [Shen, Wei] ESSCA Sch Management, EU Asia Inst, Angers, France","Ghent University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Lancaster University; ESSCA School of Management","Wang, JH (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing, Peoples R China.",weiyang.zhang@ugent.be; ben.derudder@ugent.be; wangjh@lreis.ac.cn; wei.shen@lancaster.ac.uk,"Zhang, weiyang/GZL-5011-2022; Wang, Jianghao/J-1403-2016; Derudder, Ben/ABH-5648-2020; Derudder, Ben/A-1616-2008","Wang, Jianghao/0000-0001-5333-3827; Derudder, Ben/0000-0001-6195-8544; zhang, weiyang/0000-0002-8002-3207","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41421001]; Key Research Program of Frontier Science, CAS [QYZDY-SSW-DQC007]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Research Program of Frontier Science, CAS","Jianghao Wang acknowledges financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 41421001] and the Key Research Program of Frontier Science, CAS [grant number QYZDY-SSW-DQC007].",,53,44,57,12,74,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

We estimate that the return from an extra year of schooling is about 7-8% for women and an imprecisely estimated 2-2.5% for men. The low level of the estimates for men contrasts starkly with those estimated for other developing countries. We identify several reasons why returns to schooling are low for men and why they are higher for women in our context. In particular, the policy alters the schooling distributions of men and women differently, thus the average causal effect puts a higher weight on the causal effect of schooling at higher grade levels for women than for men.","[Aydemir, Abdurrahman] Sabanci Univ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, TR-34956 Orhanli, Tuzla, Turkey; [Kirdar, Murat G.] Bogazici Univ, Dept Econ, TR-34342 Istanbul, Turkey",Sabanci University; Bogazici University,"Aydemir, A (通讯作者)，Sabanci Univ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, TR-34956 Orhanli, Tuzla, Turkey.",aaydemir@sabanciuniv.edu; murat.kirdar@boun.edu.tr,"Kirdar, Murat Guray/AAJ-3132-2021; Aydemir, Abdurrahman/AAY-1925-2020",,,,,,42,21,23,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

The identification of the structural parameters is obtained by exploiting the heteroskedasticity in the data naturally arising during crisis periods. More precisely, we provide identification conditions when heteroskedasticity and traditional restrictions on the parameters are jointly considered. Although the framework is general enough to find potential applications in many empirical economic fields, it proves to be well suited for distinguishing between interdependence and contagion in the literature related to the transmission of financial crises.

An agent-based model is used for this analysis. Capacity markets can compensate for the deteriorating incentive to invest in controllable power plants when the share of variable renewable energy sources grows, but may create volatile prices themselves. Capacity markets with long-term contracts have been developed, e.g. in the UK, to stabilize capacity prices. In our analysis, a FCM is effective in providing the required adequacy level and leads to lower cost to consumers and more stable capacity prices, as compared to a yearly capacity market. In case of a demand shock, a FCM may develop an investment cycle, but it still maintains security of supply. Its main effect on the power plant portfolio is more investment in peak plant.","[Bhagwat, Pradyumna C.; Marcheselli, Anna; Richstein, Joern C.; Chappin, Emile J.

In some cases, the programmes include the objective of electricity generated from 100% renewable energy by 2020 or 2025. The motivations for these ambitious programmes are commendable: to reduce dependency on imported oil fuels and to be seen to contribute towards reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The paper reviews renewable electricity generation policy and programmes in four PICs - Cook Islands, Niue, Tonga and Tuvalu - and implementation of the programmes to date. To illustrate the broader relevance of the issue, these programmes are compared with those of Maldives and Seychelles. Concerns identified include the ambitious goals and almost total reliance on solar photo-voltaic (PV) technology to supply electricity in small and remote islands. Our central argument is that dependency on oil imports will be replaced with dependency on technical support given the complex nature of PV technology compared with diesel particularly where high PV fractions are proposed. The lack of interest in biofuel, particularly coconut oil, is seen as a missed opportunity to use an endogenous energy resource that could form a useful part of the renewable energy mix.","[Cole, Peter] Cole & Dias Ltd, 6 Tawa St, Wellington 5013, New Zealand; [Banks, Glenn] Massey Univ, Sch People Environm & Planning, Private Bag 11 222, Palmerston North 4442, New Zealand",Massey University,"Cole, P (通讯作者)，Cole & Dias Ltd, 6 Tawa St, Wellington 5013, New Zealand.",peter@coledias.co.nz; g.a.banks@massey.ac.nz,"Banks, Glenn/GQP-3201-2022","Banks, Glenn/0000-0002-0540-8529",,,,,79,13,14,1,20,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2017,110.0,,,,,,500,508,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.08.048,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FP5LK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417660800049,0

This paper aims to take stock of the evolution of the structure of the biodiesel industry in this country under the implementation of the PNPB -between 2005 and 2016- and to understand its current traits. The research combines a dynamic analysis of the industrial concentration indexes (closing the time gap with previous studies on this matter) and a multivariate analysis of the productive characteristics of the biodiesel plants operating in 2016. Results show that, following a period of de-concentration between 2005 and 2011, the industry entered in a stage of certain stability in the concentration indexes. This picture disguises the exit of biodiesel plants and firms from this market and a business horizontal growth in the last period.

By scrutinising panel data of China's 30 provinces from 2000 to 2013, this article first uses fixed effects and feasible generalised least squares to investigate the effects of these technological factors on energy intensity by taking both economic structure and energy price as control variables. The results show that indigenous R&D plays a crucial and dominant role in the declining energy intensity among the four technological factors. In addition, technology spillovers coming from the openness of foreign direct investment and import decrease energy intensity except for the export. However, further estimation with the panel threshold model confirms that the effects of technology spillovers on energy intensity depend on the levels of local inputs of R&D expenditure intensity and the full-time equivalent of R&D personnel, allowing us to formulate different policies and measures aimed at encouraging more efficient use of energy that takes into full consideration the characteristics and situations of the technology spillovers.","[Huang, Junbing; Du, Dan] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Du, Dan] Chongqing Youth Vocat & Tech Coll, Dept Mech & Elect Engn, Chongqing 400712, Peoples R China; [Tao, Qizhi] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Huang, JB (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",20701432@bit.edu.cn,"Tao, Qizhi/GXF-0964-2022",,,,,,52,130,134,6,86,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,1,9,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.06.048,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,,Y,N,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400001,0

This paper aims to assess how Brazilian RTQ-C could learn from the European Union (EU)'s experience of implementing the Directive 2010/ 31/EU. The implementation of the RTQ-C in Brazil has been examined and compared with the EU's Directive. Technical, economic and social issues as well as barriers and challenges behind the initial stage of the Directive 2010/31/EU implementation were examined. The difficulties and weaknesses of the calculation methodology, scope and labelling of the Brazilian RTQ-C regulations, and potential areas that require further research have been identified and summarised. In order to increase the impact of RTQ-C regulations, improvements to the existing calculation methodology and tools, provision of numerous supporting measures, such as an increase in training, education, public awareness and incentives, and enforcement through building regulations or standards are essential. The valuable experience from the EU's implementation of the Directive could be used to guide the development of energy policies and certification regulations in Brazil.","[Wong, Ing Liang] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Sch Engn & Built Environm, 70 Cowcaddens Rd, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland; [Kruger, Eduardo] Univ Tecnol Fed Parana UTFPR, Dept Construcao Civil, Campus Curitiba Sede Ecoville, BR-81280340 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil",Glasgow Caledonian University; Universidade Tecnologica Federal do Parana,"Krüger, E (通讯作者)，Univ Tecnol Fed Parana UTFPR, Dept Construcao Civil, Campus Curitiba Sede Ecoville, BR-81280340 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.",IngLiang.Wong@gcu.ac.uk; ekruger@utfpr.edu.br,"Kruger, Eduardo/AAY-7243-2020; Kruger, Eduardo/K-6644-2012","Kruger, Eduardo/0000-0003-2895-5530; Wong, Ing Liang/0000-0002-7850-8029","Conselho Nacional das Fundagoes Estaduais de Amparo a Pesquisa (CONFAP), Brazil; UK Academies under Newton Fund (CONFAP-UK Academies Call)","Conselho Nacional das Fundagoes Estaduais de Amparo a Pesquisa (CONFAP), Brazil; UK Academies under Newton Fund (CONFAP-UK Academies Call)","This work was supported by Conselho Nacional das Fundagoes Estaduais de Amparo a Pesquisa (CONFAP), Brazil in partnership with the UK Academies under Newton Fund (CONFAP-UK Academies Call 2015).

In spite of this, the process of electrification was not interrupted and at the beginning of the 2010s decade most countries in the region were able to provide access to electricity to almost all of their populations.

However, the reported reductions are strongly dependent on contextual factors and on the type of feedback provided. Given the importance of learning to this respect, this dimension constitutes the core focus of the present study which reports the findings of the TICELEC (i.e. French acronym for information technologies for responsible electricity consumption) project in France. The experiment included a control group (G1: the self-monitoring group) and one equipped group (G2). All participants reduced their consumption and learnt either directly from feedback or indirectly through self-monitoring. The amount of energy savings, which is larger than in similar experiments, can be explained by two factors. First, the specificity of our sample (i.e. high income, high consumption) which allows for potentially large energy savings. Second, high involvement of participants and the building of trust. The quantitative and qualitative dimensions of learning are then discussed. Additionally, we focus on peak-load shifting in G2 with 2 subgroups (G21 and G22). The higher proportion of shifters in G22 and the higher 'quality' of their shifting suggest a higher level of learning enabled by the more sophisticated feedback. Although this translated into only a moderately higher rate of energy savings, the higher degree of absorbed knowledge (i.e. through 'learning by looking through connecting') might lead to a qualitatively distinctive type of energy saving.","[Kendel, Adnane; Lazaric, Nathalie] Univ Cote dAzur, CNRS, GREDEG, Nice, France; [Marechal, Kevin] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Univ Europe, Ctr Econ & Social Studies Environm, Brussels, Belgium; [Marechal, Kevin] Univ Liege, Gembloux AgroBioTech, Liege, Belgium",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Cote d'Azur; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; University of Liege,"Lazaric, N (通讯作者)，Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, CNRS, GREDEG, UMR 7321, 250 Rue A Einstein Sophia Antipolis, F-06560 Valbonne, France.",lazaric@gredeg.cnrs.fr,,,REGION PACA programme Agir ensemble pour l'energie [114000397-]; Conseil General des Alpes Maritimes [CG 06]; ADEME Marseille [19364 -22937],REGION PACA programme Agir ensemble pour l'energie; Conseil General des Alpes Maritimes(Region Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur); ADEME Marseille,"The research was financially supported by the REGION PACA programme Agir ensemble pour l'energie- grant no 114000397-, the Conseil General des Alpes Maritimes (CG 06) and the ADEME Marseille- grant no 19364 -22937.

By applying an explicitly spatial lens to conceptualize energy poverty as a form of injustice, it contributes to debates in the domain of 'energy justice', where previous examinations of energy deprivation through a justice framing have focused on inequalities between social groups and often marginalized questions of spatial difference. We start from the premise that geographic disparities in the risk and incidence of domestic energy deprivation are a key component of energy justice. An extensive literature review has allowed us to highlight the spatial and temporal variation of cross-sectoral and entire-energy-chain injustices that lead to elevated energy poverty risks. These processes contribute to the rise of energy injustices via four mechanisms which we term landscapes of material deprivation, geographic underpinnings of energy affordability, vicious cycles of vulnerability, and spaces of misrecognition operating at a multiplicity of scales. While lending some support to area-based approaches towards energy poverty alleviation, our findings also suggest that such policies alone may marginalize the underlying structural dynamics that (re)produce spatial inequalities. Therefore, achieving energy justice necessitates broader interventions in the fundamental driving forces of spatial inequality.","[Bouzarovski, Stefan; Simcock, Neil] Univ Manchester, Dept Geog, Arthur Lewis Bldg, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Bouzarovski, S (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Dept Geog, Arthur Lewis Bldg, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",stefan.bouzarovski@manchester.ac.uk; neil.simcock@manchester.ac.uk,,"Simcock, Neil/0000-0002-1408-962X",European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)/ERC Grant [313478],European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)/ERC Grant(European Research Council (ERC)),"The research leading to this paper has received funding from the European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)/ERC Grant agreement number 313478.

These challenges generally faced by less developing countries, while Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries has no exemption to escape out from this food-water-energy poverty nexus due to inadequate socio-economic and environmental action programs of sustainable development. This study examined the dynamic nexus between agricultural sustain ability and food-energy-water poverty in a panel of selected SSA countries over the period of 1980-2013. The study used pooled least squares regression, pooled fixed effects, and pooled random effects regression techniques to absorb country-specific-time-variant shocks. The Hausman (1978) test results reveal that country-specific shocks influence the food-energy-water poverty model; therefore, the fixed effects regression results are consider a better fit model than that of the pooled random effect model. The overall results conclude that agricultural value added, cereal yields and forest area significantly decreases food-energy-water poverty nexus, leading to higher economic growth and price levels at the cost of environmental degradation. In general, agricultural sustainability is the prerequisite for reducing food-energy-water poverty.","[Ozturk, Ilhan] Cag Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, TR-33800 Mersin, Turkey",Cag University - Turkey,"Ozturk, I (通讯作者)，Cag Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, TR-33800 Mersin, Turkey.",ilhanozturk@cag.edu.tr,"Ozturk, Ilhan/B-9431-2009","Ozturk, Ilhan/0000-0002-6521-0901",,,,,56,98,100,13,114,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2017,107.0,,,,,,289,299,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.04.048,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FA0WU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000405158200027,0

The aim of this research is to provide a reasonable estimate of carbon emissions to help policymakers in each country address their actual share of responsibility. This study employs the World Input-Output Database and the gross export decomposition methodology to recount the CO2 emissions embodied in China's international trade from the perspective of value-added trade. The result shows that reliance on traditional statistics caused a significant overestimation of China's imports and exports: US$ 398.77 billion and US$ 504.46 billion for China's imports and exports, respectively. Our findings suggest that 177.24 million tons of carbon emissions embodied in imports and 907.636 million tons of carbon emission embodied in exports were over calculated. The result obtained with traditional calculation methods has artificially increased the responsibility share of China in the global emissions reduction. We also compare the CO2 emission coefficients of China with those of other countries. Our findings suggest that the high emission coefficients of most Chinese industrial sectors determine the carbon emissions embodied in China's exports to be higher than in its imports.","[Xu, Xueliu; Mu, Mingjie; Wang, Qian] Dalian Univ Technol, Fac Management & Econ, 2nd Linggong Rd, Dalian 116024, Liaoning, Peoples R China",Dalian University of Technology,"Xu, XL (通讯作者)，Dalian Univ Technol, Fac Management & Econ, 2nd Linggong Rd, Dalian 116024, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",xueliuxu@dlut.edu.cn; 1042625819@qq.com; 1213390169@qq.com,,"Wang, Qian/0000-0003-0939-4942","Liaoning S & T Project Foundation [20170540188]; Dalian University of Technology Fundamental Research Fund [DUT16RC (4)40]; Liaoning Province Doctoral Startup Foundation [20141020]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71573031, 71403037]",Liaoning S & T Project Foundation; Dalian University of Technology Fundamental Research Fund; Liaoning Province Doctoral Startup Foundation; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research is sponsored by the Liaoning S & T Project Foundation (20170540188), Dalian University of Technology Fundamental Research Fund (DUT16RC (4)40), the Liaoning Province Doctoral Startup Foundation (20141020), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71573031, 71403037).

Four key low carbon transport polices are selected, including the public transport improvement policy, public bike policy, energy efficiency improvement policy, and electric vehicle development policy. We found that under the combined effects of public transport improvement, public bike development, energy efficiency improvement, and electric vehicle development, the carbon emission in daily travel can be reduced by 43% in Beijing, which amounts to 4.3 million tonnes of CO2 per year. The public transport improvement and public bike development can be realized under the current technology status, and if these two policies are combined, the emission reduction is 24%, which is higher than the energy efficiency improvement scenario. Electric vehicle ownership in 2025 in Beijing will increase to 1.04 million under enhanced scenario, accounting for 18.4% of total vehicles. Compared with baseline scenario, under enhanced scenario not only consumers who want to purchase additional vehicles, but also consumers who want to replace existing vehicles are attracted to buy additional vehicles.","[Yang, Yuan; Wang, Can] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Liu, Wenling] Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Peng] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University; Beijing Institute of Technology; Nanjing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics,"Wang, C (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",canwang@tsinghua.edu.cn,"WANG, CAN/GWV-0969-2022; Zhou, Peng/A-6527-2012","Zhou, Peng/0000-0003-4726-3054","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71273153, 71525007, 71403141]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.71273153, No. 71525007, and No. 71403141) We thank the Tsinghua University students who survey.",,38,18,19,7,64,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2017,107.0,,,,,,561,572,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.05.021,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FA0WU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000405158200055,0

The merit order effect is estimated as the elasticity of electricity spot price with respect to change in supply of electricity from renewable sources. Data for the Czech electricity spot market from 2010 to 2015 are analyzed as this is the period with the steepest increase in a renewable generation capacity. The effect is estimated separately for solar and other renewable sources. We find a significant difference between these two groups. Our results show that based on hourly, daily and weekly data energy produced by Czech solar power plants does not decrease electricity spot price, creating double cost to the end consumer. However, the merit order effect based on averaged daily and weekly data is shown to exist for other renewable sources excluding solar (mainly water and wind). This contributes to the conclusion that the Czech renewables policy that prefers solar to other renewable sources may be considered as suboptimal.","[Lunackova, Petra; Prusa, Jan; Janda, Karel] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Opletalova 26, Prague 11000, Czech Republic; [Janda, Karel] Univ Econ, Dept Banking & Insurance, Fac Finance & Accounting, Namesti Winstona Churchilla 4, Prague 13067, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Lunácková, P (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Opletalova 26, Prague 11000, Czech Republic.",,"janda, karel/GNP-1410-2022; janda, karel/A-3951-2008; Lunackova, Petra/T-7053-2017","janda, karel/0000-0001-7096-6300; Lunackova, Petra/0000-0001-7704-259X","Czech Science Foundation [15-00036S, 16-00027S]; European Union's Horizon Research and Innovation Staff Exchange Programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie [681228]; Australian National University; McGill University",Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); European Union's Horizon Research and Innovation Staff Exchange Programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie; Australian National University(Australian National University); McGill University,The authors acknowledge support from the Czech Science Foundation grants number 15-00036S and 16-00027S.

A time varying parameter (TVP) model with the Kalman filter is applied to monitor the evolution of consumer behaviors in the post-bubble period given the exogenous shock (financial crisis in 2008) and the structural breaks (electricity deregulation and Fukushima Daiichi crisis). The TVP model can provide a robust estimation of elasticities and can detect the outliers and the structural breaks. The results suggest that both industrial and residential consumers become less sensitive to price after the electricity deregulation and the financial crisis, and more sensitive to price after the Fukushima Daiichi crisis. Especially the industrial sector is less sensitive to price after the retail deregulation. By contrast, the income elasticities of industrial and residential sector consumers are stable during the examined period. Results also indicate that a negative relationship exists between the price elasticity of electricity demand and the price level of electricity after the electric sector deregulation. Some insights on the further electric sector reform and the environmental taxation in Japan are also provided.","[Wang, Nan; Mogi, Gento] Univ Tokyo, Sch Engn, Dept Technol Management Innovat, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138656, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Wang, N (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Sch Engn, Dept Technol Management Innovat, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138656, Japan.",wang1nan123@gmail.com; mogi@tmi.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Wang, Nan/HLV-7836-2023",,,,,,51,30,31,0,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUL,2017,106.0,,,,,,233,243,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.03.066,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EW2RL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402343600024,0

In this study, we divide the incentive policies into five categories: subsidies on bioethanol production, non-grain feedstocks planting, marginal land reclamation and utilization, bioethanol consumption in more cities, and consumption tax on gasoline use. The objective of the paper is to evaluate and compare the economic, energy, and environmental effects of the incentive policies to help the government choose the optimal policies to promote bioethanol in China. The results show that subsidies on bioethanol production and consumption can boost GDP, and simultaneously, decrease crude oil and gasoline consumption, and reduce CO2 emissions. However, the increase in bioethanol consumption is combined with the rise in coal and electricity consumption. Subsidies on bioethanol production can promote GDP and reduce energy consumption and CO2 emission but have less effect on bioethanol development than that under the scenario of subsides on bioethanol consumption. On the contrary, although subsidies on non-grain feedstocks planting and marginal land reclamation and utilization can improve macro-economy but have a negative effect on energy saving and CO2 emission reduction. Therefore, appropriate subsidies on bioethanol production and consumption can promote bioethanol consumption with economic, energy and environmental benefits. The Chinese government should further pay more attention to the coordination of different policy options by policy tools and intensities.","[Ge, Jianping; Lei, Yalin] China Univ Geosci Beijing, Sch Humanities & Econ Management, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Ge, Jianping; Lei, Yalin] Minist Land & Resources, Key Lab Carrying Capac Assessment Resource & Envi, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",China University of Geosciences - Beijing; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China,"Lei, YL (通讯作者)，China Univ Geosci Beijing, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",gejianping@cugb.edu.cn; leiyalin@cugb.edu.cn,"yang, yun/IZE-1092-2023",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71203203, 71173200]; Humanity and Social Science Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China [12YJCZH057]; Beijing Social Science Foundation [16YJB031]; Beijing Higher Education Young Elite Teacher Project [YETP0667]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2652015149]; Project from the Strategic Research Center of Oil and Gas Resources of MLR [1A15YQKYQ0112]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanity and Social Science Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China; Beijing Social Science Foundation; Beijing Higher Education Young Elite Teacher Project; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Project from the Strategic Research Center of Oil and Gas Resources of MLR,"Authors are truly thankful to Dr. Shuai Zhong for providing important help for the GAMS programming.

These arrangements are variously described as 'benefits payments' or 'compensation schemes'. Similar approaches are now being recommended for other forms of development with potential to engender opposition from local communities (e.g. nuclear power and fracking). While such payments are common, the level of payment, the institutional frameworks involved, and the nature of discourse, varies greatly. Existing literature has sought to record, rather than explain, the diversity of arrangements. To a large extent this diversity is rooted in the power dynamic between developer and community. Three UK case studies are used to highlight the diversity of arrangements, meanings, and power balances, within benefits arrangements. Finally, a typology is developed to illustrate the spectrum of potential arrangements.

Therefore, the expansion scenarios of nuclear power should be analysed in conjunction with long-term dynamics of the uranium market. This paper presents three forms of a partial-equilibrium model of the uranium market. All forms consider global demand as exogenous (input scenarios from the literature) and regional estimates of the quantities and the costs of ultimate resources (results obtained from previous work). The three forms differ by the market constraints and the market structure considered. Comparing them highlights the role of the market structure and the impact of some key parameters of the market dynamics on the long-term availability of uranium. An important finding is the influence of two constraints: the anticipation of demand and the significant role played by the correlation between price and exploration expenses in shaping the price trends. In addition, results from simulations highlight different long-term dynamics when the producers are allocated into a limited number of regions (to simulate an oligopoly) compared to a single region (undefined number of players to simulate perfect competition).","[Monnet, Antoine; Gabriel, Sophie] Univ Paris Saclay, CEA, French Alternat Energies & Atom Energy Commiss, I Tese,DAS, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Percebois, Jacques] Univ Montpellier I, UFR Econ, CREDEN, Art Dev UMR CNRS 5281, Ave Raymond Dugrand,CS 79606, F-34960 Montpellier, France",Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Universite de Montpellier,"Gabriel, S (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Saclay, CEA, French Alternat Energies & Atom Energy Commiss, I Tese,DAS, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France.",sophie.gabriel@cea.fr,,"Gabriel, Sophie/0000-0003-4967-1529; Percebois, Jacques/0000-0002-2839-2208",,,,,25,4,4,1,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUN,2017,105.0,,,,,,98,107,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.02.010,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ET8EY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000400532900010,0

The decomposition is applied to China's 2002 and 2007 interregional input-output tables with foreign-owned processing exports separated from normal exports. First, we find that interregional spillovers account for one quarter to one half of the total national indirect value added multipliers in 2007, with the largest spillovers occurring for the coastal regions. This finding is important when explaining regional value added generation and thus has real implications for regional policy programmes. Second, we develop a new measure, namely, net interregional value added spillovers' to position China's individual regions in the global production chains. This measure shows that upstream regions in the Centre, Northwest and Southwest of China are net recipients of interregional value added spillovers generated by foreign exports in coastal regions.

In this article, we unpack the theory and practice of fuel CI standards, examining claims regarding climate change mitigation. We show that these standards do not reliably mitigate climate change because estimates of GHG reductions rely primarily on models that are not designed to estimate changes in emissions and climate impacts. Some regulations incorporate models that estimate a subset of changes in emissions, but the models must project changes in global markets over decades, and there is little agreement about the best model structure or parameter values. Since multiple models and projections may be equally plausible, fuel CI is inevitably subjective and unverifiable. We conclude that regulating or taxing observable emissions would more reliably achieve emission reduction.","[Plevin, Richard J.; Delucchi, Mark A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Transportat Sustainabil Res Ctr, 2150 Allston Way,Suite 280, Berkeley, CA 94704 USA; [O'Hare, Michael] Univ Calif Berkeley, Goldman Sch Publ Policy, 2607 Hearst Ave, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Plevin, RJ (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Transportat Sustainabil Res Ctr, 2150 Allston Way,Suite 280, Berkeley, CA 94704 USA.",plevin@berkeley.edu; madelucchi@berkeley.edu; ohare@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,60,10,10,0,98,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUN,2017,105.0,,,,,,93,97,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.02.037,0.0,,,5,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ET8EY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000400532900009,0

However little research has been conducted on the phenomenon of energy monitoring itself, with most studies looking at whether, and how, feedback impacts on energy conservation. This paper aims to address that gap from a practice theory perspective. In particular we: set out the difference between energy feedback and energy monitoring; define the practice of energy monitoring; and investigate the rationale and qualitative experiences of those performing energy monitoring. An online energy feedback tool ('iMeasure') was the basis of the case study. A netnographic analysis of online discussion about the tool informed complementary in-depth interviews with ten current/former iMeasure users. We found energy monitoring to be a distinct practice that focuses on measuring and identifying energy use trends and requires specific know-how to perform. However, its connections to other household practices were weak and, for those who did perform monitoring, there was no guarantee that this practice would reorganise other practices to induce household energy saving. In fact, monitoring often followed decisions to make energy-related changes, rather than prompting them. We conclude that policy expectations need to be reframed in terms of how energy monitoring tools are used.","[Foulds, Chris; Robison, Rosalyn A.

SES goes beyond 'energy supply' and is a function of the aggregate energy system of a country, including the 'energy demand' and 'conversion and distribution sub-system'. The supply sub-system which consists of eight primary energy sources viz. coal, oil, natural gas, biomass, hydro, solar, wind and nuclear has been evaluated for four dimensions of SES, viz., availability, affordability, efficiency and (environmental) acceptability using 16 selected metrics. The dimensional indices are calculated for domestic and imported energy sources separately for the years 2002, 2007 and 2012. Results reveal that the SES index for oil has increased by 10% but it has decreased by 6% for gas from 2002 to 2012, while changes for other energy sources are marginal. The overall supply subsystem SES index is approximately 0.75 (against an ideal value of 1.0) which reveal the shortfall from the desired value. A sensitivity analysis reveals that the SES index is relatively robust to variation in weights. The assessment provides a comprehensive way to track the performance of the energy supply sub-system and can be used to design policy interventions for improving the overall SES index for India.","[Narula, Kapil] Natl Maritime Fdn, Varuna Complex,Airport Rd,NH-8, New Delhi, India; [Reddy, B.

Results show that, although some customers pay lower rates today, the average customer does not pay a lower rate due to deregulation. Moreover, the results of the modeling show that the wholesale prices realized were higher than the marginal cost associated with the grid.

Using a multinomial logit model of the choices among 1135 boilers in thermal power plants operating in China in 2013, we analyze how the choices were influenced by government policies, the stringency of national standards, and subsidies for using specific technology. The results are as follows. First, China's 12th Five-year Plan might make it more attractive for plants to choose the cheapest denitration technology among the three options examined in this study. Second, technology choices differed significantly by region before the 12th Five-year Plan period. These differences have disappeared, perhaps due to the economic development across all regions of China. Third, electricity price subsidies offered to plants that use denitration equipment might affect their technology choice. These results suggests that plants might choose the cheapest technology available, in order to lower investment costs.","[Ma, Teng; Takeuchi, Kenji] Kobe Univ Rokko, Grad Sch Econ, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan",Kobe University,"Takeuchi, K (通讯作者)，Kobe Univ Rokko, Grad Sch Econ, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.",mt_yx@hotmail.com; takeuchi@econ.kobe-u.ac.jp,"Takeuchi, Kenji/S-5311-2016; Takeuchi, Kenji/GWV-8019-2022","Takeuchi, Kenji/0000-0002-6180-7663; Ma, Teng/0000-0001-9079-6767","JSPS KAKENHI [JP16H03006, JP26241033]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16H03006, 17K18564] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers JP16H03006, JP26241033.",,34,21,24,2,42,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAR,2017,102.0,,,,,,362,376,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.12.043,0.0,,,15,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP4NM,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397357200034,0

The identified HRL segments are profiled and the practical importance of HRL for everyday energy-saving efforts in the homeand for the energy-consumer's openness to new energy saving opportunities (i.e., energy saving innovativeness) is investigated. The HRL instrument's 71 items load on 16 dimensions within five lifestyle elements. Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis reveals that the instrument possesses metric but not scalar (measurement) invariance across the 10 countries. Multileve 1 latent class analysis is used to classify participants to HRL segments and the 10 countries into regions with similar segment structure. The optimal solution has seven HRL segments and three country classes, which are profiled in terms of relevant background characteristics. A multivariate GLM analysis reveals that when differences in housing-related lifestyles are controlled, neither country of residence nor the interaction between lifestyle and country of residence influence energy saving innovativeness or everyday energy-saving efforts. However, these two behavioural tendencies vary significantly and substantially between lifestyle segments. The study shows that HRL segmentation is a useful tool for creating more targeted and effective energy-saving campaigns.","[Thogersen, John] Aarhus Univ, Dept Management, Aarhus BSS, Bartholins Alle 10, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Thogersen, J (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Management, Aarhus BSS, Bartholins Alle 10, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",jbt@mgmt.au.dk,"Thøgersen, John/G-6253-2013","Thøgersen, John/0000-0003-0613-8062",European Union [613194],European Union(European Union (EU)),"This research is part the large-scale project 'Sustainable Lifestyles 2.0: End User Integration, Innovation and Entrepreneurship (EU-InnovatE)'.

New power plants that are to be constructed should guarantee the highest level of security of electricity supply and be consistent with actual energy policy carried out by a country. Thus, the proposed remuneration system is based on an 'operational reserve' system which is currently implemented in Poland. The proposed system distinguishes new power generating assets according to a total assessment based on three factors: type of technology (including emission benchmark), flexibility, and location (addressing issue of brown or green field investment and conditions of power system operation). Existing power plants are also subsidized by the proposed mechanism, however their remuneration is not based on their characteristics. The details of the proposed mechanism, a cost analysis, and a standardized evaluation procedure are described in the paper. The concept itself is universal and can be intruded in every power system that must overcome capacity problem.","[Wierzbowski, Michal; Filipiak, Izabela] Lodz Univ Technol, PL-90924 Lodz, Poland",Lodz University of Technology,"Wierzbowski, M (通讯作者)，Lodz Univ Technol, Inst Elect Power Engn, 18-22 Stefanowskiego St, PL-90924 Lodz, Poland.",michal.wierzbowski@p.lodz.pl,"Wierzbowski, Michal/S-4317-2019; Wierzbowski, Michal/A-2644-2019","Wierzbowski, Michal/0000-0002-9320-8761; Wierzbowski, Michal/0000-0002-9320-8761",,,,,47,2,2,0,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAR,2017,102.0,,,,,,602,615,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.12.048,0.0,,,14,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP4NM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397357200056,0

Is there a link between rising trade conflicts and trade and investment trends? And what wider motivations and synergies can be identified in Chinese investments in the EU's RE sector? To address these questions we analyze trade and investment data, as well as qualitative data, including information from media and company reports. Large increases in trade and investment were followed by rapid falls since 2012-13. Trade tensions have not led to increases in investment, rather the inverse. We find that Chinese investment in these two sectors is very concentrated in Germany. The key motivation for investment is market seeking, although R+D is also important, especially for wind. Most investments are greenfield, a preference that has persisted over time.

The Medellin metropolitan area (Colombia) has developed a mass transportation system called Metro de Medellin that integrates train lines, a tram line, BRTs, gondola lift systems, a bicycle-sharing system and hybrid buses to reduce traffic and CO2 emissions. Despite these efforts, pollution is peaking, and the situation requires new plans. The aim of this paper is to quantify the emissions that will be avoided by the implementation of Medellin's Master Plan, the promotion of telecommuting, and the development of a transport energy model for Medellin between 2010 and 2040. The results indicate that combining the promotion of mass transportation and telecommuting could represent 5.65 MTons of CO2 equivalent avoided by 2040 (9.4% reduction) and estimated total energy savings of 86,575.55 TJ. Therefore, it is necessary to implement complementary policies in order to achieve the commitment assumed by Colombia at the COP 21. The analytical framework used here could be applied to other regions in order to evaluate environmental and energy mitigation strategies, especially in the developing world where similar policies may be in place.","[Esteban Martinez-Jaramillo, Juan; Alvarez-Uribe, Karla C.] Inst Tecnol Metropolitano, Dept Prod Engn, Medellin, Colombia; [Arango-Aramburo, Santiago; Jaramillo-Alvarez, Patricia] Univ Nacl Colombia, Decis Sci Grp, Fac Mines, Carrera 80 65-223,Bloque M8a, Medellin, Colombia; [Jaramillo-Alvarez, Patricia] Univ Nacl Colombia, Decis Sci Grp, Fac Minas, Carrera 80 65-223,Bloque M8a, Medellin, Colombia",Universidad Nacional de Colombia; Universidad Nacional de Colombia,"Arango-Aramburo, S (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Colombia, Decis Sci Grp, Fac Mines, Carrera 80 65-223,Bloque M8a, Medellin, Colombia.",jemartinezj@unal.edu.co; saarango@unal.edu.co; karlaalvarez@itm.edu.co; gpjarami@unal.edu.co,"Álvarez -Uribe, karla C./P-8022-2018; Uribe, Karla C.

Analysis of this data shows that within the EU, 30 Chinese investments largely focused on the oil and gas sector, especially through the acquisition of company shares. Chinese energy investments in Europe reflect a clear political and commercial strategy that addresses the PRC's need to balance supply chain security of fossil fuels, environmentally friendlier energy production and use as well as to enhance the market position and energy-industrial capabilities of Chinese state-owned or state-supervised energy companies. Based on a comprehensive set of domestic incentives for international investment the Chinese penetration of the European energy sector is embedded within two levels of political cooperation. The first level revolves around bilateral investment agreements between China and 27 EU member states. On the second level, China and the EU have established a variety of formats that guide their energy cooperation. The conclusion of the proposed bilateral investment agreement between the PRC and the EU would create a uniform investment environment across the continent and facilitate mutual economic benefits for both parties.

Thus, the Korean government is considering the introduction of a BE mandate in which the legal blend is 5% BE and 95% gasoline (E5) until 2020 in order to expand BE use. We should examine the public acceptability of the introduction, which incurs a rise in the fuel price. This study attempts to assess the public's willingness to pay (WTP) a premium for introducing the E5 program in Korea. To this end, a contingent valuation (CV) survey of 1000 randomly selected consumers was conducted in 2014 across the nation. We used a one-and-one-half-bound dichotomous choice question in the CV survey and applied the spike model to handle the WTP data with zeros. The mean WTP, a premium for the E5 per liter, is estimated to be KRW 290 (USD 0.27), which is statistically meaningful at the 1% level. This value amounts to 15.6% of the gasoline retail price in 2014 (KRW 1856 or USD 1.70) and can be interpreted as the external benefit of BE. We can conclude that gasoline consumers in Korea are ready to pay a significant premium for the E5.","[Lim, Seul-Ye; Kim, Hyo-Jin; Yoo, Seung-Hoon] Seoul Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Energy & Environm, Dept Energy Policy, 232 Gongreung Ro, Seoul 01811, South Korea",Seoul National University of Science & Technology,"Yoo, SH (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Energy & Environm, Dept Energy Policy, 232 Gongreung Ro, Seoul 01811, South Korea.",sylim@seoultech.ac.kr; hyojinkim@seoultech.ac.kr; shyoo@seoultech.ac.kr,"Yoo, Seung-Hoon/F-1048-2010","Yoo, Seung-Hoon/0000-0001-5048-219X","Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP); Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) of the Republic of Korea [20164030201060]","Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP); Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) of the Republic of Korea","This work was supported by the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) and the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) of the Republic of Korea (No. 20164030201060).",,38,19,20,0,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2017,101.0,,,,,,20,27,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.11.010,0.0,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EI8PD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000392768800003,0

Lack of such a system may lead to further problems such as long promotion time in business processes, long cycle times in transactions, excessive inventory and weak use of financial resources and other resources, low productivity and inventory shortages. The following paper presents results from a study about the importance and use of information and communication technology (ICT) in Slovak small and medium-sized companies (SMEs) from forestry and wood processing industry. In an empirical survey, 156 questionnaires were collected and analysed (return rate 78%). The goal was to identify advantages and deficiencies dealing with ICT used by the above mentioned companies. The findings show that Slovak SMEs are satisfied with functionality and adaptability of ICT. The main deficiency identified by the companies were incompatibility and insufficient support in the process of ICT implementation and operation. The most important result seems to be the investment into complex and integrated information systems (IS). The main problem in application of these types of IS are the limited financial resources of SMEs.

The Indian government has started a process through which the extent of cross subsidization is gradually being reduced. The idea is to replace the cross subsidization by 2030 and introduce a rate structure that will increase with the amount of electricity usage. This paper ices the Computable General Equilibrium framework to evaluate the ex-ante impact of these policy changes on the Indian economy. The paper finds that removal of cross subsidies will increase inflation particularly food inflation resulting in a decline in household incomes more so in rural areas. Replacing cross subsidies with a progressive rate structure will compensate for only a small part of the negative effects of the removal of cross subsidies. Four other policy options are also investigated targeting household incomes, food inflation and general inflation. Most of these options do not work as the required increase in budget deficit is unlikely to be bearable to the government The only feasible option appears to be a direct price subsidy to agricultural sector: in this case food prices are held down, inflation is moderate and effect on household incomes is minimal.","[Bhattacharyya, Ranajoy; Ganguly, Amrita] Indian Inst Foreign Trade, 1583 Madurdaha Chowbagha Rd,Ward 108,Borough 12, Kolkata 700107, India",,"Ganguly, A (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Foreign Trade, 1583 Madurdaha Chowbagha Rd,Ward 108,Borough 12, Kolkata 700107, India.",branajoy@gmail.com; amrita.ganguly@in.ey.com,"Bhattacharyya, Ranajoy/L-7591-2019; Trade, Indian Institute of Foreign/AAF-4182-2021","Trade, Indian Institute of Foreign/0000-0002-2546-3285",,,,,18,34,39,2,35,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JAN,2017,100.0,,,,,,181,190,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.10.024,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EH6SJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000391903900018,0

The approach is based on the assumption that the economic framework and institutional setting were crucial for the rise and fall of industrial districts. Transformation regularly led to a reduction of transaction costs by replacing the existing institutions with more efficient ones. However, sometimes the interests of socio-economic groups such as guilds placed barriers in the way of institutional change, impeding effective transformation. A further challenge of the paper is the comparison of 18th- and 20th-century developments.","[Boldorf, Marcel] Univ Lyon 2, F-69365 Lyon 07, France",Universite Lyon 2,"Boldorf, M (通讯作者)，Univ Lyon 2, F-69365 Lyon 07, France.",,,,,,,,52,0,0,0,2,"UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT HISTORIA, INST ECONOMIQUES",BARCELONA,"AVDA DIAGONAL 690, BARCELONA, 08034, SPAIN",1132-7200,,,REV HIST INDUST,Rev.

To achieve an actual implementation of the SEAP and to obtain its expected targets, monitoring is a crucial component. SEAP monitoring has to look at both the progress of each single action and its global environmental effect, which requires more than one level of development. In the present paper, an integrated strategy for surveying, controlling and managing the SEAP through a Monitoring and Evaluation (M & E) process is introduced. The implementation in the city of Genoa, Italy, was used to test the efficacy of this approach and to assess its strengths and weaknesses. In particular, cost benefit analysis, bankability, peer review and participatory level were identified as key elements for obtaining an operative SEAP monitoring and for then fostering an effective environmental energy policy. Some recommendations were proposed to better outline the Monitoring and Evaluation methodology and to help other cities to define a strategy for SEAP monitoring and fulfilment.","[Delponte, Ilaria] Univ Genoa, DICCA Dept Civil Chem & Environm Engn, Genoa, Italy; [Pittaluga, Ilaria; Schenone, Corrado] Univ Genoa, DIME Dept Mech Engn, Genoa, Italy",University of Genoa; University of Genoa,"Schenone, C (通讯作者)，Univ Genoa, DIME, Via Opera Pia 15A, I-16145 Genoa, Italy.",corrado.schenone@unige.it,"Delponte, Ilaria/AAD-6012-2021; Schenone, Corrado/B-8326-2013",,,,,,30,39,39,1,17,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JAN,2017,100.0,,,,,,9,17,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.10.003,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EH6SJ,,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000391903900002,0

On the basis of Load Drop Cost (LDC), a quantitative evaluation index of load-loss cost caused by voltage sag is identified. The load-loss cost to be allocated to power consumers themselves is calculated according to load classification. Based on the theory of power component the quantitative relation between sources and loads is established, thereby a quantitative calculation method for load-loss cost allocated to each source is deduced and the quantitative compensation from individual source to load is proposed.

Nowadays, the developmental policies experience a revival since they represent an alternative to liberalism normally abstaining from the interventionism that may help to overcome the economic crisis. The authors focus on the analysis of Eurasian integration processes paying attention to certain member state' political and economic characteristics considering them as prerequisites for an eventual realization of common developmental projects. Among economic parameters for the developmental regionalism, the leader's relative economic size, relative level of its development, low natural rent and industrial base has been considered, while the taken into consideration appropriate political factors were the presence of independent developmental elite, competent economic bureaucracy, effective public-private partnership, the level of public confidence, the interaction with the civil society.

However, previous studies seldom focused on nuclear power plants in the planning stage. Actually public perception is usually more sensitive at the preliminary planning stage of a nuclear power station. Mainly utilizing questionnaire survey and focus group methods, we have identified the factors that are correlated with local acceptance of planned nuclear power plants in China. We conducted our survey in two cities, Huludao, Liaoning province in northern China, and Shanwei, Guangdong province in southern China, where the local government was planning to build its first nuclear power plant. We find that people who live closer to the plant sites are less willing to accept nuclear power than those who live farther away. As for surface psychology factors, perceived benefits and risks significantly influence local acceptance. As for deep psychology factors, emotional identification and social trust can significantly influence local acceptance, while perceived knowledge cannot. When citizens are unfamiliar with nuclear power plants, they are more inclined to evaluate the benefits and risks through emotional identification and social trust, rather than through pure rational deduction based on concrete facts.","[Guo, Yue; Ren, Tao] Harvard Univ, Belfer Ctr Sci & Int Affairs, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ren, Tao] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Harvard University; Tsinghua University,"Guo, Y (通讯作者)，79 John F Kennedy St,Mailbox 134, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",yue_guo@hks.harvard.edu,,"Ren, Tao/0000-0003-1542-6568","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71233005, 71520107005]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71233005, 2013 and 71520107005, 2016).",,66,71,79,6,57,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JAN,2017,100.0,,,,,,113,125,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.10.002,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EH6SJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000391903900012,0

Determining the efficacy of such a pathway for a national electricity system implies evaluating whole system change in future scenarios. Life cycle assessment (LCA) and net energy analysis (NEA) are two methodologies suitable for prospective and consequential analysis of energy performance and associated impacts. This paper discusses the benefits and limitations of prospective and consequential LCA and NEA analysis of distributed generation. It concludes that a combined LCA and NEA approach is a valuable tool for decision makers if a number of recommendations are addressed. Static and dynamic temporal allocation are both needed for a fair comparison of distributed renewables with thermal power stations to account for their different impact profiles over time. The trade-offs between comprehensiveness and uncertainty in consequential analysis should be acknowledged, with system boundary expansion and system simulation models limited to those clearly justified by the research goal. The results of this approach are explorative, rather than for accounting purposes; this interpretive remit, and the assumptions in scenarios and system models on which results are contingent, must be clear to end users.

The functioning of these devices is dependent on their components reliability and sub-rational management of their exploitation process. The exploitation process of the rail automation devices must take into account both their usage and difficult renovation process. Due to the exploitation and maintenance costs optimization, it is important to select a maintenance strategy for railway automation devices, i.e. determining the way of carrying out maintenance work that allows devices to maintain their technical efficiency. From an economic point of view, the optimum level of railway automation devices reliability will be achieved when the total production and exploitation costs of the devices are minimal. An increase in a level of technical facilities safety and reliability causes a growth in their manufacturing costs and ultimately results in lower exploitation and maintenance costs and losses due to devices damage during their normal usage. The high level of railway automation devices safety can be achieved by many alternative spending combinations. For example, a specified level of safety can be achieved through higher investment outlays (the usage of better and more expensive technology, materials and resources, etc.) or due to higher exploitation costs (highly qualified and better paid service personnel, etc.).","[Kornaszewski, Mieczyslaw; Pniewski, Roman] Kazimierz Pulaski Univ Technol & Humanities Radom, Fac Transport & Elect Engn, Malczewskiego 29, PL-26600 Radom, Poland",Kazimierz Pulaski University of Technology & Humanities in Radom,"Kornaszewski, M (通讯作者)，Kazimierz Pulaski Univ Technol & Humanities Radom, Fac Transport & Elect Engn, Malczewskiego 29, PL-26600 Radom, Poland.",m.kornaszewski@uthrad.pl; r.pniewski@uthrad.pl,,"Kornaszewski, Mieczyslaw/0000-0002-0548-8688",Polish National Center for Research and Development [PBS3/A6/29/2015],Polish National Center for Research and Development,This material is based upon work supported by Polish National Center for Research and Development under Grant No. PBS3/A6/29/2015.,,17,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,1036,1043,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059202001,0

In the context of globalization customers have more purchasing choices than even before, customers buying behaviour changes, the abundance of buying options raises the questions how to keep customers loyal. Customer loyalty becomes a challenge for any organization. Organizations face the challenge to adapt loyalty programs to different needs and deliver desirable value. Generational aspect gets a special importance, because people born in specific time of period imprint a specific and common purchasing, which is common global. This paper examines generational perceptions of the influence of perceived benefits on the satisfaction with loyalty programs for generations X and Y in grocery retailing, having in mind that customers become more loyal if they are satisfied with the rewards obtained from loyalty programs (Demoulin and Zidda, 2009). The research findings indicate that the most important loyalty programs benefits for both generations are monetary savings, social benefits and entertainment. Exploration has the strongest impact for Gen Xers, but having no meaningful impact for Millennials. On the other hand, convenience and recognition benefits are not important for both generations. The study findings indicate directions for loyalty management in grocery retailing which can be adapted globally.","[Kyguoliene, Asta; Zikiene, Kristina; Kamanduliene, Asta] Vytautas Magnus Univ, K Donelaicio St 58, LT-44248 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Kyguoliene, A (通讯作者)，Vytautas Magnus Univ, K Donelaicio St 58, LT-44248 Kaunas, Lithuania.",asta.kyguoliene@vdu.lt; kristina.zikiene@vdu.lt; asta.kamanduliene@vdu.lt,"Zikienė, Kristina/AFV-9375-2022",,,,,,22,1,1,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,1267,1274,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059202029,0

This competitive struggle is conditioned by the quality of the offered products, by the price of the provided products and services, as well as by the efficiency of the performed activities. The new global environment will require completely new approaches by managers. It is untenable to continue in maintenance of the used habits. It is necessary to thoroughly analyze and evaluate individual customer segments and create targeted products. One of the ways to achieve this goal is the implementation of a modern CRM system.

Authors clarify the terminology, particularly, they argue that discriminatory measures against Russia as well as Russian responding measures can't be called sanctions. Only supranational unions, which have particular authority to implement sanctions toward its members, can use this instrument. Embargo and boycott are regarded as extreme forms of competitive struggle between national economies. The efficiency of limitation measures on goods and capital movement is estimated by matching benefits and losses from these measures for the national economy, not by matching the losses of contractors. In the short run boycott is more effective than embargo, because it leads to the growth of industries that are protected by the trade barrier. The embargo, in turn, is less effective, due to the variety of trade links in the global economy. The analysis of Russian protectionist trade measures for agricultural industry shows that there was rapid sectoral growth of domestic production and displace of agricultural import with short-term recoupment. In capital-intensive sectors, there has been a change in sales geography. It is expected that in the long run boycott will lead to loss in effectiveness and competitiveness, and embargo will restrain economic growth by preventing effective industry development.","[Lyakin, Alexander N.] St Petersburg Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Econ Policy, Tchaikovskogo Str 62,Off 310, St Petersburg 191194, Russia; [Rogov, Mikhail I.] St Petersburg Univ, Grad Sch Management, Dept Operat Management, Volkhovskiy Pereulok 3, St Petersburg 199004, Russia",Saint Petersburg State University; Saint Petersburg State University,"Rogov, MI (通讯作者)，St Petersburg Univ, Grad Sch Management, Dept Operat Management, Volkhovskiy Pereulok 3, St Petersburg 199004, Russia.",a.lyakin@spbu.ru; mikhail.i.rogov@gmail.com,"Rogov, PhD, Mikhail/IYJ-4662-2023; Rogov, Mikhail/N-7904-2018; Alexander, Lyakin/A-3672-2015","Alexander, Lyakin/0000-0002-0722-2517",,,,,18,2,2,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,1380,1387,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059202042,0

It is important to highlight that the main goal of city transport system control is to satisfy the aforesaid demands and minimize the total public costs at the same time. It is important to take into accordance all the public effects and all the total public costs with all the externalities if we want to estimate the transport system efficiency. Public effects include the estimation of trip time reduction, the population mobility and economic activity grow, rate of agglomeration economic grow. There are some research that confirms the relation between staff turnover with real estate price and the agglomeration transport system development level. (Faulk & Hicks, 2016) Obviously, we need to design the common way of such effects estimation and we need to use it in agglomeration development strategic planning.

One of the solutions how to avoid this kind of problem is to collect or evaluate basic information about the customer to create an image about his financial situation. Each company has to find a method how to evaluate the responsibility of customer. The general used method is rating, it means estimation of probability that the customer will delay with his payments or has no sources to pay out his debts. The company's customers are according this estimation divided into different risk groups, Customer's rating or categorization into risk groups according his insolvency is really useful tool for company with higher amount of customers. The move the rating's process is automated or connect with other parts of company ' s information system, the bigger benefit becomes for the company. The aim of this paper is to evaluate customer's rating with the help of selected methods what makes administration of claims easier, the decision-making process quicker or introduces alert system when the risk of insolvency will not remain within normal limits.

The fragmentation of the European airspace is perceived as one of the obstacles in the evolution of the European air industry towards higher competitiveness. Therefore, we confront the composition of current Functional Airspace Blocks with the results of cluster analysis. The cluster analysis uses the latest ACE Eurocontrol benchmarking report ' s indicators, which influence the cost-effectiveness of the European air navigation service providers. Each European air navigation service providers is clustered according to support cost ratio, air traffic controllers ' labour cost and air traffic controller ' s productivity in composite flight hours. Based on the results, the policy recommendations are outlined considering the impacts on the European airspace global competitiveness.

In this system the greatest emphasis is placed on reducing the impact of the waste on the environment in international and global terms. Significant is the high discipline in the sorting of waste by residents. The economic aspect of the technologies used is significant they are extremely expensive.

In particular, it presents the developments and changes on the labor market and the consequences for the German social system, the welfare state. The article examines the possible reasons for the low unemployment rate. While it is standard for people in Eastern European countries to adopt a normal, that is, full-time employment contract, the situation is somewhat different in Germany. This article shows on the basis of labor market statistics that there is a high proportion of part-time work in Germany, as well as new forms of employment contracts, bogus self-employment, midi- and mini jobs with reduced contributions to social insurance and often interrupted by periods of unemployment. However, lower social security payments also lead to reduced social expenditures and burden the budget necessary for a sufficient pension insurance.

The results point to seven components of positive or negative assessments linked to the practice of electricity saving. These can be described in terms of environmental and citizen aspects, household management, feelings of well-being, secondary benefits, daily efforts, social consequences and lack of knowledge. Our results suggest that the main value lever of electricity-saving for consumers is more closely linked to well-being rather than environmental or money-saving concerns.

This paper uses the analytical hierarch process to clarify the relative significance of the determinants in the location decisions of foreign wind and solar energy investors. A total of 18 determinants that are categorized into the macroeconomic environment, institutional environment, natural conditions, and renewable energy policy categories are used for the analysis. The results show that adding to the traditional determinants of FDI, including the macroeconomic environment, the institutional environment, and natural conditions, renewable energy support policies have the same or stronger influence as location determinants of FDI. The paper also points out that some of the traditional determinants, such as exchange rate volatility, access to land, and an efficient and transparent administrative procedure, are also very important as determinants of FDI in wind and solar energy. Policy implications focus on the determinants of FDI in wind and solar energy. The relative significance of the determinants clarified through this study offers criteria for prioritizing policies and actions for policy makers.","[Keeley, Alexander Ryota] Kyushu Univ, Technol & Policy Dept Urban & Environm Engn, Nishi Ku, 744 Motooka, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan; [Keeley, Alexander Ryota] World Bank Disaster Risk Management DRM Hub, Chiyoda Ku, Fukoku Seimei Bldg 10th Floor,Uchisaiwaicho 2-2-2, Tokyo 1000011, Japan; [Matsumoto, Ken'ichi] Nagasaki Univ, Grad Sch Fisheries & Environm Sci, 1-14 Bunkyo Machi, Nagasaki 8528521, Japan",Kyushu University; Nagasaki University,"Keeley, AR (通讯作者)，Kyushu Univ, Technol & Policy Dept Urban & Environm Engn, Nishi Ku, 744 Motooka, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan.",keeley.ryota.alexander.416@m.kyushu-u.ac.jp; kenichimatsu@nagasaki-u.ac.jp,"Matsumoto, Ken'ichi/AFZ-9881-2022; N, A/JUF-6197-2023; Keeley, Alexander/AAP-7333-2021","Matsumoto, Ken'ichi/0000-0002-9349-9765; Keeley, Alexander/0000-0002-8578-6297","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (Japan) KAKENHI [18K11754, 18K11800]; Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models (TOUGOU program) of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan) MEXT; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [18K11754, 18K11800] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (Japan) KAKENHI; Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models (TOUGOU program) of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan) MEXT; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This research was supported by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (Japan) KAKENHI Grant Number 18K11754 and 18K11800, and the Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models (TOUGOU program) of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan) MEXT.",,39,31,35,5,43,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2018,123.0,,,,,,337,348,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.08.055,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HE6FW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000453499700034,0

It argues that existing 'demand-side' approaches focused on promoting technological efficiency and informed individual consumption are unlikely to be adequate to achieving future carbon emissions reduction goals; it points out that very little attention has so far been paid to the impacts of non-energy policies on energy demand; and it submits that a much fuller integration of energy demand questions into policy is required. It advances a general framework, supported by illustrative examples, for understanding the impacts of 'non-energy' policies on energy demand. It reflects on why these connections have been so little explored and addressed within energy research and policy. And it argues that, for all their current 'invisibility', there is nonetheless scope for increasing the visibility of, and in effect 'mainstreaming', energy demand reduction objectives within other policy areas. Researchers and policymakers, we contend, need to develop better understandings of how energy demand might be made governable, and how non-energy policies might be revised, alone and in combination, to help steer long-term changes in energy demand.","[Royston, Sarah; Selby, Jan] Univ Sussex, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England; [Shove, Elizabeth] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England",University of Sussex; Lancaster University,"Royston, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England.",s.royston@sussex.ac.uk; j.selby@sussex.ac.uk; e.shove@lancaster.ac.uk,,"Selby, Jan/0000-0002-7574-9660","DEMAND: Dynamics of Energy, Mobility and Demand Research Centre - Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, Research Councils UK Energy Programme [EP/K011723/1]; EDF as part of the R&D ECLEER Programme; EPSRC [EP/K011723/1] Funding Source: UKRI","DEMAND: Dynamics of Energy, Mobility and Demand Research Centre - Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, Research Councils UK Energy Programme; EDF as part of the R&D ECLEER Programme; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","This work was supported by the DEMAND: Dynamics of Energy, Mobility and Demand Research Centre funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [grant number EP/K011723/1] as part of the Research Councils UK Energy Programme and by EDF as part of the R&D ECLEER Programme.",,108,63,67,7,53,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2018,123.0,,,,,,127,135,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.08.052,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HE6FW,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000453499700013,0

To examine the role of the incentives in reducing total ownership costs of battery electric vehicles (BEVs), increasing BEV sales, and obtaining environmental benefits from switching to BEVs, we carry out cost benefit analyses and ordinary least square regressions. We study 10 pairs of BEVs and their internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) counterparts across 28 European countries from 2012 to 2014. The results show that, under the incentive schemes, the costs reduced by switching to large BEVs from their ICEV counterparts are larger than the costs reduced by switching to small BEVs from their ICEV counterparts. Owing to the cost-reduction effect, a 10% increase of the total tax incentive leads to an increase in the sales share of BEVs by around 3% on average. Finally, we find that it is still costly to use the tax incentives to reduce CO2 emissions and other environmental externalities through transport electrification, despite recent improvements in greening electricity generation and lowering battery costs.","[Yan, Shiyu] Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Business & Management Sci, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Yan, SY (通讯作者)，Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Business & Management Sci, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway.",yanshiyu614@hotmail.com,,"Yan, Shiyu/0000-0002-4539-2939",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"The author would like to thank Professor Gunnar S.

Three aspects of the behaviour of the methods are analysed: performances in reproducing 'true' input coefficients, variability of error, and direction of bias. The analysis uses real data and in particular the world input-output table. The most important aspect that emerges from the analysis is that even though simple location quotient (SLQ) has been identified as one of the most robust methods, its performance drops when confronted with Input Output Tables characterized by a high percentage of technical coefficients close to zero. Also the cross industry location quotient (CILQ), the semi logarithmic location quotient (RLQ), the symmetric cross industry location quotient (SCILQ) methods behave in a similar way. On the contrary, the performance of the methods the Flegg location quotient (FLQ) for delta = 0.2 and the Augmented Flegg location quotient (AFLQ) for 0.2 <= delta <= 0.3 are not affected by this situation.","[Lamonica, Giuseppe Ricciardo; Chelli, Francesco Maria] Univ Politecn Marche, Fac Econ G Fua, Dept Econ, Piazzale Martelli 8, I-60121 Ancona, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University,"Lamonica, GR (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, Fac Econ G Fua, Dept Econ, Piazzale Martelli 8, I-60121 Ancona, Italy.",g.ricciardo@univpm.it; f.chelli@univpm.it,,"CHELLI, Francesco Maria/0000-0003-1056-0119; Ricciardo Lamonica, Giuseppe/0000-0002-6453-7275",,,,,27,46,48,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

It is increasingly asserted that paying due attention to the moral values involved in controversial energy cases may increase social acceptance. Value-sensitive design (VSD) has been recommended as a promising approach for addressing moral values in controversial energy cases. This paper aims to empirically explore the applicability of VSD in controversial energy cases by investigating the extent to which it is possible to identify the relevant values, norms and design requirements in the Groningen gas controversy (the Netherlands) using values hierarchies. It was found in this case that the relevant values, norms and design requirements could be retrieved, but that two conditions need to be fulfilled to avoid underexposure of relevant values. Firstly, data should be collected using a variety of data sources. Secondly, these sources should be analyzed through both top-down approaches and bottom-up approaches. We find that 'Safety' is a critical value in the Groningen case, while other critical values are related to securing 'Procedural Justice'. Strikingly, the important procedural values 'Trust' and 'Honesty' did not translate into concrete policies. Policy makers can use values hierarchies to address moral values in energy cases and to translate these values into concrete measures.","[Mouter, Niek] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Engn Syst & Serv, Jaffalaan 5, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands; [de Geest, Auke] Waterboard Hollands Noorderkwartier, Stn Pl 136, NL-1703 WC Heerhugowaard, Netherlands; [Doorn, Neelke] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Values Technol & Innovat, Jaffalaan 5, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology; Delft University of Technology,"Mouter, N (通讯作者)，Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Engn Syst & Serv, Jaffalaan 5, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands.",n.mouter@tudelft.nl; n.doorn@tudelft.nl,,"Doorn, Neelke/0000-0002-1090-579X",,,,,78,15,17,3,16,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2018,122.0,,,,,,639,648,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.08.020,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GX2UX,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447576700059,0

Our general question is therefore whether there is simply more informal work in less-developed regions, as the modernization theory asserts. Our analysis concludes that there is limited correlation between the prevalence of informal work and a region's level of development, whereas there is a significant positive autocorrelation between the extent of informal work in the analysed voivodships in Poland.","[Nikulin, Dagmara; Sobiechowska-Ziegert, Aneta] Gdansk Univ Technol, Fac Management & Econ, Gdansk, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; Gdansk University of Technology,"Nikulin, D (通讯作者)，Gdansk Univ Technol, Fac Management & Econ, Gdansk, Poland.",dnikulin@zie.pg.gda.pl; as@zie.pg.gda.pl,"Nikulin, Dagmara/AAH-5603-2019; Sobiechowska-Ziegert, Aneta/V-5174-2017","Nikulin, Dagmara/0000-0002-0534-4553; Sobiechowska-Ziegert, Aneta/0000-0001-6504-1602",,,,,90,8,8,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

Deterministic unit commitment (DUC) models with exogenous reserve requirements, as often used in today's adequacy studies to represent day-to-day power system operations, do not account for the contribution of operating reserves to the adequacy of the system. Hence, the adequacy metrics obtained from such an analysis represent a worst-case estimate and should be interpreted with care. In this paper, we propose to use a DUC model with a set of state-of-the-art probabilistic reserve constraints (DUC-PR). The performance of the DUC-PR model in the context of adequacy assessments is studied in a numerical case study. The Expected Energy Not Served (EENS) volume obtained with the DUC model is shown to be a poor estimate of the true EENS volume. In contrast, the DUC-PR methodology yields an accurate estimate of the EENS volume without significantly increasing the computational burden. Policy makers should encourage adopting novel operational power system models, such as the DUC-PR model, to accurately estimate the contribution of operating reserves to system adequacy.","[Hermans, Mathias; Bruninx, Kenneth; Delarue, Erik] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Celestijnenlaan 300, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium; [Hermans, Mathias; Bruninx, Kenneth; Delarue, Erik] EnergyVille, Thor Pk 8310, B-3600 Genk, Belgium; [Bruninx, Kenneth] VITO, Boeretang 200, B-2400 Mol, Belgium; [Vitiello, Silvia; Spisto, Amanda] European Commiss, JRC, Via Enrico Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy",KU Leuven; VITO; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Delarue, E (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Celestijnenlaan 300, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium.;Delarue, E (通讯作者)，EnergyVille, Thor Pk 8310, B-3600 Genk, Belgium.",erik.delarue@kuleuven.be,"Vitiello, Silvia L./ABB-7456-2020; Vitiello, Silvia/AAF-3051-2020; Bruninx, Kenneth/T-4486-2019; Delarue, Erik/G-9722-2012","Vitiello, Silvia L./0000-0002-5115-7855; Bruninx, Kenneth/0000-0003-0838-5139; Delarue, Erik/0000-0003-1798-1274","European Commission Joint Research Center (JRC), Ispra, Directorate C - C.3 Energy system, distribution and markets Unit [CCR.C.C685709.X0]","European Commission Joint Research Center (JRC), Ispra, Directorate C - C.3 Energy system, distribution and markets Unit","We acknowledge research funding from the European Commission Joint Research Center (JRC) (CCR.C.C685709.X0), Ispra, Directorate C - C.3 Energy system, distribution and markets Unit.",,40,9,9,0,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2018,121.0,,,,,,112,123,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.06.012,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GV3HA,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445983800012,0

The core contention is that the sensitivity of the investment rate to the cash flow rate is a function of a firm's financial position contributing to its access to external finance. The application of a nonlinear panel threshold model reveals that the marginal effect of the cash flow rate on the investment rate is almost twice as strong for high debt' firms compared to low debt' firms. This result holds for six out of seven balance sheet threshold variables. For a single specification, the results reveal a non-monotonic relationship between the cash flow rate and investment rate.

Consequently, the body of literature on NSTT is mature, while the body on SSTT and SNTT is still in its infancy. This paper provides a meta-synthesis of the scholarly writings on NSTT, SSTT and SNTT from the past 30 years. We specifically discuss core drivers and inhibitors of technology transfer and cooperation, outcomes as well as outcome determinants. We find policies and practices for low carbon development to be the main driver, both pushed by governments and international aid programs, as well as by firms that are interested in expanding overseas. Inhibitors include a non-existent market in the host countries and the abundance of cheap fossil fuel resources that price out renewables. The literature is divided on whether intellectual property rights are inhibitors or drivers of technology transfer to the Global South. Outcomes of technology transfer and cooperation are mixed with approximately one-third of instances reported as successful technology transfer and another one-third reported as failures. Core key success factors were identified as suitable government policies as well as adequate capacities in the recipient country. This analysis is then followed by an introduction of the papers of the special issue 'South-South Technology Transfer and Cooperation for Low Carbon Energy Technologies'. Finally, a research agenda for future work on NSTT, SSTT and SNTT is proposed.","[Kirchherr, Julian] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Urban, Frauke] Univ London, SOAS, London, England",Utrecht University; University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Kirchherr, J (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Utrecht, Netherlands.",j.kirchherr@uu.nl,"Dijkstra, Tim/Z-1876-2019",,ESRC [ES/J01320X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,88,38,38,7,50,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2018,119.0,,,,,,600,609,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.001,0.0,,,19,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO0XY,,"Green Accepted, hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439671200056,0

An online survey of 526 Turkish households in 2014 gathered data on current habits including peak hour use, energy labeling, standby use, willingness for behavioral change, and policy options they would like to see implemented to improve energy efficiency. The results indicate the awareness level of energy efficiency among Turkish households is quite low, and should be promoted by demand side programs. Two-step cluster analysis is used to construct clusters to group households with respect to their policy preferences. Four different clusters are identified and characteristics of these clusters suggest the importance of having unique intervention strategies for successful behavioral change and for the attainment of energy efficiency.","[Tumbaz, Meryem N.

Our analysis of utility-scale PV projects procured through major auctions in developing countries between 2013 and 2016 reveals that low PV prices are viable. PV prices of $0.06-0.08/kWh are consistent with market fundamentals and prices lower than $0.03/kWh are viable under exceptional conditions in some countries. Maintaining low prices while ensuring deployment of quality projects requires a combination of high capacity factors, low equipment prices, low cost of capital, de-risked investment environments, e.g., through the presence of guarantees, and other factors such as particular project developer strategies. Overall, developing countries with abundant local solar resources are well-positioned to drive the global expansion of PV capacity. Well-designed auctions offer a unique opportunity to expand solar PV capacity to many markets in a cost-effective manner.","[Dobrotkova, Zuzana; Audinet, Pierre] World Bank, 1818H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Surana, Kavita] Univ Maryland, Sch Publ Policy, Ctr Global Sustainabil, 2101 Van Munching Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",The World Bank; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Surana, K (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Sch Publ Policy, Ctr Global Sustainabil, 2101 Van Munching Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",zdobrotkova@worldbank.org; ksurana@umd.edu; paudinet@worldbank.org,,"Surana, Kavita/0000-0003-2424-7406",The World Bank,The World Bank,"This work was supported by The World Bank.

However, we hold that besides this pure age effect other cultural elements should be considered in order to understand and forecast energy-related choices. Individuals react to the pressure of several factors that define the concept of energy culture (Stephenson et al., 2015), among which are sociodemographic and economic transformations and changes in lifestyle and pro-environmental attitudes. In this paper, we analyse the use of fuels for private mobility in Italy. In our view, this case is particularly interesting because of the country's very high car and motorcycle ownership rates and the very fast ageing of its population. Because of this demographic shift, various generations coexist and a relevant share of the elderly population are still driving a car. We use several waves of the Italian Household Budget Survey to run a double-hurdle model augmented by age and cohort effects. According to our estimates, baby boomers exhibit a positive cohort effect, so that their transport fuel expenditure is significantly higher compared with younger generations. We interpret this result as a confirmation of evolving generational energy culture towards a sustainable transport system, speeding up the decarbonisation process.","[Bardazzi, Rossella; Pazienza, Maria Grazia] Univ Florence, Dept Econ & Management, Via Pandette 21, I-50127 Florence, Italy",University of Florence,"Bardazzi, R (通讯作者)，Univ Florence, Dept Econ & Management, Via Pandette 21, I-50127 Florence, Italy.",Rossella.bardazzi@unifi.it; Mariagrazia.pazienza@unifi.it,"Bardazzi, Rossella/A-6614-2016","Bardazzi, Rossella/0000-0002-4495-8945; Pazienza, Maria Grazia/0000-0002-9504-6313",,,,,42,18,18,0,27,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUN,2018,117.0,,,,,,396,405,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.03.026,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GF4KU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431932600039,0

While there is a longstanding literature relating to fuel poverty and increasingly energy justice, there remains little evidence which explores its link with the urban form. Specifically, the purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between the urban consolidation hypothesis and the cultivation of energy justice in Australia. This study uses data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey (years 2007-2014), a national probability sample and indefinite life panel. The substantive findings of this study demonstrate that for low income and renting households greater urban density corresponds to a higher likelihood of experiencing fuel poverty. Further, for households with a dwelling type described as an apartment (two or three storeys) there is a separate and quite generalisable indication that this type of dwelling is associated with a lower likelihood of experiencing fuel poverty. This study connects the debate regarding urban consolidation and energy consumption to the fuel poverty and energy justice literature. Alongside this contribution, this study also provides policymakers and planners with new evidence to inform remediation policies that are directed at supporting the fuel poor.","[Poruschi, Lavinia] CSIRO Land & Water, Ecosci Precinct, 41 Boggo Rd, Dutton Pk, Qld 4102, Australia; [Poruschi, Lavinia] Griffith Univ, Cities Res Inst, Sir Samuel Griffith Ctr N78 3 28, Nathan Campus,170 Kessels Rd, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia; [Ambrey, Christopher L.] Inst Social Sci Res, Cycad Bldg 1018,80 Meiers Rd, Indooroopilly, Qld 4068, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Griffith University,"Poruschi, L (通讯作者)，CSIRO Land & Water, Ecosci Precinct, GPO Box 2583, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",lavinia.poruschi@csiro.au; c.ambrey@uq.edu.au,,"Ambrey, Christopher/0000-0002-3790-7509; Poruschi, Lavinia/0000-0002-5109-9202","School of Environment, Griffith University [ENV1010-APDLP]; Australian Government Department of Social Services (DSS)","School of Environment, Griffith University(Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus); Australian Government Department of Social Services (DSS)(Australian Government)","This research wasconducted as part of a PhD project funded by the School of Environment, Griffith University, project fund: ENV1010-APDLP.

Yet infrastructure projects in Africa have been frequently shown to fail because planners have neglected their sociopolitical realm. Using the social science literature, this paper derives six political factors that are crucial for African electrification, and incorporates them into a linear, renewable-energy focused bi-criteria optimisation planning model of the African electricity network. The results reveal a significant degree of preventable political risk in the network if the only optimisation criterion is cost minimisation. This cost-minimal solution highly depends on large-scale exports from some of Africa's most politically volatile countries, such as hydroelectric energy from the Democratic Republic of Congo and wind energy from Sudan, Somalia, Chad and Mauritania. However, the model demonstrates that raising the levelised cost of electrification in 2030 by 4% allows to cut preventable political risks of the network by 50%. Crucially, the optimal, most cost-effective risk mitigation strategy is to gradually replace large-scale exports with domestic solar energy abundant in most African countries. High solar energy shares increase national energy sovereignty, meet international climate commitments, and decrease the network's dependence on politically unstable and/or inefficacious countries for generation and transmission.","[Trotter, Philipp A.; McManus, Marcelle C.] Univ Bath, Dept Mech Engn, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Maconachie, Roy] Univ Bath, Dept Social & Policy Sci, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England",University of Bath; University of Bath,"Trotter, PA (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Dept Mech Engn, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",p.trotter@bath.ac.uk,"McManus, Marcelle C/C-6828-2009; Trotter, Philipp/T-6260-2019","Trotter, Philipp/0000-0003-0590-4546",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/M507982/1],Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"The authors would like to acknowledge excellent comments and suggestions from Catherine Boone, Evelyn Frank and Hans Pirnay.

Simulations are developed to estimate a range in supply potential and costs across a broad range of sensitivity scenarios, including (1) different biomass availability rates based on observed roundwood removals, (2) renewable energy targets set nationally or at a state-level, (3) with and without biomass sourcing restrictions within a state, (4) with and without access to public lands, and (5) policy restrictions on eligible facility types. Under the least restrictive policy scenario (a hypothetical national mandate), total supply is 8.8 million dry tons (MDT) at $20/DT and increases to 32.5 MDT at $80/DT. Results fall within the range of previous logging residue supply studies in the U.S., including the last two Billion Ton reports. Results from this paper offer important policy insight into the potential cost efficiency of a flexible policy design. Sensitivity scenarios show potential supply cost increases that could result from policies imposing regional restrictions, limiting access to public lands, and restricting eligible facilities. Restricting biomass supply sources within state boundaries reduces total supply up to 10% relative to an unrestricted national policy.","[Baker, Justin S.; Crouch, Adam; Cai, Yongxia; Jones, Jason; Latane, Annah] RTI Int, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Latta, Greg] Univ Idaho, Nat Resources & Soc, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Ohrel, Sara] US EPA, Washington, DC 20004 USA",Research Triangle Institute; Idaho; University of Idaho; United States Environmental Protection Agency,"Baker, JS (通讯作者)，RTI Int, 3040 E Cornwallis Rd, Durham, NC 27709 USA.",justinbaker@rti.org,,"Cai, Yongxia/0000-0002-1954-269X; Latane, Annah/0000-0002-6786-7747; Baker, Justin/0000-0002-9914-8421; Jones, Jason/0000-0002-0194-9512",U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) [EP-BPA-12-H-0023],U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)(United States Environmental Protection Agency),"This paper was supported by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (Contract EP-BPA-12-H-0023, Call Order # EP-B15H-0143 and Call Order # EP-B16H-00029).

Using insights from expert interviews, it highlights multiple trade-offs between innovative pricing approaches and regulatory principles which might be resolved by a political decision on how the costs should be recovered or socialised. It then identifies four essentials for a successful implementation of a new mechanism: (1) Closer collaboration between TSO and DNO/DSO concerning local dispatch to improve system efficiency. (ii) Installation of smart meters to collect data providing information about the actual contribution to the grid utilisation of each customer. (iii) Intensified cooperation between supplier and DNO/DSO to pass-through the price signal on the electricity bill. (iv) A legislative framework to facilitate data sharing and data management and communication among network stakeholders - essentially a relaxation of current privacy legislation as an enabler for new approaches to network management, and potentially to reduce costs to the consumer. This suggests the focus for future network pricing should be on services and functions provided by the grid rather than on the commodity power itself.","[Faerber, Laura Antonia] Advisory House GmbH, Malkastenstr 17, D-40211 Dusseldorf, Germany; [Balta-Ozkan, Nazmiye] Cranfield Univ, Sch Water Energy & Environm, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England; [Connor, Peter M.] Univ Exeter, Penryn Campus,Treliever Rd, Penryn TR10 9FE, Cornwall, England",Cranfield University; University of Exeter,"Balta-Ozkan, N (通讯作者)，Cranfield Univ, Sch Water Energy & Environm, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England.",n.ozkan@cranfield.ac.uk,"Connor, Peter M/C-6080-2009","ozkan, nazmiye/0000-0002-2848-5535",,,,,50,23,23,3,25,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAY,2018,116.0,,,,,,210,219,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.02.010,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GD8JH,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430758200022,0

Lacking economically viable storage options, renewable energy integration is possible thanks to the presence of modem mid-merit fossil-based technologies, which act as back-up capacity. This paper discusses the role of modem fossil-based power generation technologies in supporting renewable energy investments. We study the deployment of these two technologies conditional on all other drivers in 26 OECD countries between 1990 and 2013. We show that moving from the first to the third quartile of the distribution of modem fossil technologies is associated with an increase in yearly renewable energy investment of between 6 and 14 kW per thousand people, on average and ceteris paribus. This is a sizeable effect, considering that average yearly renewable capacity addition in our sample are around 12 kW per thousand people. These findings are robust to different econometric specifications, various definitions of modern fossil technologies and are stronger for wind, which is more intermittent and for which the mismatch between supply and demand is more marked. Our analysis points to the substantial indirect costs of renewable energy integration and highlights the complementarity of investments in different generation technologies for a successful decarbonization process.","[Verdolini, Elena] FEEM, Corso Magenta 63, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Verdolini, Elena] Fdn Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, Milan, Italy; [Vona, Francesco] Univ Cote Azur GREDEG, OFCE Sci Po, Nice, France; [Vona, Francesco] Univ Cote Azur GREDEG, SKEMA Business Sch, Nice, France; [Popp, David] Syracuse Univ, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Popp, David] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Fondazione Mattei; Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); Universite Cote d'Azur; SKEMA Business School; Universite Cote d'Azur; Syracuse University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Verdolini, E (通讯作者)，FEEM, Corso Magenta 63, I-20123 Milan, Italy.;Verdolini, E (通讯作者)，Fdn CMCC, Corso Magenta 63, I-20123 Milan, Italy.",elena.verdolini@feem.it,"Vona, Francesco/ABE-8328-2020","Vona, Francesco/0000-0002-2112-5537",European Union's Seventh Framework Programme [308481]; Horizon Research and Innovation Programme [730403]; European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) [320278],European Union's Seventh Framework Programme(European Union (EU)); Horizon Research and Innovation Programme; European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)(European Union (EU)),"Elena Verdolini gratefully acknowledges funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme under grant agreement No 308481 (ENTRACTE) and from the Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under grant agreement No 730403 (INNOPATHS).

This study investigated the water, energy and emissions nexus (WEEN), focusing on end-of pipe treatment technologies for the coal-fired power industry in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. The result revealed that the energy consumption for pollutant removal was 1.2 million tons coal equivalent (Mtce) for the 118 investigated plants in 2014. Of the energy consumed, 60%, 11% and 29% was used for SO2, NOx, and dust removal, respectively. Water consumption for pollutant removal was 13% of total water consumption for electricity generation. The result implied that this policy could reduce SO2, NOx, and dust emissions by 89%, 90%, and 88%, respectively, while consuming an average of 2% less energy and 8% more water as tradeoffs. Construction cost associated with implementing these technology changes could be as high as 5-14 billion yuan in total.

National Standard V of gasoline and diesel will be put into effect by 2018. However, as most of the gasoline and diesel are supplied by domestic refineries, whether the domestic refineries are capable to produce National Standard V products remains a question. This paper develops a mix integer programming model for long-term development route of refining industry in China from 2015 to 2050. The model provides optimal route of refinery construction, upgrading and retirement under different scenarios. Three scenarios are designed to discuss the mutual influence between long-term development of refining industry and fuel quality standard implementation. In the three scenarios, the schedule of 100%-National-Standard-V refining capacity target should be realized by 2018, 2030 and 2040 respectively. Based on the modeling results, we conclude that the 100%-National-Standard-V target by 2018 is difficult to realize. Putting off the schedule to 2030 is more practical in consideration of the current situation in China. To realize the 2030 target, extra investment for building new refineries and upgrading existing ones is needed in short term. However, impulse investment will result in over-capacity problem in the future.","[Pan, Lingying] Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol, Business Sch, Shanghai 200093, Peoples R China; [Liu, Pei; Li, Zheng] Tsinghua Univ, Tsinghua BP Clean Energy Ctr, Dept Energy & Power Engn, State Key Lab Power Syst, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",University of Shanghai for Science & Technology; Tsinghua University,"Liu, P (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Tsinghua BP Clean Energy Ctr, Dept Energy & Power Engn, State Key Lab Power Syst, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",liu_pei@tsinghua.edu.cn,"Li, Zheng/E-7840-2011; Liu, Pei/C-4913-2011","Li, Zheng/0000-0002-1518-5605; Liu, Pei/0000-0002-6854-4333",BP Company; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71704110]; State Key Lab of Power Systems [SKLD16KZ10]; Funding Program for Young Faculty of Shanghai Education Committee [ZZslg16021]; Funding Program for Young Faculty of USST,BP Company; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); State Key Lab of Power Systems; Funding Program for Young Faculty of Shanghai Education Committee; Funding Program for Young Faculty of USST,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from BP Company in the scope of the Phase III Collaboration between BP and Tsinghua University, the funding from National Natural Science Foundation of China (Program No. 71704110), State Key Lab of Power Systems (Program No. SKLD16KZ10), the Funding Program for Young Faculty of Shanghai Education Committee (Program No. ZZslg16021), and the Funding Program for Young Faculty of USST.",,29,8,8,2,47,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAR,2018,114.0,,,,,,403,412,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.12.010,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FW0DY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000424962800037,0

We compare two types of contracts: a deforestation based contract and a policy-based contract. Each of them implies a dramatically different information rent/efficiency trade-off due to domestic implementation and transaction costs. If the contract is deforestation-based (resp. policy-based), information rents are awarded to countries with the ex ante lowest (resp. highest) intended deforestation. We show that a general contract can be offered to recipient countries in which the type of instrument proposed is endogenous, independent of the historical trend, unlike the current REDD+ mechanism.

In this study, six experts were involved in order to determine the degree of direct influence between two factors through a pairwise comparison. The results revealed that the top three important criteria affecting consumers in buying green products are environmental attitude (E), safety and health concerns (B) and green product management (G), respectively. Furthermore, a cause and effect relation diagram was also constructed to gain a better understanding of the interactive relationship between those criteria. It was found that subjective norm (F) has the most influence on other factors, whereas perception on environmental concerns (A) gets the most impact from other factors.

Results show that the effect of road infrastructure investment was significant but accompanied by a strong polarization between north and south (also emerging from non-parametric analysis) that it failed to prevent, possibly because investment in the south was not large enough to close the accessibility gap with the centre-north, a gap that appears to persist during the subsequent years.","[Cosci, Stefania] LUMSA Univ, Dept Law, Rome, Italy; [Mirra, Loredana] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Econ & Finance, Rome, Italy",Universita LUMSA; University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Mirra, L (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Econ & Finance, Rome, Italy.",s.cosci@lumsa.it; loredana.mirra@uniroma2.it,"Mirra, Loredana/GON-4575-2022","Mirra, Loredana/0000-0001-8386-2439; COSCI, Stefania/0000-0002-8120-8887",,,,,55,29,33,1,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The author notes that infrastructure projects on railway transport have high capital intensity, complex engineering, technical, organizational and legal structures. The implementation of such projects requires the use of professional experience and knowledge in the field of attracting investments, application of public-private partnership mechanisms, taking into account industry features of infrastructure facilities and project management, and digital orientation of the modern economy. Deep transformations caused by the processes of digitalization of the world economy require a new vision of problems, innovative forms and methods of economic activity to improve the efficiency of the implementation of transport infrastructure projects. The globalization of the economy is an objective process that encompasses all aspects of society, opening up new opportunities for individual and group interaction. Globalization requires new rules of the game and values influencing the activity of transport organizations, creating new mechanisms of interaction between economic and social development. All of these requires from transport organizations innovation, flexibility and the ability to adapt to the new economic environment of the world economy. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the aspects of project management in the railway transport related to the development of the information society and the widespread use of information and communication technologies in the context of globalization and the digital transformation of the economy.","[Davydov, Stanislav] Emperor Alexander I St Petersburg State Transport, Fac Econ & Managment, Dept Transport Econ, 9 Moscovskiy Pr, St Petersburg 190031, Russia",Emperor Alexander I St. Petersburg State Transport University,"Davydov, S (通讯作者)，Emperor Alexander I St Petersburg State Transport, Fac Econ & Managment, Dept Transport Econ, 9 Moscovskiy Pr, St Petersburg 190031, Russia.",davstas@gmail.com; aspasskova@mail.ru,"Davydov, Stanislav/HNP-5310-2023",,,,,,18,0,0,0,7,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,2029,2036,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300259,0

Since the 1960s, there has been a large decrease in social capital in the USA as well as a considerable inflow of immigrants. This increased heterogeneity of US cities may have increased the cost of investing in social capital, and thereby, reduced such investment. By using the current population survey September Volunteer Supplement for 2005-2011, we examine the relationship between the proportion of foreign-born people and social capital investment by US-born individuals, proxied by volunteering. Once we correct for immigrants' self-selection to different destinations using a supply-push instrumental variable, we find that a 1 standard deviation increase in the proportion of foreign-born individuals in a state reduces the probability of US-born individuals volunteering by 0.09-0.15 standard deviations and cuts number of hours volunteered by 0.13-0.21 standard deviations.","[Freire, Tiago] Univ Canberra, Fac Business Govt & Law, Locked Bag 1, Bruce, ACT 2601, Australia; [Li, Xiaoye] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Int Business Sch, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",University of Canberra; Sun Yat Sen University,"Freire, T (通讯作者)，Univ Canberra, Fac Business Govt & Law, Locked Bag 1, Bruce, ACT 2601, Australia.",tiago@tiagofreire.com,"Freire, Tiago/C-1035-2018","Freire, Tiago/0000-0001-7840-7431",,,,,29,3,4,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Today, tourism is one of the key pillars of the EU strategy for jobs and inclusive growth. The harnessing of tourism positive contribution to sustainable development and the mitigation of the sectoral potential adverse effects call for strong partnerships and decisive action by all tourism stakeholders in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Countries lack frameworks to capture, aggregate and report on the full economic, social and environmental impacts of tourism. In Slovakia, tourism destinations play a more significant role in achieving the goals of sustainable development, they must be able to measure their progress, benchmark themselves against comparable destinations and incrementally improve their performance. The aim of the article is to examine the frameworks to measure the role of tourism in sustainable development and its possible transition from global to local level. Sustainable development of tourism is most commonly measured using the indicators of sustainable development. To analyse the application of frameworks to measure the role of tourism, the Delphi method is used which relies on a panel of experts. The article deals with the framework for measuring sustainable development of tourism using indicators and its possible application in Slovak destinations.","[Gucik, Marian; Marcis, Matus] Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Tajoyskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia",Matej Bel University,"Marcis, M (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Tajoyskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia.",marian.gucik@umb.sk; matus.marcis@umb.sk,"Marciš, Matúš/AAA-5059-2020","Marciš, Matúš/0000-0002-4860-3105",[VEGA 1/0809/17],,This paper is supported by the grant VEGA 1/0809/17 Reengineering of destination management organisations and good destination governance conformed to principles of sustainable development.,,23,0,0,0,3,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,2524,2531,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300323,0

Moreover, the Atacama Desert exhibits further advantageous conditions with 7 kWh/(m(2)d), clear skies and a large energy-consuming mining industry. Since 2012 the solar sector takes off, totalizing over 1600 MW, of solar power and about 100 MWt of solar heat installed by the end of 2016. However, only about 10% of the filed projects are operative; many barriers are slowing down the further development of solar technologies. While several barrier studies for solar technologies exist in the literature, they are often country-specific and there is no publication found regarding the Chilean solar sector. In the present paper, the barriers obstructing the way of Chile becoming a solar power country are found through interviews and then analyzed and classified into six groups (economic, market, system integration, technical, regulatory and information barriers). For these barriers, an overview of emerging mitigation options are provided and future solutions, including opportunities for research, are proposed.","[Haas, Jannik; Palma-Behnke, Rodrigo; Valencia, Felipe; Araya, Paz; Diaz-Ferran, Gustavo; Diaz, Manuel; Puschel, Sebastian; Roman, Roberto; Jimenez-Estevez, Guillermo] Univ Chile, Dept Elect Engn, Energy Ctr, Santiago 2007, Chile; [Haas, Jannik] Univ Stuttgart, Dept Stochast Simulat & Safety Res Hydrosyst IWS, Pfaffenwaldring 5A, Stuttgart, Germany; [Telsnig, Thomas; Eltrop, Ludger] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Energy Econ & Rational Energy Use, Hessbruhlstr 49a, Stuttgart, Germany; [Grandel, Matthias] Deutsch Gesell Int Zusammenarbeit GIZ GmbH, Marchant Pereira 150, Santiago, Chile; [Grandel, Matthias] Univ Appl Sci Biberach, Energy Econ, Karlstr 11, Biberach, Germany; [Diaz-Ferran, Gustavo; Roman, Roberto] Univ Chile, Dept Mech Engn, Beauchef 851, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Chile; University of Stuttgart; University of Stuttgart; Universidad de Chile,"Haas, J (通讯作者)，Univ Stuttgart, Dept Stochast Simulat & Safety Res Hydrosyst IWS, Pfaffenwaldring 5A, Stuttgart, Germany.",jhaas@ing.uchile.cl,"Haas, Jannik/Y-6791-2019; Jimenez, Guillermo A/C-4085-2015; Palma-Behnke, Rodrigo/A-1849-2012; /AAD-1997-2020; Haas, Jannik/P-6845-2016; Araya, Paz/GXI-0042-2022; Valencia, Felipe/H-7157-2018","Haas, Jannik/0000-0003-2604-6456; Palma-Behnke, Rodrigo/0000-0002-7508-0944; Haas, Jannik/0000-0003-2604-6456; Valencia, Felipe/0000-0002-1747-4021; Araya, Paz/0000-0002-5694-6634; Eltrop, Ludger/0000-0002-1721-7607; Jimenez-Estevez, Guillermo/0000-0002-8044-0713",Chilean Council of Scientific and Technological Research through the Solar Energy Research Center SERC-Chile [CONICYT/FONDAP/15110019]; Chilean Council of Scientific and Technological Research through Solar Mining project [Program for International Cooperation] [CONICYT-BMBF/20140019],Chilean Council of Scientific and Technological Research through the Solar Energy Research Center SERC-Chile; Chilean Council of Scientific and Technological Research through Solar Mining project [Program for International Cooperation],"The authors thank the support of the Chilean Council of Scientific and Technological Research through the Solar Energy Research Center SERC-Chile [CONICYT/FONDAP/15110019] and the Solar Mining project [Program for International Cooperation/CONICYT-BMBF/20140019], the European Union through the project STAGE-STE, the BHP Billiton Foundation through the project Ayllu Solar, Monique Marquez in language editing, and Gerrit Haas for his help in Fig. 2.",,82,49,52,1,32,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JAN,2018,112.0,,,,,,399,414,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.10.001,0.0,,,16,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FO2NK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416615800040,0

Spatially dependent choices frequently arise in various modeling scenarios, including situations involving analysis of regional voting behavior, decisions by states or cities to change tax rates relative to neighboring jurisdictions, decisions by households to move or stay in a particular location. We use county-level voting results from the 2004 presidential election as an illustrative example of some issues that arise when drawing inferences from spatial probit model estimates. Although the voting example holds particular intuitive appeal that allows us to focus on interpretive issues, there are numerous other situations where these same considerations come into play. Past work regarding Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo estimation of spatial probit models from LeSage and Pace (Introduction to spatial econometrics. Taylor and Francis, New York, 2009) is used, as well as derivations from LeSage et al. (J R Stat Soc Ser A Stat Soc 174(4):1007-1027, 2011) regarding proper interpretation of the partial derivative impacts from changes in the explanatory variables on the probability of voting for a candidate. As in the case of conventional probit models, the effects arising from changes in the explanatory variables depend in a nonlinear way on the levels of these variables. In non-spatial probit regressions, a common way to explore the nonlinearity in this relationship is to calculate marginal effects estimates using particular values of the explanatory variables (e.g., mean values or quintile intervals). The motivation for this practice is consideration of how the impact of changing explanatory variable values varies across the range of values encompassed by the sample data. Given the nonlinear nature of the normal cumulative density function transform on which the (non-spatial) probit model relies, we know that changes in explanatory variable values near the mean may have a very different impact on decision probabilities than changes in very low or high values. For spatial probit regression models, the effects or impacts from changes in the explanatory variables are more highly nonlinear. In addition, since spatial models rely on observations that each represent a location or region located on a map, the levels of the explanatory variables can be viewed as varying over space. We discuss important implications of this for proper interpretation of spatial probit regression models in the context of our election application.","[Lacombe, Donald J.] West Virginia Univ, Reg Res Inst, Dept Agr & Resource Econ & Econ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [LeSage, James P.] Texas State Univ San Marcos, Dept Finance & Econ, McCoy Coll Business Adm, Fields Chair Urban & Reg Econ, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA",West Virginia University; Texas State University System; Texas State University San Marcos,"Lacombe, DJ (通讯作者)，West Virginia Univ, Reg Res Inst, Dept Agr & Resource Econ & Econ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",donald.lacombe@mail.wvu.edu; jlesage@spatial-econometrics.com,,,"National Science Foundation [SES-0729264, BCS-0136229]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"James P.

After the energy reform in Mexico, efficient cogeneration plants can generate and trade Clean Energy Certificates, to the extent a certain efficiency threshold is exceeded. According to official planning documents, a significant fraction of Mexico's targeted clean power production is expected to come from efficient cogeneration; this assumption is critically examined. The official methodology for determining clean power contributions from cogeneration is studied in detail, and the expected clean electricity fractions for several case studies are calculated. The efficiency figures determined in this step are then combined with an assessment of the potential for cogeneration in Mexico, the current installed cogeneration capacity, and the official growth figures, in order to estimate the expected clean power contribution from efficient cogeneration through 2030. Since the clean power fraction from cogeneration is determined through an accounting procedure it is potentially prone to data mishandling or even manipulation. It is concluded that significant possibilities for accounting failures exist and that efficient cogeneration plants generating Clean Energy Certificates should be equipped with a continuous monitoring system to ensure correct accounting.","[Llamas, Armando; Probst, Oliver] Tecnol Monterrey, Escuela Ingn & Ciencias, Eugenio Garza Sada 2501 Sur, Monterrey 64849, NL, Mexico",Tecnologico de Monterrey,"Probst, O (通讯作者)，Tecnol Monterrey, Escuela Ingn & Ciencias, Eugenio Garza Sada 2501 Sur, Monterrey 64849, NL, Mexico.",oprobst@itesm.mx,,"Llamas, Armando/0000-0002-4776-9509; Probst, Oliver/0000-0003-0075-8295",focus group on energy and climate change at the School of Engineering and Sciences at Tecnologico de Monterrey,focus group on energy and climate change at the School of Engineering and Sciences at Tecnologico de Monterrey,Support from the focus group on energy and climate change at the School of Engineering and Sciences at Tecnologico de Monterrey is gratefully acknowledged.

The most significant effects will be created in infrastructure industries that include transport. Nowadays transport industry in Russia is at the beginning of digitalization process. There is a necessity of rapid information technologies implementation in different transport systems. JSC Russian Railways has developed a project Digital Railway which determines main directions of digital technologies strategic development in transportation. These new technologies provide not only internal efficiency growth (deserted and resource-saving technologies, transport infrastructure monitoring systems, safety technologies), but also the growth of transport services quality and customer focus (virtual and cloud client services, online sales, special mobile applications for transportation planning and travel time assessment). Particular interest is related to digital technologies implementation in passenger transport. The result of passenger transport digitalization is the emergence of intermodal transport systems that provide high degree of passenger transport modes cooperation. These systems are based on transport modes specialization, which ensures the effective way of available resources allocation, travel time economy and market demand satisfaction with high level of transport services quality. To create intermodal transport systems, it is necessary to apply digital technologies. For example, Big Data to analyze the intensity of passenger traffic on the route, simulation to determine capacity requirements. Digitalization transforms the model of transport services market and lead to a new ways of interaction between transport companies, infrastructure providers and passengers.","[Lyakina, Maria; Volkova, Elena] Emperor Alexander I St Petersburg State Transport, Fac Econ & Managment, Dept Transport Econ, 9 Moscovskiy Pr, St Petersburg 190031, Russia; [Tretyak, Vladimir] Russ Univ Transport RUT MIIT, Dept Transport Econ & Management, 22 Ul Novokuchevskaj, Moscow 103030, Russia",Emperor Alexander I St. Petersburg State Transport University,"Lyakina, M (通讯作者)，Emperor Alexander I St Petersburg State Transport, Fac Econ & Managment, Dept Transport Econ, 9 Moscovskiy Pr, St Petersburg 190031, Russia.",malyakina@mail.ru; moonlight34@ya.ru; v_tretyak@inbox.ru,"Lyakina, Maria/E-2129-2017; Volkova, Elena M/E-4511-2017",,,,,,26,0,0,0,4,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,2214,2219,,,,,,6,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300283,0

This can happen in various market conditions. Distorted competition affects the balance of negotiating power between negotiating parties and, eventually, the outcome of negotiations. This often affects both buyers and sellers. Such situations open great opportunities for international business relations as new market participants can create additional alternatives for companies and organizations or other business entities by reducing the negative impact the distorted competition makes on the balance of negotiating power between negotiating parties. The assessment of the negotiation powers of the negotiating parties is crucial for the development and implementation of effective international business negotiation strategies in order to make the best use of the negotiation potential - the negotiating power. The object of the research is the search for balance of the negotiating powers at international business negotiations under distorted market competition. The scientific problem is that negotiation theory lacks measures to assess and balance the negotiating powers of negotiation participants under distorted market competition. The goal of the article is to identify the key elements for determining the balance and equilibrium of negotiating powers at international business negotiations, as well as the opportunities for their adequate evaluation and configuration, which affects the conduct and performance of international business negotiations.","[Peleckis, Kestutis; Peleckiene, Valentina; Peleckis, Kestutis K.; Lapinskiene, Giedre] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Av, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Polajeva, Tatjana] Euroakadeemia, Tondi 55, EE-11316 Tallinn, Estonia; [Nedelko, Zlatko; Potocan, Vojko] Univ Maribor, Razlagova 14, SI-2000 Maribor, Slovenia",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; University of Maribor,"Peleckiene, V (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Av, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",kestutis.peleckis@vgtu.lt; valentina.peleckiene@vgtu.lt; k.peleckis@vgtu.lt; giedre.lapinskiene@vgtu.lt; tatjana.polajeva@gmail.com; zlatko.nedelko@uni-mb.si; vojko.potocan@uni-mb.si,"Lapinskienė, Giedrė/HNR-0508-2023; Peleckienė, Valentina/JXN-9424-2024",,,,,,22,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,2743,2750,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300351,0

Three geo-localized databases are here combined into a circular-flow template from former consumer spending to the final wage income.

Guided by the Design Science Research approach, in this project a programming language and a programming and simulation environment for higher Petri nets has been developed, tested and evaluated. Method and tool are applied to complex simulation problems in production planning and control now. The following results had to be achieved: 1) Schedule-related data like customer orders and their prioritization can be considered now. 2) Various production strategies such as push or pull can be applied. 3) Complex data types including date and time information are supported. 4) Working time and downtime of machines can be imported from external data sources like an MES in order to calculate productivity measures like an OEE index. The tool has been developed as a web-based system in order to support mobile use even on the shop floor.

According to neo-classical theory of migration, labour force flows from the areas relatively abundant in labour, where wages are obviously comparably low, to the areas characterised by relative capital abundance, and consequently, relatively high wages. Decline in labour resources and their ageing are going to be the most critical issues of Polish labour market in the nearest perspective. In 2015 there were 23 people aged 65+ per 100 people aged 20-64, whereas it is predicted that in 2060 there will be two and half times more of them. Globalisation processes, political and social changes in Poland, Europe and in Asian countries have affected growth of migration movements of economic character. Shortages of labour resources both in terms of the number of workers and in terms of their qualifications occurred on local labour markets. For many countries, including Poland, inflow of foreigners willing to work is perceived in many situations as specific rescue that allows maintaining appropriate functioning of many economy sectors. The goal of the paper is to analyse the scale and structure of the phenomenon of economic migration in Poland in conditions of globalisation. The paper also attempts to answer the following questions: is the inflow of foreign workers a threat to Polish labour market, or rather an opportunity to increase competitiveness of domestic economy? What are the perspectives in the sphere of employment of foreigners? Does the currently increased interest in migration among citizens from the east (mainly from Ukraine) concern only Poland or does it have a Union-wide dimension?","[Sojka, Elzbieta] Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Stat & Math Methods Econ, 1 Maja 50 St, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Sojka, E (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Stat & Math Methods Econ, 1 Maja 50 St, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland.",elzbieta.sojka@ue.katowice.pl,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,374,381,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300050,0

By applying a conditional slack-based measure (SBM) model, local linear regression (LLR) and a nonparametric significance test, we conduct an empirical analysis based on 262 cities in China during the period of 2005-2012. The results demonstrated that: (1) the overall eco-efficiency of China was low due to the fact that the EEP scores of most of the cities were below 0.5; (2) the eco-efficiency performances of a majority of the municipalities & sub-provincial (M & S) cities were better than those of the prefecture-level cities, and the former showed greater improvements than the latter on eco-efficiency performances, although the M &S cities experienced faster paces of urbanization and consumed more resources; (3) there exists a nonlinear relationship between government transparency and eco-efficiency performance. In other words, if the government information was more transparent, it would be more beneficial to the improvement of eco-efficiency, and the phenomena were more significant in M &S cities such as Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou. Policy implications are thus drawn in this paper for promoting ecoefficiency improvement in China's M &S cities and prefecture-level cities.","[Li, Zhi; Zhao, Yang] Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, China Ctr Energy Econ Res, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Ouyang, Xiaoling] East China Normal Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Du, Kerui] Shandong Univ, Ctr Econ Res, Jinan 250100, Shandong, Peoples R China",Xiamen University; East China Normal University; Shandong University,"Ouyang, XL (通讯作者)，East China Normal Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.;Du, KR (通讯作者)，Shandong Univ, Ctr Econ Res, Jinan 250100, Shandong, Peoples R China.",xlouyang@jjx.ecnu.edu.cn; kerrydu1986@gmail.com,"Du, Kerui/JNT-5681-2023; Ouyang, Xiaoling/GLU-3178-2022","Du, Kerui/0000-0001-7388-7018","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71603084, 71603148]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2016M590627, 2017T100480]; Ministry of Education of China [16YJC790078, 14YJC630026 17YJC790068]; Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation, China [ZR2016GB10]; Shanghai Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science [2016EJB003]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2017ECNU-HWFW033, 2016zk017]; Shanghai Pujiang Program [14PJC027]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation, China(Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province); Shanghai Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Shanghai Pujiang Program(Shanghai Pujiang Program)","We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the Editor and anonymous referees for their insightful and constructive comments.

Scenario analysis by 2030 suggests that implementing the INDC could consolidate a transition from the baseline trajectory, which is mainly derived from improved energy efficiency and decarbonization of electricity. The 2030 target is still technically feasible even if nuclear power is constrained or totally phased-out by 2030, based on additional deployment of renewable energies. However, these pathways incur carbon price hikes of over 160 US$/t-CO2, and need effective policy supports. Over the long-term, pathways that meet both 2030 and 2050 targets also appear technically feasible, provisional upon additional efforts being made beyond the 2030 target. These pathways also require a huge and rapid transformation in the energy system post-2030, including large-scale deployment of variable renewable energies and carbon capture and storage, and improvement of energy efficiency and electrification. Early actions and policies before 2030, including RD & D in innovative technologies and development of the market would be needed for commercial realization of these options.","[Oshiro, Ken] Mizuho Informat & Res Inst Inc, Environm & Energy Div 1, Tokyo, Japan; [Kainuma, Mikiko] Inst Global Environm Strategies, Hayama, Japan; [Masui, Toshihiko] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Social & Environm Syst Res, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Kainuma, Mikiko] 2108-11 Kamiyamaguchi, Hayama, Kanagawa 2400115, Japan; [Masui, Toshihiko] 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan","Mizuho Research & Technologies, Ltd.; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan","Oshiro, K (通讯作者)，2-3 Kanda Nishikicho,Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1018443, Japan.",ken.oshiro@mizuho-ir.co.jp,"Oshiro, Ken/W-9746-2018","Oshiro, Ken/0000-0001-6720-409X","Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency under Environment Research and Technology Development Fund [2-1402, 2-1702]",Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency under Environment Research and Technology Development Fund,This study was supported by the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency under the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (2-1402 and 2-1702).,,32,32,34,2,34,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2017,110.0,,,,,,581,587,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.09.003,0.0,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FP5LK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417660800058,0

The ARDL bounds tests as well as additional cross-checking test convincingly confirmed long run cointegration between carbon emissions, energy consumption and industrial production in Bangladesh. The industrial production and energy consumption have significant positive impact on the carbon emissions both in the short and long-runs.

The results suggest that non-OECD economies have become the major drivers for the rapid global growth of CO2 emissions after the crisis. More specifically, the increasing consumption and investment of non-OECD economies, as well as stagnation of their emission intensity reductions, have largely contributed to global growth of CO2 emissions after 2009. On the contrary, OECD economies have a less carbon-intensive life style. Coupled with a decrease in investment and stagnation of consumption, the OECD economies have successfully reduced both their production-based and consumption based emissions. However, the magnitude of their reduction is much lower than the increase led by non-OECD economies. In addition, both OECD and non-OECD economies have started to increase their purchases of intermediate and final products from non-OECD economies. Such changes of international trade caused an additional 673 Mt of global emissions from 2008 to 2011. The results of our decomposition provide both worries about and insights into future global climate change mitigation.","[Jiang, Xuemei] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Guan, Dabo] Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",Capital University of Economics & Business; University of East Anglia,"Guan, DB (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",dabo.guan@uea.ac.uk,"Guan, Dabo/Y-2406-2019; Guan, Dexin/I-4184-2018","Guan, Dabo/0000-0003-3773-3403; Jiang, Xuemei/0000-0002-5639-0453","National Natural Science Foundation of China project [71473246, 41629501]; Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality project [9172006]; National Key R & D Program of China [2016YFA0602604]; UK Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L016028/1]; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/N00714X/1]; British Academy Grant [AF150310]; ESRC [ES/L016028/1] Funding Source: UKRI; NERC [NE/N00714X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L016028/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/N00714X/1] Funding Source: researchfish",National Natural Science Foundation of China project(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality project; National Key R & D Program of China; UK Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); British Academy Grant; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"The work was partially funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China project (71473246, 41629501) Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality project (9172006), National Key R & D Program of China (2016YFA0602604), the UK Economic and Social Research Council (ES/L016028/1), Natural Environment Research Council (NE/N00714X/1), and British Academy Grant (AF150310).",,47,74,76,8,90,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,734,746,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.07.058,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400071,0

To understand this kind of decentralized refueling behavior, we surveyed 133 drivers of CNG fleet vehicles at six public stations across the Los Angeles region. Nearly one-third of CNG fleet drivers were solely reliant upon public refueling for their operations. For each driver's refueling trip, we used GIS to compare the chosen station's proximity to the driver's fleet base and their deviation from the shortest path between their previous and next stops relative to all other stations they could have chosen. This revealed-preference approach shows that fleet drivers chose the station with the smallest deviation over the station closest to base by a 6:1 ratio, though this ratio varied by the driver's availability of central refueling and type of vehicle and route. Given that public stations remain essential to meeting decentralized refueling demand for other fleets as well as consumers, these findings have important implications for fleets that are both considering the adoption of CNG vehicles and the additional investment of hosting central refueling infrastructure at their base.","[Kelley, Scott; Kuby, Michael] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Kelley, Scott] Univ Michigan, Energy Inst, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Kelley, S (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.;Kelley, S (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Energy Inst, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",sbkelley@umich.edu; mikekuby@asu.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [1025313]; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1025313] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",This work was supported by the National Science Foundation Grant number 1025313.,,30,11,13,0,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,350,359,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.07.017,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400032,0

Given that network costs are significantly driven by peak capacity requirements, many proposals for more cost-reflective tariffs include a demand (capacity) component. However, there are many complexities in the implementation of such tariffs. This paper first presents a method to visually assess how cost-reflective a particular demand charge network tariffs is. We apply it to a typical demand charge network tariff proposal within the Australian National Electricity Market and actual consumption data of 3876 Sydney households, and find it to have low cost-reflectivity in terms of aligning customer bills with their contribution towards network peak demand. Such misalignment has potentially significant adverse impacts on the economic efficiency of such tariffs an issue that does not appear to have received sufficient policy attention. We then use this assessment method to demonstrate how a demand charge tariff structure can be adjusted to make it significantly more cost-reflective. This method can be applied to any tariff that includes a capacity-based component.","[Passey, Robert; MacGill, Iain] Univ New South Wales, Sch Elect Engn & Telecommun, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Passey, Robert; Haghdadi, Navid; Bruce, Anna] Univ New South Wales, Sch Photovolta & Renewable Energy Engn, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Passey, R (通讯作者)，Univ New South Wales, Sch Elect Engn & Telecommun, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",r.passey@unsw.edu.au,"Haghdadi, Navid/T-5282-2019; Bruce, Anna/B-5646-2009","Haghdadi, Navid/0000-0002-2177-3307; Passey, Robert/0000-0001-5598-7306; Bruce, Anna/0000-0003-1820-4039",Energy Consumers Association of Australia [814],Energy Consumers Association of Australia,"This work was supported by the Energy Consumers Association of Australia, Grant number 814.",,33,63,67,0,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,642,649,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.07.045,0.0,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400062,0

We considered a consumer-choice-based simulation approach, using the MA3T model, to estimate the market acceptance of fuel efficiency (FE) technologies and alternative fuel technologies as reflected by new sales of light-duty vehicle (LDV). Because both full and extremely low FE valuations are common in the literature, we use a moderate assumption of a 10-year perceived vehicle lifetime at a 7% annual discount rate in the baseline and include both extreme views (5 years and 15 years) in the sensitivity analysis. The study focuses on market-driven compliance and therefore excludes manufacturers' cross-subsidization. The model results suggest that the LDV industry is able to comply with both standards even without cross-subsidization and with projected high technology cost, mainly thanks to the multiple credit programs and technology advancements. The compliance robustness, while encouraging, however is based on moderate market assumptions, such as Annual Energy Outlook 2016 Reference oil price projection and moderate FE consumer valuation. Sensitivity analysis results reveal two significant risk factors for compliance: low oil prices and consumers' FE undervaluation.","[Xie, Fei; Lin, Zhenhong] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Natl Transportat Res Ctr, 2360 Cherahala Blvd, Knoxville, TN 37932 USA; [Lin, Zhenhong] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, 851 Neyland Dr, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Lin, ZH (通讯作者)，Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Natl Transportat Res Ctr, 2360 Cherahala Blvd, Knoxville, TN 37932 USA.;Lin, ZH (通讯作者)，Univ Tennessee, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, 851 Neyland Dr, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",xief@ornl.gov; linz@ornl.gov,"Lin, Zhenhong/ISA-9347-2023; Lin, Zhenhong/AAJ-9468-2021","Lin, Zhenhong/0000-0002-4664-8297; Lin, Zhenhong/0000-0002-4664-8297; Xie, Fei/0000-0003-4325-2868",U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC05-000R22725]; U.S. Department of Energy's Vehicle Technologies Office; U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Policy,U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy's Vehicle Technologies Office(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Policy,"This manuscript has been authored by UT-Battelle, LLC under Contract No. DE-AC05-000R22725 with the U.S. Department of Energy.

There is great heterogeneity in reform progress in transition countries, with consequences to service quality in utilities and also the view the population has of such services. This article analyses drivers of reported household satisfaction with the quality of electricity services in 27 countries using cross-section survey data from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Life in Transition Survey II, in a context of improving regulation and infrastructure. An ordinal Random Effects Logit model is estimated, showing that key drivers of reported satisfaction are the uses of electricity within the household and some characteristics such as age and economic conditions of the household. There is no strong evidence of the effect of the state of power sector reform on the opinion of households. However, customers in countries with fully independent regulation are more likely to report higher levels of satisfaction than those in countries with no independent regulation.","[Carvalho, Antonio] Heriot Watt Univ, CEERP, Conoco Bldg, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland",Heriot Watt University,"Carvalho, A (通讯作者)，Heriot Watt Univ, CEERP, Conoco Bldg, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland.",A.Carvalho@hw.ac.uk,,"Carvalho, Antonio/0000-0001-5279-1455",,,,,18,6,7,0,2,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2017,107.0,,,,,,151,157,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.04.040,0.0,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FA0WU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000405158200015,0

This alters the relation between consumers and power generation sites, as generation and consumption spatially converge. It allows for new configurations within the energy sector and provides opportunities for marketing regional energy. We empirically investigate consumer preferences for electricity generation in proximity to end-users, focusing on the proximity of generation and providers, and present representative data for Germany. In a discrete choice experiment, a sample of 780 consumer households and 173 adopters of a renewable energy system (prosumers) chose from a range of different electricity tariffs. We estimate the willingness to pay for the following attributes: shares of regional generation, power providers, and electricity mixes. We find evidence in favor of regional production, but in spite of positive attitudes towards local generation from renewable sources, willingness to pay is not responsive to higher shares of regional generation. In addition, a preference for regional providers exists. The results show that renewable energy mixes are preferred, particularly a solar and hydro mix. Adopters state slightly more distinct preferences as compared to consumer households. Thus, we find there is potential for business models offering regionally generated electricity.","[Kalkbrenner, Bernhard J.; Roosen, Jutta] Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Management, Chair Mkt & Consumer Res, Munich, Germany; [Yonezawa, Koichi] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, New York, NY 10021 USA",Technical University of Munich; Cornell University,"Kalkbrenner, BJ (通讯作者)，TUM Sch Management, Chair Mkt & Consumer Res, Alte Akad 16, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",bernhard.kalkbrenner@tum.de,"Roosen, Jutta/AAN-2079-2021; Yonezawa, Koichi/IWV-2877-2023","Roosen, Jutta/0000-0002-3032-399X; Yonezawa, Koichi/0000-0003-1532-262X","Bavarian Ministry of Economic Affairs and Media, Energy and Technology via EEBatt project","Bavarian Ministry of Economic Affairs and Media, Energy and Technology via EEBatt project","The authors thank the Bavarian Ministry of Economic Affairs and Media, Energy and Technology for their financial support via the EEBatt project.

Traffic safety, vehicle choices and the effect of new corporate average fuel economy standards",RESOURCE AND ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Fuel economy standards; MPG targets; Lightweighting; Traffic safety; Automobile demand,COSTS,"The new Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) Standards increase fuel economy to 54.5 MPG by model year 2025 and determine fuel economy targets based on vehicle sizes. This paper examines the effect of the new CAFE standards on consumer choices and composition of vehicle sales, accounting for the impact of traffic safety. We first formulate and estimate a mixed logit model of consumer demand using micro-level data. Two measures of traffic safety, consumers' safety concerns and traffic fatalities, are included and interacted with two vehicle characteristics that matter most for traffic safety: weight and size. Further, we conduct simulations of three extreme firm responses to assess the potential impact of the new CAFE standards: lightweighting, paying CAFE fines, and size increase. Simulation results suggest that the sales impact will fall almost entirely on the SUV and light truck segments and on US automakers that use lightweighting. Moreover, consumers in states with more traffic fatalities are the most responsive, shifting away from passenger cars. In addition, the new CAFE standards could result in an increase of 8.1 percent in the share of SUV and light trucks, which will cause as many as 347 more equivalent fatalities on roads each year.

We analyse the determinants of environmental innovation intention. We also analyse the effects of environmental innovation behavior on economic performance and environmental performance in different provinces and of different corporate ownership. We find that environmental innovation behavior has a greater effect on environmental performance than economic performance. Innovation in production processes, in particular, positively affects environmental performance for Korean-owned firms in Jiangsu. We also find that wholly Korean-owned firms (WKOEs) are more receptive to environmental innovation than Sino-Korean joint ventures. It is important to enhance environmental innovation within Korean-owned firms in China.

Targeted policies such as Feed-in Tariff (FIT), Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) and Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) are introduced to stimulate renewable energy capacity expansion as well as generation. Currently, Indian power utilities treat RPO targets as a cost-burden, and therefore there is prevalence of non-compliance. Even other policies, such as FIT and RECs, in their present form, have failed to influence increase in renewable electricity supply. This has lead us to raise an important question whether these policies are adequate for building a cost-effective renewable energy-based low carbon electricity system for India. In this paper, we discuss the impact of above targeted policies in increasing the share of renewable electricity generation in the case of Karnataka State Electricity System. Various scenarios are developed and analysed using mixed-integer programming model to study the impacts. The results suggest that optimally managed FTT and REC schemes can provide opportunities for utilities to benefit from reduced costs. Overall, the above policies are inadequate, and introduction of market based incentives, which expand the scope of trading in renewable energy certificates, are essential to achieve the desired objectives.","[Amrutha, A.

The model is run under a wide spectrum of EV uptake scenarios to provide plausible answers to a variety of research, policy and investment questions, including minimum growth rates to break even under current policy. Using real-world data we have confirmed that a financial business opportunity does exist for investment in rapid chargers on main highways and have identified the operating area in which a profit can be made.

Specifically, it investigates the presence of an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) in 17 OECD countries over the period of 1990-2012. The results confirm the existence of an N-shaped EKC relationship between income and environmental degradation. The study offers a novel methodological contribution that makes it possible to explain the environmental pollution process through the analysis of low-carbon technologies. This demonstrates how income levels affect energy consumption and how higher energy demand leads to a larger share of fossil sources in the energy mix and, thus, increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The effect on per capita GHG emissions is explored in a model containing a dampening variable that moderates the relationship between energy consumption and income, This empirical evidence helps to explain the interaction between energy regulation, economic growth and carbon emissions. This study also confirms the positive effect that energy innovation process exerts on environmental pollution.

We examine the impacts on different parties (Distribution Network Operators, wider society and generators). As illustration we use a specific case study. Alternative connection scenarios are proposed (with partial and full interruptible capacity quota under a mix of generation with different technology-specific curtailment levels) for integrating DG units in a constrained area of the East of England covered by the Flexible Plug and Play project. The smart (interruptible) connection option is the preferred option across all the scenarios (higher NPV/MW). The analysis of the distribution of benefits between the different parties suggests that generators capture most of the benefits while DNOs and wider society capture much less benefit. A smart connection incentive, which recreates the benefits to DNOs from an earlier losses incentive, is proposed. By contrast with other societally desirable metrics which are usually incentivised or penalised, there is currently no direct connection between more DG MWs connected and DNO incentive payments. Our proposed smart connection incentive, by charging DG for smarter connection may help to distribute more efficiently the benefits for connecting more DG.","[Anaya, Karim L.; Pollitt, Michael G.] Univ Cambridge, Energy Policy Res Grp, Cambridge, England",University of Cambridge,"Anaya, KL (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Energy Policy Res Grp, Cambridge, England.",k.anaya@jbs.cam.ac.uk; m.pollitt@jbs.cam.ac.uk,,"Anaya, Karim L./0000-0002-3371-3862",UK Power Networks via the Low Carbon Networks Fund's Flexible Plug and Play Project [12-00077],UK Power Networks via the Low Carbon Networks Fund's Flexible Plug and Play Project,"The authors wish to acknowledge the financial support of UK Power Networks via the Low Carbon Networks Fund's Flexible Plug and Play Project (Project agreement ref: 12-00077) and of an anonymous reviewer.

To figure out whether energy-price regulations will benefit China's economy (measured by GDP growth) and environment (measured by carbon emissions), we conducted an in-depth simulation using path analysis, where five energy products (natural gas, gasoline, fuel oil, steam coal, and coking coal) are selected and three measurements (absolute, relative, and moving) of energy-price distortions are calculated. The results indicate that, with a series of energy pricing policies, the price distortion for a single type of energy has gradually transformed, while the energy pricing system in China is not fully market-oriented yet. Furthermore, China's economy benefits from relative and moving distortions, while the absolute distortions of energy prices have negative impacts on economic growth. Finally, with regard to the environment, carbon emissions call for fewer distortions.","[Ju, Keyi; Wu, Junmin] Jiangsu Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Econ & Management, 2 Mengxi Rd, Zhenjiang 212003, Peoples R China; [Ju, Keyi; Su, Bin] Natl Univ Singapore, Energy Studies Inst, 29 Heng Mui Keng Terrace, Singapore 119620, Singapore; [Ju, Keyi; Zhou, Dequn] Res Ctr Soft Energy Sci, 29 Yudao St, Nanjing 210016, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Jiangsu University of Science & Technology; National University of Singapore,"Ju, KY (通讯作者)，Jiangsu Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Econ & Management, 2 Mengxi Rd, Zhenjiang 212003, Peoples R China.",jky1983@163.com,"SU, BIN/B-7990-2011; YI, J/JJE-7713-2023; Zhou, Dequn/ABE-6579-2020; dequn, zhou/ABE-6699-2020","SU, BIN/0000-0003-4273-7054;","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71203081, 71203055, 71403131, 71573121]; Ph.D. Programs Foundation of Ministry of Education of China [2014M551591]; Humanities and Social Sciences Research Foundation of the Ministry of Education [16YJC630133]; Key Projects of Philosophy and Social Science Research in Universities of Jiangsu Province [2014ZDIXM038]; 333 Engineering Research Projects [BRA 2015332]; Talent Project of Jiangsu University of Science and Technology [35041201]; Graduate Innovation Foundation of Jiangsu University of Science and Technology [YSJ15S-15]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ph.D. Programs Foundation of Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Humanities and Social Sciences Research Foundation of the Ministry of Education; Key Projects of Philosophy and Social Science Research in Universities of Jiangsu Province; 333 Engineering Research Projects; Talent Project of Jiangsu University of Science and Technology; Graduate Innovation Foundation of Jiangsu University of Science and Technology","Keyi Ju is Visiting Scholar at Energy Studies Institute, National University of Singapore.

Strategic planning for energy research and development (R & D) can be complex and dynamic, in part due to federal budgetary constraints and volatility. Managing R & D funding to advance energy technologies, in spite of these challenges, is a crucial component of the nation's long term energy policy. This study demonstrates a portfolio decision analysis (PDA) approach to support R & D resource allocation decisions for the DOE Office of Fossil Energy's Carbon Capture and Storage R & D program. A multi-attribute value model uses technology readiness levels (TRU) and other metrics to represent the overall objectives of the R&D program in order to evaluate alternative research portfolios given limited funding. Mathematical optimization identifies efficient funding allocations for each technology program area to maximize the multi-attribute value generated from the total budget. This is especially useful for responding to externally-imposed-budget changes.

There have been extensive studies on the operating strategies of SPR. However, previous literatures have paid more attention to a booming or stable international oil market, while few studies analyzed the impact of a long-term low oil price on SPR policy. As a supplement, this paper extends a static model to study China's optimal stockpiling policy under different oil price trends, and in response to different current oil prices. A new variable FC, which demonstrates the appreciation and depreciation of the reserved oil economic value, has been taken into account to assess the optimal size of SPR. In this paper, a more multi-perspective of view is provided to consider the policies of China's SPR, especially under the different trend of international oil price fluctuations.","[Xie, Nan; Yan, Zhijun] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Xie, Nan] China ZhenHua Oil Co Ltd, Beijing 100031, Peoples R China; [Yan, Zhijun] Sustainable Dev Res Inst Econ & Soc Beijing, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Yan, Zhijun] Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Yi] Shanghai Feynman Asset Management LLP, Shanghai 201815, Peoples R China; [Huang, Wenjun] New Oriental Educ & Technol Grp Inc, Beijing 100020, Peoples R China",Beijing Institute of Technology; Beijing Institute of Technology,"Yan, ZJ (通讯作者)，Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",yanzhijun@bit.edu.cn,"HUANG, WENJUN/GXM-9167-2022",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71272057, 71572013, 71521002]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation [9152015]; Joint Development Program of Beijing Municipal Commission of Education",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); Joint Development Program of Beijing Municipal Commission of Education,"This paper was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (71272057, 71572013 and 71521002), Beijing Natural Science Foundation (9152015) and Joint Development Program of Beijing Municipal Commission of Education.",,37,5,5,1,18,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUN,2017,105.0,,,,,,332,340,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.03.008,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ET8EY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000400532900032,0

The argument being that we need a similar rapid and total shift in our industrial social and economic environment to prevent or at least address the pending impacts of climate change. This argument and these studies have inspired us to think with them on what it means to use the WWII war analogy as a security claim in energy and climate change debates. Here, we would like to use this opportunity to draw attention to some of the implicit dangers of a call to war in such discussions. Among others we observe, first, the absence of any attention to the actual mobilization policies, in terms of garnishing public support. Second, based on the insights from Critical Security Studies, we question the historical incongruence of the case study especially by comparing the perceived enemy in both cases. Lastly, building on that same security literature, we point to some undesirable and perhaps unintended consequences of the use of war analogies in climate change debates.","[Kester, Johannes; Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Business Dev & Technol, Ctr Energy Technol, Birk Centerpk 15, DK-7400 Herning, Denmark; [Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Univ Sussex, Sch Business Management & Econ, SPRU, Energy Policy, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England",Aarhus University; University of Sussex,"Kester, J (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Business Dev & Technol, Ctr Energy Technol, Birk Centerpk 15, DK-7400 Herning, Denmark.",j.kester@btech.au.dk; benjaminso@btech.au.dk,"Sovacool, Benjamin/Y-2392-2019","Sovacool, Benjamin/0000-0002-4794-9403; Kester, Johannes/0000-0001-5384-0247",Research Councils United Kingdom (RCUK) Energy Program Grant [EP/K011790/1]; Danish Council for Independent Research (DFF) Sapere Aude Grant [4182-00033B],Research Councils United Kingdom (RCUK) Energy Program Grant; Danish Council for Independent Research (DFF) Sapere Aude Grant,This work is supported by the Research Councils United Kingdom (RCUK) Energy Program Grant EP/K011790/1 Center on Innovation and Energy Demand and the Danish Council for Independent Research (DFF) Sapere Aude Grant 4182-00033B Societal Implications of a Vehicle-to-Grid Transition in Northern Europe.

The scenarios were developed using a probabilistic approach based on Bayesian networks, through a structured process for elicitation of expert knowledge. We have identified the most and least favourable scenarios in terms of the expected likelihood for the development of the market of biofuels from microalgae, through which we have focussed on the contribution of economic and policy aspects in the development of the sector. A detailed analysis of the contribution of each variable in the context of the scenarios is also provided. These data represent a starting point for the evaluation of different policy options for the future biofuel market in Italy. The best scenario shows a 75% probability that biofuels from microalgae will exceed 20% of the biofuel market by 2030.

In this study, data was collected in an online survey carried out in 2015, from private homeowners of existing and newly built single and double-family houses in Austria who had invested in a new heating system within the last ten years (N=484). In contrast to previous studies, this study specifically investigates the triggers behind homeowner decisions to invest in a new heating system (e.g. problem, opportunity, or new building situation). Results of binary logistic regression analysis show that subsidies for heating system tabinvestments and infrastructural adjustments reveal to be most effective for homeowners in problem situations to foster alternative heating systems. For homeowners in opportunity situations (e.g. building refurbishment), in addition operational convenience appears to be important. For new buildings, the main barriers for alternative heating system adoption were found in the positive perception of fuel supply security and feasibility of fossil systems. Thus, the use of trigger-specific policy measures is proposed to foster alternative heating systems in the residential building sector.","[Hecher, Maria; Hatzl, Stefanie; Posch, Alfred] Graz Univ, Inst Syst Sci Innovat & Sustainabil Res, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Knoeri, Christof] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Grp Sustainabil & Technol, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Graz; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Hecher, M (通讯作者)，Graz Univ, Inst Syst Sci Innovat & Sustainabil Res, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",maria.hecher@uni-graz.at,,"Posch, Alfred/0000-0002-7859-1539","federal government of Styria (Land Steiermark - Erneuerbare Energien and Klimaschutz); Faculty of Environmental, Regional and Educational Sciences at the University of Graz in Austria","federal government of Styria (Land Steiermark - Erneuerbare Energien and Klimaschutz); Faculty of Environmental, Regional and Educational Sciences at the University of Graz in Austria","This work was supported by the federal government of Styria (Land Steiermark - Erneuerbare Energien and Klimaschutz) and in the form of a scholarship granted by the Faculty of Environmental, Regional and Educational Sciences at the University of Graz in Austria.

CO2 enhanced oil recovery can play a significant role in stimulating CCS deployment because CO2 is used to extract additional quantities of oil. This study analyzes the investment decision of both a carbon emitting source and an oil company separately by adopting a real options approach. It is shown that when uncertainty is integrated in the economic analysis, CO2 and oil price threshold levels at which investments in CO2 capture and enhanced oil recovery will take place, are higher than when a net present value approach is adopted. We also demonstrate that a tax on CO2 instead of an emission trading system results in a lower investment threshold level for the investment in the CO2 capture unit. Furthermore, we determine a minimum CO2 selling price between the two firms and show that CO2-EOR has the potential to pull CCS into the market by providing an additional revenue on the capture plant. However, when CO2 permit prices are above an identifiable level, the EU ETS does not necessarily result in the adoption of CCS and stimulates oil production.","[Compernolle, T.; Kort, P.] Univ Antwerp, Dept Econ, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Compernolle, T.; Welkenhuysen, K.; Piessens, K.] Geol Survey Belgium, Royal Belgian Inst Nat Sci, Jennerstr 13, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Welkenhuysen, K.] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Fac Geosci, Budapestlaan 6, NL-3584 CD Utrecht, Netherlands; [Welkenhuysen, K.] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Celestijnenlaan 200E, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium; [Huisman, K.; Kort, P.] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econometr & Operat Res & Ctr, Warandelaan 2, NL-5037 Tilburg, Netherlands; [Huisman, K.] ASML, De Run 6501, NL-5504 Veldhoven, Netherlands",University of Antwerp; Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences; Utrecht University; KU Leuven; Tilburg University; ASML Holding,"Compernolle, T (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Dept Econ, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",tine.compernolle@uantwerpen.be; kwelkenhuysen@naturalsciences.be; kpiessens@naturalsciences.be; kort@uvt.nl,"Kort, Peter/AAE-3883-2020; Kort, Peter/ADN-9538-2022","Kort, Peter/0000-0001-5973-1981; Huisman, Kuno/0000-0002-7472-1391",Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) [12M7417N],Research Foundation Flanders (FWO)(FWO),"We would like to thank the reviewers for their constructive comments which helped us to improve the manuscript.

A case study of the Zaozhuang coal-mining region in transition. Regional Studies. Although the role of the local state in China's regional development has been regarded as important, individual local state actors and their relation with institutional change have been under-explored. Critically exploring the Western idea of place leadership, this paper launches the notion of local state leadership as a specific Chinese form of place leadership. Through a case study of the coal-mining region of Zaozhuang in Shandong, it articulates how interpretive, formal and network leadership are exercised by the prefectural-level mayor to affect institutionalization processes. These processes collectively create broader enabling conditions for local industrial change.","[Hu, Xiaohui] Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Adm, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Hassink, Robert] Univ Kiel, Dept Geog, Kiel, Germany",Zhejiang University of Finance & Economics; University of Kiel,"Hassink, R (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Geog, Kiel, Germany.",xhhugeo@zufe.edu.cn; hassink@geographie.uni-kiel.de,"Hassink, Robert/U-5311-2019","Hassink, Robert/0000-0001-7524-4577; Hu, Xiaohui/0000-0002-2986-9282",Graduate Center of Kiel University,Graduate Center of Kiel University,The authors thank the Graduate Center of Kiel University for financially supporting two fieldworks in 2013 and 2014.,,58,27,34,3,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Based partly on interviews with experts, this study reviews China's industrial policies that shape the supply of these materials abroad. We also assess the short-and long-term strategies of the European Union and European solar and wind industries to ameliorate potential supply bottlenecks. While these strategies adequately address short-term challenges, we find they pose several long-term risks, such as increasing the dependence on China and hampering European competitiveness in global Markets. There is also divergence in the extent to which these two industries are vulnerable to supply bottlenecks and price volatility; because more options are open to them, European solar manufacturers are less exposed to these risks than their counterparts in the offshore wind sector.

Increased competition leads to increased probability of company failure. Early recognition of the threat of bankruptcy is therefore even more important. In 2016 in Slovakia entered into force the new provisions of Law No. 513/1991 Coll. Commercial Code on companies in crisis. The company is in crisis when it is in default or at risk of imminent default. Objectives: The goal is to create and evaluate an ensemble model that predict whether a Slovak company will find itself in a crisis in the following year. Paper also provide an overview of bagging, boosting, and stacking, arguably the most used ensemble methods. Methods and data: The ensemble model is created and tested on a sample of Slovak companies. The data used to create the model are from financial statements 2014 (47 414 companies) and model is tested on data from financial statements 2015 (64 757 companies) and 2016 (56 743 companies). The data was obtained from the register of the financial statements (www.registeruz.sk). To evaluate of the model, we use standard performance metrics (AUC, confusion matrix, RMSE, logloss, ...). Results: Using ensemble learning, we have created a model to predict whether a company will be in a crisis.

On the other hand, the investor realizes that for the same length of time, workers (even in the same areas) can have different labour productivity in different countries. Also, based on this, the investor can opt for the country. Of course, a combination of lower labour productivity (for example, lower by 10% compared to other country) and low average wages may be more advantageous for the investor than high labour productivity. Measuring labour productivity per hour worked provides a better picture of productivity developments in the economy. The main goal of the article is to compare the labour productivity and average wage level in selected countries of the European Union, to compare the share of the average wage on productivity and the difference in average wage level and productivity in each selected country. The first chapter provide the theoretical basis for the topic. We will explain what it is labour productivity, how we can measure it, and we will also focus on average wages. In the second chapter, we will go to research where we will compare average wages among states, labour productivity among states and consequently, we will compare labour productivity and average wages between each other.

The main purpose of such codes is to clearly establish and unequivocally state the rules and principles for the ethical behaviour of managers and employees, internally and externally, as well as towards each other. This article deals with the goals and the contents of codes of ethics, the principles behind their creation, the enforcement of those principles and the main pre-conditions required for ensuring their effectiveness. The empirical part of the article is based on research conducted on a sample set of 607 Czech companies. These companies were divided into four categories according to size. The tested hypothesis was set on the basis of the assumption that more than 50% of companies use the comments of their departments and employees when implementing changes to their code of ethics. All the tests and calculations of interval estimates were performed at the significance level of 0.05 using R-software. The tables were created in MS Excel. The statistical tests show that more than 50% of medium and large-sized companies take into account the comments of departments and staff prior to modifying their codes of ethics. The hypothesis was refuted for micro and small-sized companies.","[Caha, Zdenek; Urban, Jan] Inst Technol & Business Ceske Budejovice, Dept Management, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic","Institute of Technology & Business, Ceske Budejovice","Caha, Z (通讯作者)，Inst Technol & Business Ceske Budejovice, Dept Management, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",caha@mail.vstecb.cz; urban@consilium-group.cz,"Caha, Zdeněk/AAN-2017-2020",,,,,,15,0,0,0,3,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,255,261,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059200034,0

It intends to analyse their social responsibility and attitude to become active in this field. Corporate social responsibility is a topic of growing academic and management interest, particularly regarding its impact on consumer behaviour and sustainability of contemporary way of life as consumers tend to employ a company's image in consumption decision making. Sustainable development is based on economic development, social equity, and environmental protection. So the abovementioned theme is directly related to ethics and corporate social responsibility. The results reveal the attitude of the students to these issues, and how they perceive the impact of the consuming way of life and industry on nature.

Comparing with spaceborne repeatpass InSAR, airborne repeat-pass InSAR solves the problems of long revisit time and lowresolution images. Due to the advantages of flexible, accurate, and fast obtaining abundant information, airborne repeat-pass InSAR is significant in deformation monitoring of shallow ground. In order to getting precise ground elevation information and interferometric coherence of deformation monitoring from master and slave images, accurate co-registration must be promised. Because of side looking, repeat observing path and long baseline, there are very different initial slant ranges and flight heights between repeat flight paths. The differences of initial slant ranges and flight height lead to the pixels, located identical coordinates on master and slave images, correspond to different size of ground resolution cells. The mismatching phenomenon performs very obvious on the long slant range parts of master image and slave image. In order to resolving the different sizes of pixels and getting accurate co-registration results, a new method is proposed based on Range-Doppler (RD) imaging model.

During the quarantine, service of customers is stopped, new breakdowns do not arrive while the broken servers continue recovering. Under the fixed values of the thresholds, behavior of the system is described by the multi-dimensional continuous time Markov chain.

It focuses on the case of Massachusetts by tracking changes in the importance of spatial distance from Boston concerning citizens' choices of residence according to data for 1880-90 and 1930-2010. By adopting a Bayesian strategy, results show that Boston reinforced its attractiveness until the 1960s, when the city's accessibility no longer represented the unique determinant of population density distribution.

Regional Studies. Could urbanization lead to more democracy and better government for the mega-cities of the developing world? This paper reviews three channels through which urbanization may generate political change. First, cities facilitate coordinated public action and enhance the effectiveness of uprisings. Second, cities may increase the demand for democracy relative to dictatorship. Third, cities may engender the development of civic capital' which enables citizens to improve their own institutions. History and empirics provide significant support for the first channel, but less evidence exists for the others.

Virtual Reality (VR) has matured in the past allowing a rapid consolidation of information and decision-making through visualization and experience. These new man machine interfaces offer advanced interaction possibilities with the digital domain and allow engineers to variate over several hypothesis. This enlightened ideas to deploy VR for what-if-scenarios also in the CAE domain. However, while CAD/VR integration has been sufficiently researched, the integration of CAE into VR is still facing a long road ahead. Despite recent criticism that the application of VR technology has been considered unnecessary in CAE, this paper aims to refute this by presenting methodologies for linear static FEM analysis allowing what-if-scenarios within interactive environments.

It is proved that the state economic policy should be realized using not so much direct as indirect measures of state influence on economic processes. Also, the authors point to the need to expand the composition of economic policy subjects.

Unfortunately, Ghana's economy reported only steady growth with successive periods of high inflation and undesirable balance of payments deficits leading scholars to ask whether external debt really contributes to growth. At the same time, there is now considerable evidence that the build-up in debt was accompanied by increasing capital flight from the country. Employing Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model and dataset from 1970 to 2012, this paper investigated the apparent positive relationship between external debts and capital flights in Ghana. The results revealed that capital flight exerted a positive and statistically significant effect on external debt both in the short-run and long-run suggesting that if capital flight remains unchecked, it will continue to lead to massive external debt accumulation in Ghana. The Toda-Yamamoto Approach to Granger causality test also revealed the existence of a debt-fueled capital flight signifying the need for sound domestic debt management to deal with high external borrowing that is causing massive capital flight in the country.","[Kwesi, Ampah Isaac; Kiss, Gabor David] Univ Szeged, Dugonics Ter 13, Szeged, Hungary",Szeged University,"Kwesi, AI (通讯作者)，Univ Szeged, Dugonics Ter 13, Szeged, Hungary.",ampah.isaac@eco.u-szeged.hu; kiss.gabor.david@eco.u-szeged.hu,"Kiss, Gábor Dávid/A-2389-2013","Kiss, Gábor Dávid/0000-0003-0373-9970",,,,,25,0,0,0,0,TOMAS BATA UNIV ZLIN,ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7454-654-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,21,34,,10.7441/dokbat.2017.02,0.0,,,14,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BM6FF,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000466528800002,0

To correctly and fully bring the translator's subjective initiative into play is the key to success. With the culture turn uprising in 1970s, the once marginalized position of the translator now draws theorists' attention. The study of translator's subjectivity has aroused a heated debate among Sino-foreign scholars. This thesis aims to study translator's subjectivity, taking the English version of Song of the Burial of Flowers as an example. And it includes an introduction, embodiment of translators' subjectivity in the English version of Song of the Burial of Flowers, factors affecting the translators in translation based on the English version of Song of The Burial of Flowers and the translation standard guiding translators in translating.

More than 70% of the largest Russian companies in production of electronics, consumer goods, alcohol and tobacco are foreign. Institutional factor played a significant role in attraction of foreign TNCs and FDI in Russia in 2000-2016. Economic-statistical analysis revealed that the legislative reforms in Russia led to a sharp increase of FDI inflows in 2006-2013, privileges for international business - to a rapid development of import substitution in automotive and food industries, pharmaceuticals, telecommunications, and creation of special industrial economic zones defined their regional priorities. Institutional barriers (introduction of sanctions against Russia in 2014 and retaliatory sanctions, sharp decline of oil prices) weakened the international business position: a number of foreign multinationals left the country, FDI inflows significantly reduced in 2014-2016. Globalization reflected the development of foreign tobacco companies in Russia, three of which control about 90% of the cigarette market in Russia for the past 10 years. Russia's excise policy due to global trends is aimed at raising excise taxes on less quality cigarettes which resulted in profits decrease of those TNCs as well as in the revival of the shadow market of cheap domestic cigarettes.","[Mironova, Marina] RUDN Univ, Peoples Friendship Univ Russia, Fac Econ, Dept Reg Econ & Geog, Moscow, Russia; [Alborova, Agunda] RUDN Univ, Peoples Friendship Univ Russia, Fac Econ, Financial Management Sect Econ, Moscow, Russia",Peoples Friendship University of Russia; Peoples Friendship University of Russia,"Mironova, M (通讯作者)，RUDN Univ, Peoples Friendship Univ Russia, Fac Econ, Dept Reg Econ & Geog, Moscow, Russia.",mirmar@yandex.ru; agualborova@yandex.ru,,,[5-100],,This paper is prepared with the support of the RUDN University Programm 5-100.,,21,0,0,0,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,1598,1606,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059203003,0

The analysis considers the subsidies provided by the main Italian regional policy, Law 488/1992, during 1996-2009. By exploiting an unusual characteristic of the L. 488 selection process, a quasi-experimental design with high internal validity - the regression discontinuity design - is applied for the first time to the survival analysis. The results show a lower default risk in subsidized start-ups. These findings contradict the view that start-ups receiving L. 488 assistance simply used the grant funding to delay exit.","[Pellegrini, Guido] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Social & Econ Sci, Rome, Italy; [Muccigrosso, Teo] Ist Nazl Stat ISTAT, Dept Natl Accounts, Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Pellegrini, G (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Social & Econ Sci, Rome, Italy.",guido.pellegrini@uniroma1.it; muccigrosso@istat.it,"Pellegrini, Guido/GSJ-0304-2022","Pellegrini, Guido/0000-0002-6325-7351",Sapienza University of Rome,Sapienza University of Rome,This work was supported by the Sapienza University of Rome Postdoctoral Fellowship 'Statistical Methods for the Evaluation of Public Policies'.,,25,18,19,2,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The term globalization in the world means integration of economies and societies in the world through cross country flows of information, ideas, technologies, goods, services, capital, finance and people. Cross border integration can have several dimensions - cultural, social, political and economic. In fact, some people fear cultural and social integration even more than economic integration. Globalization is a feature of changing world. It is no more a recent phenomenon in the world. Initial enthusiasm for globalization as a beneficial set of processes has yielded to an understanding that the phenomenon is largely associated with increasing social inequality within and between countries as well as instability and conflict. Globalization is impacting the institutional framework in both developing and industrial countries. It is changing the way in which governments perceive their role in the society. Globalization has a multi-dimensional impact on the system of education. It promotes new tools & techniques in this area like E-learning, Flexible learning, Distance Education. Globalization will mean many different things for education. In the near future, it will mean a more competitive and deregulated educational system modelled after free market but with more pressure on it to assure that the next generation of workers are prepared for some amorphous job market of the 21st century.","[Slovakova, Ivana] Tech Univ Zvolen, Inst Foreign Languages, TG Masaryka 2117-24, Zvolen 96053, Slovakia",Technical University Zvolen,"Slovakova, I (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Zvolen, Inst Foreign Languages, TG Masaryka 2117-24, Zvolen 96053, Slovakia.",ivana.slovakova@tuzvo.sk,,,project Developing the reading competency and teaching technical foreign languages at technical universities,project Developing the reading competency and teaching technical foreign languages at technical universities,This article has been written with the support of the project Developing the reading competency and teaching technical foreign languages at technical universities.,,16,0,0,1,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,2417,2423,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059204042,0

Our paper provides a complex look on how globalization affected the quality of partnerships among service enterprises and its various components such as trust, honesty, reliability and commitment. The main aim of this study is to identify the impact of globalization on selected components of partnership quality in service supply chains in Slovak republic. Data was collected via survey in two time periods 2006 and 2016. The difference of 10 years provides a possibility to examine how globalization changed the role of partners in their corresponding supply chains and how it affected various aspects of partnership quality. Our findings indicate that there is a significant dependence between various components of partnership quality and partners' business activities. Significant changes can be observed during the examined time period as a result of increased pressures from global environment. Moreover, our research provides evidence that reliability of partner has become the most significant component of partnership quality, whereas a decade ago it was honesty of partner.","[Veselovska, Lenka] Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Inst Managerial Syst, Francisciho 910-8, Poprad 05801, Slovakia; [Zavadsky, Jan] Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Francisciho 910-8, Poprad 05801, Slovakia",Matej Bel University; Matej Bel University,"Veselovská, L (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Inst Managerial Syst, Francisciho 910-8, Poprad 05801, Slovakia.",lenka.veselovska@umb.sk; jan.zavadsky@umb.sk,"Veselovská, Lenka/F-8379-2018; Zavadsky, Jan/M-6707-2019",,,,,,21,1,1,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,2849,2855,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059205031,0

In these situations, there is no energy consumption reduction and thermal comfort is hardly achieved. This paper introduces a methodology to choose the most appropriate retrofit measure in a context of fuel poverty. This methodology is based on thermal comfort as the main criterion, and secondarily, it is based on the budget for paying monthly energy bills and initial costs. This study demonstrates how thermal comfort and monthly available income of households must be the first criterion for decision-making process. The methodology has been applied in four buildings. Results demonstrate why active retrofit measures are ineffective when monthly budget to pay energy bills is reduced.

That may be expressed in the form of free cash flow to equity (FCFE) or in the form of EVA Equity. Calculating both indicators, we follow the enterprise 's economic profit. For the company ' s management to be able to reach the best economic profit possible it has to maximise its revenues and minimise its costs. A key role in each company of today's globalized world is played especially by production costs. They define the enterprise ' s potential, they determine possible limits and its activity. An enterprise, which wants to fulfil its main aim, needs to manage its costs. This contribution sets a goal to create a tool for modelling production costs dependency on the volume of production based on an example of a specific enterprise using artificial neural networks. Individual items of financial statements serve as data - especially balance sheets and profit and loss statements. First of all, it was necessary to determine what cost items related to the company ' s manufacturing activity. For the purpose of the analysis costs have been summed up according to individual production costs. Subsequently, using the Statistica software, neural structures (multilayer perceptron networks and neural networks of the basic radial function) which are able to model the company costs developments with the regard to production volume, have been calculated.","[Vochozka, Marek] Inst Technol & Business Ceske Budejovice, Okruzni 517-10, Ceske Budejovice 37001, Czech Republic","Institute of Technology & Business, Ceske Budejovice","Vochozka, M (通讯作者)，Inst Technol & Business Ceske Budejovice, Okruzni 517-10, Ceske Budejovice 37001, Czech Republic.",vochozka@mail.vstecb.cz,"Vochozka, Marek/L-3154-2019","Vochozka, Marek/0000-0001-9923-7814",,,,,15,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,2872,2879,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059205034,0

The big advantage of the computer simulation is that once we have reliable mathematical model of the system we can do thousands of simulation experiments that are quicker, cheaper and safer then examination on the real system. The control approach used in this work is a hybrid adaptive control where an adaptation process is satisfied by the on-line recursive identification of the External Linear Model as a linear representation of the originally nonlinear system. The polynomial approach together with the Pole-placement method and spectral factorization satisfies basic control requirements such as a stability, a reference signal tracking and a disturbance attenuation. Moreover, these methods produce also relations for computing of controller's parameters. As a bonus, the controlled output could be affected by the choice of the root position in the Pole-placement method. The goal of this contribution is to show that proposed controller could be used for various outputs as this system provides five possible options.","[Vojtesek, Jiri; Spacek, Lubos; Dostal, Petr] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Appl Informat, Nam TGM 5555, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Vojtesek, J (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Appl Informat, Nam TGM 5555, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic.",vojtesek@fai.utb.cz; lspacek@fai.utb.cz,"Dostál, Petr/JTV-6004-2023; Vojtěšek, Jiří/H-6372-2012","Vojtesek, Jiri/0000-0001-9923-7128",,,,,13,0,0,0,0,EUROPEAN COUNCIL MODELLING & SIMULATION,NOTTINGHAM,"SCHOOL COMPUTING & MATHEMATICS, NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIV, BURTON STREET, NOTTINGHAM, NG1 4BU, ENGLAND",,,978-0-9932440-4-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,446,452,,,,,,7,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Economics; Engineering, Industrial",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Engineering,BH9XI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404420000067,0

This question is investigated in the context of the dynamics analysis of average hours, worked during the whole working life. The decrease in the general number of hours worked during the working life of workers who started working in the 1950-s, in comparison with the previous generation is explored. This trend is explained by the decrease of average annual hours actually worked per worker life during. the second half of the XX th c. Together with the reduction in the total hours during the working life, the legal increase of pension age may combine with the decrease of labor loading for the workers retiring after the pension reform comes into force in comparison with the workers retiring in accordance with the acting law. The perspectives of pension reform in economically developed countries and Russia is evaluated from this perspectives. Labor loading of Russian workers has tendency to increase, the increase in the retirement age under other equal conditions will lead to a considerable lengthening of working life. A gradual decrease in a share of the years worked before the 90-s in the nominal length will play its role in it. As a result, if to introduce beginning with the year 2020 60 years retirement age for women the real length of the working life will be about 79200 hr that is there will be 7000 hr increase.

Empirical results from a panel-data multilevel model indicate that the regional concentration and centralization of the banking system are relevant for firms' investment choices. More importantly, the fitness of the multilevel model indicates the need to consider that investment rates vary according to a regional hierarchical banking structure (centre versus periphery).","[Cavalcante, Anderson] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, CEDEPLAR FACE, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais,"Cavalcante, A (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Minas Gerais, CEDEPLAR FACE, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.",atmc@cedeplar.ufmg.br,,"Cavalcante, Anderson Marques/0000-0002-0700-5993",CAPES (Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel - Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior) [4908-06-6],CAPES (Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel - Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior),This work was supported by the CAPES (Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel - Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior) [grant number 4908-06-6].,,48,1,1,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

This paper studies the role of commuter rail stations in population deconcentration, modelled through the relationship between in-migration and out-commuting from census tracts. It finds that increased migration in station areas suppresses population deconcentration, seemingly enabling node-based development. However, this effect does not hold across all stations. Preliminary evidence suggests that commercial development in station areas facilitates migrants working locally, decreasing deconcentration - and possibly helping regions work toward sustainability goals.","[Ganning, Joanna] Cleveland State Univ, Maxine Goodman Levin Coll Urban Affairs, Dept Urban Studies, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA",University System of Ohio; Cleveland State University,"Ganning, J (通讯作者)，Cleveland State Univ, Maxine Goodman Levin Coll Urban Affairs, Dept Urban Studies, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA.",j.ganning@csuohio.edu,"Ganning, Joanna/JHT-1366-2023",,"National Institute for Transportation and Communities (NITC), a programme of the Transportation Research and Education Center (TREC) at Portland State University [778]; Wasatch Front Regional Council; Ivory-Boyer Real Estate Center; University of Utah","National Institute for Transportation and Communities (NITC), a programme of the Transportation Research and Education Center (TREC) at Portland State University; Wasatch Front Regional Council; Ivory-Boyer Real Estate Center; University of Utah","This research was funded by the National Institute for Transportation and Communities (NITC), a programme of the Transportation Research and Education Center (TREC) at Portland State University [grant number 778], with additional support from the Wasatch Front Regional Council, the Ivory-Boyer Real Estate Center and multiple academic departments within the University of Utah.",,29,1,2,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

If community concerns is disregarded in public spatial planning and the private development of wind power projects, the expected increase in the production of wind power energy will be jeopardized. Value propositions for installing wind farms in a community often consider only national policy targets, end users and those organizations that make a profit on installing, running or owning a wind turbine power plant. In many cases, the impact of technologies on society is underestimated, especially the impact on those actors who are influenced by technological change but without perceived benefit. This paper applies a value framework to systematically analyse the perceived value of the National Test Centre for Large Wind Turbines in Denmark, considering different stakeholder dimensions of acceptance (socio-political, market and community) from four perspectives (economic, psychological, sociological and environmental) before arriving at some policy recommendations on how to incorporate community values when siting wind turbines.","[Borch, Kristian] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Management Engn, Diplomvej 372, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark,"Borch, K (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Management Engn, Diplomvej 372, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",krbo@dtu.dk,,"Borch, Kristian/0000-0001-8628-3491",DTU,DTU,"I would like to express my gratefulness to Dr. Jens Emborg, Copenhagen University who provided valuable comments about the manuscript and to DTU for sponsoring my Masters in mediation, which was an invaluable inspiration to this work.",,63,14,14,2,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2018,123.0,,,,,,251,258,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.08.056,0.0,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HE6FW,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000453499700025,0

Subsequently, India has also submitted its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) for the period 2021-2030 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). While the Government of India (GOI) has ambitious plans for enhancing the installed capacity of RE sources, 75% of its electricity is currently generated by coal-fired power plants. As India's electricity requirements grow to meet the aspirations of 1.3 Bi people, it needs a policy framework that integrates all low-carbon energy technologies with coal in such a manner that the reliability, security, and affordability of electric supply are balanced with sustainable development. India also needs to develop innovative strategies to clean up the country's coal sector while enhancing the integration of renewable energy into the National Power Grid. In this context, certain recommendations are proposed in this article for timely implementation by GOI to facilitate the achievement of India's targets with respect to SDG 7 and the NDCs in an efficient and effective manner.","[Srikanth, R.] Natl Inst Adv Studies, Indian Inst Sci Campus, Bengaluru, India",,"Srikanth, R (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Adv Studies, Indian Inst Sci Campus, Bengaluru, India.",rsrikanth@nias.res.in,,"Srikanth, Raman/0000-0003-0083-3355",,,,,105,44,46,2,22,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2018,123.0,,,,,,325,336,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.08.050,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HE6FW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000453499700033,0

Such feedbacks may induce recipients to update their beliefs about both reachable material outcomes and perceived self/social esteem. Both channels are very hard to disentangle in the field, which notably makes welfare analysis a very challenging task. This paper uses an online experiment that makes it possible to focus, within the considered setting, on the role of pure information on material outcomes. Despite an absence of normative pressure, comparative feedbacks are found to trigger comparable or even greater changes in behaviors than other kinds of informative and more accurate feedbacks. A possible explanation may be that comparative feedbacks more effectively conveyed to participants the idea that it should not be too difficult for them to reach a better outcome.

Data includes fifty-six auction prices from 2007 to 2013, those of CESUR in the Spanish OMEL electricity market, and those of Basic Generation Service auctions (PJM-BGS) in New Jersey's PJM market. Winning bidders got an average ex-post yearly forward premium of 7% (CESUR) and 38% (PMJ-BGS). The premium using an index of futures prices is 1.08% (CESUR) and 24% (PJM-BGS). Ex-post forward premium is negatively related to the number of bidders and spot price volatility. In CESUR, hedging-driven trading in power derivatives markets predominates around auction dates, but in PJM-BGS, speculation-driven trading prevails. The policy recommendation to market regulators and administrators is that they should gauge consumers' price risk aversion before introducing alternative methods to default supply auctions for the computation of the part of cost of energy of the electricity bill of customers whose contracted capacity is small and are not served by other suppliers.","[Ignacio Pena, Juan; Rodriguez, Rosa] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Business Adm, C Madrid 126, Madrid 28903, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Peña, JI (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Business Adm, C Madrid 126, Madrid 28903, Spain.",ypenya@eco.uc3m.es; rosa.rodriguez@uc3m.es,"Pena, Juan Ignacio/I-3570-2015","Pena, Juan Ignacio/0000-0003-2435-3583; RODRIGUEZ, ROSA/0000-0002-4559-2332","Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness [ECO2016-77807-P, ECO2015-67035-P]; Bank of Spain",Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness; Bank of Spain,"We are grateful to Veronika Lunina, Beatriz Martinez, Hipolit Torro, Daniel Jiang, Alvaro Cartea and participants in ECOMFIN 2016 Paris Conference, 8th Valencia Research Workshop on Energy Markets, CEM2017 Oxford Conference, IAEE 2017 Vienna Conference, and AEEE 2018 Zaragoza conference for helpful comments.

Although the Energy Transition for Green Growth Act of 2015 is the flagship legislation of this period on this eponymous topic, many other acts directly or indirectly concerning the energy transition were adopted and carried provisions contributing to its legal corpus. Additionally, this legal production was accompanied by an extensive process of public participation, an unusual practice in French energy law and policy building. The emergence of a voluminous legal corpus concerning the organisation of a transition from fossil and fissile fuels to renewable energy sources in France has led the author to ask the following question: To what extent may the voluminous energy transition legal framework recently created in France result in the emergence of a new autonomous branch of law? To answer this question, this article presents various sets of criteria for the recognition of an autonomous branch of law and uses the cases of the emergence of energy law and of the interrelations between environmental law and climate change law to analyse the potential qualification of the energy transition legal framework.","[Mauger, Romain] Univ Groningen, Fac Law, GCEL, Oude Kijk Jatstr 26, NL-9712 EK Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Mauger, R (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Law, GCEL, Oude Kijk Jatstr 26, NL-9712 EK Groningen, Netherlands.",r.j.g.mauger@rug.nl,"Mauger, Romain/GYE-0297-2022","Mauger, Romain/0000-0002-5085-7518",,,,,50,11,12,2,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2018,122.0,,,,,,499,505,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.08.013,0.0,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GX2UX,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447576700046,0

We find evidence of incomplete learning and fatigue: as subjects are told more information, their marginal learning rates decrease. Consistent with previous work, ex ante knowledge does affect stated willingness to pay. However, we find no significant marginal impact of knowledge on the mean nor the variance of willingness to pay for changes in the environmental good conditional on ex ante knowledge.

Although the Chinese government launched a wide variety of policies to encourage green building practices, only 1592 housing projects had been green-certified by the end of 2015, representing a small percentage in China's booming housing market and with very uneven distribution across cities. Based on a panel dataset of all the cities at the prefecture level or above in China for the period from 2008 to 2015, this paper employs Tobit model and Cox proportional hazard model to investigate the drivers of green housing development. Besides the factors associated with economic returns to green investment, the empirical results suggest that some policy instruments have effectively stimulated green practices in the private housing sector, such as land-related policies, priority in enterprise qualification inspection and upgrade, and demand-side subsidies. This paper also highlights the spillover effects of the government's green practices in public housing, implying that governments can also influence the building sector as leading actors.

Furthermore, an order-alpha approach is developed for determining partial frontiers. Both traditional Malmquist-Luenberger and bootstrapped Malmquist productivity indexes between 1993 and 2015 are constructed. Analysis of productivity change by decomposing the Total Factor Productivity Index into Efficiency Change and Technical Change is performed showing respectively whether productivity gains derive mainly from improvements in efficiency or are mostly the result of technological progress.

Although one barrier to adoption is the higher purchase price, advocates suggest that fuel and maintenance savings can make BEVs economical over time. To assess this empirically, this paper analyzes the five-year Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for conventional, hybrid, and electric vehicles in 14 U.S. cities from 2011 to 2015. Results show spatial variation due to differences in state and local policies, fuel prices, insurance and maintenance costs, depreciation rates, and vehicle miles traveled. Yet in nearly all cities, the BEV's higher purchase price and rapid depreciation outweighed its fuel savings. Extensive sensitivity analyses highlight the impact of key parameters and show that both federal and state incentives were necessary for BEVs to be cost competitive. Future BEV cost competitiveness may improve if innovation and scaling lead to significantly reduced BEV purchase prices, but our analysis suggests that it will be challenging for BEVs to achieve unsubsidized cost competitiveness except in the most optimistic scenarios.","[Breetz, Hanna L.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, 800S Cady Mall, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Salon, Deborah] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Breetz, HL (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, 800S Cady Mall, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",hbreetz@asu.edu,"Salon, Deborah/AAM-3735-2021","Salon, Deborah/0000-0002-2240-8408; Breetz, Hanna/0000-0002-4763-6482",,,,,49,126,136,9,109,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2018,120.0,,,,,,238,249,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.038,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO6DC,,,Y,N,2024-03-10,WOS:000440123300022,0

We show that, for any given target of stationary stock of pollution, the land rent taxation scheme leads to a higher steady state capital accumulation than the other schemes, and hence the steady state consumption of agents when young under this scheme is also higher than under the others. In addition, under an ambitious mitigation target when the efficiency of the mitigation technology is relatively high compared to the dirtiness of production, the land rent taxation also provides a higher steady state consumption when old, resulting in higher social welfare, than the others. In the second part of the paper, we propose a period-by-period-balanced budget policy, which includes land rent and capital income taxes with intergenerational transfers, to decentralize the socially optimal allocation during the transitional phase to the social planner's steady state, (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Previous de-capacity measures based on the quantity of the total excess capacity have failed to prevent the recurrence of increasingly worse overcapacity. To solve this problem we attempt to quantitatively analyze China's excess coal capacity by dividing it into the long-term natural excess capacity and short-term cyclical excess capacity using the state-space model and Kalman filter algorithm. The results show that China's excess coal capacity can indeed be divided into natural excess capacity and cyclical excess capacity, and they have different causes, fluctuations, roles, and effects on the price. In 1995-2001, cyclical excess capacity was the main factor of overcapacity, but in 2002-2015 natural excess capacity played a key role. Cyclical excess capacity has a negative effect on the price, whereas natural excess capacity has little effect on it. Therefore, policy makers should focus on the causes, the fluctuations, and the roles of natural excess and cyclical excess in addition to those of the total excess capacity. They should also consider the relationship between the capacity and price based on the different effects of the natural excess capacity and cyclical excess capacity on the price.","[Yang, Qing; Hou, Xiaochao; Zhang, Lei] China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Management, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",China University of Mining & Technology,"Zhang, L (通讯作者)，China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Management, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",mailing126@126.com,,,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2018BSCXB05],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),This work was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [No. 2018BSCXB05].,,60,42,44,3,41,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUL,2018,118.0,,,,,,270,278,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.03.052,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GJ1TF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000435050000025,0

To draw consensus, this study develops a translog-causality-based model in order to study causation between electricity, natural gas, petroleum, and economic growth in Egypt. In addition, the models' results are used to estimate the substitution possibilities between various energy pairs and to subsequently test the CO2 mitigation benefits arising from fuel substitution. Results support a bidirectional relationship between all energy types and economic growth in Egypt and suggest, also, that these energy types are substitutes. Although technical progress is estimated to be a bit slow (varying between 4.5% and 7.5%), there appears to be substantial CO2 emissions mitigation benefits from fuel substitution amounting to reductions in the range of 1.5 and 2.2 million metric tons under a 5% investment scenario and 2.5 and 4.5 million metric tons under a 10% investment scenario. These results have broader implications for energy conservation policies and industrial merger policies in developing countries.

One of the main causes has been the complexity of modeling the required energy consumption of households, as demanded by the official 10% indicator, and its replacement in calculations by the actual energy consumption, which, as is well known, underestimates the real needs of households. This weakness is addressed in this paper, through the development of the Stochastic Model of Energy Poverty (SMEP). The development of the model includes, firstly, the modeling of energy consumption at household level and, subsequently, the transition from household level to country level through stochastic analysis (Monte-Carlo simulation). Through Sensitivity Analysis, the impact of various parameters on energy poverty is quantified for the first time, by determining their weighting factors. Applied to the case of Greece, it is found that energy poverty reaches 70.4%, with income being the decisive factor affecting energy poverty at 63%, while other variables (Hint, etc.) follow at significantly lower percentages. The findings can be used in order to assess in advance the effectiveness of energy poverty measures, making the model a valuable policy tool.","[Papada, Lefkothea] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Metsov Interdisciplinary Res Ctr, 9 Heroon Polytech Str, Athens 15780, Greece; [Kaliampakos, Dimitris] Natl Tech Univ Athens, 9 Heroon Polytech Str, Athens 15780, Greece",National Technical University of Athens; National Technical University of Athens,"Papada, L (通讯作者)，Natl Tech Univ Athens, Metsov Interdisciplinary Res Ctr, 9 Heroon Polytech Str, Athens 15780, Greece.",lefklpap@metal.ntua.gr; dkal@central.ntua.gr,,"Papada, Lefkothea/0000-0002-8098-4251",,,,,42,64,66,3,35,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAY,2018,116.0,,,,,,153,164,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.02.004,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GD8JH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430758200016,0

However, in developing economies this is more challenging due to substantial revisions in GDP data and the limited availability of predictor variables. Taking India as a leading case, we use a dynamic factor model nowcasting method to analyse these two issues. Firstly, we propose to compare nowcasts of the first release of GDP to those of the final release to assess differences in their predictability. Secondly, we expand a standard set of predictors typically used for nowcasting GDP with nominal and international series, in order to proxy the variation in missing employment and service sector variables in India. We find that the factor model improves over several benchmarks, including bridge equations, but only for the final GDP release and not for the first release. Also, the nominal and international series improve predictions over and above real series. This suggests that future studies of nowcasting in developing economies which have similar issues of data revisions and availability as India should be careful in analysing first- vs. final-release GDP data, and may find that predictions are improved when additional variables from more timely international data sources are included.","[Bragoli, Daniela] Univ Cattolica, Dept Math Financial Math & Econometr, Via Necchi 9, I-29100 Milan, Italy; [Fosten, Jack] Univ East Anglia, Dept Econ, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; University of East Anglia,"Bragoli, D (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica, Dept Math Financial Math & Econometr, Via Necchi 9, I-29100 Milan, Italy.",daniela.bragoli@unicatt.it; j.fosten@uea.ac.uk,,,,,,,34,18,18,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

Hydropower, as a renewable energy source, is a key area in which Chinese technological cooperation and finance can contribute to sustainable growth. However, many of China's overseas hydropower projects remain controversial for their social and environmental impacts. This paper presents a comparative case study of a China Exim Bank-financed project and a World Bank-led multilateral project - both located in Cameroon - to highlight the commonalities and differences between China as a rising power and traditional Northern donors in the field of hydropower development. It examines the financiers' influence on tendering, financing and implementation, as well as pathways of technology transfers undertaken.

However, the barriers to its further diffusion in the urban environment have so far not been addressed. One feature of SWH diffusion in China is that it emerged from the rural market, mainly driven by market demand. This article explicitly focuses on China's diffusion of SWH from rural areas to urban cities and explores the problems and barriers obstructing its full potential in cities. Applying the Multi-level Perspective (MLP) framework, the results find that the technological niche is still not mature enough, and the urban regime is still powerful in terms of building infrastructure, consumer demand, policy coordination and vested interests. SWH development in China is promoted more as a business opportunity, while environmental discourses have not been powerful enough to promote further diffusion in the urban context. We suggest there is a need to focus on technology innovation with higher industry standards and to implement more benefit-based incentive policies to motivate incumbent actors.","[Yu, Zhen; Gibbs, David] Univ Hull, Sch Environm Sci, Kingston Upon Hull, N Humberside, England",University of Hull,"Yu, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Hull, Sch Environm Sci, Kingston Upon Hull, N Humberside, England.",yuzhen023@163.com,"Gibbs, David/ABE-7191-2020","Gibbs, David/0000-0001-8051-0024; Yu, Zhen/0000-0001-8029-3816",,,,,42,10,11,2,29,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,APR,2018,115.0,,,,,,366,373,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.01.041,0.0,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GA1TH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428099800036,0

This study investigates household-level energy consumption patterns, relevant socioeconomic factors and carbon-emissions from various energy sources. Using a semi-structured questionnaire, we conducted an explorative survey of 189 households in three income groups in a suburban region of Chittagong, Bangladesh. Results suggest that most of the households heavily depend on biomass energy that accounts for 87% of their monthly energy consumption and about two-thirds of energy expenditure. Contrariwise, dependence on non-renewable energy is minimal and accounts for households' 31% monthly energy expenditure. The rich households tend to rely more on electricity, candle, liquid petroleum gas (LPG) while their consumption of the non-renewables is significantly higher than that of medium income and poor households. Income, education and landholdings of households are positively correlated with expenditure for consuming convenient energy sources such as firewood, electricity and LPG. Firewood, the biomass fuel used most for cooking, is an energy source with the highest carbon emissions monthly about 192 kg carbon dioxide equivalent per household. Our research findings offer insights to enhance household-level clean energy access in Bangladesh and countries alike.","[Baul, T.

In doing so, we follow the approach by Martin (J Econ Geogr 12:1-32, 2012) and Martin and Sunley (2015) who identify three different dimensions to regional economic resilience: (a) resistance, i.e., the degree of sensitivity or depth of reaction of a regional economy to a recessionary shock; (b) recovery, i.e., the speed and magnitude of the recovery; (c) reorientation and renewal, i.e., the ability of a region to adapt in response to the shock and renew its growth path. The analysis is conducted at the local labor systems (LLS) geographical level and focuses, at this stage, only on the first two dimensions of resilience, i.e., resistance and recovery. The recessionary shock (2009-2010) is defined following the Italian National Statistical Institute approach for which a recession implies a decrease in GDP for three consecutive trimesters. The pre-recessionary period is 2007-2008 and the recovery period 2011 (as a new recession started again in Italy at the end of 2011). The results clearly point at very heterogeneous resilience for the Italian LLS.","[Faggian, Alessandra; Jaquet, Timothy] Ohio State Univ, AED Econ Dept, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Faggian, Alessandra] GSSI, Social Sci, Laquila, Italy; [Gemmiti, Roberta; Santini, Isabella] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Methods & Models Econ Terr & Finance, Rome, Italy",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Gran Sasso Science Institute (GSSI); Sapienza University Rome,"Faggian, A (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, AED Econ Dept, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.;Faggian, A (通讯作者)，GSSI, Social Sci, Laquila, Italy.",alessandra.faggian@gssi.infn.it; roberta.gemmiti@uniroma1.it; jaquet.5@osu.edu; isabella.santini@uniroma1.it,"Faggian, Alessandra/K-8548-2019","Faggian, Alessandra/0000-0002-2479-2933; SANTINI, Isabella/0000-0001-6834-8618",,,,,39,124,134,14,92,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

By 2030, experts indicate that more fundamental chemistry changes are possible, particularly under higher R&D funding scenarios, but are not inevitable. Experts suggest that significant improvements in cycle life (eg. doubling or greater) are more achievable than in cost, particularly by 2020, and that R&D could play a greater role in driving these. Experts expressed some concern, but had relatively little knowledge, of the environmental impact of LiBs.

Two main scenarios were developed: (1) a reference scenario considering the actual trends of the steel industry; and (2) a scenario where the use of charcoal from planted forests is stimulated for the additional steelmaking capacity. In addition, the effects of 13 Best Available Technologies (BAT) and one disruptive technology (TGRBF) on the industrial sector were calculated for both scenarios. Findings show that the increase in charcoal usage in pig iron production from 23.0% to 32.5% can reduce the total CO2 emissions in 11.3% in 2050, while the adoption of the BAT and TGRBF in new steel plants can reduce the CO2 emission levels in 15.6%. If both effects are considered, the CO2 reduction potential would reach 23.2% in 2050. As the TGRBF technology was developed to a coke based-route, a simply structural change towards charcoal (without using BATs) can be less effective in reducing cumulative CO2 emissions than applying BATs in a scenario without structural change. However, in terms of costs, the switch towards an increasing use of charcoal is less expensive. Correct incentives are needed in the industry to achieve such reduction levels.","[Pinto, Raphael Guimaraes D.; Szklo, Alexandre S.; Rathmann, Regis] Univ Fed Rio De Janeiro, Cetr Tecnol, Grad Sch Engn, Energy Planning Program, Bloco C,Sala 211 Cidade Univ Rho Fundelo, BR-21941972 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,"Pinto, RGD (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rio De Janeiro, Cetr Tecnol, Grad Sch Engn, Energy Planning Program, Bloco C,Sala 211 Cidade Univ Rho Fundelo, BR-21941972 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.",raphaelgduarte@gmail.com,"Szklo, Alexandre/AAP-8970-2021; Szklo, Alexandre/C-3315-2013; Rathmann, Régis/G-3842-2012","Szklo, Alexandre/0000-0002-7101-1810;","Ministerio das Ciencias, Tecnologia, Inovacao e Comunicacoes (MCTIC); Global Environmental Facility (GEF), as part of the study Opcoes de Mitigacao de Emissoes de Gases de Efeito Estufa em Setores-Chave no Brasil","Ministerio das Ciencias, Tecnologia, Inovacao e Comunicacoes (MCTIC); Global Environmental Facility (GEF), as part of the study Opcoes de Mitigacao de Emissoes de Gases de Efeito Estufa em Setores-Chave no Brasil","The authors would like to than National Counsel of Technological and Scientific Development (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico - CNPq), and the Federal Univeristy of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) for making this aticle possible.

Hourly simulation of a microgrid in which wind and/or hydrogen are produced is used for the analysis. Results show that using underground seasonal storage leads to the government paying less incentive per kg of CO2 emission reduction as it lowers levelized cost of hydrogen and provides a higher carbon emission reduction potential. Results also show that for the same incentive policy, incentivizing hydrogen production with grid electricity or a blend of wind power and grid electricity and producing hydrogen using wind power with underground hydrogen storage are more cost-efficient options for government than incentivizing wind power production alone. Regarding the renewable energy incentives, a combination of capital grant and FIT is shown to be more cost-efficient incentive program for the government than FIT only programs.

Syrup can be made from pondoh super snake fruit to increase the shelf life of this fruit. Stabilizer and thickener are needed in making syrup to keep the stability of syrup in order to prevent precipitation during storage. Therefore, it is necessary to add stabilizer and thickener in syrup such as Carboxy Methyl Cellulose (CMC). This study aimed to determine the effects of CMC types which added in various concentrations on chemical, physical, and organoleptic properties of snake fruit syrup. In this study, the fresh snake fruit fleshes were blanched, soaked in 5% salt solution, crushed, and filtrated to get snake fruit extract. The extract was added with CMC then homogenated for 2 minutes. 65% of sugar were added to the extract then heated in 100oC for 25 minutes followed by adding 0.01% of citric acid. The chemical properties (moisture content, total sugar, reducing sugar, and pH), physical properties (viscosity, color, and total soluble solid), and organoleptic properties (color, aroma, viscosity, flavor, and overall) of snake fruit syrup were analyzed. Randomize Complete Block Design was used in this study with 2 independent variables. First is CMC types (commercial and snake fruit) and second is CMC concentrations (0.1%; 0.3%; and 0.5%). This study was statistically analyzed by SPSS 20 using one way and two ways ANOVA then continued by using Duncan Multiple Range Test and T-test with 5% significance level. The result showed that adding snake fruit kernel CMC increased the moisture content, total sugar, reducing sugar, total phenolic compound, the reddish of color (a*) and decreased the total soluble solid, lightness and viscosity of snake fruit syrup. The adding of snake fruit kernel CMC can make the snake fruit syrup more stable. The increasing concentration of snake fruit kernel CMC increase viscosity, total soluble solid, decrease moisture content and reducing sugar and did not influence pH, antioxidant activity and yellowish color (b*) of snake fruit syrup. Overall, snake fruit syrup added by snake fruit kernel CMC had the lower hedonic score than snake fruit syrup was added by commercial CMC. Snake fruit syrup with 0.3% commercial CMC had the highest hedonic score.","[Anggrahini, Sri; Pratama, Olivia Andriyan] Gadjah Mada Univ, Fac Agr Technol, Dept Agroind Technol, Jl Flora 1, Bulaksumur 55281, Yogyakarta, Indonesia",Gadjah Mada University,"Anggrahini, S (通讯作者)，Gadjah Mada Univ, Fac Agr Technol, Dept Agroind Technol, Jl Flora 1, Bulaksumur 55281, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.",sri_anggrahini@ugm.ac.id,,"Anggrahini, Sri/0000-0002-7615-1281",,,,,17,0,0,0,3,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2413-0877,,,KNE LIFE SCI,,,2018,,,,,,,51,64,,10.18502/kls.v4i2.1657,0.0,,,14,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Science & Technology - Other Topics,BL1IO,,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447763100007,0

Regional Studies. Regional analyses require detailed and accurate information about dynamics happening within and between regional economies. However, regional input-output tables and trade flows are rarely observed and they must be estimated using up-to-date information. Common estimation approaches vary widely but consider tables and flows independently. By using commonly used economic assumptions and available economic information, this paper presents a method that integrates the estimation of regional input-output tables and trade flows across regions. Examples of the method implementation are presented and compared with other approaches, suggesting that the integrated approach provides advantages in terms of estimation accuracy and analytical capabilities.","[Boero, Riccardo; Edwards, Brian K.; Rivera, Michael K.] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Los Alamos National Laboratory,"Boero, R (通讯作者)，Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA.",riccardo@lanl.gov; bke@lanl.gov; mkrivera@lanl.gov,"Boero, Riccardo/AAF-2003-2020","Boero, Riccardo/0000-0002-7468-9096",National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center (NISAC) at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL),National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center (NISAC) at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)Los Alamos National Laboratory),The authors acknowledge the financial support of the National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center (NISAC) at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL).,,49,31,35,6,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

One of prerequisites of the cost optimization is the ability to be aware and avoid the mistakes made in the past, and knowledge of the history of cost management. Activities of Polish hospitals are financed by the National Health Fund, which was established after the liquidation of the sickness insurance funds. Earlier, the financial resources of local government units were used to finance health services in hospitals operating as budgetary units. Contracting of financing health services with the payer forced hospitals to analyse and rationalize operating costs. The aim of this article is to identify conditions (primarily barriers) of cost management in Polish hospitals. Analysis of the literature, legal acts and data on Polish hospital reporting, and the deduction method were used as research tools. An important role in the correct identification, valuation, presentation, reporting and cost analysis is played by the accounting of hospitals, including the appropriate and correct company hospital cost account. The corporate cost account allows for planning and controlling costs. Studying literature and observation of the economic practice leads to the research hypothesis that cost management in Polish hospitals is more and more often determined by external global factors.","[Chluska, Jolanta] Czestochowa Tech Univ, Czestochowa, Poland",Technical University Czestochowa,"Chluska, J (通讯作者)，Czestochowa Tech Univ, Czestochowa, Poland.",jolanta.chluska@wz.pcz.pl,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1112,1119,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300144,0

All member states excluding Denmark have committed to adopt the euro once they fulfil the necessary conditions, but no timetable is prescribed. Currently 19 of 28 member states use the euro, with Lithuania being the last country that adopted Euro in 2015. Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia aim to become the Eurozone member within several years, while Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland are just considering this possibility. The benefits of euro include stable prices, a more transparent and competitive market, more international trade, lower travel costs, and better access to capital. Residents of any country that has so far adopted the euro were afraid of price increases after the adoption of the euro. In the EU member states that have not adopted the common currency yet, almost two thirds of respondents think that introducing the euro will increase prices in their country. This paper analyses the inflationary changeover effect in Baltic states. The analysis is based on the consumer price indices (CPI) by COICOP divisions. The difference-in-differences method is used where the treated group is Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and the control group consists of selected EU member states. Our calculations show that the euro has either insignificant or small effect on consumer prices in evaluated countries.","[Gazdikova, Jana; Bohm, Patrik] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Quantitat Methods & Econ Informat, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Gazdikova, J (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Quantitat Methods & Econ Informat, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",jana.gazdikova@fpedas.uniza.sk; patrik.bohm@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Gazdikova, Jana/P-5077-2016; Bohm, Patrik/P-4697-2016","Gazdikova, Jana/0000-0001-6999-0880; Bohm, Patrik/0000-0002-3210-1055",,,,,23,0,0,0,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,2508,2515,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300321,0

The article draws attention to this issue in connection with the forthcoming tax concept for the period of 2020-2030, which is being prepared by the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic and it is also connected with the financial accounting and reporting.

The actual unemployment rate in the Czech Republic reached 2.3% in July 2018 and is lower than the natural rate of unemployment. Minimum and average wage has a growing tendency. This situation causes an excess of demand for labour over job offer. Additionally, the pressure to increase labour productivity, greater efficiency and lower costs forces companies to look for new ways to make savings and improve their production program. One of the ways, how to solve this problem is initiative Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 will lead to labour substitution using capital. The impact of Industry 4.0 on the labour market will be strong and is currently difficult to predict the result. Changes will have a global impact and they can manifest themselves as a decline in globalization. The aim of the article is to analyse the impacts of Industry 4.0 in the Czech Republic and throughout the European Union. In the second part of the article, there is an analysis of unemployment in context of age, education and gender, which is taking into account the impacts of Industry 4.0 and Work 4.0 on the labour market.

Antecedents included organizational (e.g., work structures), individual (e.g., personal initiative), and interpersonal (e.g., leader relationship) factors. Outcomes captured individual (e.g., reduced strain) and organizational benefits (e.g., task performance) and mediating processes (e.g., work characteristics).

Methodology: A competitiveness of the leading countries in the global market of robots is estimated by using the methods of economic statistics and index method. In order to take into account the differences in the size of the manufacturing industry in various countries, it is used a measure of density of robot workers. One such measure of robot density is the number of industrial robots per 10,000 persons employed in manufacturing industry. The data of International Federation of Robotics, Forbes, World Economic Forum, Deloitte are used. Results: The ratings of the selected countries by sales of industrial robots and competitiveness of the countries in development of the Industry 4.0 are determined. 72% of world sales of industrial robots are the share of 5 countries: China, Japan, USA, Republic of Korea and Germany.

It is often suggested that management accounting in Russian companies serves the role of an internal adviser. As the results of the research conducted show, this is a rather idealistic position reflecting wishful thinking. The results of the research demonstrate that from the point of view of practices prevailing in companies today, the current understanding of management accounting in Russian mid-sized companies is currently corresponding to the level at which management accounting in the countries with developed market economies had been twenty to thirty years ago. As illustrated by the results of the research, the current understanding of management accounting, and management accounting and controlling practices in the companies studied, both have a strong operational focus with an almost invisible strategic agenda and an insignificant contribution to the value creation and stewardship.","[Lebedev, Pavel] IEDC Bled Sch Management, Presernova Cesta 33, Bled 4260, Slovenia",,"Lebedev, P (通讯作者)，IEDC Bled Sch Management, Presernova Cesta 33, Bled 4260, Slovenia.",p.lebedev@inbox.ru,"Lebedev, Pavel/W-4271-2017","Lebedev, Pavel/0000-0002-5199-723X",Center for Financial Management and Education of the National Guild of Professional Consultants of Russia,Center for Financial Management and Education of the National Guild of Professional Consultants of Russia,This paper is an output of a science project conducted jointly with the Center for Financial Management and Education of the National Guild of Professional Consultants of Russia.,,21,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1196,1203,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300154,0

We estimate the model on equity returns and variance swap rates at different horizons. The total VRP is negative and has a downward-sloping term structure, while its jump component displays an upward-sloping term structure. The abrupt and persistent response of the short-term jump VRP to extreme events makes this specific premium a proxy for investors' fear of a market crash.

Among the most frequently identified problems is the issue of financial burden. It should be seen as a collection of all mandatory payments that businesses must bear in carrying out their activities in order to meet its tax and levies or administrative duties. All these obligations significantly affect the financial side, which can ultimately decide on the success or failure of the business entity. Tax burden in the widest sense can be understood as the percentage of tax on the tax base. Tax policy and fiscal impact are related to the tax burden. The aim of the paper is to review some indicators of tax burden in selected countries, to give their basic characteristics and thus to outline the possible optimal tax system. The tax burden is part of any economic activity carried out by a natural or legal person and taxes form the most important part of the revenue part of the state budget. From the perspective of economic reality, the tax system also performs other functions. They are tools of economic policy that the government can influence the course and functioning of economic life. The tax system should be, in each country, set up with the aim to lead to the stimulation, growth and expansion of economic life.","[Paliderova, Martina; Skolkova, Slavomira Micurova] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Paliderova, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",martina.paliderova@fpedas.uniza.sk; slavomira.micurova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Paliderova, Martina/P-3826-2015",,,,,,18,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,2719,2726,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300348,0

This paper examines London's development as the first Western offshore RMB centre established in 2013, drawing on original research conducted between 2013 and 2015 in London and China. The longitudinal analysis reveals that the development of RMB finance in London is characterized by selective adaptation in which state-private bargaining dynamics have shifted from strategic alignment to a bifurcation of interests. Understanding these state-finance relations has important implications for research and policy-making concerned with (offshore) financial centres and RMB internationalization.","[Topfer, Laura-Marie] Univ Oxford, Smith Sch Enterprise & Environm, Oxford, England; [Hall, Sarah] Univ Nottingham, Sch Geog, Nottingham, England",University of Oxford; University of Nottingham,"Hall, S (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Geog, Nottingham, England.",Laura-Marie.Topfer@ouce.ox.ac.uk; Sarah.hall@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Hall, sarah/0000-0001-5563-5909; Topfer, Laura-Marie/0000-0002-0680-4515",British Academy Mid Career Fellowship [MD130065]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES-J500112-1]; Royal Geographical Society [RGS-IBG Research Award]; Oxford Clarendon Fund [OUCF-2013]; Hertford College (Mann Senior Scholarship) of the University of Oxford [HC-MSS-2015],British Academy Mid Career Fellowship; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Royal Geographical Society [RGS-IBG Research Award]; Oxford Clarendon Fund; Hertford College (Mann Senior Scholarship) of the University of Oxford,"This work was supported by a British Academy Mid Career Fellowship awarded to Sarah Hall [grant number MD130065], and by grants awarded to Laura-Marie Topfer by the Economic and Social Research Council [grant number ES-J500112-1], the Royal Geographical Society [RGS-IBG Research Award] as well as the Oxford Clarendon Fund [grant number OUCF-2013] and Hertford College (Mann Senior Scholarship) of the University of Oxford [grant number HC-MSS-2015].",,43,31,34,0,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Regarding the equipment, players usually do not need anything else than a smartphone or a handheld GPS. However, playing the game may be time-consuming, so only people with secured basic needs may join it and play for longer time. Geocaching relates to the free movement closely, players are often travelling around their own country or visiting interesting places abroad. There are some requirements on the environment as well - placing and finding small containers must be tolerated by people in the community/society and cannot be restricted by administrative or other rules. The contribution asks and answers a question, whether there is a significant correlation between the relative number of geocaches and geocaches (in a state) on one hand and the Index of Economic Freedom and the Human Freedom Index on the other hand.

The output of the manufacturing industry is growing year on year. As a result, the pressure on production efficiency, resource utilization is steadily increasing. The margins of companies are decreasing. Companies that do not accept this trend and will not react to it in time will not survive for a long time.

This was a cluster analysis. The topology of the Kohonen maps was set at 10 x 10. Individual clusters of enterprises in the manufacturing industry were identified. Subsequently, these clusters were compared with each other. It was investigated which clusters are crucial to this industry, which annual outputs they perform and their proportion to the performance of the entire industry. The structure of the enterprises was examined in terms of the size of the individual enterprises, not the number of employees, but in terms of the realized performances.

The classic role that the state has lived for centuries is not enough today. It must both transform and expand its tasks, while remaining the most important player in the global economy. In a world in which globalization and international integration are spreading ever wider, it may seem that the state is being pushed to a further position. Globalization enforces changes in the institutional and legal order and limits the sovereignty of the state. In the environment of emerging new entities, such as transnational corporations or various international organizations, its participation in creating reality is falling relatively. On the one hand, the globalization process needs a strong, efficient state, which must take up new challenges, on the other, the more the process of uniformity intensifies, the more societies defend their identity. Even if the state is more the administrator of international institutions than a sovereign, it does not seem that the institution of the national state will disappear.The aim of the paper is to look at the role of the state in changing conditions related to the globalization and international integration processes and an attempt to answer the question about the scope of sovereignty of the modern state.","[Zagora-Jonszta, Urszula] Univ Econ Katowice, Ul 1 Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Zagóra-Jonszta, U (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, Ul 1 Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland.",urszula.zagora-jonszta@ue.katowice.pl,,,,,,,22,0,0,1,7,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,461,467,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300061,0

The empirical results indicate that deregulation and market competition decrease the former, but increase the latter. These results are followed by a discussion on why this scenario occurs. The results also suggest that, after deregulation, utilities focus more on short-term, business-oriented R & D projects.

These findings are matters of major concern to policy makers as the shift towards more decentralized power systems must be sustainable, and although this brings great opportunities, it also pauses important challenges. The transition calls for policy and regulation attention. For some researchers, DG development should be accompanied with design changes to distribution tariffs, the addition of connection charge and modifications to Net Metering, while for others, certain of these measures could discourage DG investments. In this context and given multiple uncertainties, the authors propose a system dynamics model to examine the effect of the diffusion of Photovoltaic technology on the revenues of utilities and customers. The paper concludes that for the Colombian case, it is possible under certain conditions to attain a balance between social welfare and the aversion of the utility death spiral through systemic interventions.","[Castaneda, Monica; Jimenez, Maritza; Zapata, Sebastian; Franco, Carlos J.; Dyner, Isaac] Univ Nacl Colombia, Bogota, Colombia; [Castaneda, Monica; Zapata, Sebastian; Dyner, Isaac] Univ Jorge Tadeo Lozano, Bogota, Colombia; [Jimenez, Maritza] Univ Pontificia Bolivariana, Medellin, Colombia",Universidad Nacional de Colombia; Universidad de Bogota Jorge Tadeo Lozano; Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana,"Dyner, I (通讯作者)，Carrera 80 65-223,Bloque M8A, Medellin, Colombia.",mcastanr@unal.edu.co; mjimenezz@unal.edu.co; szapatar@unal.edu.co; cjfranco@unal.edu.co; idyner@unal.edu.co,"Zapata, Sebastian/AAU-7029-2021; Franco, Carlos Jaime/G-5181-2011","Dyner, Isaac/0000-0003-3318-5972; Jimenez, Maritza/0000-0001-6107-4319",Colciencias; Universidad Nacional de Colombia,"Colciencias(Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion Colciencias); Universidad Nacional de Colombia",The authors acknowledge the financial support provided by Colciencias and Universidad Nacional de Colombia for this research.

If they are indeed build, in order to avoid a dangerous level of global warming, it may appear necessary to dispose of these plants' CO2 by burying it in deep underground geological formations instead of releasing it into the atmosphere, using carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. We show that CCS has a technical potential in Vietnam, according to the geology and the industrial geography. To discuss under which economics conditions this potential could actualize, we examine two scenarios for 2050. In the fast scenario, CO2 is used in Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) only. EOR technology makes CCS cheaper by injecting CO2 in partially depleted oil field, aiming to recover more oil. The second scenario considers CCS deployment in coal-based power plants, on top of using it for EOR. In both scenarios, a few gas-fired CCS power plants are build, reaching 1 GW in 2030, supported by Enhanced Oil Recovery and international carbon finance. The decision point where the two scenarios diverge is in 2030. A scenario to switch all currently existing or planned power plants to low-carbon by 2050 is to retrofit 3.2 GW of coal-fired capacity and install 1.2 GW of gas-fired capacity with CCS every year, starting in 2035 for 15 years. Capture readiness would lower the costs of using CCS in Vietnam, but is not mandatory today.","[Ha-Duong, Minh] CNRS, CIRED, 45 Ave Belle Gabrielle, Nogent Sur Marne, France; [Ha-Duong, Minh; Hoang Anh Nguyen-Trinh] USTH, CleanED, Cau Giay, Ha Noi, Vietnam",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; AgroParisTech; Universite Paris Saclay; Vietnam Academy of Science & Technology (VAST); University of Science & Technology of Hanoi (USTH),"Ha-Duong, M (通讯作者)，CNRS, CIRED, 45 Ave Belle Gabrielle, Nogent Sur Marne, France.",minh.haduong@gmail.com,,"Ha-Duong, Minh/0000-0001-9988-2100",Mines ParisTech CTSC Chair grant,Mines ParisTech CTSC Chair grant,"We acknowledge the support of Dr. Didier Bonijoly, BRGM, with respect to the geological information.

By using a game theory model, this article captures the differences of two important types of subsidies: fixed subsides and output subsidies. Some interesting conclusions are achieved, and some social phenomena are rationally explained. Firstly, increasing total subsidies increases the number of subsidized firms. Moreover, fiercer competition produces more firms to be subsidized. Thus, the number of subsidized firms depends on the competition in this industry. Secondly, output subsidies achieve a higher consumer surplus and a lower producer surplus than do fixed subsidies. Therefore, consumers like output subsidies, while firms like fixed subsidies. Finally, output subsidies achieve a more favorable environmental impact and subsidize more firms than do fixed subsidies. That is, the environmental effects of output subsidies dominate those of fixed subsidies. In summary, based on both the effects on the environment and the consumer surplus, this article supports output subsidies and explains the advantages of output subsidies.","[Nie, Pu-Yan; Wang, Chan] Guangdong Univ Finance & Econ GDUFE, Sch Finance, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Sci Finance & Ind, Inst Guangdong Econ & Social Dev, Guangzhou 510320, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yon-Cong] Guangdong Univ Foreign Studies, Guangzhou 510420, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Guangdong University of Finance & Economics; Guangdong University of Foreign Studies,"Wang, C (通讯作者)，Guangdong Univ Finance & Econ GDUFE, Sch Finance, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Sci Finance & Ind, Inst Guangdong Econ & Social Dev, Guangzhou 510320, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",wangchan512@163.com,"NIE, Pu-yan/J-3547-2019","NIE, Pu-yan/0000-0002-6214-5980","National Natural Science Foundation of PRC [71271100, 71401057]; Collaborative Innovation Center of Scientific Finance industry; Innovative Group Foundation (Humanities and Social Sciences) for Higher Education of Guangdong Province [2015WCXTD009]",National Natural Science Foundation of PRC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Collaborative Innovation Center of Scientific Finance industry; Innovative Group Foundation (Humanities and Social Sciences) for Higher Education of Guangdong Province,"This work is partially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of PRC (71271100, 71401057), Collaborative Innovation Center of Scientific Finance & industry, and, Innovative Group Foundation (Humanities and Social Sciences) for Higher Education of Guangdong Province (2015WCXTD009).",,36,41,41,9,72,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2017,110.0,,,,,,144,149,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.07.053,0.0,,,6,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FP5LK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417660800015,0

We classify the revenue streams, customer segments, electricity services provided, and resources for 144 business models. We use this assessment to identify a set of business model archetypes in each resource category. Our analysis leads us to five observations that have important implications for policymakers and regulators. First, our analysis highlights that business models are deeply embedded in myriad policy and regulatory frameworks. Second, current DER business models are driven more by regulatory and policy factors than by technological factors. Third, the relatively small set of well-defined DER business model archetypes suggests that the determinants of success within a given archetype may include executional capabilities, culture, and other activities that are not captured in our framework. Fourth, continued cost declines, technological innovation, and changing policy and regulatory landscapes mean the business models of tomorrow will likely look very different than the business models of today. Finally, DER business models compete within archetypes for market share in providing a limited set of electricity services.","[Burger, Scott P.] MIT, MIT Energy Initiat, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; MIT, MIT Inst Data Syst & Soc, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Burger, SP (通讯作者)，MIT, MIT Energy Initiat, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",sburger@mit.edu; mluke@mit.edu,,,consortium of funders under the construct of the MIT Utility of the Future project,consortium of funders under the construct of the MIT Utility of the Future project,"The authors would like to thank all of the contributors to this research; specifically, Prof. Ignacio J.

Accordingly, energy efficiency policies have to be adapted to different situations. The present paper analyzes the relationships between the EET of European Union (EU) business end-users and three contextual factors, i.e. high energy prices, stringency of regulations, and society's alertness toward environment conservation. Enterprises from 9 EU Member States have been grouped according to country, industry and size. The final sample includes 256 enterprise classes, and the model controls for the innovation propensity and energy intensity of each enterprise class. Our results show that regulatory stringency is the most impactful contextual factor, while the environmental alertness of society does not have a significant effect. Concerns over energy costs have not been found to drive EET per se, but more energy-intensive enterprise classes are more likely to react to high energy prices. We discuss the implications of our results for the EU governments that are currently monitoring and refining the transposition of the 2012 Energy Efficiency Directive.","[Garrone, Paola; Grilli, Luca; Mrkajic, Boris] Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, Via Lambruschini 4b, I-20156 Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan,"Garrone, P (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, Via Lambruschini 4b, I-20156 Milan, Italy.",paola.garrone@polimi.it; luca.grilli@polimi.it; boris.mrkajic@polimi.it,"Grilli, Luca/K-6348-2017","garrone, paola/0000-0002-0953-5007",,,,,58,12,12,0,20,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,49,58,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.06.054,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400005,0

In a linear model, it is possible to obtain the best of both worlds by making random effects-type assumptions on the time-invariant explanatory variables while maintaining the flexibility of a fixed effects approach when it comes to the time-varying covariates.

The dynamics of material flows over time are captured, taking account for the life expectancy of PV technology. Requirements of solar grade silicon and silver for crystalline silicon (c-Si) technology, as well as indium, gallium, selenium, tellurium, and cadmium for currently commercial thin film (TF) technology are explored, accounting for different technology choices and potential improvements in material intensities. Future availability of these materials from primary resources, as well as secondary resources from end-of-life recycling, is also analyzed. Rapid deployment of c-Si technologies would require a major expansion of solar grade silicon production, and significant quantities of silver. Availability of materials such as indium and tellurium could become problematic for major implementation of TF technology, unless production can be scaled up significantly, or material intensities radically decreased. Availability of secondary resources from end-of-life recycling have little impact on material availability during the growth phase, but could be important for sustaining a low-carbon energy system over longer time perspectives. Material availability could cause problems for rapid PV growth, but does not necessarily limit total PV deployment, especially if material intensities are decreased.","[Davidsson, Simon; Hook, Mikael] Uppsala Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Villavagen 16, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden",Uppsala University,"Davidsson, S (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Global Climate & Energy Project, 473 Via Ortega, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",simon.davidsson@stanford.edu; mikael.hook@geo.uu.se,"Höök, Mikael/I-3479-2019; Davidsson Kurland, Simon/A-3635-2016","Höök, Mikael/0000-0002-6379-7104; Davidsson Kurland, Simon/0000-0003-0794-5536",STandUP for Energy collaboration initiative,STandUP for Energy collaboration initiative,This study has been supported by the STandUP for Energy collaboration initiative.

Many studies assume a role for nuclear power in the new energy economy, and the nuclear industry anticipates an eventual transition from light water reactors to advanced, non-light water designs. The development of these advanced reactors is emblematic of the type of dramatic change that is needed to transition from fossil fuels and deeply decarbonize the energy system. The Office of Nuclear Energy (NE) in the U.S. is entrusted with the allocation of public sector expenditures for this transition, but there is little to show for its efforts; no advanced design is remotely ready for deployment. Here, we report results from structured interviews we conducted with 30 nuclear energy veterans to elicit their impressions of the state of U.S. fission innovation. Most experts assessed NE as having been largely unsuccessful in enabling the development of advanced designs. The interview results highlight the importance of leadership and programmatic discipline, and how their absence leads to poor performance in driving change. Responses point to the likely demise of nuclear power and nuclear science in the U.S. without significant improvements in leadership, focus and political support.","[Ford, Michael J.; Morgan, M.

Bridging this divide only adds to the already daunting challenge of securing climate stabilization. In fact, efforts towards the former are more likely to conflict with the latter. To be able to address this dilemma, the relationship between energy consumption and human well-being, beyond its economic dimension, needs to be better understood. This paper aims to contribute to the emerging knowledge base, by examining this relationship using a proxy for human well-being that also considers its environmental and social dimensions. The ultimate goal of this paper is to investigate the potential incompatibility between efforts towards the achievement of higher collective well-being and those associated with climate stabilization. To this end, it provides estimates of the additional energy needed and its associated carbon emissions under different climate scenarios, and compares them with existing carbon budgets. Results indicate that even if new climate policies were adopted, emissions associated with higher well-being in all regions where improvements are needed could still reach up to one and a half times estimated 2 degrees C budgets, and even more so for lower temperature increase targets.","[Ribas, Aline; Lucena, Andre F.

To do this, further efficiencies in energy use are needed across all sectors, many of which still offer considerable potential for improving energy efficiency. Rental properties in particular, have seen very few improvements in energy efficiency due to a range of barriers and market failures including misinformation, split incentives and an uneven power dynamic between renters and landlords. This is important as not only do rental properties account for a significant proportion of housing stock, the high proportion of low income households in rental properties are particularly vulnerable to rising energy prices. This study aimed to identify feasible policy solutions for overcoming the barriers to energy efficiency improvements in rental properties. Renters, landlords and agents were presented with five possible solutions to determine their level of support. Eight key recommendations for overcoming the barriers to energy efficiency improvements in rental properties are provided. These create a foundation for policy makers, councils and businesses to develop and target energy efficiency solutions for rental properties.","[Wrigley, Koel; Crawford, Robert H.] Univ Melbourne, Fac Architecture Bldg & Planning, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Crawford, RH (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Fac Architecture Bldg & Planning, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",koel.wrigley@gmail.com; rhcr@unimelb.edu.au,"Crawford, Robert/C-4547-2016; Crawford, Robert/N-7428-2019","Crawford, Robert/0000-0002-0189-3221; Crawford, Robert/0000-0002-0189-3221",,,,,44,21,23,1,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2017,108.0,,,,,,369,378,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.06.009,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FC3FZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406725800037,0

The Sustainable /Development Goal seven (SDG7) aspires to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030. This will require transition toward modern cooking fuels such as Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and electricity. In Latin American and the Caribbean (LAC), 90 million people still rely on solid fuels for cooking. Access and price have been identified as the main factors that limit substitution of solid fuels by clean fuels. In this paper, we present an exploritory analysis of the effects of subsidy policies for LPG in reducing USF in LAC countries when controlling for indicators of socioeconomic development and urbanization. In LAC, subsidies to LPG have substantially contributed to accelerate the transition from USF to clean fuels for cooking. Targeted subsidies should be considered as a policy option to implement the SDG7 on clean energy. Making clean energy accessible to all has the co-benefits of preventing diseases and premature deaths. Understanding the transition processes from USF to cleaner fuels made by LAC countries can better inform policy making in other regions.","[Troncoso, Karin; da Silva, Agnes Soares] WHO, Pan Amer Hlth Org, 525 23 St NW, Washington, DC 20037 USA",Pan American Health Organization; World Health Organization,"Troncoso, K (通讯作者)，WHO, Pan Amer Hlth Org, 525 23 St NW, Washington, DC 20037 USA.",troncosok@paho.org,"da Silva, Agnes Soares/H-8070-2012","da Silva, Agnes Soares/0000-0003-2618-6061; Troncoso, Karin/0000-0002-4348-0994",,,,,55,75,79,0,12,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2017,107.0,,,,,,188,196,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.04.046,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FA0WU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000405158200019,0

Examining the case of a country, Finland, which introduced policy measures to diversify its renewable energy portfolio, we analyse the development of investments in renewable heat and power in response to new policy measures and contextual factors during the downturn period 2009-2013. We investigate investor heterogeneity, i.e., the diversity of logics employed by different types of RES investors. In spite of a severe financial recession, we find an emergence of new sources of investment. Among these new investor types, we find diversity in investment drivers and available options. These include investors mobilized by the feed-in-tariff to seek profitable targets and investors such as real estate owners investing in heat pumps for their own use and benefiting from low interest rates. We find that the diversification of investors supports the diversification in RES sources, and brings in new investors undeterred by the financial downturn. Our findings imply that policy-makers should recognize that the responses to distinct incentives and pressures vary by investor types. This also means that a mix of policies is required to maximize the contribution of different sectors to filling the renewable energy investment gap.","[Heiskanen, Eva] Univ Helsinki, Dept Polit & Econ Studies, POB 33, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Jalas, Mikko] Aalto Univ, Sch Arts Design & Architecture, POB 21230, Aalto 00076, Finland; [Juntune, Jouni K.; Nissila, Hell] Aalto Univ, Sch Business, Dept Management Studies, POB 21230, Aalto 00076, Finland",University of Helsinki; Aalto University; Aalto University,"Jalas, M (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Sch Arts Design & Architecture, POB 21230, Aalto 00076, Finland.",mikko.jalas@aalto.fi,"Juntunen, Jouni K./I-8315-2015","Juntunen, Jouni K./0000-0001-8137-8985","Strategic Research Council at the Academy of Finland, Smart Energy Transition project [293405]; Marcus Wallenberg foundation grant 'CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION OF A MARKET FOR NEW ENERGY SOLUTIONS IN FINLAND'","Strategic Research Council at the Academy of Finland, Smart Energy Transition project; Marcus Wallenberg foundation grant 'CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION OF A MARKET FOR NEW ENERGY SOLUTIONS IN FINLAND'","This work has been supported by the Strategic Research Council at the Academy of Finland, Smart Energy Transition project (293405) and Marcus Wallenberg foundation grant 'CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION OF A MARKET FOR NEW ENERGY SOLUTIONS IN FINLAND'.

Feed-in-Tariffs (FITs) offer cost based prices for renewable electricity to compete with conventional energy producers. The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) issues certified emission reduction (CER) credits that generate additional revenues, enhancing renewable projects' return on investment. This study investigated how these subsidies impact the financial returns on Korea's CDM projects. An investment analysis was performed on four cases including solar, hydropower, wind and landfill gas projects. Revenues from electricity sales, FITs and CERs were compared using financial indicators to measure their relative contributions on profitability. Results indicate that CDM is partial towards large scale projects with high emission reductions. Moreover, conflicts with FIT schemes can deter small scale, capital intensive projects from pursuing registration. The analysis highlights CDM's bias for particular project types, which is in part due to its impartiality towards carbon credit prices. It also reveals that Korea, a key benefactor of CDM, is susceptible to such biases, as demonstrated by the disproportionate distribution of issued CERs. Improving incentives for bundled, small scale projects, CER price differentiation, and excluding domestic subsidies during additionality testing are proposed as possible reforms.","[Koo, Bonsang] Seoul Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, 232 Gongneung Ro, Seoul 01811, South Korea",Seoul National University of Science & Technology,"Koo, B (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, 232 Gongneung Ro, Seoul 01811, South Korea.",bonsang@seoultech.ac.kr,"Koo, Bonsang/HHS-3859-2022; Koo, Bonsang/AAE-6100-2022",,"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)-Ministry of Education, South Korea [2016R1D1A1B03931198]","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)-Ministry of Education, South Korea","This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by Ministry of Education, South Korea (grant number: 2016R1D1A1B03931198).",,28,25,26,0,35,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAY,2017,104.0,,,,,,144,154,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.01.017,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP7HS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397549500015,0

(e.g. if average lifetime of air conditioners is shortened by 1 year, energy efficiency of air conditioners have to be further improved by 20.6% from current level.","[Nishijima, Daisuke] Kyushu Univ, Fac Econ, Fukuoka, Japan",Kyushu University,"Nishijima, D (通讯作者)，Kyushu Univ, Higashi Ku, 6-19-1 Hakozaki, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan.",nishijindaiko@gmail.com,,"Nishijima, Daisuke/0000-0002-9091-1785",,,,,33,10,10,0,41,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAY,2017,104.0,,,,,,340,347,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.01.045,0.0,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP7HS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397549500033,0

It is shown that the estimated thresholds are n-consistent, each of which converges weakly to the smallest minimizer of a two-sided compound Poisson process. The remaining parameters are-consistent and asymptotically normal. Based on this theory, a score-based test is developed to identify the number of thresholds in the model. Furthermore, we construct a mixed sign-based portmanteau test for model checking. Simulation study is carried out to access the performance of our procedure and a real example is given.","[Yang, Yaxing] Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yaxing] Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Ling, Shiqing] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Math, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Xiamen University; Xiamen University; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Yang, YX (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, Xiamen, Peoples R China.;Yang, YX (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ, Xiamen, Peoples R China.",yyangaj@gmail.com; maling@ust.hk,,"Ling, Shiqing/0000-0002-4232-7744","Hong Kong Research Grants Commission [HKUST641912, HKUST603413]",Hong Kong Research Grants Commission,The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from Hong Kong Research Grants Commission Grants HKUST641912 and HKUST603413.,,42,5,5,3,20,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0735-0015,1537-2707,,J BUS ECON STAT,J.

However, donors' funding has been focused mainly on the development and diffusion of technical knowledge. We find that this pattern of ODA support has not fostered balanced and effective Technology Innovation Systems, and that this has contributed to the failure to achieve widespread diffusion of improved cookstoves.

This paper explores licensing by means of royalty licensing and equity licensing in a Hotelling linear city model. Given a covered market, this paper shows that the insider patentee would like to choose equity licensing when the transport rate relative to the innovation size is large, while selecting royalty licensing otherwise. Next, provided that the market is uncovered post licensing, this paper finds that equity and fixed-fee licensing are indifferent to the patentee and are both superior to royalty licensing. Resumen La literatura existente sobre titulares privilegiados de patentes indica que el contrato de licencia optimo es el de derechos de licencia bajo competencia de Bertrand. Este articulo examina la concesion de licencias mediante licencias de derechos y licencias mediante participacion de capital en un modelo de ciudad lineal de Hotelling. En un mercado cubierto, este trabajo demuestra que el titular de la patente privilegiado elegiria la concesion de licencias mediante participacion de capital cuando la tasa de transporte en relacion con el tamano de la innovacion es grande, mientras que en el resto de casos elegiria otorgar derechos de licencia. A continuacion, y a condicion de que el mercado este descubierto despues de la concesion de licencias, este articulo encontro que al titular de la patente le es indiferente la concesion de licencias mediante participacion de capital y mediante tarifa fija, y que ambas son superiores a la concesion de derechos de licencia. ??: ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

In this study, a comprehensive techno-economic analysis is undertaken to evaluate the economic feasibility of ongoing national projects and the technical compatibility with China's future fuel cycle transition. We investigated the dynamic impacts of technical and economic uncertainties in the lifecycle of a nuclear system. The electricity generation costs associated with four potential fuel cycle transition scenarios were simulated by probabilistic and deterministic approaches and then compared in detail. The results showed that the total cost of a once-through system is lowest compared those of other advanced systems involving reprocessing and recycling. However, thanks to the consequential uncertainties caused by the further progress toward technology maturity, the economic potential of fuel recycling options was proven through a probabilistic uncertainty analysis. Furthermore, it is recommended that a compulsory executive of closed fuel cycle policy would pose some investment risk in the near term, though the execution of a series of R & D initiatives with a flexible roadmap would be valuable in the long run.","[Gao, Ruxing] Korea Univ Sci & Technol, 217 Gajeong Ro, Daejeon 305353, South Korea; [Gao, Ruxing; Ko, Won Il; Kim, Sungki] Korea Atom Energy Res Inst, Nonproliferat Syst Res Div, 989-111 Daedeok Daero, Daejeon 305353, South Korea; [Choi, Sungyeol] Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Mech & Nucl Engn, UNIST Gil 50, Ulsan 689798, South Korea",University of Science & Technology (UST); Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI); Ulsan National Institute of Science & Technology (UNIST),"Ko, WI (通讯作者)，Korea Atom Energy Res Inst, Nonproliferat Syst Res Div, 989-111 Daedeok Daero, Daejeon 305353, South Korea.",nwiko@kaeri.re.kr,"Choi, Sungyeol/K-5748-2015",,"Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning [2012M2A8A5025944]","Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning(Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea)","This work was supported by the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning (Grant no. 2012M2A8A5025944) under the Nuclear R & D project.",,33,13,15,0,25,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2017,101.0,,,,,,526,536,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.10.021,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EI8PD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000392768800053,0

Yet definitions of subsidies vary widely and, as a result, estimates of their global magnitude vary by orders of magnitude. I review why energy subsidies are so difficult to define and measure. I show why some non-standard measures are very poor proxies for subsidy costs and in fact may vary inversely with them. In particular, recent attempts to treat unpriced externalities as subsidies yield especially misleading results. In general, energy subsidies as conventionally understood do exist but only comprise a small portion of some very large recently-reported estimates, the bulk of which are indirect measures that may have little connection with actual costs to governments or allocational inefficiencies.","[McKitrick, Ross] Univ Guelph, Dept Econ & Finance, Guelph, ON N1G 2M5, Canada",University of Guelph,"McKitrick, R (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Econ & Finance, Guelph, ON N1G 2M5, Canada.",ross.maitrick@uoguelph.ca,,,,,,,21,16,17,0,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2017,101.0,,,,,,379,385,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.10.035,0.0,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EI8PD,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000392768800038,0

Currently, it is approximated as the average emissions of the whole system, despite an acknowledgement that wind will actually displace only the generators operating on the margin. This article presents a methodology to isolate the marginal emissions displacement of wind power from historical empirical data, taking into account the impact on the operating efficiency of coal and CCGT plants. For Great Britain over 2009-2014, it was found that marginal emissions displacement has generally been underestimated with, for example, the emissions displacement factor for wind being 21% higher than that the average emissions factor in 2010. The actual displacement depends upon the relative merit of coal and CCGT, with a greater discrepancy between marginal displacement and average emissions during more normal system operation, suggesting that policies to penalise high-carbon generation can increase the effectiveness of wind at reducing GHG emissions. Furthermore, it was also identified that wind power is almost as technically effective as demand-side reductions at decreasing GHG emissions from power generation.","[Thomson, R.

Yet, the results do not always fulfill the expectations. The regulator's market-clearing mechanism is a strategic choice that may affect the level of competition in the market. We conceive of the market-clearing mechanism as composed of two components: pricing rules and rationing policies. We investigate the strategic behavior of power generation companies under different market-clearing mechanisms using an agent-based simulation model which integrates a game-theoretical understanding of the auction mechanism in the electricity market and generation companies' learning mechanism. Results of our simulation experiments are presented using various case studies representing different market settings. The market in simulations is observed to converge to a Nash equilibrium of the stage game or to a similar state under most parameter combinations. Compared to pay-as-bid pricing, bid prices are closer to marginal costs on average under uniform pricing while GenCos' total profit is also higher. The random rationing policy of the ISO turns out to be more successful in achieving lower bid prices and lower GenCo profits. In minimizing GenCos' total profit, a combination of pay-as-bid pricing rule and random rationing policy is observed to be the most promising.","[Aliabadi, Danial Esmaeili; Kaya, Murat; Sahin, Guvenc] Sabanci Univ, Fac Engn & Nat Sci, Istanbul, Turkey",Sabanci University,"Sahin, G (通讯作者)，Sabanci Univ, Fac Engn & Nat Sci, Istanbul, Turkey.",danialesm@sabanciuniv.edu; mkaya@sabanciuniv.edu; guvencs@sabanciuniv.edu,"Esmaeili Aliabadi, Danial/H-4286-2018; Esmaeili Aliabadi, Danial/AAE-8874-2020; Kaya, Murat/G-6178-2014; Sahin, Guvenc/H-3486-2011","Esmaeili Aliabadi, Danial/0000-0003-2922-2400; Esmaeili Aliabadi, Danial/0000-0003-2922-2400; Kaya, Murat/0000-0001-8975-8886; Sahin, Guvenc/0000-0002-8623-7257",,,,,29,48,57,3,57,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JAN,2017,100.0,,,,,,191,205,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.09.063,0.0,,,15,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EH6SJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000391903900019,0

We study the nonparametric identification and estimation of a structural model, where such discrepancies are rationalized by the members' unobserved types, which consist of ideological bias while weighing different sources of information, and tastes for multiple objectives announced in the policy target. We consider models with and without strategic incentives for members to make recommendations that conform to the final committee decision. We show that pure-strategy Bayesian Nash equilibria exist in both cases, and that the variation in common information recorded in the data helps us to recover the distribution of private types from the members' choices. Building on the identification result, we estimate a structural model of interest rate decisions by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at the Bank of England. We find some evidence that the external committee members are less affected by strategic incentives for conformity in their recommendations than the internal members. We also find that the difference in ideological bias between external and internal members is statistically insignificant.

Regional Studies. This paper presents a model of firm localization in which the intrinsic advantages of regions are disentangled from localized externalities, while this latter force is allowed to have a quadratic shape. Through inferential analysis, it is verified whether the quadratic component of localized externalities is statistically different from zero. Such a term can reflect more-than-linear positive feedbacks as well as congestion effects, so that the sign of the interdependencies stemming from localization is not assumed a priori to be positive. The main result is that the quadratic term is virtually never statistically different from zero across Italian sectors observed at the scale of commuting zones, so that localized externalities seem to be well approximated by a linear specification.","[Bottazzi, Giulio; Vanni, Fabio] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Econ, Pisa, Italy; [Gragnolati, Ugo M.] Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, Paris, France",Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna,"Gragnolati, UM (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, Paris, France.",giulio.bottazzi@sssup.it; ugo.gragnolati@univ-paris1.fr; fabio.vanni@sssup.it,,"Vanni, Fabio/0000-0001-5624-4213; Bottazzi, Giulio/0000-0003-2565-4732; Gragnolati, Ugo Maurizio/0000-0001-6473-1580",,,,,36,2,2,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Generally, new models adapted to the conditions of same country and the global economic situation are being created and used. One of the most widely used methods for creating bankruptcy models is the logistic regression model. One of the first logit models was the already mentioned Ohlson logit model, created in 1980 under the conditions of the US economy. Since then, many logit bankruptcy models have emerged in many countries around the world, including the Slovak Republic. In this paper we analyze the potential of using both foreign and Slovak logit models to predict the financial health of companies operating in the current conditions of the Slovak economy, which are largely influenced by globalization.

While the tendency of economic globalisation might appear to reduce the importance of distinctiveness, a tendency of industry localisation seems to do exactly the opposite. Current tendencies of globalisation and localisation have created challenges for policy of national and local governments. A dramatic proliferation of policies based on cluster cooperation is one response to these challenges. The process of globalisation creates higher demand on the adoption of highly flexible innovative solutions. However, in many cases are SMEs not capable of their performing. Research among young entrepreneurs has proved that one out of four entrepreneurs is starting business without previous experience and approximately one third of all do not even know how to reach out to a customer. Strategic alliance of enterprises called network business and clusters have become very attractive. The globalisation and technological development bring a specific form of network business - virtual organisation. Simplifying communication channels has facilitated marketing, sales promotion and advertising through the Internet. SMEs are attracted by advantages of e-commerce and e-business such as the scope and possibilities of trading on the global market, reducing of administration costs, wider price ranges etc. Based on the localisation coefficient calculation, the analysis of current state of cluster initiatives in Spain and abroad the authors propose a potential tourism cluster for Murcia.","[Gasova, Katarina; Stofkova, Jana] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Commun, Zilina, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Gasová, K (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Commun, Zilina, Slovakia.",katarina.gasova@fpedas.uniza.sk; jana.stofkova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Gašová, Katarína/P-8961-2016",,VEGA [1/0693/16],VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This paper is an output of the science project VEGA 1/0693/16.,,22,1,1,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,479,486,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059200064,0

Firstly the key determinants of European unemployment are stated, including a summary of the main findings regarding the labour markets after the 2008 Global Crisis. The following econometric analysis focuses on the stated two groups of countries in order to reveal changes in the variability of unemployment in the period from 2008 to 2016, which is measured as a proportion of unemployed persons of active population. The methodologic approach to the variability measure leans on the analysis of sigma convergence/divergence outlining possible decreasing or increasing trends in unemployment and beta convergence/divergence investigating whether the unemployment rates in individual countries that were more affected by the crises decrease faster or slower than in the less affected economies of the given groups.

However, a crowd typically rates tourism resources using multi-criteria, i.e., each user provides multiple ratings per item. In order to apply standard collaborative filtering, it is necessary to have a unique classification per user and item. This unique classification can be based on a single rating single criterion (SC) profiling or on the multiple ratings available multi criteria (MC) profiling. Exploring both SC and MC profiling, this work proposes: (iota) the selection of the most representative crowd-sourced rating; and (iota iota) the combination of the different user ratings per item, using the average of the non-null ratings or the personalised weighted average based on the user rating profile. Having employed matrix factorisation to predict unknown ratings, we argue that the personalised combination of multi-criteria item ratings improves the tourist profile and, consequently, the quality of the collaborative predictions. Thus, this paper contributes to a novel approach for guest profiling based on multi-criteria hotel ratings and to the prediction of hotel guest ratings based on the Alternating Least Squares algorithm. Our experiments with crowd-sourced Expedia and TripAdvisor data show that the proposed method improves the accuracy of the hotel rating predictions.","[Leal, Fatima] Univ Vigo, Sch Telecommun Engn, INESC TEC, Oporto, Portugal; [Gonzalez-Velez, Horacio] Natl Coll Ireland, Cloud Competency Ctr, Dublin, Ireland; [Malheiro, Benedita] Inst Politecn Porto, Sch Engn, INESC TEC, Oporto, Portugal; [Carlos Burguillo, Juan] Univ Vigo, Sch Telecommun Engn, Oporto, Portugal",Universidade de Vigo; INESC TEC; National College of Ireland; Instituto Politecnico do Porto; INESC TEC; Universidade de Vigo,"Leal, F (通讯作者)，Univ Vigo, Sch Telecommun Engn, INESC TEC, Oporto, Portugal.",fatimaleal2@gmail.com; horacio@ncirl.ie; mbm@isep.ipp.pt; J.C.Burguillo@uvigo.es,"Leal, Fatima/Y-3460-2019; Gonzalez-Velez, Horacio/ABD-5680-2021; Gonzalez-Velez, Horacio/B-7840-2008; Burguillo, Juan Carlos/E-9091-2016; Malheiro, Benedita/A-5278-2009","Leal, Fatima/0000-0003-4418-2590; Gonzalez-Velez, Horacio/0000-0003-0241-6053; Gonzalez-Velez, Horacio/0000-0003-0241-6053; Burguillo, Juan Carlos/0000-0001-9869-7448; Malheiro, Benedita/0000-0001-9083-4292","European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the Operational Programme for Competitiveness and Internationalisation - COMPETE Programme [FCOMP-01-0202-FEDER-023151, POCI-01-0145-FEDER-006961]; National Funds through Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) - Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [ULD/EEA/50014/2013]; ICT COST Action High-Performance Modelling and Simulation for Big Data Applications (cHiPSet) [IC1406]",European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the Operational Programme for Competitiveness and Internationalisation - COMPETE Programme; National Funds through Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) - Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology; ICT COST Action High-Performance Modelling and Simulation for Big Data Applications (cHiPSet),"This work was partially financed by: (i) the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the Operational Programme for Competitiveness and Internationalisation - COMPETE Programme - within project FCOMP-01-0202-FEDER-023151 and project POCI-01-0145-FEDER-006961:, and by National Funds through Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) - Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology - as part of project ULD/EEA/50014/2013; and (ii) ICT COST Action IC1406 High-Performance Modelling and Simulation for Big Data Applications (cHiPSet).",,28,7,7,0,5,EUROPEAN COUNCIL MODELLING & SIMULATION,NOTTINGHAM,"SCHOOL COMPUTING & MATHEMATICS, NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIV, BURTON STREET, NOTTINGHAM, NG1 4BU, ENGLAND",,,978-0-9932440-4-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,576,582,,,,,,7,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Economics; Engineering, Industrial",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Engineering,BH9XI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404420000086,0

Given the degraded state of Maine's waterways (partly due to damming of rivers for commerce), we find positive, concave relationships between housing values and river distance. We find statistically different estimates of marginal WTP across the four markets, but results from the same watershed are more similar. Also, we find mean WTP is diminishing with average river distance, which is consistent with the empirical functional form. Comparing original and benefit transfer estimates, we find errors range from 29% to over 1000%, growing with spatial distance between the study and transfer sites. Lastly, we estimate a difference-indifference model for the single market that has witnessed dam removal, and we apply the results to the other markets (that could undergo dam removal as well).

The new machine for grinding canes to extract the juice increased the industrial productivity of this industry and reduced sugar prices. Therefore, this innovation facilitated the transition of the productive process, from the small Mediterranean garden to the large American estate, and it was then that the sugar supply could be incorporated into the first global economic era. This article shows that this new industrial technology had its origins in the Canary Islands at the beginning of the sixteenth century, and how the island workers transferred it later from there to the other side of the Atlantic.","[Macias Hernandez, Antonio M.] Univ La Laguna, E-38207 San Cristobal la Laguna, Spain",Universidad de la Laguna,"Hernández, AMM (通讯作者)，Univ La Laguna, E-38207 San Cristobal la Laguna, Spain.",,,,,,,,45,0,0,2,16,"UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT HISTORIA, INST ECONOMIQUES",BARCELONA,"AVDA DIAGONAL 690, BARCELONA, 08034, SPAIN",1132-7200,,,REV HIST INDUST,Rev.

In the period of growing globalization of the world economy, it can not be overlooked the fact that the differences in the living conditions of the population of advanced economies and the people of developing countries continue to persist. Business concept of fair trade is a form of development aid and represents one of the possible ways of alleviating world poverty. The concept is based on the principle of social and economic solidarity between the poorer and richer part of the Word. Fair trade is closely related to the principle of sustainable development and puts into the forefront the mutual links that exist between lifestyle, quality of the environment and fair distribution of resources. In the Czech Republic, the concept of fair trade has begun to be promoted only in recent years. However, it can be said that Fairtrade products are constantly expanding and the annual volume of funds for these products is rising sharply. Despite the undeniable growth in the popularity of Fairtrade Movement ideas, the Czech Republic also has many differences over other developed countries that are participating in the world market for these products. Agricultural produce is grown and commodities are traded on international markets, which are typical for fair trade, especially coffee and cocoa. The aim of the paper is to define fair trade commodities in the international context and to compare them with the Czech Republic.","[Navratilova, Miroslava; Regnerova, Olga; Beranova, Marketa; Hes, Ales] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Trade & Finance, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Navratilova, M (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Trade & Finance, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521, Czech Republic.",navratilovam@pef.czu.cz; oregnerova@pef.czu.cz; mberanova@pef.czu.cz; hes@pef.czu.cz,"Regnerová, Olga/B-6291-2018; Hes, Aleš/H-3788-2018; Beranova, Marketa/B-6266-2018",,,,,,21,0,0,1,4,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,1678,1685,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059203013,0

In the context of determining the level of objective quality of life, indicators of economics, security, health, education are applied. The quality of life in the municipalities has many components, as life standard reflected by amount of income, safe housing, and availability of water, goods, services or health care. These indicators are quite good measurable. Subjective aspect of quality of the life, assessment of the satisfaction of individual areas and aspects of well-being, including the assessment of income and other indicators, such as the quality of environment, education, health services, or feeling of safety can be measured more complicated. The security of citizens and their property is also one of the key indicators of life quality. It can be characterized through subjective perception or objective statistical indicators. The contribution focuses on the primary research on the quality of life in selected cities und municipalities in European Union. This reflects at what level is human perception of safety and other indicators and how much is this limited by the external factors. In the contribution are presented the results of the primary survey about the perception from citizens' point of view, implemented in the selected cities and municipalities from European Union.

Logistics can ensure to enterprise the high quality of its goods and services, and also achieve significant cost savings to gain a competitive advantage. In the following article, we build on the knowledge we have gained through a detailed analysis of company logistics, with an emphasis on production logistics and production batch in the manufacturing plant, which was established in Slovakia. The company has incorporated its portfolio among the world's leading suppliers of standard and special rolling bearings for storage in various industrial applications. The analysis revealed the problem of too small monthly production batches of some bearings, which gave rise to excessive costs of machine typing. After detailed analysis, we calculated the costs of typing the machines that the enterprise spends at the current production scale. On the basis of the conclusions of the analysis, we have suggested optimization of the production process following the size of the production batch, with an emphasis on reducing the relevant costs of machine typing. The suggestion to optimize production batches consisted of their merging. We have quantified the costs of machine typing and the capacity losses that will be incurred after merging production batches. We compared the figures of current and suggested status and quantified the amount of savings the enterprise could achieve. The benefits are quantified by comparing the current costs of machine typing and costs after optimization.","[Vidrova, Zdenka; Ceniga, Pavel] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Ceniga, P (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",zdenka.vidrova@fpedas.uniza.sk; pavel.ceniga@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Ceniga, Pavel/P-3333-2015",,,,,,16,0,0,1,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,2864,2871,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059205033,0

The errors and covariates of the regression are assumed to belong to a general class of locally stationary processes and are allowed to be cross-dependent. Simultaneous confidence tubes (SCTs) and integrated squared difference tests (ISDTs) are proposed for simultaneous nonparametric inference of the latter models with asymptotically correct coverage probabilities and Type I error rates. Our methodologies are shown to possess certain asymptotically optimal properties. Furthermore, we propose an information criterion that performs consistent model selection for nonparametric quantile regression models of non stationary time series. For implementation, a wild bootstrap procedure is proposed, which is shown to be robust to the dependent and nonstationary data structure. Our method is applied to studying the asymmetric and time-varying dynamic structures of the U.S. unemployment rate since the 1940s.

The traditional theory of the organization and management is based on contributions from numerous sources including scientific management, administrative management, bureaucratic modelling, microeconomics and public administration. After World War II, the interdisciplinary nature of management theory expanded to create a modern management approach. There was applied knowledge such as cybernetics, general theory of systems, operational analysis, and next computers and in the management, exact methods have been introduced. Representatives of this theory are approaching to management through the decision-making process and claim that decision-making is the core of managing. The aim is to compare and detect the contrast between the selected approaches and to define their similarities and differences.

Though DSM was introduced into China in the early 1990s, its benefits have been underutilized. Using literature study, interview methods and three data sources, this paper examines the likely impacts of China's on-going power sector reform on its DSM. It finds that the major constraints to DSM in China are the insufficient and improper market-based DSM mechanism, grid companies' low motivations for DSM due to their traditional business model, the underdeveloped energy service industry, and electricity end-users' low motivation for DSM. China's on-going power sector reform will change power transmission and distribution pricing and grid companies' business model and introduce competition into retail-side. Drawing on these findings, it is concluded that the likely impacts of the new reform on DSM are: governments may attach more importance to DSM; grid companies may have more motivations for DSM investment;, electricity end-users' motivations for DSM may be both enhanced and dampened; electricity retailers' motivations for DSM may be dampened; demand response application may be enhanced, and more DSM business models may be developed. Finally, policy implications are provided.","[Zhang, Sufang; Jiao, Yiqian; Chen, Wenjun] North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Econ & Management, 2 Beinong Rd, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Sufang] Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton, E Sussex, England",North China Electric Power University; University of Sussex,"Zhang, SF (通讯作者)，North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Econ & Management, 2 Beinong Rd, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.;Zhang, SF (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",zsf69826313@sina.com.cn,,,"National Social Science Foundation of China [14BJY063]; Beijing Social Science Foundation [14JDJGB016]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [GB2015011, GB2016MS69]",National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Beijing Social Science Foundation; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"The research was supported by the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 14BJY063), the Beijing Social Science Foundation under Grant No.14JDJGB016, the 2015 Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant No. GB2015011, and 2016 Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant No. GB2016MS69.

In theory, to improve energy efficiency can reduce carbon emission significantly, but the result may be affected by the rebound effect. This paper utilizes a two-stage Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) model to estimate the total CO2 rebound effect for China's private cars during 2001-2012 at the provincial level, then uses a panel data model to analyze its impact factors. The results suggest that, first of all, the CO2 emissions of private cars have the super conservation effect, partial rebound effect and backfire effect among provinces in China. And the direct CO2 rebound effect plays a dominant role in the total CO2 rebound effect in most provinces. Second, the total CO2 rebound effect of private cars among China's provinces presents an overall convergence trend over time. Finally, the household expenditure and the population density have a negative and positive influence on the total CO2 rebound effect for China's private cars, respectively.","[Zhang, Yue-Jun; Liu, Zhao; Qin, Chang-Xiong; Tan, Tai-De] Hunan Univ, Sch Business, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yue-Jun; Liu, Zhao; Qin, Chang-Xiong; Tan, Tai-De] Hunan Univ, Ctr Resource & Environm Management, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Tan, Tai-De] Univ Nevada, Dept Mech Engn, 4505 Maryland Pkwy, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA",Hunan University; Hunan University; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Las Vegas,"Liu, Z (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ, Sch Business, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China.",liuzhao@hnu.edu.cn,"Zhang, Yue-Jun/A-8850-2012","Zhang, Yue-Jun/0000-0001-7687-9267","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71273028, 71322103]; National Special Support Program for High-Level Personnel from the Central Government of China and Hunan Youth Talents Program",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Special Support Program for High-Level Personnel from the Central Government of China and Hunan Youth Talents Program,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71273028, 71322103), the National Special Support Program for High-Level Personnel from the Central Government of China and Hunan Youth Talents Program.

This study aims to provide a new way to quantitatively analyze the roles of countries in the international fossil fuel trade by complex network analysis and Emergy theory. We transform the trade quantity of coal, crude oil and natural gas into emergy and the sum of the three emergies is the emergy of fossil fuel. We build up network models of fossil fuel based on the value of fossil fuel emergy. Then, the top relationships, the central position, the intermediary ability of the countries, and the roles of countries in the trade groups were used to analyze the roles of countries in the international fossil fuel trade network. We choose four countries, the USA, China, Russia and Saudi Arabia, as examples to show the analysis of roles and policy implications. We suggest that the USA and Russia should try to improve their intermediary abilities by diversifying their trade orientations and pay more attention to building up relationships with countries in different communities. China should seek for more tight relationships with other countries to improve its central position, and more pipelines connecting China, Russia, and other Middle Asia countries are needed. As for Saudi Arabia, expanding its industrial chain of crude oil is a better way to deal with the more fierce competition in the market. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The vast majority lives in poor municipalities away from urban centers. The replacement of fuelwood for LPG is the result of an intense urbanization process and governmental intervention based on price regulation and subsidies. In 2015, the energy demand for cooking in the Brazilian households was 46 TJ, LPG covered 51% of the demand and the remaining 49% relied on fuelwood to supply the demand for energy. This study shows that there are enormous variations in the level of consumption and the types of fuels used due to the regional complexity of Brazil. In addition, it also shows the transition from fuelwood for cooking to modern fuels such as LPG does follow a consistent pattern in Brazil. Decisions related to energy consumption and fuel type are strongly influenced by accessibility, affordability and the convenience of the fuel.","[Coelho, Suani Teixeira; Sanches-Pereira, Alessandro; Tudeschini, Luis Gustavo; Goldemberg, Jose] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Energy & Environm, Res Grp Bioenergy, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Sanches-Pereira, Alessandro] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Energy Technol, Stockholm, Sweden; [Tudeschini, Luis Gustavo] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Energy Program, Laxemburg, Austria; [Sanches-Pereira, Alessandro] Inst 17, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo; Royal Institute of Technology; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA),"Sanches-Pereira, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Energy & Environm, Res Grp Bioenergy, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",perei@i17.org,"Tudeschini, Luis G/E-5470-2015; Coelho, Suani/H-7304-2012","Coelho, Suani/0000-0002-4587-9325","FAPESP, the Sao Paulo Research Foundation [2012/51466-7, 2014/03319-0, 2014/22355-8, 2014/50279-4]; Research Centre for Gas Innovation (RCGI) [27]; University of Berkeley, California; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [12/51466-7, 14/50279-4, 14/22355-8, 14/03319-0] Funding Source: FAPESP","FAPESP, the Sao Paulo Research Foundation(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); Research Centre for Gas Innovation (RCGI); University of Berkeley, California; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa e Inovacao do Estado de Santa Catarina (FAPESC))","Authors thanks FAPESP, the Sao Paulo Research Foundation because of its support through the grants 2012/51466-7 (bound grants 2014/03319-0 and 2014/22355-8) and 2014/50279-4.

This study investigates how such distributional impacts are considered in the appraisal process for UK energy and climate policies. Using a scorecard developed to capture the guidance on policy appraisal and distributional analysis, 79 impact assessments were evaluated. The majority of these impact assessments either did not or only partially considered the impacts of policies on vulnerable groups in society, with only eight assessments containing more detailed distributional analysis. Moreover, a bias seems to exist as to which areas of energy and climate policy provide well-founded analysis and which do not. With further insights gained from interviews with relevant actors, this research concludes that political motivation, analytical difficulties and a lack of awareness of the prevalence and importance of distributional impacts are at the root of this insufficient consideration. Possible alterations to the current IA framework are presented, which aim to more firmly embed the distributional impact assessment in the appraisal process.","[Zimmermann, Michel] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Environm & Urban Econ, BP 2137,Batiment BP,Stn 16, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Pye, Steve] UCL, UCL Energy Inst, 14 Upper Wolburn Pl, London WC1H, England",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; University of London; University College London,"Zimmermann, M (通讯作者)，Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Environm & Urban Econ, BP 2137,Batiment BP,Stn 16, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",michel.zimmermann@epfl.ch; s.pye@ucl.ac.uk,,,,,,,52,9,9,3,27,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2018,123.0,,,,,,594,601,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.08.062,0.0,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HE6FW,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000453499700058,0

Its ultimate goal is to evaluate how the state's climate mitigation and environmental policies have affected the power sector's vulnerability to extreme drought and how extreme drought has affected progress towards the states climate mitigation priorities. The study analyzes the period spanning 2010-2016, which includes one of the states most severe droughts on record. The results indicate that the growth of variable renewable energy generation has helped offset some of the negative consequences of drought, which include increased emissions and cooling water usage by natural gas generators during periods of low hydropower. However, the retirement of the San Onofre nuclear power plant has delayed the overall decarbonization of the states power sector, and the closure of significant coastal power plant capacity could increase the freshwater consumption of the power sector if replacement capacity is not cooled with alternative cooling water sources or dry cooling systems. The noted tradeoffs between greenhouse gas mitigation priorities, freshwater dependency, and vulnerability to climatic events highlight the importance of holistic decision making as regional power grids transition to cleaner generation sources.","[Zohrabian, Angineh; Sanders, Kelly T.] Univ Southern Calif, Sonny Astani Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Kaprielian Hall,3620 S Vermont Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California,"Zohrabian, A (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, 3620 S Vermont Ave,Kaprielian Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",azohrabi@usc.edu; ktsanders@usc.edu,,,,,,,81,11,11,1,21,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2018,123.0,,,,,,461,470,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.09.014,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HE6FW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000453499700046,0

It employs the panel cointegration tests of Pedroni (2004) and Westerlund and Edgerton (2008) with the level break/shift to a data set of 56 developing countries. The results provide evidence of a long run equilibrium relationship between access to electricity and labour productivity for developing countries in presence of the control variables. Furthermore, the Dumitrescu and Hurlin (2012) heterogeneous panel non-causality test underscores a bidirectional causal relationship between these two key variables in the short-run. Based on these results, we recommend that policymakers ensure access to electricity for mass people in developing countries to increase productivity and thus to improve the living standards of their citizens.

We designed a quasi-experiment that, using a transport fuel dataset, is applied to the Spanish regions. We found that, despite controlling for regional tax divergences, price differences remained critically dependent on regions. However, results suggest that the presence of borders per se is practically negligible to explain the lack of regional integration.

In this paper, we present a novel answer to this question using positive and normative analyses in such a way that they complement one another. From a positive perspective, we first propose a new look at the analysis of sectors' distributed GHG forward emissions on the basis of absolute rather than marginal effects. Using this information, we then move to a normative viewpoint using an environmental extended input-output linear programming system and compute lower bounds for the potential gross and net output losses for each production unit when facing emissions reduction targets, such as those proposed by the European Union in their 20-20-20 Directive. The originality of our approach relies on two aspects, namely, the introduction of an Armington assumption to link domestic and imported output and that, differently to previous works, total final demand drives the optimal adjustments to reach emissions cuts while minimizing output losses. Our empirical exercise compares the results of these normative and positive analyses for the six largest economies in the European Union.","[Guerra, Ana-Isabel] Univ Granada, Dept Int Econ, Paseo Cartuja 7, Granada 18011, Spain; [Sancho, Ferran] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ, Campus UAB,Edifici B, Bellaterra 08193, Spain",University of Granada; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Guerra, AI (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, Dept Int Econ, Paseo Cartuja 7, Granada 18011, Spain.",anaisabelguerra@ugr.es; ferran.sancho@uab.cat,"Guerra, Ana-Isabel/K-2363-2014; Sancho, Ferran/K-1714-2014","Sancho, Ferran/0000-0002-6200-116X",[MICINN-ECO2017-83534P],,"We gratefully acknowledge financial support from project MICINN-ECO2017-83534P to this research.

We study unilateral strategies by climate-concerned Arctic countries to deter extraction by others. Contradicting common theoretical assumptions about climate-change mitigation, our setting is one where countries may fundamentally disagree about whether mitigation by others is beneficial. This is because Arctic oil extraction requires specific R&D, hence entry by one country expands the extraction-technology market, decreasing costs for others. This means that, on the one hand, countries that extract Arctic oil gain if others do so as well. On the other hand, as countries may disagree about how harmful climate change is, they may disagree whether an equilibrium where all enter is better or worse than an equilibrium where all stay out. Less environmentally-concerned countries (preferring maximum entry) have a first-mover advantage but, because they rely on entry by others, entry in equilibrium is determined by the preferences of those who are moderately concerned about the environment. Furthermore, using a pooling strategy, an environmentally-concerned country can deter entry by credibly pretending to be environmentally adamant, and thus be expected to not follow. A rough calibration suggests a country like Norway, or prospects of a green future U.S. administration, could be pivotal in determining whether the Arctic will be explored. (C) 2018 The Authors.

In order to identify the feasibility of utilising crop residues as bioenergy feedstock, a postal survey was conducted to determine current farm business wheat straw use, destination and potential future supply. The survey responses showed a bias towards larger, more commercially-minded farms, therefore capturing a large area of straw production. Results demonstrated a wide range of responses to both current straw use and potential for the supply of straw to different markets in the future. Interestingly, even for a very generous payment for straw, 28.5% of straw currently chopped and incorporated would not be sold, suggesting that straw supply for bioenergy feedstock is likely to be more limited than previously assumed. However, higher prices for straw would encourage farmers to explore ways of increasing straw yield.","[Townsend, T. J.; Sparkes, D. L.; Ramsden, S. J.; Glithero, N.

In Germany a large share of the residential building stock is rented. This comes with barriers to energy efficiency retrofitting due to split incentive problems. Alongside existing government incentive programmes, the German tenancy law allows landlords to add a maximum of 11% of the energy-related modernisation costs onto the annual rent. Studies evaluating the actual outcomes, from an energy as well as a social point of view, are rare. This article compares calculated theoretical heating energy consumption for prior to and after retrofit with actual consumption data after retrofit. Further, the issue of household expenses is addressed by comparing increased rental costs after retrofit with household's energy expenses prior and after retrofit. Despite a reduction in energy consumption of 70%, more than half of the households faced increased costs due to higher rents after retrofit. Even when increases in energy prices are taken into account, still one third of the households faced higher costs. For a fairer and more effective distribution of costs and benefits, this article stresses the importance of alternative financing models.","[Weber, Ines; Wolff, Anna] Ludwig Maximilian Univ Munich, Fac Social Sci, Inst Sociol, Konradstr 6, D-80801 Munich, Germany; [Weber, Ines] IWU, Rheinstr 65, D-64295 Darmstadt, Germany",University of Munich,"Weber, I (通讯作者)，Ludwig Maximilian Univ Munich, Fac Social Sci, Inst Sociol, Konradstr 6, D-80801 Munich, Germany.",I.Weber@iwu.de; Anna.Wolff@soziologie.uni-muenchen.de,,,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [01UT1411D],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),The financial support for the study is acknowledged from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research under the socioeconomic research funding programme FONA Research for Sustainable Development under the Contract number 01UT1411D.,,79,35,38,0,18,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2018,122.0,,,,,,680,688,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.08.007,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GX2UX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447576700064,0

However, there is insufficient evidence to analyse in depth its influence on the energy and economic performance of such systems. The wide range of O&M annual expenditures (OPEX) and the lack of standardization further complicate the proliferation of specialized studies. This paper analyses the influence of OPEX on the performance and viability of a utility-scale photovoltaic tracking plant based on real data. After a description of the O&M costs incurred to maximise photovoltaic performance, a first result shows that a percentage decrease in annual OPEX does not necessarily imply the same trend in energy losses. Although this electricity decrease may jeopardise the viability of the project, the economic outlook of this study shows that high quality O&M not always improves the Levelised Cost of Electricity or the annual liquid asset of such investment. Finally, it shows real evidence of the influence of promotion policies on the viability of photovoltaic projects, taking Spain as an example, where it is more profitable to abandon the preventive maintenance of a photovoltaic plant than to invest in O&M and only undertake corrective O&M in limit situations","[Munoz-Ceron, E.] Univ Jaen, IDEA Res Grp Res & Dev Solar Energy, Ctr Adv Studies Energy & Environm CEAEMA, Div Projects Engn,Dept Graph Engn Design & Projec, Jaen, Spain; [Lomas, J.

The impact of policy support for photovoltaics, electrolysis, concentrated solar power, and thermochemical reactors is assessed. The rates of growth of the four technologies are taken as proxies for the degree of policy support. Key assumptions are identified and results are considered over the range of reasonable assumptions. Initially, electrolysis with PV will be the less expensive way to produce solar hydrogen. However, though it is initially more expensive, the thermochemical cycle has greater long-term potential for cost reductions from learning, and it is the faster route to $2/kg hydrogen. Cost reductions in hydrogen from the thermochemical cycles are primarily driven by improvements in the thermochemical reactors, which, due to initially high costs, will only see growth through government support. Thus, policymakers must support the thermochemical cycles through their research, development, and early implementation stages in order to achieve these cost reductions. Though the details change when key parameters are varied over their range of reasonable values, the broad conclusions are unaffected.","[Nicodemus, Julia Haltiwanger] Lafayette Coll, Easton, PA 18042 USA",Lafayette College,"Nicodemus, JH (通讯作者)，Lafayette Coll, Easton, PA 18042 USA.",nicodemj@lafayette.edu,,,,,,,62,28,29,4,41,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2018,120.0,,,,,,100,109,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.04.072,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO6DC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440123300010,0

Once feed-in tariffs to support the development of renewable generation are phased out, the payment for grid exports is usually based on the wholesale energy value alone. Network charges are generally levied in full, with few attempts to offer a partial charge, or completely waived. Local Electricity Trading (LET) and Local Network Credits (LNCs) offer one approach to reforming charge structures. This paper examines the effects of LET and LNC on different stakeholders in four virtual trials of medium scale distributed generation projects around Australia, and the implications for policy. The trials found the large value gap between behind the meter systems and grid exports may lead to duplication of network assets, inefficient sizing and operation of distributed generators, and a lack of incentive for dispatchable generators to operate at peak times. The trials indicated that in most circumstances, the combination of LNC and LET addresses all four problems identified to some degree.","[Rutovitz, Jay; McIntosh, Lawrence; Langham, Ed; Teske, Sven; Atherton, Alison; Kelly, Scott] Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Sustainable Futures, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Oliva H, Sebastian] Univ Chile, Energy Ctr, Santiago 8370451, Chile",University of Technology Sydney; Universidad de Chile,"Rutovitz, J (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Sustainable Futures, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",jay.rutovitz@uts.edu.au,"Oliva H., Sebastian/ABB-9241-2021; Kelly, Scott/ABC-7526-2020; Langham, Edward/J-8329-2014; Kelly, Scott/F-8774-2011","Oliva H., Sebastian/0000-0003-4133-259X; Langham, Edward/0000-0002-2439-015X; Teske, Sven/0000-0001-9582-2469; Kelly, Scott/0000-0002-8454-6144; Rutovitz, Jay/0000-0002-8198-4026",Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) as part of ARENA's Emerging Renewables Program [A00738]; Conicyt (through Conicyt/Fondecyt) [3180160]; Conicyt (through Conicyt/Fondap) [15110019],Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) as part of ARENA's Emerging Renewables Program(Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA)); Conicyt (through Conicyt/Fondecyt); Conicyt (through Conicyt/Fondap),"The virtual trials and associated research received funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) as part of ARENA's Emerging Renewables Program A00738.

Simulation experiments indicate that combined-cycle generation raises the long-run price of natural gas, both at the wellhead and electricity generating plants. Conversely, the increased production of natural gas has a relatively small long run effect on natural gas prices. Historical counterfactuals indicate increased natural gas production since June 2003 lowers natural gas prices by an average of $0.16 per million BTU while combined cycle generation increases prices by an average of $0.54 per million BTU since April 1999. This increase is captured by natural gas producers such that the margin between prices at electricity generating plants and the wellhead shrinks by about $0.05 per million BTU. This analysis suggests that market relations among energy prices and their statistical ordering will reinforce the direct effects of a carbon tax on relative prices in ways that enhance interfuel substitution towards natural gas.","[Kaufmann, Robert K.; Hines, Edward] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Boston University,"Kaufmann, RK (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",Kaufmann@bu.edu,"Kaufmann, Robert K/I-4962-2017","Kaufmann, Robert K/0000-0002-5670-7027",,,,,26,11,13,1,19,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUL,2018,118.0,,,,,,603,611,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.03.039,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GJ1TF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000435050000055,0

This article analyzes the situations and shows that the limitation of coal resources could be relaxed through using coal in far regions, especially in Xinjiang, which are less developed at present. Coal-to-liquids projects could greatly reduce the negative influence of transportation costs. The limitation of water resources might also be solved with desalinating fossil water from deep saline aquifers. Since water costs are only a small fraction of the total cost, the economy of coal-to-liquids projects are not affected much. In addition, the use of fossil water could promote carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) and reduce CO2 emissions. However, given the current coal and oil prices, the potential profitability of those projects with or without CCS is seriously negative in all major coal producing regions.","[Guo, Meiyu] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Geog, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Xu, Yuan] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog & Resource Management, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Xu, Yuan] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Inst Environm Energy & Sustainabil, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Baptist University; Chinese University of Hong Kong; Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Xu, Y (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog & Resource Management, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Xu, Y (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Inst Environm Energy & Sustainabil, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",yuanxu@cuhk.edu.hk,"Xu, Yuan/H-4329-2011","Xu, Yuan/0000-0002-3044-5508; GUO, Meiyu/0000-0002-7379-6666",Hong Kong RGC [14654016]; HKBU [FRG2/16-17/004],Hong Kong RGC(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); HKBU,The authors thank Robert H.

Based on an understanding of the distributed solar radiation intensity (SRI) in China, this paper explored the socially optimal deployment strategies of SPCM. And by formulating a leader-follower Stackelberg game, we investigated the role that emission permits trade policy can play in inducing the choice of SPCM. The empirical results show that not all the areas in China are suitable for the promotion of SPCM. And the social emissions concern (epsilon) has a big impact on the socially optimal deployment strategy of SPCM. Two factors determine whether the SPCM is inducible in a specific area: the located SRI and the incentive policy. And for a specific area, resident makes the choice based on whether the SPCM could be profitable. The results also demonstrate that a high price of CERs can achieve the effect of feed-in tariff policy in inducing SPCM, and emission permits trade policy as a market incentive mechanism can also internalize the external costs of CO2 emissions.","[Chen, Weidong; Wei, Pengbang] Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China",Tianjin University,"Chen, WD (通讯作者)，Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.",chenweidong@tju.edu.cn,"chen, weidong/JZT-5874-2024; Chen, Wei/GZK-7348-2022","chen, weidong/0009-0006-1337-808X;",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71373173]; National Social Science Foundation of China [2014B1-0130],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),The authors sincerely acknowledge the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71373173) and the National Social Science Foundation of China (No. 2014B1-0130).,,42,19,20,4,96,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAY,2018,116.0,,,,,,86,94,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.01.056,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GD8JH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430758200010,0

This paper offers a qualitative comparative analysis that draws on a subsample of 227 semi-structured interviews on electric vehicles with both transportation and electricity experts from 201 institutions and 17 cities within the Nordic region to discuss the reasoning and arguments behind V2G incentives and policy mechanisms. A frequency analysis of the most coded V2G responses favours an update of the electricity market regulation - in particular in relation to electricity taxation and aggregator markets - and support for pilot projects. However, the analysis overall implies that V2G, in contrast to EVs, is a technology for the market and by the market. One that will develop on its own over time. More in-depth, our analysis shows the debates around V2G and how its perspective differs per country, pending available frequency capacity and flexible production (hydro power).

Literature estimates of the economic impacts of oil price shocks, summarized by the oil price elasticity of GDP, span a very wide range due to both fundamental economic and methodological factors. This paper presents a quantitative meta-analysis of the oil price elasticity of GDP for net oil importing countries, with a focus on the United States (US). The full range of estimates of the oil price elasticity of GDP for the US in the data is - 0.124 to + 0.017, accounting for different methodologies, data and other factors. We employ a meta-regression model that controls for key determinant factors to estimate the mean and variance of the GDP elasticity across studies. We use a robust estimation technique to deal with heterogeneity of the data and well-known econometric issues that confront mew-analysis. The resulting regression model is used to simulate the oil price elasticity of GDP for the US, with a mean of - 0.020% and 68% confidence interval of - 0.035 to - 0.006, four quarters after a shock.","[Oladosu, Gbadebo A.; Leiby, Paul N.; Bowman, David C.; Uria-Martinez, Rocio; Johnson, Megan M.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory,"Oladosu, GA (通讯作者)，Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 USA.",oladosuga@ornl.gov; leibypn@ornl.gov; bowmandc@ornl.gov; uriamartiner@ornl.gov; johnsonmm@ornl.gov,,"Uria-Martinez, Rocio/0000-0001-9689-9951",US Department of Energy under the Strategic Petroleum Reserves Office [DE-AC05-00OR22725],US Department of Energy under the Strategic Petroleum Reserves Office(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"This material is based upon work supported by the US Department of Energy under the Strategic Petroleum Reserves Office, and performed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory under contract number DE-AC05-00OR22725.

Policy recommendations are derived by showing which buildings and energy efficiency measures should be addressed in order to determine the full energy saving potential in the most effective way. Different cost curves for energy savings potential are applied, and these curves show the investor perspective and overall economic perspective. Final energy demand can be reduced by 56% by year 2030 if the least-cost energy efficiency solutions for each building type are selected. Energy performance class A implementation for the apartment buildings built before 1990 and supplied by district heating is the most cost-effective measure. If we consider the overall economic perspective, energy performance class A+ + (deep renovation) for the same buildings is the most cost-effective measure. The results call for (I) policies to support building renovation that address buildings with low energy performance instead of subsidising energy prices and (II) policies promoting deep renovation (A +, A+ +) in order to avoid lock-in effects and ensure the transition of the Lithuanian building stock towards nearly zero-energy buildings (nZEBs).","[Toleikyte, Agne; Kranzl, Lukas; Mueller, Andreas] Tech Univ Wien, Energy Econ Grp, Inst Energy Syst & Elect Drives, Vienna, Austria",Technische Universitat Wien,"Toleikyte, A (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Wien, Energy Econ Grp, Inst Energy Syst & Elect Drives, Vienna, Austria.",toleikyte@eeg.tuwien.ac.at,,"Kranzl, Lukas/0000-0003-3350-7134; Muller, Andreas/0000-0002-2030-4584",,,,,23,23,27,3,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,APR,2018,115.0,,,,,,148,157,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.12.043,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GA1TH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428099800016,0

Using data from the Northern Ireland Household Panel Survey and from the Understanding Society survey, the effect on fuel poverty during a twelve year period is investigated. Difference-in-difference regression modelling of the impact of NR on fuel poverty provides evidence of a 3.0% reduction in fuel poverty comparing respondents in NR areas with the rest of Northern Ireland and a 4.7% decline relative to a similarly deprived control group. When the effect on heterogeneous characteristics of the sample is explored, the analysis reveals that NR has been particularly effective in relieving fuel poverty among groups with lower qualifications, the retired and those receiving benefits, and has therefore contributed to a reduction in inequalities within the most deprived areas in Northern Ireland.","[Mohan, Gretta; Kee, Frank] Queens Univ Belfast, Royal Victoria Hosp, Inst Clin Sci, Ctr Publ Hlth,Queens Sch Med Dent & Biomed Sci, Grosvenor Rd, Belfast BT12 6BA, Antrim, North Ireland; [Mohan, Gretta; Longo, Alberto; Kee, Frank] Queens Univ Belfast, Royal Victoria Hosp, Inst Clin Sci, UKCRC,Ctr Excellence Publ Hlth Northern Ireland, Grosvenor Rd, Belfast BT12 6BA, Antrim, North Ireland; [Mohan, Gretta; Longo, Alberto] Queens Univ Belfast, Med Biol Ctr, Sch Biol Sci, Gibson Inst,Inst Global Food Secur, Room 01-409,Lisburn Rd, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland; [Longo, Alberto] Univ Basque Country, Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Sede Bldg 1,1st Floor Sci Campus, Leioa 48940, Bilbao, Spain",Queens University Belfast; Queens University Belfast; Queens University Belfast; Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3); University of Basque Country,"Mohan, G (通讯作者)，Queens Univ Belfast, Royal Victoria Hosp, Inst Clin Sci, UKCRC,Ctr Excellence Publ Hlth Northern Ireland, Grosvenor Rd, Belfast BT12 6BA, Antrim, North Ireland.",gmohan03@qub.ac.uk,,"Mohan, Gretta/0000-0002-1525-0841","Medical Research Council [1510980]; MRC [MR/K023241/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [1510980, MR/K023241/1, MR/K023241/1B, MC_CF023241] Funding Source: researchfish",Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.

We use panel data analysis covering 15 years for the four consumer categories. The comparison of the responsiveness in demand due to changes in tariff for the two utilities reveals some interesting differences in the demand pattern of the consumers served by the different utilities when the private sector supplies to the highly urbanized areas and the public sector supplies to the rest of the state. We get an idea about the difference in tariff structure of a public and a private utility as well. Our study suggests that any policy to entirely remove the cross subsidy is not a viable option as there is considerable differences in the elasticity of demand for power among the different category of consumers.

The results with the disaggregate data cannot support the EKC estimated at the aggregate level. The finding of aggregation bias has several policy implications. First, the government should not be misled by the false relationship between the pollutant emission and the real GDP per capita at the aggregate level. Second, the local governments should play more important roles in making environmental protection policies since the more disaggregate data can mitigate the aggregation bias. To provide enough incentives to the local government, the Chinese national government should align the interests of the local governments with those of the national government. On the other hand, the findings indicate that China can stick to the policy of encouraging foreign direct investment, openness and financial development since they have not influenced the SO2 emission in China.","[Xu, Tao] Soochow Univ, Dongwu Business Sch, 50 Donghuan Rd, Suzhou 215021, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Soochow University - China,"Xu, T (通讯作者)，Soochow Univ, Dongwu Business Sch, 50 Donghuan Rd, Suzhou 215021, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",tylerxu@sina.com,,,Humanity & Social Science Funds from the Ministry of Education of People's Republic of China [15YJA790071],Humanity & Social Science Funds from the Ministry of Education of People's Republic of China,"This work was sponsored by the Humanity & Social Science Funds from the Ministry of Education of People's Republic of China (Grant no. 15YJA790071, 2015)",,37,113,115,2,63,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAR,2018,114.0,,,,,,315,322,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.12.027,0.0,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FW0DY,,,Y,N,2024-03-10,WOS:000424962800029,0

It verifies a significant positive effect of public R&D funding in terms of absolute monetary value and past funding intensity on the number of patents, but no significant effect on patent's quality measured by the number of citations. Besides public R&D funding, a firm's technology knowledge base and the overall financial situation have a positive effect on the quantity of patents, while the effect of firm's age is negative. The paper contributes to the RBV by linking it with extant research on firm innovation, gaining empirical insights on the importance of financial, physical and intangible resources.

As the analysis reveals, TFP differences are large even within countries, and are strongly related to economic geography and historical development paths.

In applications the focus of interest is on capturing joint tail behavior rather than a variation around the mean. Quantile and expectile regression are used here as tools of data analysis. When it comes to characterizing tail event curves one faces a dimensionality problem, which is important for CoVaR (Conditional Value at Risk) determination. A projection-based single-index model specification may come to the rescue but for ultrahigh-dimensional regressors one faces yet another dimensionality problem and needs to balance precision versus dimension. Such a balance is achieved by combining semiparametric ideas with variable selection techniques. In particular, we propose a projection-based single-index model specification for very high-dimensional regressors. This model is used for practical CoVaR estimates with a systemically chosen indicator. In simulations we demonstrate the practical side of the semiparametric CoVaR method. The application to the U.S. financial sector shows good backtesting results and indicate market coagulation before the crisis period.

Regional Studies. This study empirically examines the effect of divided governments on the existence of political budget cycles. It uses a setting at the German municipality level, where divided governments occur frequently and can be clearly disentangled from the underlying political system. In this setting, the executive does not have full discretion over expenditures and tax rates, and needs support from the legislative to manipulate policy before executive elections. The study shows that political budget cycles in expenditures and tax rates are more likely when the same party controls executive and legislative. Under divided government, policy manipulation is significantly smaller.","[Garmann, Sebastian] Univ Bochum, Fac Econ & Management, Bochum, Germany",Ruhr University Bochum,"Garmann, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bochum, Fac Econ & Management, Bochum, Germany.",sebastian.garmann@rub.de,,"Garmann, Sebastian/0000-0002-1035-4916",,,,,42,6,8,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

An example might be logging into e-mail inbox when a user firstly enters his username (identification) and his password (authentication). Although, different ways of authentication (biometrics, smart cards.) exist currently, an authentication through passwords is often used because of easy implementation and low financial requirements. But this way of authentication is not generally considered to be too secure because users often choose easy to guess short passwords, divulge their passwords to others, remark theirs passwords, and often use the same password for different services. Many existing passwords are not resilient to various forms of attack, such as a dictionary attack or brute force attack that also has relatively high economic impacts. However, due to globalization, there are significant social changes that affect the passwords that end users choose and therefore their security. At this time, users are choosing other passwords than they used to, such as choosing English terms for their passwords, using other mnemonic tools, and so on. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the password authentication security from the globalization point of view with respect to the ability of end users. Through the proposed dictionary attack and brute force simulation model, the attacks on the passwords that were acquired over the last fifteen years will be carried out and the impact of globalization on their security will be analysed.","[Hub, Miloslav; Prihodova, Katerina] Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Studentska 84, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Hub, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Studentska 84, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic.",miloslav.hub@upce.cz; st30351@student.upce.cz,,,University of Pardubice [SGS_2018_021],University of Pardubice,This article was supported by projects No. SGS_2018_021 of the University of Pardubice.,,30,0,0,1,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,2061,2066,,,,,,6,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300263,0

The current state of the global crisis of the mankind is linked to the globalisation processes of the world economy whose speed and unlimited impact create destructive effects. Economics provides sufficient guidance and explanation of the economic phenomena in each country as well as guidance how to behave in the globalisation process. However, limitlessly growing demand and rapid economic growth of modern economies have come into conflict with the rules of nature functioning, resulting in polluted environment and declining reserves of natural energies and raw materials. The environmental issues are very complex and the circular economy cannot provide solutions for all of them, however, it affects many areas. The circular economy deals with production, consumption and waste production issues. Through the product life cycle analysis, it examines the production process from the extraction of raw materials to the disposal of a product while considering energy consumption, water consumption and the like, used to manufacture a product. It is a complex view of its life cycle, from the first to the last step.

Besides that, the goal of integrated management system is to ensure that the organization achieves and demonstrates responsible environmental behaviour, protects the health of employees and creates conditions for a generally safe operation. For both large international companies operating on global market and SMEs operating on local market, the implementation of international ISO standards can create significant change in benefits through improved and systematic alignment of management processes. From the economic point of view, the most significant benefits of introducing integrated management systems include lowering the costs of poor quality, and reducing losses resulting from non-compliance with environmental or safety regulations. In order to rise competitiveness and achieve sustainable development, organizations are currently looking at the global market with new competitive advantages. One of advantage is provided by the integration of management systems including environmental management system, quality management system, occupational health and safety or other management systems.

The research period for the analysis of deposit insurance premiums to Lithuanian banks is 2010-2014. In the risk-based model, the main risk indicators are evaluated by European Banking Authority. Performed deposit insurance system problem analysis showed that deposit insurance system has positive characteristics, it is a key tool in the fight against depositors panic and helps to maintain confidence in the financial institutions, but it also has a negative impact. Theoretical deposit insurance models evaluation showed that in many EU countries, the existing deposit insurance systems do not provide sufficient protection on depositors because contributions are not based on banks' risk assessment, which means that deposit insurance does not perform one of its basic functions. The introduction of risk-based deposit insurance system would redistribute contributions among the Lithuanian banks and thus contribute to the negative effects of deposit insurance systems mitigation and growth of all financial system stability.","[Lakstutiene, Ausrine; Barkauskaite, Aida] Kaunas Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Business, Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Barkauskaite, A (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Business, Kaunas, Lithuania.",ausrine.lakstutiene@ktu.edu; aida.barkauskaite@ktu.edu,,,,,,,16,1,1,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-67913-6,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2018,8.0,1.0,,,,,105,118,,10.1007/978-3-319-67913-6_7,0.0,,,14,"Business; Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BR9PT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000679398800007,0

From a global business environment perspective, project management has been developing and improving over the last few years. Project risk management has a very important place in this environment. In Slovakia and the Czech Republic, compared with abroad, very few companies deal with risk management and therefore many projects end in failure. According to the elaborated studies and surveys, the insufficient risk management in Slovakia and the Czech Republic is, in more than 66% cases, the reason why the projects exceed the budget; they do not respect the time schedule or the resource management plan. However, there is a similar problem in the world, where more than 50% of project managers feel significant project management gaps. Many managers do not know enough to learn from past project mistakes.

To this end, we develop an extended factor augmented vector autoregression (VAR) model that simultaneously allows the estimation of a measure of uncertainty and its time-varying impact on a range of variables. We find that the impact of uncertainty shocks on real activity and financial variables has declined systematically over time. In contrast, the response of inflation and the short-term interest rate to this shock has remained fairly stable. Simulations from a nonlinear dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model suggest that these empirical results are consistent with an increase in the monetary authorities' antiinflation stance and a flattening of the Phillips curve.

In this way, conditions for the institutions will be created to perform effectively, the energy of the civil society, the state and the businesses will be mobilized, which will lead to the increase of the social capital in society. The paper provides a comparative analysis of the current Bulgarian and European legislation opportunities for the development of the human potential in the context of the social economy.","[Parvanov, Petar; Krastev, Vladislav; Atanasova, Irina] South West Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Blagoevgrad, Bulgaria",South-West University - Bulgaria,"Atanasova, I (通讯作者)，South West Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Blagoevgrad, Bulgaria.",petarparvanov@gmail.com; vladislav_swu@law.swu.bg; irina_atanasova@yahoo.com,"Atanasova, Irina/HJH-2305-2023; Krastev, Vladislav I/B-9994-2014","Atanasova, Irina/0000-0002-8154-619X; Krastev, Vladislav I/0000-0002-3654-278X",,,,,29,0,0,0,5,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1275,1282,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300164,0

It is assumed that recent large-scale scandals show just a glimpse of what might happen if the company fails to recognize its power. Voices calling for regulation are stronger than ever. Yet, before we move towards proposing a new regulation, a proper analysis should be done in order to establish what kind of socio-economic power Facebook has and whether the existing regulating mechanisms are capable of preventing and solving potential problems. We focus on three regulating mechanisms: data protection, consumer protection and competition law, which are presented as the relevant regulating mechanisms also by the literature. In order to assess the suitability of these mechanisms, we present a brief case study of the recent Facebook redesign. In 2017, Facebook introduced Explore Feed in a few selected countries. As a consequence, posts of pages (including prominent media, politicians, etc.) were shifted from a default wall News Feed, into a secondary wall - Explore Feed; unless the pages owners decided to pay for sponsored posts shown on the default wall. We assume that such an ad hoc change of service might have had serious consequences. We analyze the existing regulatory mechanisms and their suitability to make Facebook (or other social media platforms) accountable for some of the problems and find that overall there exists a wide regulatory gap in capturing the main problems of platforms, one that may be filled with a new proposal of public supervision over the platforms.","[Patakyova, Maria; Mazur, Jan] Comenius Univ, Fac Law, Inst European Law, Bratislava, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Patakyova, M (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Fac Law, Inst European Law, Bratislava, Slovakia.",maria.patakyova2@flaw.uniba.sk; jan.mazur@flaw.uniba.sk,,,[APVV-16-0553],,"This contribution is an output of the project implementation APVV-16-0553 Metamorphoses and innovations of the corporations ' concept under conditions of globalisation/,Premeny a inovacie konceptu kapitalovych spolocnosti v podmienkach globalizacie.",,34,0,0,1,3,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,2298,2306,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300294,0

This article focuses exclusively on the so-called green-green companies, therefore on companies that were conceived with an ecological approach since their beginnings. Numerous studies lend support to the argument that social norms, which certainly are a manifestation of the given cultural context, are among the most significant determinants of entrepreneurial activity. The objective of this study is to explore how the cultural factors, which influence the attitude toward environment, may or may not affect the ratio of green entrepreneurship initiatives in a region. Consequently, we try to answer as well the question if there are cultures more likely to start green enterprise ventures than others do. Apart from exposing the recent efforts to find the connection between environmental attitudes and green entrepreneurship commitment, this papers offers data collected in Spain, Portugal and Austria regarding four variables: environment legislation, non-governmental initiatives to preserve the environment, ratio of sustainable cities and measures undertaken in environmental and ecopreneurship education. These variables evidence the embedded environmental awareness in the three different cultural areas. The methodological approach consists of an exploratory data analysis in order to unveil the kind of relation between the above- mentioned variables and the green entrepreneurship initiatives in these regions. The results do not show a clearly positive relation between a friendly culture toward environmental aspects and the rate of green entrepreneurial initiatives and further research much be done to investigate if there is however a cause-effect influence but in a longer time spam. The authors still believe on the important part played by culture not only in the level of business venture creation, but also in the type of venture initiatives.","[Perez Alonso, Maria Azucena] Univ Appl Sci Joanneum, Management Dept, Graz, Austria; [Sanchez Garcia, Jose Carlos] Univ Salamanca, Social Psychol Dept, Salamanca, Spain; [Cardoso Pinto, Maria Joao] Polytech Coimbra, Business Sch Dept, Coimbra, Portugal",University of Salamanca; Instituto Politecnico de Coimbra (IPC),"Alonso, MAP (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci Joanneum, Management Dept, Graz, Austria.",azucena.perez-alonso@fh-joanneum.at; jsanchez@usal.es; mcardoso@iscac.pt,,,,,,,53,4,4,1,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-67913-6,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2018,8.0,1.0,,,,,217,232,,10.1007/978-3-319-67913-6_15,0.0,,,16,"Business; Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BR9PT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000679398800015,0

It is absolutely natural that business entities want to optimize their tax liability and seek ways to achieve it. In today's globalized world, with an easy way of remote communication, more and more business entities are considering optimizing their tax obligations using tax havens that are more tax-friendly and more accommodating than their home countries. Tax havens are carried away by movable subjects from domestic tax jurisdictions, and the state is therefore losing considerable sums that would otherwise become revenue to the state budget. In view of the increasing indebtedness of states, they are trying, together with international organizations, to fight against tax havens and to attract leaking entrepreneurs back or to increase their ability to remain through different tax advantages on the one hand or different legal constraints on the other. The article deals with an overview of measures that are acquired worldwide and also in the Czech Republic to combat the growing phenomenon of tax havens.

The authors suggest updating these models of creation of consumer value chain and placing a system of marketing research of the sought values of global consumers at the foundation of the creation of consumer value chain by international companies businesses. They emphasize that the creation of an information and analytical base on the behaviour of global consumers will enable researchers to evaluate the extent of cross-cultural differences in the value system of global consumers. Provided these differences are significant, researchers and practitioners will be able to segment and account for additional values corresponding to the needs of the target segments of consumers from different cultures in the framework of business processes associated with the economic activity of global companies on world markets.

To derive insights for more legitimate policy making, we provide the first holistic account of Myanmar's legitimation struggles over large hydropower, focusing on Myitsone, the country's most controversial dam, during the period 2003-2011. Our analysis takes a policy regime perspective (specifically, a political economic regime of provisioning framework). Among our findings: (1) frequent use of non-rationally persuasive argument among contending actors; (2) a spiral of declining policy legitimacy, which is amplified by civil society mobilization, and halted by a 2011 decision to suspend Myitsone; (3) rejection of Myitsone but conditional acceptance of large hydropower among some elements of civil society. Opportunity and capability for more technically informed, inclusive discussion exists in Myanmar, but given hydropower's complexities, urgently deserves to be augmented. Although Myitsone in Myanmar is an exceptional case, we offer three propositions to assess and improve policy legitimacy of hydropower.","[Foran, Tira; Chen, Yun] CSIRO Land & Water, GPO Box 1700, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Kiik, Laur] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Kiik, Laur] Tallinn Univ, Tallinn, Estonia; [Hatt, Sullivan] Mekong Program Water Environm & Resilience, Chiang Mai, Thailand; [Fullbrook, David] Sunrise Energy, Singapore, Singapore; [Dawkins, Alice; Walker, Simon] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Oxford; Tallinn University; Australian National University,"Foran, T (通讯作者)，CSIRO Land & Water, GPO Box 1700, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",tira.foran@csiro.au,"Walker, Simon/AAL-5376-2021; Chen, Yun/C-8672-2011; Kiik, Laur/AAM-9040-2020; Foran, Tira/D-7039-2011","Walker, Simon/0000-0002-5257-3172; Chen, Yun/0000-0001-6819-6562; Kiik, Laur/0000-0003-2552-8971;",,,,,88,19,20,1,24,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2017,110.0,,,,,,619,630,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.08.043,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FP5LK,,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417660800062,0

Triggered by the nationwide power shortage of the mid-1990s, the Chinese government launched its Green Lights Program in 1996. Since then, this program has been continuously highlighted in the nation's 9th-12th Five-Year Plans (1996-2015). This paper presents a review and assessment of this program during the past two decades. Based on available data, the achievements along with the implementation of this program are assessed by examining a set of indicators of electricity savings, consumer savings, market penetration, product quality, and production capacity expansion. The success of this programs can be attributed to several factors: 1) strong and sustained government commitment; 2) prioritized policy focus by program stages; 3) extensive efforts on product quality control; 4) a close symbiosis of energy efficiency policies with industrial development policies; and 5) the implementation of various incentive schemes. Nonetheless, several challenges are evident that the program needs to address in its next phase. These include: 1) promoting the use of efficient lighting products in rural China; 2) emphasizing the overall efficacy of lighting fixtures rather than focusing only on bulb efficacy; and 3) promoting the healthy development of an emerging semiconductor lighting industry in the nation.","[Guo, Fei; Pachauri, Shonali] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Energy Program, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria",International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA),"Guo, F (通讯作者)，Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Energy Program, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria.",guof@iiasa.ac.at,"Pachauri, Shonali/AAR-7383-2020","Guo, Fei/0000-0001-6415-8083; Pachauri, Shonali/0000-0001-8138-3178",European Union's Horizon research and innovation programme [642147],European Union's Horizon research and innovation programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)Horizon Europe Research Infrastructures),The research leading to these results has been supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 642147 (CD-LINKS).,,30,14,14,2,22,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2017,110.0,,,,,,31,39,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.08.002,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FP5LK,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417660800004,0

We conduct an analysis in the event of energy resource supply disruption in exporting countries for Japan. The study showed that oil stockpiling by the government and firms plays an important role in energy security; the analysis shows that oil supply disruption does not cause latent demand of oil products except naphtha after the supply disruption. However, we found that the supply interruption of town gas caused by liquefied natural gas supply disruption is a possible weak point in Japan's energy security. This would mainly impact a variety of non-energy intensive sectors such as the customer sector. We also show that the energy security of the supply is degraded by the unplanned outage of nuclear power stations, as seen from the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station. Nuclear power generation and renewable energy power generation can mitigate the impact of energy resource supply interruption in the power generation sector.","[Kitamura, Toshihiko; Managi, Shunsuke] Kyushu Univ, Sch Engn, Dept Urban & Environm Engn, Nishi Ku, Motooka 744, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan; [Managi, Shunsuke] Kyushu Univ, Sch Engn, Urban Inst, Nishi Ku, Motooka 744, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan",Kyushu University; Kyushu University,"Managi, S (通讯作者)，Kyushu Univ, Sch Engn, Dept Urban & Environm Engn, Nishi Ku, Motooka 744, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan.;Managi, S (通讯作者)，Kyushu Univ, Sch Engn, Urban Inst, Nishi Ku, Motooka 744, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan.",managi@doc.icyushu-u.ac.jp,"Managi, Shunsuke/G-1740-2013","Managi, Shunsuke/0000-0001-7883-1427",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26000001] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,31,20,20,3,37,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2017,110.0,,,,,,90,104,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.08.008,0.0,,,15,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FP5LK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417660800010,0

The analysis exploits the passage of a 2004 New Jersey property disclosure law to identify an external change in information. The law required real estate sellers to disclose information about nearby contaminated sites. After presenting a model of the impact of disamenity information on home prices, we use several econometric variations to test hypotheses about the effects of additional information. Results indicate that the impact on home prices near contaminated sites depended on the baseline information about contamination. Homes prices near widely-known contaminated sites did not see a change after the disclosure law. However, homes near sites that were less well-known before the disclosure did see a drop in price as home buyers were given new information. Our results have several important implications on the assumptions of the hedonic model and could be used to formulate more effective disclosure laws in the future. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We analyzed freshwater consumption for NG production in major U.S. shale gas plays from recent reports and studies. We reviewed recent literature quantifying methane leakage from the NG supply chain and vehicle use to improve the estimates of NGV GHG emissions. Results show that NGVs could reduce freshwater consumption significantly and offer air emissions reduction benefits compared to their diesel counterparts. NGV WTW GHG emissions are largely driven by the vehicle fuel efficiency, as well as methane leakage rates of both the NG supply chain and vehicle end use: we estimate WTW GHG emissions of NGVs to be slightly higher than those of the diesel counterparts given the estimated WTW methane leakage. NGVs utilizing the newest aftertreatment systems have lower WTW and vehicle operation NOx emissions across different duty-cycles and slightly lower WTW PM emissions than their diesel counterparts. We found that the cost-effectiveness of NGVs is impacted by incremental cost of NG storage tanks and the price difference between NG and diesel fuels. These findings for NGVs shed light on their environmental and economic impacts from a WTW holistic point of view.","[Cai, Hao; Burnham, Andrew; Chen, Rui; Wang, Michael] Argonne Natl Lab, Syst Assessment Grp, Div Energy Syst, Argonne, IL 60439 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Argonne National Laboratory,"Cai, H (通讯作者)，Argonne Natl Lab, Syst Assessment Grp, Div Energy Syst, Argonne, IL 60439 USA.",hcai@anl.gov,,"Burnham, Andrew/0000-0001-8980-6542",Vehicle Technologies Office (VTO) of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy [DE-AC02-06CH11357],Vehicle Technologies Office (VTO) of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy,This study was supported by the Vehicle Technologies Office (VTO) of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy under Contract DE-AC02-06CH11357.

With increasing wind deployment this issue is well recognised in Scotland. Spatial smoothing of generation is seen as one method to enhance energy security in a high wind penetration system. This requires wind farms to be developed in a way to take advantage of this smoothing; however, this is not part of the UK/Scottish government wind deployment strategy which is instead developer led. This research seeks to contribute to a strategic approach to wind development in Scotland, taking into account spatial smoothing which is shown in this study to be statistically significant within Scotland. Providing quantification of which pre-existing areas of large-scale wind development in Scotland should be the focus of further development and which are of least benefit. Wind farms in southern Scotland offer least in terms of energy security, due to over-concentration of deployment in this area, further development here should be in part considered in terms of export value, rather than utilization within Scotland. The two island areas modelled are shown to have high spatial smoothing value.

We model a mix of water heating (WH) technologies including conventional and on-demand (tank-less) natural gas heating, electric resistance, existing electric heat pumps, advanced heat pumps with low global warming refrigerants and solar thermal water heaters. Technically feasible policy scenarios are developed by considering combinations of WH technologies with efficiency gains within each technology, lowering global warming potential of refrigerants and decreasing grid carbon intensity. We then evaluate energy demand, emissions and equipment replacement costs of the pathways. We develop multiple scenarios by which the annual greenhouse gas emissions from residential water heaters in California can be reduced by over 80% from 1990 levels resulting in an annual savings of over 10 Million Metric Tons by 2050.

Although these standards had been set constant for years, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) set increasing CAFE standards in 2011 based on vehicle's footprint, requiring vehicle manufacturers to improve the fuel economy of the vehicles they produce. This resulting improvement in vehicle fuel economy is likely to influence consumers' decisions regarding new vehicle purchases, while the stringent CAFE standards are also likely to affect manufacturers' production costs and benefits. In addition, the government provides various incentives to support the adoption of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs), including electric vehicles (EVs), which in turn will likewise influences consumers' decisions regarding purchasing a new vehicle. An agent-based model is developed in this paper to estimate the potential future market shares of EVs considering the existing inherent uncertainties under different policy scenarios, including the footprint-based CAFE regulation. The results show that, if implemented effectively in conjunction with the available government incentives, the CAFE regulation can accelerate EV market penetration and help the U.S. to move away from conventional vehicles, thus reducing fossil fuel dependency.","[Sen, Burak; Tatari, Omer] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Civil Environm & Construct Engn, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Noori, Mehdi] MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Tatari, O (通讯作者)，Univ Cent Florida, Dept Civil Environm & Construct Engn, Orlando, FL 32816 USA.",tatari@ucf.edu,,"Sen, Burak/0000-0003-2454-9287",University of Central Florida from the U.S. Department of Transportation's University Transportation Centers Program [DTRT13-G-UTC51],University of Central Florida from the U.S. Department of Transportation's University Transportation Centers Program,This work was supported in part by an award to the University of Central Florida as part of Grant Number DTRT13-G-UTC51 from the U.S. Department of Transportation's University Transportation Centers Program.,,65,48,54,3,60,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,279,287,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.07.008,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400026,0

The SMLPI is then applied to a unique dataset of China's coal-fired power plants, including 5048 observations covering the period 1999-2008. The results show an increasing trend of carbon productivity growth during the sample period for both state- and non-state-owned power plants. Further decomposition analyses show that the production technology also exhibits an increasing trend for both groups, but the efficiency change exhibits a decreasing trend. For the state-owned group, the technology gap decreased before 2003, but increased thereafter. On the contrary, for the non-state-owned power plants, the technology gap increased before 2003, but decreased thereafter.","[Yu, Yanni] Jinan Univ, Inst Resource Environm & Sustainable Dev, Coll Econ, Guangzhou 510623, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Qian, Tao; Du, Limin] Zhejiang Univ, China Acad West Reg Dev, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Jinan University; Zhejiang University,"Qian, T (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, China Acad West Reg Dev, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",yayabaobei@naver.com; qiantaochew@sina.com; dlmsos@hotmail.com,,"Du, Limin/0000-0001-5366-1628","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71303213, 71603102, 41461118]; National Key R & D Program of China [2016YFA0602500]; Ministry of Education of China [13YJA790015]; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [LQ12G03013]; Zhejiang Federation of Humanities and Social Sciences Circles [2010Z51]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in China","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key R & D Program of China; Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); Zhejiang Federation of Humanities and Social Sciences Circles; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in China","We gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71303213, 71603102, 41461118), National Key R & D Program of China (2016YFA0602500), the Ministry of Education of China (13YJA790015), the Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (LQ12G03013), the Zhejiang Federation of Humanities and Social Sciences Circles (2010Z51), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in China",,34,43,43,10,78,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,479,487,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.05.040,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400046,0

This paper presents a methodology for policymakers in such conditions to examine more precisely the financial performance of residential solar PV from the consumer perspective as part of an ex-ante policy assessment. We model a range of prospective policy scenarios and compare policy mechanisms that compensate homeowners for generation, those that reduce their upfront costs, and those that assist with financing, using Ireland as a case study. The results confirm the intuitive notion that more generous financial remuneration schemes provide quicker payback; however we observe that in low irradiance regions there is little difference between upfront grants and feed-in-tariffs to accelerate payback timeframes. We also show the importance of retail tariff structure in consumer payback for solar PV systems, with one-part tariffs generating shorter paybacks than two-part tariff structures, although the latter is more likely to secure revenue for electricity infrastructure investment. Drawing from this analysis, the paper proposes some options for the design of policy supports and tariff structures to deliver a sustainable residential renewable electricity system in low-irradiance regions.","[La Monaca, Sarah] UCD, Michael Smurfit Grad Business Sch, Dublin, Ireland; [Ryan, Lisa] UCD, Sch Econ, Dublin 4, Ireland; [La Monaca, Sarah; Ryan, Lisa] UCD, Energy Inst, Dublin 4, Ireland",University College Dublin; University College Dublin,"Ryan, L (通讯作者)，UCD, Energy Inst, Dublin 4, Ireland.",sarah.lamonaca@ucd.ie; lisa.ryan@ucd.ie,,/0000-0002-6097-7900,Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) under the Energy Systems Integration Partnership Programme (ESIPP); UCD Energy Institute,Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) under the Energy Systems Integration Partnership Programme (ESIPP)(Science Foundation Ireland); UCD Energy Institute,This work was conducted in part within the UCD Energy Institute.

A related critical question is what role state and federal governments should have in advancing energy efficient and renewable energy technologies. We derive learning rates for six technologies (electronic ballasts, magnetic ballasts, compact fluorescent lighting, general service fluorescent lighting, stationary fuel cells, and the installed price of residential solar PV) and provide an overview and timeline of historical deployment programs, such as state and federal standards and incentive programs, for each technology. Piecewise linear regimes are observed in a range of technology experience curves, and deployment programs are found to be strongly correlated to an increase in learning rate across multiple technologies. A downward bend in the experience curve is found in 5 out of the 6 energy-related technologies presented here. In each of the five downward-bending experience curves, we believe that an increase in the learning rate can be linked to deployment programs to some degree. This work sheds light on the endogenous versus exogenous contributions to technological innovation and can inform future policy investment direction and can shed light on market transformation and technology learning behavior.","[Wei, Max; Smith, Sarah Josephine; Sohn, Michael D.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, 1 Cyclotron Rd,Mail Stop 90R2002, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,"Wei, M (通讯作者)，Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, 1 Cyclotron Rd,Mail Stop 90R2002, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",mwei@lbl.gov; sjsmith@lbl.gov; mdsohn@lbl.gov,"Wei, Max/GXH-4560-2022; Sohn, Michael/HHM-5790-2022",,U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory [DE-AC02-05CH11231],U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"This work was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and conducted at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231.

The thermal coal price is always lower than other same quality coal, and this phenomenon of thermal coal price distortion has been existing in China for a long time. The distortion coal price can not reflect the external cost and the resource scarcity of coal, which could result in environment deteriorating and inefficient resource allocation. This paper studied the phenomenon of thermal coal price distortion through economic theoretical modeling and empirical cointegration analysis from the perspective of market forces. The results show that thermal coal price is determined by electricity price, the prediction elasticity of a electricity enterprise, price elasticity of demand of electricity, the input prediction elasticity of a electricity enterprise and the price elasticity of supply of thermal coal. The main reason of coal price distortion is the unbalance market force of coal industry and thermal coal generation industry. The distortion rate of coal price is positively related to the market force of electric power industry and negatively related to the industrial concentration of coal industry.","[Cui, Herui; Wei, Pengbang] North China Elect Power Univ, Dept Econ & Management, Baoding 071003, Peoples R China",North China Electric Power University,"Wei, PB (通讯作者)，North China Elect Power Univ, Dept Econ & Management, Baoding 071003, Peoples R China.",weipb666@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71471061]; National Social Science Foundation of China [15BGL145],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),The authors sincerely acknowledge the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71471061) and the National Social Science Foundation of China (No. 15BGL145).

Yet relatively little attention has been paid to how payments made under this policy type get distributed across socioeconomic groups. This paper links information on individual domestic photovoltaic (PV) installations registered under the feed-in tariff for England and Wales, to spatially organised census data. This makes it possible to observe which socioeconomic groups are benefitting most and least under the policy. Comparing the observed benefit distribution to a counterfactual distribution of perfect equality, a moderate to high level of inequality is found. Cross-sectional regressions suggest that settlement density, home ownership status, physical dwelling type, local information spillovers, and household social class shaped this outcome. Greater sensitivity to these factors in policy design could improve distributional outcomes under feed-in tariff policies in England and Wales, and beyond.","[Grover, David] Grenoble Sch Management, Grenoble, France; [Grover, David] UCL, London, England; [Daniels, Benjamin] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Grenoble Ecole Management; University of London; University College London; The World Bank,"Grover, D (通讯作者)，Grenoble Sch Management, Grenoble, France.;Grover, D (通讯作者)，UCL, London, England.",david.grover@grenoble-em.com; bdaniels@worldbank.org,,,,,,,42,37,39,0,12,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUL,2017,106.0,,,,,,255,265,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.03.043,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EW2RL,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402343600026,0

We provide the following findings. First, vehicle possession in the road transport sector and carbon emissions both display an increasing trend, reaching 180 million units and 6.6 billion tons by 2020, respectively. Second, the road transport sector has the largest carbon quota under the benchmark scenario and the smallest under a low-carbon scenario. The difference between these two scenarios is 2.7 billion tons of carbon emissions.

Impacts of events occurring in the tails of distributions were assessed estimating deviations of minimum temperature, maximum temperature and hourly electricity consumption with respect to statistically derived thresholds and using three sets of data: temperature observations (1911-2013); major power outages reported in a disaster database (1971-2013) and hourly electricity consumption (2006-2013). These deviations (exceedances) proved to be adequate indicators of the stress posed by extreme temperature events to the electricity distribution system leading to major blackouts. Based on these indicators, we found that the electricity distribution system was under similar stress during cold waves or heat waves, but it was much more vulnerable to heat waves (three blackouts under cold waves against 20 under heat waves between 2006 and 2013). For heat waves, the results of a binomial regression logistic model provided an adequate description of the probability of disastrous supply interruptions in terms of exceedances in extreme temperatures and electricity consumption stress. This approach may be of use for other cities wishing to evaluate the effects of extreme temperature events on the electricity distribution infrastructure.","[Santagata, Daniela M.; Rossler, Cristina E.; Gomez, Dario R.] Comis Nacl Energia Atom, Gerencia Quim, Av Gral Paz 1499,B1650KNA, San Martin, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Santagata, Daniela M.] Univ Belgrano, Zabala 1837, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Castesana, Paula; Rossler, Cristina E.] Univ Nacl San Martin, Inst Invest & Ingn Ambiental, Campus Miguelete,25 Mayo & Francia, RA-1650 San Martin, Buenos Aires, Argentina",Comision Nacional de Energia Atomica (CNEA),"Rössler, CE; Gómez, DR (通讯作者)，Comis Nacl Energia Atom, Gerencia Quim, Av Gral Paz 1499,B1650KNA, San Martin, Buenos Aires, Argentina.",crossler@cnea.gov.ar; dgomez@cnea.gov.ar,,"Castesana, Paula/0000-0001-9281-4789","International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) [17515, I11007]",International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)(International Atomic Energy Agency),The authors are grateful to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for support under research contract 17515 within the framework of the Coordinated Research Project I11007 (Techno-economic evaluation of options for adapting nuclear and other energy infrastructure to long-term climate change and extreme weather).

The paper also examines the impact of technical specialised training on the ability of social workers to prevent and mitigate conditions of household energy poverty in Europe. The adoption of a research-action-participation methodological framework and a training research approach has permitted the opinions of social workers to be collected through surveys, and their central role in implementing regional policies to be highlighted. The conclusions obtained have made possible the construction of a self-diagnosis and data-collection tool which increases the ability of social workers to mediate and implement urgent mitigation measures for energy poverty. Finally, regional policies which aim to mitigate household energy poverty are examined from the professional perspective of social workers.","[Searpellini, Sabina] Univ Zaragoza, CIRCE, Dept Accounting & Finance, Zaragoza, Spain; [Sanz Hernandez, M.

We estimate cost savings of $24.5 to $35.7 million which is 64%-93% of the total costs the city currently plans to spend on water infrastructure.

China is developing its first National Implementation Plan on Mercury Control, which priorities the control of emissions from CFPPs. While social benefits play an important role in designing environmental policies in China, the benefits associated with mercury control are not yet understood, mainly due to the scientific challenges to trace mercury's emissions-to impacts path. This study evaluates the benefits of mercury reductions in China's CFPPs for China and its three neighboring countries in East Asia. Four policy scenarios are analyzed following the policies-to-impacts path, which links a global atmospheric model to health benefit analysis models to estimate the economic gains from avoided mercury-related adverse health outcomes under each scenario, and,take into account key uncertainties in the path. Under the most stringent scenario, the benefits of mercury reduction by 2030 are projected to be $432 billion (95% CI: $166-941 billion), with the benefits for China and the neighboring countries accounting for 96% and 4% of the total benefits, respectively. Policy scenario analysis indicates that coal washing generates the greatest benefits in the near term, whereas upgrading air pollution control devices maximizes health benefits in the long term.","[Zhang, Wei; Zhen, Gengchong; Zhu, Yan] Renmin Univ China, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Chen, Long] East China Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Wang, Huanhuan; Ye, Xuejie; Wang, Xuejun] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Lab Earth Surface Proc, Minist Educ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Li, Ying] East Tennessee State Univ, Coll Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth, Johnson City, TN 37604 USA; [Tong, Yindong] Tianjin Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; East China Normal University; Peking University; East Tennessee State University; Tianjin University,"Wang, XJ (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Lab Earth Surface Proc, Minist Educ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.;Li, Y (通讯作者)，East Tennessee State Univ, Coll Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth, Johnson City, TN 37604 USA.",LIY005@mail.etsu.edu; xjwang@urban.pku.edu.cn,"Chen, Long/ABB-9867-2020",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41471403, 41671492]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41471403, 41671492).",,46,25,26,8,110,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUL,2017,106.0,,,,,,579,587,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.04.010,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EW2RL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402343600054,0

Similar results can also be found for other mast types (e.g. mobile phone base stations). However, it is not adequately understood if the protest reflects arguments against infrastructure in general or, rather, mast-specific acceptance patterns. By applying conjoint analyses, we undertook a comparison of siting preferences for electricity pylons and wind power plants. In line with previous studies in this field, distance to masts, location, perceived health hazards, and compensation payments were chosen as attributes which defined the scenarios. Overall, 149 respondents took part in the study. Results show both, mast-independent as well as mast-dependent siting preferences. Independent of the mast type, the most important criterion was alleged health concerns, and the least important characteristic was compensation payments. A closer analysis using choice simulation revealed that placing pylons in the forest is more accepted than the same scenario for wind power plants. The findings are discussed in light of a public communication strategy.","[Zaunbrecher, Barbara S.; Linzenich, Anika; Ziefle, Martina] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Human Comp Interact Ctr, Chair Commun Sci, Campus Blvd 57, D-52074 Aachen, Germany",RWTH Aachen University,"Zaunbrecher, BS (通讯作者)，Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Human Comp Interact Ctr, Chair Commun Sci, Campus Blvd 57, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.",zaunbrecher@comm.rwth-aachen.de; linzenich@comm.rwth-aachen.de; ziefle@comm.rwth-aachen.de,,"Zaunbrecher, Barbara Sophie/0000-0002-2475-5323",Excellence Initiative of the German federal and state governments (Project Urban Future Outline) [ZUK 32/2],Excellence Initiative of the German federal and state governments (Project Urban Future Outline),"Thanks to Henrik Natemeyer and Baris ozalay from the Institute of high voltage technology at RWTH Aachen University, Germany, for the constructive cooperation.

It considers four indicators of the pressures exerted by economic activity on the environment: global warming, tropospheric ozone formation, acidification and particulate formation. The change in environmental performance from the early 2000s onwards is decomposed at the levels of country and environmental pressure, and as the result of eco-innovations and catching-up with the best available environmental technologies; furthermore, we distinguish between the periods of economic growth (2001-07) and severe crisis (2007-13). Our main finding is that environmental performance improved in both periods, mainly fuelled by advances in environmental technology. Accordingly, environmental policies aimed at boosting catching-up are highly recommended, particularly in the newer member states that joined the EU from 2004 onwards, which perform further away from their respective environmental technological frontiers. In addition, re-establishing the pre-crisis ecoinnovation investment levels would also be highly advisable in order to return to the rates of environmental technical progress registered in the expansion period.","[Beltran-Esteve, Mercedes; Picazo-Tadeo, Andres J.] Univ Valencia, Dept Appl Econ 2, E-46003 Valencia, Spain; [Picazo-Tadeo, Andres J.] Univ Valencia, INTECO Joint Res Unit, E-46003 Valencia, Spain",University of Valencia; University of Valencia,"Picazo-Tadeo, AJ (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Dept Appl Econ 2, E-46003 Valencia, Spain.",andres.j.picazo@uv.es,"Picazo-Tadeo, Andres J/C-2545-2011; Beltran-Esteve, Mercedes/E-9625-2016","Picazo-Tadeo, Andres J/0000-0002-7129-5606; Beltran-Esteve, Mercedes/0000-0001-6996-6063",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; European Regional Development Fund [ECO2016-7523-R]; Valencian Regional Government [PROMETEOII/2014/053],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); European Regional Development Fund(European Union (EU)); Valencian Regional Government,"We are grateful to three anonymous referees for their comments and suggestions, as they have contributed to a much improved manuscript.

Our primary objective and contribution in this paper are in obtaining a direct relation between technological adoption (greater capitalization) and emission intensity at the industry level over a period of fourteen years between 1996 and 2009. We use the Environmentally Extended Input-Output (EEIO) model to calculate the direct, upstream and total emission intensity generated through the entire supply chain of production and consumption. From the fixed effects panel regression results we note that technological adoption helps to reduce emission intensity across industries, although, beyond a critical level it raises the intensity. Importantly, when better technologies are adopted for production of export goods as against non-traded goods, emission falls in a significant way. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The relevant crop production data from 31 provinces during 1997-2014 are utilized. In order to fully reflect the energy consumption and ECR-GHG emissions in CPSs, energy balance techniques are adopted from a consumption perspective. The driving factors behind ECR-GHG emissions are identified by means of a Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index analysis at both national and provincial levels. The results are as follows: (1) The yield of China's CPS is not positively correlated with energy consumption, and China's CPS has the relatively high potential to conserve energy and reduce ECRGHG emissions; (2) Most of China's provinces have experienced enormous growth in ECR-GHG emissions; however there are relatively significant regional disparities; (3) ECR-GHG emissions from CPSs were mostly derived directly from the consumption of chemical fertilizers and diesel oil; (4) Areal productivity is the determining factor in the growth of ECR-GHG emissions, whereas the emission coefficient and energy mix are the main inhibiting factors; (5) Energy intensity has not achieved its full potential to decrease ECR-GHG emissions.

Monte Carlo experiments give further support to the new models, and the analysis of an empirical example is also reported.","[Li, Guodong; Zhu, Qianqian; Liu, Zhao; Li, Wai Keung] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong,"Li, GD (通讯作者)，Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",gdli@hku.hk; qianqzhu@hku.hk; zhaoliu@hku.hk; hrntlwk@hku.hk,"Li, Wai/I-7954-2015; Li, Wai Keung/AAL-7193-2020; /D-3103-2009; Li, Guodong/A-2741-2010","/0000-0001-9149-9289; Li, Guodong/0000-0003-3137-8471; Zhu, Qianqian/0000-0001-7791-911X",Hong Kong RGC grant [HKU702613P],Hong Kong RGC grant,"The authors are grateful to the editor, an associate editor, and two anonymous referees for their valuable comments and constructive suggestions that led to the substantial improvement of this article.

Many previous papers have highlighted the implications of different effort-sharing principles and schemes in determining national contributions to global mitigations. In this paper, China's energy transformation towards the 2 degrees C goal until 2100 is examined in an integrated-assessment model in light of different effort-sharing principles to understand how the application of such schemes may alter China's energy system transformation on a pathway to this long-term goal. Across scenarios, China's non-fossil energy will account for 50-70% and 85% of primary energy consumption in 2050 and 2100, respectively in the scenarios in this study. Fossil energy with carbon capture and storage technologies and non-fossil energy will dominate power generation in China over the long run. Coal will be phased out in end-use sectors and electricity use will expand regardless of the effort-sharing principles. The sensitivity analysis of long-term steady-state levels implies that the ultimate level that emissions could reach will have great influences on the energy system transformation in China.","[Pan Xunzhang] China Univ Petr, Acad Chinese Energy Strategy, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China; [Chen Wenying; Wang Lining] Tsinghua Univ, Inst Energy Environm & Econ, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Clarke, Leon E.] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Joint Global Change Res Inst, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Wang Lining] CNPC, CNPC Econ & Technol Res Inst, Beijing 100724, Peoples R China; [Liu Guannan] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China",China University of Petroleum; Tsinghua University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; China National Petroleum Corporation; Beihang University,"Wang, LN (通讯作者)，CNPC, CNPC Econ & Technol Res Inst, Beijing 100724, Peoples R China.",wanglining87@126.com,"Chen, Weiyu/M-5972-2018; Chen, WY/HKN-5931-2023","Chen, Weiyu/0000-0003-4436-2743;","Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China [71690243]; Science Foundation of China University of Petroleum, Beijing [2462016YJRC023]","Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science Foundation of China University of Petroleum, Beijing","This study was supported by the Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China (71690243) and the Science Foundation of China University of Petroleum, Beijing (2462016YJRC023).",,56,59,62,5,104,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,APR,2017,103.0,,,,,,116,126,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.01.020,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP4NA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397356000010,0

The paper examines the reduction potential of electricity demand and CO2 emissions in the residential sector by conducting a scenario analysis. Electricity consumption scenarios are set up using a time-series regression model, and used to forecast the electricity consumption patterns to 2030. The scenario analysis also includes scenarios that reduce electricity consumption through enhanced energy efficiency and energy saving measures. The obtained results show that Japan can reduce electricity consumption and CO2 emissions in the residential sector in 2030 more than the Japanese post-2020 mitigation target indicates. At the maximum, the electricity consumption could be reduced by 35 TWh, which contributes to 55.4 MtCO(2) of emissions reduction in 2030 compared to 2013 if the voluntarily targeted CO2 intensity of electricity is achieved. The result implies that Japan has the potential to ratchet up post-2020 mitigation targets discussed under the Paris Agreement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).","[Wakiyama, Takako] Inst Global Environm Strategies, Climate & Energy Area, Green Econ Area, Hayama, Kanagawa 2400115, Japan; [Kuramochi, Takeshi] NewClimate Inst, Hof 20-26, D-50667 Cologne, Germany",,"Wakiyama, T (通讯作者)，Inst Global Environm Strategies, Climate & Energy Area, Green Econ Area, Hayama, Kanagawa 2400115, Japan.",waltiyama@iges.or.jp; t.kuramochi@newclimate.org,"Kuramochi, Takeshi/S-2407-2016","Kuramochi, Takeshi/0000-0002-3976-0133",JSPS KAKENHI [JP 16K21703]; World Resources Institute through the Open Climate Network; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K21703] Funding Source: KAKEN,"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); World Resources Institute through the Open Climate Network; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This study was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant number JP 16K21703.

Against this background, RES-E support policies making widely use of technology differentiation in remuneration settings, e.g. across the EU, are frequently criticized from a theoretical point of view. However, in this paper we provide a systematic critique of the technology neutrality concept as a foundation for designing policy support schemes in the RES-E technology field. Specifically, the main objective of the paper is to scrutinize the arguments for technology-neutrality, and discuss three conceptual arguments for why technology-specific support schemes could in fact help minimize the societal costs of reaching future RES-E targets. We also briefly address different political economy concerns, which could constrain the choice of cost-effective policy support schemes, and that have to be taken into account for economic policy advice. For empirical illustration of the key arguments we refer to the case of German RES-E policy-making. The central conclusion from this paper is that technology-specific RES-E support schemes may generate significant economic benefits, particularly if technology markets work imperfectly and in second-best policy settings with additional non-internalized market failures.","[Gawel, Erik; Lehmann, Paul; Purkus, Alexandra] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Econ, Permoser Str 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Gawel, Erik; Witte, Katherina] Univ Leipzig, Inst Infrastruct & Resources Management, Grimmaische Str 12, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany; [Soederhohn, Patrik] Lulea Univ Technol, Econ Unit, S-97187 Lulea, Sweden",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Leipzig University; Lulea University of Technology,"Gawel, E (通讯作者)，UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Econ, Permoser Str 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.",erik.gawel@ufz.de,"Lehmann, Paul/F-8207-2013; Gawel, Erik/G-8130-2015; Purkus, Alexandra/D-6301-2015","Lehmann, Paul/0000-0001-7999-9125; Purkus, Alexandra/0000-0002-5278-261X",German Helmholtz Association [HA-303],German Helmholtz Association(Helmholtz Association),Financial support from the German Helmholtz Association under Grant HA-303 is gratefully acknowledged.

In Norway, a number of smaller distribution system operators exist and thus there is potential to restructure the industry, possibly through mergers. However, the revenue cap regulatory model in Norway does not incentivize firms to merge as merging leads to a stricter revenue cap for the merged company. Thus the regulator compensates the firms in order to create such incentives. The amount of compensation is based on the potential gains of the merger estimated using a data envelopment analysis (DEA) based frontier approach introduced by Bogetoft and Wang (2005). DEA is however only one of many possible frontier estimators that can be used in estimation. Furthermore, the returns to scale assumption, the operating environment of firms and the presence of stochastic noise and outlier observations are all known to affect to the estimation of production technology. In this paper we explore how varying assumptions under two alternative frontier estimators shape the distribution of merger gains within the Norwegian distribution industry. Our results reveal that the restructuring policies of the industry may be significantly altered depending how potential gains from the mergers are estimated.","[Saastamoinen, Antti] VATT Inst Econ Res, Helsinki, Finland; [Bjorndal, Endre; Bjorndal, Mette] NIIH Norwegian Sch Econ, Oslo, Norway",VATT Institute for Economic Research; Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Saastamoinen, A (通讯作者)，VATT Inst Econ Res, Helsinki, Finland.",antti.saastamoinen@vatt.fi,"Bjørndal, Endre/X-9795-2019",,Aalto University; Sustainable Transition of European Energy Markets (STEEM) research program,Aalto University; Sustainable Transition of European Energy Markets (STEEM) research program,"This paper was produced as part of the project Benchmarking for Regulation of Norwegian Electricity Networks (ElBench) at the Centre for Applied Research at NHH (SNF).

Southern European countries have not missed out on this trend and have gradually consolidated as important recipients of Chinese investments. This has allowed them to accumulate 23.5% of all Chinese FDI to Europe between 2000 and 2014 (10.8 billion Euro). The energy sectors of all four countries have been primary beneficiaries. Chinese entities have carried out impressive acquisitions in the Italian and Portuguese energy markets. In contrast, their presence in the Greek and Spanish energy markets has been discrete. In parallel, the penetration of Chinese investments in Italy and Spain's subsectors of renewable energies has been more prominent than in the Greek and the Portuguese ones. The former two countries have received significant investments in solar-related greenfield projects, whereas the latter have mostly benefited from operations in wind-related ones. The influence of Chinese ergy policies and promoting foreignntities has had an impact on the markets of all four countries. This trend is not consolidated. Data suggests that Chinese investments have been highly opportunistic. Athens, Rome, Lisbon and Madrid should see China's penetration in their markets as a mix bag of opportunities and challenges that demands better informed analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Their basic algorithm, the so called deferred acceptance mechanism always returns a student optimal stable matching in linear time, and it is indeed widely used in practice. However, there can be some special features which may require significant adjustments on this algorithm, or the usage of other techniques, in order to satisfy all the objectives of the decision maker. The college admissions problem with ties and equal treatment policy is solvable with an extension of the Gale and Shapley algorithm, but, if there are further constraints, such as lower quotas, there exist no efficient way to find a stable solution. Both of these features are present in the Hungarian higher education matching scheme and a simple heuristic is used to compute the cutoff scores. Integer programming is a robust technique that can provide optimal solutions even when we have multiple requirements. In this paper we develop and test a new IP formulation for finding stable solutions for CAP with ties and equal treatment policy. This formulation is more general than the previously studied ones, and it has better performance, as we demonstrate with simulations, mostly because of its pure binary nature.","[Agoston, Kolos Cs.; Biro, Peter] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Operat Res & Actuarial Sci, Fovam Ter 8, H-1098 Budapest, Hungary; [Biro, Peter] Hungarian Acad Sci, Budaorsi Ut 45, H-1112 Budapest, Hungary",Corvinus University Budapest; Hungarian Academy of Sciences,"Agoston, KC (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Operat Res & Actuarial Sci, Fovam Ter 8, H-1098 Budapest, Hungary.",kolos.agoston@uni-corvinus.hu; peter.biro@krtk.mta.hu,,"Biro, Peter/0000-0001-7011-3463; Agoston, Kolos/0000-0002-6738-0592",Hungarian Academy of Sciences under Momentum Programme [LP2016-3/2016]; Hungarian Scientific Research Fund - OTKA [K108673],Hungarian Academy of Sciences under Momentum Programme; Hungarian Scientific Research Fund - OTKA(Orszagos Tudomanyos Kutatasi Alapprogramok (OTKA)),"Peter Biro was supported by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences under Momentum Programme (LP2016-3/2016), and by the Hungarian Scientific Research Fund - OTKA (no.

The approach can (a) help comprehensive evaluate environmental impacts of multiple types of vehicles, (b) facilitate analysis of environmental, economic and policy features of such vehicles, and (c) identify desirable taxi fleet development strategies for the city. The developed approach represented an improvement of the decision-making capability for taxi implementation based on multiple available technologies and their performance that can be specifically tailored to Beijing. The results demonstrated that the proposed approach could comprehensively reflect multiple implications of strategies for the taxi fleet in Beijing to reduce air pollution in the city. The results also indicated that the electric vehicle powered with the year 2020 electricity projections would be the ideal solution, outranking the other alternatives. The conventional vehicle ranked the lowest among the alternatives.

The estimation of this extension is nontrival since the volatility appears in both the conditional mean and the conditional variance, and its coefficient in the former is time-varying. We develop an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm based on band and sparse matrix algorithms instead of the Kalman filter to estimate this more general variant. The methodology is illustrated with an application that involves U.S., U.K., and Germany inflation. The estimation results show substantial time-variation in the coefficient associated with the volatility, highlighting the empirical relevance of the proposed extension. Moreover, in a pseudo out-of-sample forecasting exercise, the proposed variant also forecasts better than various standard benchmarks.","[Chan, Joshua C.

This scheme provides a financial incentive for home owners to engage in energy efficiency retrofits, provided the upgrades meet appropriate energy efficiency standards. This study analyses the BEH data, which is comprised of all applications from March 2009 to October 2015, in order to examine the extent to which applications are abandoned and the determinants thereof. We find that more complicated retrofits are more likely to be abandoned, with variation across certain combinations of retrofit measure. We find lower probabilities of abandonment among certain obligated parties, who are energy retailers obliged by the State to reduce energy consumption in Ireland, while others possess greater likelihoods of abandonment, relative to private retrofits. We find that newer homes are less likely to abandon an application than older homes, as are applications made for apartments, relative to houses. Regional variations exist in abandonment, with rural households more likely to abandon than urban households. A seasonal trend in abandonment is also present, with higher likelihoods of abandonment among applications made during winter.","[Collins, Matthew; Curtis, John] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland; [Collins, Matthew] Sustainable Energy Author Ireland, Wilton Pk House,Wilton Pl, Dublin, Ireland; [Curtis, John] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin,"Collins, M (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland.",matthew.collins@esri.ie; john.curtis@esri.ie,"Curtis, John/Q-8539-2018","Curtis, John/0000-0002-6957-5684",Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland; Energy Policy Research Centre,Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland; Energy Policy Research Centre,"We acknowledge the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland for access to the anonymous dataset of Better Energy Homes scheme applications.

In these circumstances enterprises try to gain competitive advantage, for example by use of so-called contemporary concepts and management tools. These researches should include in particular solutions based on, for example, Kaizen philosophy. Typical tool of the Kaizen philosophy is, in relation to the ideas reported by employees, the Suggestion System. In this context, it should be interesting to look at the premises and ways in which different enterprises use the Suggestion System in terms of a tool that can improve the production quality. In every enterprise employees structure is diverse and the interest of individual groups in the Suggestion System can be different. It seems that especially the age of employees can cause such difference. It can be speculated that people below 40 years old employees will be more engaged in the activities connected to the Suggestion System than their older counterparts. The purpose of the paper was to examine the Suggestion System which was used for the quality improvement in chosen production enterprises in three European countries: Poland, Slovakia and Czech Republic, the results of these studies were compared with each other. Particular attention has been paid to the use of this tool by different age groups of employees. Due to the qualitative nature of the research problem, a case study based method has been used.

In so doing, it investigates the potential role of regions as drivers of the new green economy, drawing on research into sustainability transitions.","[Gibbs, David] Univ Hull, Sch Environm Sci, Geog, Kingston Upon Hull, N Humberside, England; [O'Neill, Kirstie] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England",University of Hull; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Gibbs, D (通讯作者)，Univ Hull, Sch Environm Sci, Geog, Kingston Upon Hull, N Humberside, England.",d.c.gibbs@hull.ac.uk; k.j.oneill@hull.ac.uk,"Gibbs, David/ABE-7191-2020","Gibbs, David/0000-0001-8051-0024; ONeill, Kirstie/0000-0003-3954-9933",Regional Studies Association,Regional Studies Association,David Gibbs acknowledges the support of a Regional Studies Association Fellowship Research Grant.,,91,74,77,14,101,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Evaluation methods and their impact on efficiency of additional training could be influenced by financial resources. The donors have no methods how to measure economic efficiency of supported project. Moreover, training evaluation is an issue which does not have a simple solution. Still some Czech companies do not take enough interest in systematic evaluation of their training process or they make random or partial evaluation only or even no evaluation at all. Co-financing of additional training has influence on the shape of market and competition and has impact on quality and structure of companies, which offer additional trainings. Also the swing in incoming public resources has the impact on the shape as well as structure and intensity of additional training among Czech companies. Additional training has impact on companies and their profit as well as satisfaction on the market. (see Storej and Westhead: 1997).

The research goal is evaluate and measure whether the additional training financing by own resources is more efficient and generate better company (in category of SME) productivity or not. It will also compare with the training financing from the public subvention from ESF. It can also show if this ESF policy reach the convergence's goals. Particular goal of the research is to find and statistically argue the utility of training in the way of company productivity according to ROI (Return of Investment) criteria in the selected sample of SME which do or do not invest to additional training from own resources or subvention.

This paper presents the evaluation of the current position of women and socio-economic conditions on the labour market within the Visegrad Group. The first part is devoted to the characteristics of documents dealing with the employment policy of women and it also analyses conditions and position of women in selected countries. The second part contains analysis and comparison of level of family policies in selected countries with the EU and the assessment of financial support of women during their maternity leave. This part is complemented with the sociological survey focused on the position of women on labour market in Visegrad group. The Visegrad group countries have all experienced a transition to a market economy in the last two decades, but their family policies are by no means uniform. In the early years of this transition, the main guideline for organizing family allowances was the principle of universality, with the aim of compensating for the loss of job security and wage subsidies that characterized the former system. However, many of these countries have since moved toward means-tested support, while less emphasis has been placed on policies enabling women to combine motherhood with paid work.","[Liskova, Zuzana Dvorakova] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Reg Management, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Dvorak, Petr] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Fisheries & Protect Waters, Inst Aquaculture & Protect Waters, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Klufova, Renata] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Appl Math & Informat, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice; University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice; University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice,"Lísková, ZD (通讯作者)，Univ South Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Reg Management, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",azu.li@seznam.cz; dvorakp@frov.jcu.cz; klufova@ef.jcu.cz,"Klufová, Renata/G-3132-2019; Dvořáková Líšková, Zuzana/G-3160-2019",,,,,,17,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,384,390,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059200051,0

Besides molybdenum, the ore minerals contain scheelite, native bismuth, bismuthinite, magnetite and so on; and the gangue minerals are mainly andradite, fluorite and wollastonite. Part of the molybdenum exists in the scheelite in form of isomorphism, and there is an obvious negative correlation between MoO3 and WO3. The molybdenite granularity is mainly located in the 0.04 similar to 0.08mm area, which accounts for 29.5% of the total and is the finely disseminated ore. For samples of 70%, 90%, and 100% with the particle size of more than 200 meshes, the maximum recovery of the molybdenite are 75.15%, 86.45% and 91.25% respectively. So there will be a better use of molybdenum if we properly improve the grinded particle size of the comprehensive samples. As part of the molybdenum is distributed in the scheelite lattice, the actual recovery rate in this area may decline compared with the ideal value.","[Liu, W.

However, the Index only covers the data from the largest publicly listed companies that are members of the primary blue-chip index in the respective country and only 10 companies from Slovakia are included in the analysis. This paper therefore complements this evidence by focusing on the representation of women in the statutory and supervisory management bodies and top executive level positions of 50 largest non-financial companies, included in the Trend top 200 list for the year 2015. Additionally, the paper also examines how different factors, such as type of the company ownership, type of the decision-making body or number of its members, influence the representation of women in decision-making positions.

Value chain analysis can expose strategic and operational misalignments within the global value chains, and the consequential misallocation of resources and hence opportunities for improvements which create value and economic sustainability. The paper focuses mainly on the fast fashion business model and fast fashion global value chain. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the whole fast fashion business model by describing its key drivers from a strategic international management perspective. There are huge differences in the value chain and supply chain relationships between creative industries and one of creative fashion industry and it is not possible to generalize these relationships in one value and supply chain. For this reason, the paper describes dimensions of fashion industry value chain, mostly fast fashion in the context of industry analysis, value chain processes, support and related environment and evaluation of the relationship of stakeholders. Findings present main generalized value chain of the global fashion value chain. The paper also takes into account the of value chain approach that describes the vertical and horizontal linkages.

From empirical point of view the panel data regression of 22 chosen OECD countries in the period from 2000 to 2015 is used and done by several estimation techniques used (OLS, one-way and two-way fixed effect model and GMM).

Modern enterprises operate in an international environment, offering opportunities for growth and development, but featuring a danger of aggressive competition at the same time. Accounting is also affected by the consequences of globalisation. In recent years, the awareness among users of financial statements has been observed to increase. As a result, their expectations regarding the financial statements and the amount of information disclosed continuously grow. Another important change in accounting systems emerges in nonfinancial information disclosure. For several years, theorists and practitioners of accounting have been debating whether the financial data presented in financial statements is a sufficient source of knowledge for the decision-making process. Global trends unanimously indicate that besides traditional financial information, investors pay attention to business model issues, social responsibility and employment policy. The Directive 2014/95/UE implemented into national legislation systems forces the largest enterprises to publish some non-financial information. The data can also be disclosed in narrative reporting, also called management commentary. The main aim of this article is to present a conceptual framework for narrative reporting, matching both the polish accounting law and the international regulations. The results of performed researches on the forms of presentation in management commentary are to be presented.

A drying process of a moist porous sample of arable soil is studying in this contribution on the bases of the model of air and moisture transfer. The transfer considers from the porous sample to the external environment. In addition, the model also takes to the account the phase transition of water to saturated water vapor in the pores of the sample. Using the variables separation method, we determine an exact model solution that includes the concentration of dry air, the concentration of water, the concentration of water vapor and the evaporation rate function. The model consists of four equations. Three of them describe diffusion processes for air, water, and water vapor in the soil sample including phase transition.

The objectives of this paper is to propose a framework to explain the influence of website design (aesthetics and usability) on eWOM intention via the applicability of the stimulus-organism-response model. Based on literature review and the framework used, an online questionnaire is developed and sent to more than 350 respondents in Taiwan. Then, SPSS and partial least square (PLS) will be use to analyze the collected data in further research.

The values obtained in the liquidity group will demonstrate the financial component necessary for the successful functioning of the bank capital. Reliability indicators will reveal the level of profitability, financial stability and the impact of the size of the bank on its activities. Assessment of the level of risks will protect the movement of bank capital. The relative and absolute levels of equity capital will certify to users of information on the fulfillment by the bank of mandatory economic standards.

There exist a great number of different design methods based on various approaches. A large group of these filters is based on active components, namely amplifiers, that are equipped with the appropriate feedback to achieve the desired transfer function. In terms of applications operating at audible frequencies it became to be a rule that one or two operational amplifiers are applied, taking into consideration that their input impedance and amplification factor are infinitely high, whilst their output impedance is infinitely low. The simulation results presented in this paper show that these considerations may not be so strict. That means the input impedance may be in tens of kiloohms and the amplification factor of 40 dB without the feedback loop can do enough. Moreover, the operational amplifiers may be replaced by a simple circuit consisting of two transistors, as it is shown in this paper. This should be considered when calculating manufacturing costs of several designs. In this paper, a detailed description of a band pass filter for a third octave equalizer is presented. However, it is obvious, that the same approach can be applied in other designs.","[Pospisilik, Martin] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Appl Informat, Stranemi 4511, Zlin 76005, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Pospisilik, M (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Appl Informat, Stranemi 4511, Zlin 76005, Czech Republic.",pospisilik@fai.utb.cz,"Pospisilik, Martin/AAM-3553-2021",,"Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic within the National Sustainability Programme [LO1303, MSMT-7778/2014]","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic within the National Sustainability Programme","This work was supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic within the National Sustainability Programme project No. LO1303 (MSMT-7778/2014).",,5,0,0,0,0,EUROPEAN COUNCIL MODELLING & SIMULATION,NOTTINGHAM,"SCHOOL COMPUTING & MATHEMATICS, NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIV, BURTON STREET, NOTTINGHAM, NG1 4BU, ENGLAND",,,978-0-9932440-4-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,397,402,,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Economics; Engineering, Industrial",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Engineering,BH9XI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404420000060,0

Information globalization triggers the need for integration of business processes and the related information flows in certain company and between different enterprises involved in the same value chain. As a result the need for enterprises to integrate heterogeneous applications and systems grows. Service-oriented architecture (SOA) considered as a set of interacting Web services is able to ensure the information system flexibility, reduce software development, maintenance and upgrades costs, and thereby increase responsiveness of the system to changing business requirements. The paper discusses principles and methods for SOA design for small and middle enterprises (SME) considering the logic structure of business processes as a basis of coordinated service interactions. Taking into account the business requirements the problem of assessing the quality of web services for optimal choice and integration in structure is solved. In service-oriented design web-services have a direct impact on the possibility of development, adaptation and modernization of the information system. A set-theoretical approach, fuzzy logic and expert methods were used for evaluation and selection of web services. The developed procedures allow the user to select from a set of available services, the services with the required functionality that also satisfy non-functional requirements such as performance, reliability, security, response time etc. The proposed approach helps SME's to strengthen competitiveness through reducing the time-to-market and provides the necessary flexibility, according to changes in business environment.","[Shpolianskaya, Irina; Dolzhenko, Alexei; Glushenko, Sergey] Rostov State Univ Econ, Bolshaya Sadovaya Str 69, Rostov Na Donu 344002, Russia",Rostov State University of Economics; Southern Federal University,"Shpolianskaya, I (通讯作者)，Rostov State Univ Econ, Bolshaya Sadovaya Str 69, Rostov Na Donu 344002, Russia.",irinaspol@yandex.ru; doljenkoalex@gmail.com; gs-gears@yandex.ru,"Shpolianskaya, Irina/AAP-6471-2020; Dolzhenko, Alexey/AAQ-3585-2020",,,,,,18,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,2332,2339,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059204031,0

The gained experience can be an effective tool how to avoid repetitive mistakes thanks to targeted information and experience shared not only in areas of industrial companies. However, the gained experience is often isolated and is not further developed and handed over. On the one hand, knowledge is gained on the basis of specific approaches of various methods at different stages of the project. In addition, these experiences often only work within one project, as there are no conditions for sharing experiences across organization(s).

Vehicles are major petroleum consumers and contributors of greenhouse gas and criteria pollutants emissions in many countries around the world. Road transport is the biggest producer of carbon dioxide that affects the greenhouse effect at the most. Combusting of 1 litre of petrol means production of 2.5 kg of carbon dioxide. At the same time, to combust 1 kg of petrol, approximately 15 kg of air is consumed. The amount of fuel consumed affects the environment, status of health of human population as well as the financial costs that are associated with vehicle operation. The article is focused on the issues of driving resistances that affect a vehicle. Every vehicle breaks driving resistances during a drive. These resistances are air resistance, acceleration resistance, rolling resistance and gradient resistance. The engine must perform certain work in order to break the driving resistances. The value increase of some of the resistances results in the increase of the work needed for its breaking. For such work it is necessary to consume certain amount of fuel and the result is seen in the form of harmful emissions. The article describes the mechanism of formation of particular driving resistances and factors that affect them.","[Synak, Frantisek; Rievaj, Vladimir] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Urban & Rd Transport, Univ 1, Zilina, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Rievaj, V (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Urban & Rd Transport, Univ 1, Zilina, Slovakia.",frantisek.synak@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Rievaj, Vladimir/R-2279-2016; Synák, František/HDM-9651-2022",,,,,,14,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,2602,2609,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059204066,0

EU energy policy has evolved under the influence of various factors. There were: global energy crises, environmental threats, rising prices of energy commodities and electricity, achieved level of economic integration in the European Union. Currently, the main goal of Community energy policy is to create a single electricity market. It will result in the integration of national energy markets into single EU energy market. It meets the energy and environmental challenges faced by the EU. These are: ensuring the energy security of the European Community, technological development and constant modernizing of energy system equipment, ensuring clean electricity supply from renewable energy sources, ensuring low electricity costs for customers. In the article, the actions undertaken by the Polish political, economic and energy sectors to integrate with the European system aimed at creating a common energy market are presented. The structure and resources of the Polish electricity production and distribution market are also presented.

The information base is provided by qualitative and quantitative assessments of signs of actual performance of freight transportation by volume and addresses, by time, speed, intensity and cost parameters. The obtained model ensures the traceability of cargo traffic data in the exit routes. A mathematical description of the process enables us to trace the status of the timing, speed and cost parameters of actual freight transportation at any desired time, to identify and duly address the risks posed by interactions with interfacing transportation entities and traffic. The modelling results provide for the identification of a double effect of the freight transportation digitization in exit routes - the growth of transporters' revenues and the growth of consignors' marginal profits due to a reduction of transport costs in the global transportation services.","[Zhuravleva, Natalia A.; Karchik, Valentin G.] Emperor Alexander I St Petersburg State Transport, Dept Transport Econ, Moskovsky Pr 9, St Petersburg 190031, Russia",Emperor Alexander I St. Petersburg State Transport University,"Zhuravleva, NA (通讯作者)，Emperor Alexander I St Petersburg State Transport, Dept Transport Econ, Moskovsky Pr 9, St Petersburg 190031, Russia.",zhuravleva_na@mail.ru; vkar1@rambler.ru,"Zhuravleva, Natalia/B-3231-2019","Zhuravleva, Natalia/0000-0003-3566-9225",,,,,20,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,3091,3098,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059205062,0

The assessment is performed in terms of economic impacts and political feasibility. Model-based scenarios considering different price and quantity levels are analyzed on Balmorel-MX, a cost optimization bottom-up model of the Mexican electricity system. The political feasibility is evaluated using an online survey and interviews with representatives of relevant stakeholder groups. The assessment suggests that an ETS is the most appropriate instrument for the Mexican case. We recommend to set the cap as 31% abatement in relation to a baseline, which is suggested to be 102 MtCO(2) by 2030, given the business-as-usual baseline used as reference by the Mexican government (202 MtCO(2)) is found to leave cost-effective abatement potential untapped. An emission trading system with such design has higher cost efficiency and lower distributional effects than a carbon tax at equivalent ambition level (15 USD/tCO(2)). The political feasibility analysis confirms the assessment, as it is in line with the priorities of the stakeholder groups, allows earmarking carbon revenue and avoids exempting natural gas from carbon pricing.","[Barragan-Beaud, Camila; Xylia, Maria; Silveira, Semida] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Energy Technol, Energy & Climate Studies, Stockholm, Sweden; [Barragan-Beaud, Camila; Syri, Sanna] Aalto Univ, Sch Engn, Dept Mech Engn, Aalto, Finland; [Pizarro-Alonso, Amalia] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Management Engn, Energy Syst Anal, Lyngby, Denmark",Royal Institute of Technology; Aalto University; Technical University of Denmark,"Pizarro-Alonso, A (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Management Engn, Energy Syst Anal, Lyngby, Denmark.",camilabb@kth.se; aroal@dtu.dk; maria.xylia@energy.kth.se; sanna.syri@aalto.fi; semida.silveira@energy.kth.se,"Syri, Sanna/G-2444-2013; Silveira, Semida/G-4830-2015",,,,,,89,44,45,1,74,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2018,122.0,,,,,,287,299,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.07.010,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GX2UX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447576700027,0

This research consists of a two-step study. First, we conduct a literature review to analyse the academic views by systematically reading the reports to investigate practitioners' views on the performance indicators for environmental sustainability and energy efficiency in the port industry. Second, we provide, through a qualitative method, a portrait of the Italian seaports and a multiple case study to confirm the developed conceptual managerial key performance indicators (KPIs). Specifically, applying the Balanced Scorecard model, this paper provides managerial KPIs to support PM in their decision-making processes within the inter-organizational relationships with shipping lines for developing environmentally sustainable and energy efficient ports.","[Di Vaio, Assunta; Alvino, Federico] Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Law, Via G Parisi 13, I-80132 Naples, Italy; [Varriale, Luisa] Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Sport Sci & Wellbeing, Via Medina 40, I-80133 Naples, Italy",Parthenope University Naples; Parthenope University Naples,"Di Vaio, A (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Law, Via G Parisi 13, I-80132 Naples, Italy.",susy.divaio@uniparthenope.it,"Di Vaio, Assunta/N-2259-2019","Di Vaio, Assunta/0000-0002-0498-1630","University Parthenope, Naples, Italy","University Parthenope, Naples, Italy","This publication has been produced with the financial support of University Parthenope, Naples, Italy, Research Financial Resources, Annualita 2017.",,97,83,84,8,78,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2018,122.0,,,,,,229,240,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.07.046,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GX2UX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447576700022,0

Transitioning to electricity systems that are considered acceptable by the public requires that the public's preferences be taken into account. In this study, we investigate the type of energy technology portfolio that people prefer for Switzerland, and why they prefer it, when they are faced with two realistic constraints: (i) the limited domestic potential for the expansion of power plants and (ii) the requirement to not dismantle existing infrastructure. We find that the affect evoked by particular energy technologies is consistently the most important driver of the proportion of those technologies included in an energy portfolio. The regression models for the investigated technologies explain between 14% and 54% of the variance, providing strong support for the affect heuristic. We further find that concerns regarding environmental impacts, costs or climate change play an additional role for portfolio preferences. This is reflected in four different clusters we identified for the German-speaking Swiss population who potentially hold opposing views as to what they consider the best electricity mix. For policymakers, our findings suggest that positive affective reactions towards energy technologies are necessary, although concerns must also be considered if the implementation is to be widely accepted.","[Jobin, Marilou; Siegrist, Michael] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, IED, Consumer Behav, Univ Str 22, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Jobin, M (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, IED, Consumer Behav, Univ Str 22, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",marilou.jobin@hest.ethz.ch,"Jobin, Marilou/KCJ-6828-2024; Siegrist, Michael/A-1032-2008",,Swiss National Science Foundation [166098],Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),This research was financially supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (project no. 166098).

We expect that fulfilling this pledge will likely require a reduced reliance on fossil-based energy and additional investments in low-carbon energy sources. To fully assess these impacts, we develop a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the Turkish economy that combines macroeconomic representation of non-electric sectors with a detailed power sector representation. We analyze several scenarios to assess the impact of an emission trading scheme: one including the planned nuclear development and a renewable subsidy scheme (BAU), and another with no nuclear technology allowed (NoN). Our assessment shows that in 2030, without policy, primary energy will be mainly oil, natural gas and coal. Under an emission trading scheme, however, coal-fired power generation vanishes by 2030 in both BAU and NoN due to the high cost of carbon. With nuclear (BAU), GHG emissions are 3.1% lower than NoN due to the resulting energy mix, allowing for a lower carbon price ($50/tCO2 in BAU compared to $70/tCO2 in NoN). Our results suggest that fulfillment of Turkey's pledge may be possible at a modest economic cost of about 0.8-1% by 2030.","[Kat, Bora; Paltsev, Sergey; Yuan, Mei] MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Kat, Bora] Sci & Technol Res Council Turkey TUBITAK, Ankara, Turkey; [Kat, Bora] Middle East Tech Univ, Grad Sch Nat & Appl Sci, Earth Syst Sci, Ankara, Turkey",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK); Middle East Technical University,"Kat, B (通讯作者)，Sci & Technol Res Council Turkey TUBITAK, Ankara, Turkey.",bora.kat@tubitak.gov.tr,"Kat, Bora/R-1990-2018; yuan, meiyi/AAR-5159-2020","Kat, Bora/0000-0002-6863-6940; Paltsev, Sergey/0000-0003-3287-0732",Turkish Fulbright Commission [FY-2016-TR-SS-09],Turkish Fulbright Commission,"The authors thank Jamie Bartholomay for her help with the paper.

One such avoided cost that has received little attention is the market price response, or how distributed PV generation reduces utilities' procurement costs and, consequently, consumers' costs through reduced wholesale electricity prices in the short-term. We quantify the reduction in day-ahead wholesale electricity prices to distributed PV generation in California (CA) from 2013 through 2015. Using a database of all distributed PV systems in the three CA investor owned utilities, we estimate historic hourly distributed PV generation using three methods that we validate with metered generation from 205 PV systems. Via multiple linear regression, we then estimate electricity price reductions due to distributed PV generation. Across the three methods used to estimate PV generation, distributed PV generation reduced hourly median (mean) wholesale electricity prices by up to $2.7-3.1/MWh ($2.9-3.2/MWh) ($(2015)), or by 7-8% (8-9%). Lower wholesale prices reduced utilities' energy procurement costs in the day-ahead market by up to $650-730 million ($(2015)) from 2013 through 2015.

Although an increase in the use of renewable energy sources is expected, 40% of the new connections until 2030 will be through conventional technologies, including diesel. Diesel generator sets can be carried out using three different strategies: (1) off-grid, (2) support to national grid extension or (3) support to distributed generation plants in rural zones. Advantages and inconveniences of each strategy have not clearly been stated yet. The objective is to evaluate and compare the 3 strategies to improve future projects. Therefore, cases from Venezuela have been studied. Historical generation and operational data are analyzed, as well as in situ visits, surveys and interviews. Although Venezuela is an oil producer country, contrasts with the world energy matrix since its fossil fuel-based generation is less than a half of the global average. Results show the advantages of each strategy are conditioned by geographical, climatic and logistical factors, while benefits of the support to national grid extension strategy have been highlighted. These results can assist rural electrification promoters to effectively determine the most appropriate diesel projects strategy.","[Lopez-Gonzalez, A.; Domenech, B.; Ferrer-Marti, L.] Univ Politecn Catalunya BarcelonaTech, Inst Ind & Control Engn, Barcelona, Spain; [Lopez-Gonzalez, A.] Univ Politecn Catalunya BarcelonaTech, Inst Sustainabil, Barcelona, Spain; [Lopez-Gonzalez, A.] Univ Zulia, Socioecon Ctr Petr & Alternat Energies, Maracaibo, Venezuela",Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya,"López-González, A (通讯作者)，Av Diagonal 647,Pavil F,Floor 0, Barcelona 08028, Spain.",a.lopez@upc.edu,"López González, Alejandro/HPC-3431-2023; Domenech, Bruno/ABF-8264-2020; Domenech, Bruno/ABE-5991-2020; Ferrer Marti, Laia/K-2881-2014","López González, Alejandro/0000-0002-9031-4649; Domenech, Bruno/0000-0002-4332-2400; Ferrer Marti, Laia/0000-0003-0606-3523",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ENE 2015-67253-R]; Centre for Cooperation Development (CCD) of the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya - Barcelona TECH (UPC) [2017-U012],Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); Centre for Cooperation Development (CCD) of the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya - Barcelona TECH (UPC),"This research was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (project ENE 2015-67253-R) and the Centre for Cooperation Development (CCD) of the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya - Barcelona TECH (UPC) (2017-U012).

The exact dates (i.e., timing) of the stepdown events were not known, yet recent analyses find evidence of an announcement effect wherein consumer adoption is pulled-forward across these stepdown events. We analyze unique data from our recent household-level survey on the decision-making process for 194 of these very consumers within a narrow window of eight CSI rebate stepdown events, comparing the decision-making processes of pulled-forward consumers to their counterparts that adopt just after a rebate stepdown. We find evidence that a subset of pre-stepdown adopters engage in more savvy decision-making behaviors from their post-stepdown counterparts, including strategic adoption timing. Given these behavioral differences, we conclude that future analyses should carefully consider aspects of individual decision-making processes as potential confounders and control for them if possible. Experience is identified as a potential pathway through which this non-negligible subset of adopters may gain the ability to execute savvy decision-making behaviors; future research should assess the degree to which policy implementation can explicitly leverage this pathway.","[Reeves, D.

Learning from Sweden's example, this research maps where smokestacks are placed in relation to land uses, finding that residential areas comprise nearly 20% of the surrounding land uses within a quarter mile of district-heating associated smokestacks.

The relocation decisions are conceptually split into those on whether to relocate and where to relocate, specified by a nested-logistic model structure. The results indicate that manufacturing establishments' preference to intra-industry agglomeration changes non-monotonically during their lifetime. While they prefer to stay in or move into municipalities characterized by the own-industry agglomeration in their initial relocation decision, they shun the intra-industry agglomeration in the stages of post-initial relocation. These findings suggest that to achieve the goal of industrial decentralization, policies to induce incumbent firms to relocate into rural areas could be more effective than those to attract start-up firms in peripheral area because they have lower dependence on agglomeration externalities.","[Yi, Yoojin] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Reg Quantitat Anal Res Grp BK21plus, 1,200-1003 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Yi, Y (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Reg Quantitat Anal Res Grp BK21plus, 1,200-1003 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea.",jinparki@snu.ac.kr,,"Yi, Yoojin/0000-0002-4390-2560",,,,,36,7,8,1,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

We investigate this issue using measures of public service performance and autonomy at the region level in 171 European regions. We introduce a novel dose-response approach which identifies the pattern of the effect of regional autonomy on the performance of public services. The relationship between the level of regional autonomy and the provision of local public services exhibits a u-shape: both low and high autonomy lead to better local public services. This speaks against the presence of one optimal level of autonomy and policy recommendations based on the view that more decentralisation is always desirable.

However, changes to economic conditions impact household spending and savings decisions. To investigate the dynamics of this relationship, we examine mortgage payment choices of homeowners who purchased property in areas that later experienced a positive shock to local economic conditions via the shale oil and gas boom. We find that borrowers with properties located in areas with shale oil and gas booms experienced a 6% reduction in the probability of missing a mortgage payment over the period 2007-2014. Indexing these results to the size of the boom, we find that one hundred additional rigs (billion dollars of oil and gas produced) are associated with a 3.2% (1.6%) decrease in default.

To do so, an extended gravity model, combined with a methodology that identifies endogenous thresholds to nonlinear effects, is estimated. The results support that the role played by labor factors is more important for foreigners than natives, especially before the outbreak of the economic crisis. The results also indicate that the relative size of the service sector and, to a lesser extent, climate conditions have gained importance as attraction factors for natives over the crisis, while the opposite happens for foreigners. Therefore, evidence clearly supports the idea that business cycle modifies the decision making of migrants. Finally, some nonlinearities in the effect of expected wages on migration are found regardless of the group and/or time frame considered.","[Gutierrez-Portilla, Maria; Maza, Adolfo; Hierro, Maria] Univ Cantabria, Avda Los Castros S-N, E-39005 Santander, Spain",Universidad de Cantabria,"Gutiérrez-Portilla, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cantabria, Avda Los Castros S-N, E-39005 Santander, Spain.",maria.gutierrezp@unican.es; mazaaj@unican.es; maria.hierro@unican.es,"Maza, Adolfo/H-5265-2019","Maza, Adolfo/0000-0002-7299-3449","Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports [FPU14/00900]","Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports(Spanish Government)","The authors thank Professor JoseVillaverde for his helpful comments.

Little has been said, however, about the effects of housing consumption restrictions on the dispersal of neighbourhood effects to different economic groups. At a time of rising public concern about economic inequality, properly understanding the link between housing market restrictions and neighbourhood effects across the income spectrum is of increasing importance. This paper proposes a model to better assess how labour productivity as influenced by neighbourhood effects changes with restrictions in housing consumption. The results of the model show that except in the case where no labour complementarity exists between the high and low-skilled population segments, housing restrictions excluding the poor from the better-off neighbourhoods will lead to welfare losses for both populations.","[Asquith, Brian] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Social 3151, Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Asquith, B (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Social 3151, Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",basquith@uci.edu,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

Promoting energy transition is among the great challenges for China. As one of the most developed megacities in China, Beijing promotes energy transition intensively. In this study, we explored the trends, socioeconomic drivers and environmental impacts of the energy transition process in Beijing during the decades. We found that Beijing's energy transition has gone through four typical stages. After a parallel growth between the economy and coal-dominated energy consumption at beginning, the growth rate of energy consumption has gradually slowed down since 1996. Between 2000 and 2007, the energy structure became relatively balanced and diversified, driven by the changes of energy intensity, energy structure, and final demand composition, along with the economic structure's shift from heavy manufacturing to service. Thereafter, economic development was seriously decoupled from direct energy consumption, and the de-coal trend had made remarkable achievements. SO, and NO,, emissions have declined significantly since 2007. Diversified energy structure based on the de-coal trend, cleaner energy, and economic restructuring promotes energy transition. Meanwhile the feasibility of implementation also should be considered in other cities' energy transition process in China.","[Zhang, Pengpeng; Zhang, Lixiao; Tian, Xin; Hao, Yan] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Wang, Changbo] Minist Agr, Nanjing Res Inst Agr Mechanizat, Nanjing 210014, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Lixiao; Tian, Xin] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, 19 Xin Jie Kou Wai St, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China","Beijing Normal University; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Nanjing Institute of Agricultural Mechanization, CAAS; Beijing Normal University","Zhang, LX; Tian, X (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.;Zhang, LX; Tian, X (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, 19 Xin Jie Kou Wai St, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",zhangpengpeng@mail.bnu.edu.cn; zhanglixiao@bnu.edu.cn; tianx@bnu.edu.cn; haoyan@bnu.edu.cn; changbo@mail.bnu.edu.cn,"hao, yan/HGB-0465-2022; pengpeng, zhang/ABF-9611-2020; Tian, Xin/HKE-7875-2023",,Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2017YFC0505703]; Funds for International Cooperation and Exchanges of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [51661125010]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41371521],"Ministry of Science and Technology of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, China); Funds for International Cooperation and Exchanges of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was supported by the National Science and Technology Major Project of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (2017YFC0505703), Funds for International Cooperation and Exchanges of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51661125010) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (41371521).",,99,28,31,17,141,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUN,2018,117.0,,,,,,173,183,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.02.039,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GF4KU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431932600018,0

In this study, using panel data consisting of 30 Chinese provincial-level regions between 2000 and 2014, an extension of the CH-LP framework is first employed to control for the disparity between different proxy variables for FDI and trade in the previous literature. The effects of both indigenous R&D and technology spillovers in the formation of FDI and trade on carbon intensity are investigated in depth by utilizing both linear and nonlinear analyses. The linear empirical results indicate that both indigenous R&D and import's technology spillover play a significant role in decreasing China's carbon intensity. The technology spillovers originating from FDI and export are also beneficial to the reduction of China's carbon intensity. Further estimation results based on the nonlinear analysis indicate that the local technology absorption capacity affecting factors such as human capital, indigenous R&D and the full-time equivalent of R&D personnel are crucial for determining the level of carbon intensity.","[Huang, Junbing; Liu, Qiang; Cai, Xiaochen] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Hao, Yu] Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Hao, Yu] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, 5 Zhongguancun South St, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Hao, Yu] Sustainable Dev Res Inst Econ & Soc Beijing, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Hao, Yu] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Elect Vehicles Beijing, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Hao, Yu] Beijing Key Lab Energy Econ & Environm Management, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Lei, Hongyan] Chengdu Univ TCM, Chengdu 611137, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Beijing Institute of Technology; Beijing Institute of Technology; Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine,"Hao, Y (通讯作者)，Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",20701432@bit.edu.cn; lqcarrer@sina.com; caixiaochen1975@sina.com; haoyuking@bit.edu.cn; hongyanlei2015@163.com,"wang, KiKi/JFZ-3334-2023; Hao, Yu/ABF-4628-2021","Hao, Yu/0000-0001-8394-4215","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71403015, 71521002]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation [9162013]; Beijing Social Science Foundation [17JDYJA009]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFA0602801, 2016YFA0602603]; Joint Development Program of the Beijing Municipal Commission of Education",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); Beijing Social Science Foundation; National Key Research and Development Program of China; Joint Development Program of the Beijing Municipal Commission of Education,"This paper is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71403015, 71521002), the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (9162013), the key research program of Beijing Social Science Foundation (17JDYJA009), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFA0602801, 2016YFA0602603), and the Joint Development Program of the Beijing Municipal Commission of Education.

The main drivers for the Latin America region are the activity and the population effects, followed by the fossil fuel and the carbonisation effects, while the intensity effect is revealed as the only inhibitor. The lessons from Latin America's group of countries are the following. First, the necessary decoupling between the growth of CO2 emissions and the economic activity has not taken place, the population growth also being an important driver effect. Second, the groups of countries with the highest CO2 emissions growth, show the highest population and fossil fuel effects. This latter confirms the scant efforts made to reduce the weight of fossil fuels in the total primary energy supply. Third, the energy intensity has become the most important inhibitor of CO2 emissions for those countries that are not able to substitute fossil fuels so easily.

At the same time, there are increasing concerns about the vulnerability of ports and terminals to man-made and natural disasters. This paper advances a methodology for estimating the total economic consequences of and resilience to a disruption of crude oil and refined petroleum product trade at a major seaport. The methodology is able to estimate not only the direct impacts of such disruptions but also the supply-chain effects. It also estimates the effects of muting the impacts by various resilience tactics such as ship re-routing, drawing inventories from storage, accessing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, geographic shifting of petroleum refining, and production rescheduling. We apply the methodology to a 90-day disruption of petroleum trade at the twin seaports of Beaumont and Port Arthur, Texas. The results indicate that port region and national economic activity could decline by billions of dollars, but that resilience can reduce these consequences significantly. We also conclude that factors associated with the recent surge in the extraction of shale and tight oil resources has significantly enhanced the potential effectiveness of some resilience tactics.","[Rose, Adam; Wei, Dan] Univ Southern Calif, Sol Price Sch Publ Policy, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Rose, Adam; Wei, Dan] Univ Southern Calif, CREATE, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Paul, Donald] Univ Southern Calif, Viterbi Sch Engn, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Paul, Donald] Univ Southern Calif, Energy Inst, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Rose, Adam; Wei, Dan] USC, Price Sch Publ Policy, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Paul, Donald] USC, Viterbi Sch Engn, Los Angeles, CA USA",University of Southern California; University of Southern California; University of Southern California; University of Southern California; University of Southern California; University of Southern California,"Wei, D (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Sol Price Sch Publ Policy, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.;Wei, D (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, CREATE, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",danwei@usc.edu,,"Wei, Dan/0000-0003-0738-2286; Rose, Adam/0000-0003-3347-7684",,,,,52,33,36,8,60,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,APR,2018,115.0,,,,,,584,615,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.12.052,0.0,,,32,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GA1TH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428099800055,0

We use an agricultural household dynamic programming model that includes two types of households differentiated by their socio-economic characteristics and that are linked through agricultural contracts. Households are also differentiated by their membership in terms of men, women and children. The model simulates the effects of policies such as state subsidies for the purchase of solar panels, improvement in non-agricultural employment opportunities, and combinations of the two, as they are suggested to improve energy supply and reduce trade-offs in energy use. The model results indicate that households improve energy use patterns by using solar panels; yet, adoption of such technology is conditional on state subsidy levels of 50% and 80% for the purchase of solar panels for farming and domestic purposes respectively. Subsidies for solar panels together with improvement of off-farm work increases off-farm employment levels and income of the poorer household, however, this policy reduces agricultural production. In addition, the wealthier household incurs losses from improvement in non-agricultural employment opportunities due to reduced labor availability for farm operations.","[Djanibekov, Utkur] Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, 231 Morrin Rd, Auckland 1072, New Zealand; [Djanibekov, Utkur] Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ ILR, Meckenheimer Allee 174, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Gaur, Varun] Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, Walter Flex Str 3, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",Landcare Research - New Zealand; University of Bonn; University of Bonn,"Djanibekov, U (通讯作者)，Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, 231 Morrin Rd, Auckland 1072, New Zealand.",djanibekovu@landcareresearch.co.nz; varungaur.engg@gmail.com,,,German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ),German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ),The authors gratefully acknowledge the support for this research from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ).,,48,16,17,1,36,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2018,113.0,,,,,,439,453,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.11.023,0.0,,,15,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FT2XO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000423009500043,0

Globalization induces a highly competitive business environment where the optimal utilization of resources emerges as a critical aspect of project management. In this respect, project portfolio solutions can facilitate the balance between effectiveness and efficiency by means of portfolio management. In the recent decades project portfolio management has developed as a contemporary approach supporting the realization of the organizational strategy through enhancement of the effectiveness and efficiency of its implementation. The goal of the paper is to provide an overview of the major factors that favourably affect project portfolio management practices using survey data from Bulgarian project-oriented organizations. Using an original research instrument, data about this implementation were collected through purposive sampling of organizations that apply project portfolio management approach in their operations. A selection of empirical results from a questionnaire survey of the factors of effective project portfolio management is presented concerning the implementation of portfolio management approach in the studied organizations. The set of specific implementation items are grouped into five major factors by application of principal component analysis. Each of these latent factors reflects a particular cluster of internal capabilities of the organization to implement successfully the project portfolio management practices in conditions of globalized economy.","[Alexandrova, Matilda] Univ Natl & World Econ, Sofia, Bulgaria",University of National & World Economics - Bulgaria,"Alexandrova, M (通讯作者)，Univ Natl & World Econ, Sofia, Bulgaria.",matildaa@unwe.bg,"Alexandrova, Matilda/J-8420-2016","Alexandrova, Matilda/0000-0001-7235-2433",,,,,14,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,963,970,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300125,0

We see it as an irreversible process, which deeply interferes with the existing structures of each country. For this reason, goal of our paper is to evaluate the existing situation of globalization in the Slovak Republic and compare it with other EU countries, and clarify its connectivity with other significant phenomena that we regard as the human capital and the economic growth. The analysis based on the globalization index, can be mapped in three dimensions: economic, social and political areas, and has been available for review since 1970. In the research of the human capital, we use the information of the HDI index, and in the research of the economic growth, we focus on the analysis of the GDP per capita.

However, the synchronisation of business cycles is expected to increase because of the growing inter-linkages among regions led by the adoption of common currency and common economic policies (Frankel and Rose effect). We show that in the case of nineteenth-century Austria-Hungary the specialisation effect, most likely amplified by the stock market crisis of 1873, prevailed during 1867-1890, while the common currency/policy effect prevailed during 1890-1913, when the gold standard was adopted in both Austria and Hungary. However, core and peripheral regions contributed differently to the correlation of business fluctuations.","[Ciccarelli, Carlo] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Econ & Finance, Via Columbia 2, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [Missiaia, Anna] Lund Univ, Econ Hist Dept, Alfa 1,Scheelevagen 15 B, S-22363 Lund, Sweden",University of Rome Tor Vergata; Lund University,"Ciccarelli, C (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Econ & Finance, Via Columbia 2, I-00133 Rome, Italy.",carlo.ciccarelli@uniroma2.it; anna.missiaia@ekh.lu.se,,"Missiaia, Anna/0000-0002-4872-1865",,,,,44,0,1,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Our analysis uses the synthetic control method (SCM) to examine if the passage of the Stand Your Ground (SYG) laws had dissimilar effects on homicides and firearms deaths in the US states that passed these laws during the first wave (between 2005 and 2007). Using 22 years of data (1991-2012) to study each state separately, we find that these laws did not have uniform effects across states: in three out of 14 states - Florida, Alabama and Michigan - they led to increased (non-suicide) firearms deaths (and by different magnitudes). These three states imposed a duty to retreat prior to their SYG laws and saw a marked departure in self-defence treatment as their SYG laws passed. As for murder and non-negligent manslaughter, only for Florida was an effect found.","[Guettabi, Mouhcine] Univ Alaska Anchorage, Coll Business & Publ Policy, Inst Social & Econ Res, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA; [Munasib, Abdul] Univ Georgia, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Griffin, GA USA; [Munasib, Abdul] US Dept Commerce, Bur Econ Anal, Suitland, MD USA",University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Anchorage; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Guettabi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Alaska Anchorage, Coll Business & Publ Policy, Inst Social & Econ Res, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA.",mguettabi@alaska.edu; Abdul.Munasib@bea.gov,,,,,,,44,10,12,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The new approach has two components. First, a slice sampler is developed, which leverages a decomposition of the likelihood function that is a Bayesian analogue to two-stage least squares. The new sampler permits nonconjugate shrinkage priors to be implemented easily and efficiently. The new computational approach permits a Bayesian analysis of problems that were previously infeasible due to computational demands that scaled poorly in the number of regressors. Second, a new predictor-dependent shrinkage prior is developed specifically for the many instruments setting. The prior is constructed based on a factor model decomposition of the matrix of observed instruments, allowing many instruments to be incorporated into the analysis in a robust way. Features of the new method are illustrated via a simulation study and three empirical examples.","[Hahn, P.

An important aspect in the regeneration of brownfields in the Visegrad group countries is a future use. In all four countries of Visegrad Group there is a clear movement in favor of cognition and protection of the cultural values of industrial heritage.

The control group dramatically overestimates how much winning would help them grow the size of their firm.

The aim of the article is to define the structure of the influx of visitors to the region as well as relation between national structure and the development of the types of accommodation. Based on data from the Czech Statistical Office and the CzechTourism, the Index of the Internationalization of Tourism in the region was quantified. That illustrated an increasing proportion of foreign tourists to the total number of visitors of the region. Simultaneously, it was found, that there is a relationship between the influx of French tourists and the development of accommodation in the two-star category. The research discovered preferences of Slovak, Polish and German tourists to choose accommodation providing higher standards of service. Interestingly, tourists from the Netherlands, generally preferring campsites, are almost not searching for this at all, which may indicate an inadequate level of this accommodation.

There are many implications resulting from globalization for human resources management - managing and acceptance of diversity management, acquiring multicultural knowledge, creating of virtual work positions, using of online recruitment, management of talented individuals, and others. Battle of talents is one of many strategic problems in the area of human resources, considered as the most important. That is the reason why this paper deals with talent management and its impact on economic results in companies providing business in Slovakia. The objective of the research survey is to detect relationships between the level of talent management process and economic results. We searched whether companies with improved economic results have talent management process on higher level. We used data from 381 companies, which filled in the questionnaire. A scaled questionnaire was distributed online through Google documents system. Questionnaire reliability was verified by Cronbach's alpha and reached the level 0.799. To find the statistically significant differences between individual groups of respondents the Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test were used.

Due to the still growing proliferation and specialization of bots, a large body of research into characterization and recognition of their traffic has been conducted so far. In particular, some approaches to classify bot and human sessions on websites have been proposed in the literature. In this paper we verify and discuss the efficiency of such recently proposed approach, which uses differences in resource request patterns of bots and humans. We reconstructed Web sessions from actual HTTP log data for three different e-commerce sites, varying in the traffic intensity and proportions of bot sessions in the overall traffic. Two heuristic procedures for labeling sessions as driven by a bot or a human were proposed and implemented. Resource request patterns for both session classes, using both session labeling procedures, were analyzed and their potential to differentiate between bot and human sessions was investigated. Results show that the broader session labeling procedure allows one to capture more bot sessions and that resource requests patterns are a good discriminant of bots and humans on e-commerce sites.","[Suchacka, Grazyna; Motyka, Igor] Opole Univ, Inst Math & Informat, Ul Oleska 48, PL-45052 Opole, Poland",University of Opole,"Suchacka, G (通讯作者)，Opole Univ, Inst Math & Informat, Ul Oleska 48, PL-45052 Opole, Poland.",gsuchacka@uni.opole.pl; igor_motyka@mail.com,,"Suchacka, Grazyna/0000-0001-7456-1204",National Science Centre (NCN) in Poland [DEC2017/01/X/ST6/01070],"National Science Centre (NCN) in Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)",This work was partially supported by the National Science Centre (NCN) in Poland under Grant No. DEC2017/01/X/ST6/01070.,,12,6,6,0,0,EUROPEAN COUNCIL MODELLING & SIMULATION,NOTTINGHAM,"SCHOOL COMPUTING & MATHEMATICS, NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIV, BURTON STREET, NOTTINGHAM, NG1 4BU, ENGLAND",,,978-0-9932440-7-0,,,,2018,,,,,,,475,481,,,,,,7,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Engineering, Industrial",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Engineering,BR5JS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000656119000070,0

The present research assessed the potential effect of AM on the global energy demand in four energy scenarios for 2050 with extended versus limited globalisation and limited versus extensive adoption of AM. These scenarios were developed and applied for two cases, namely the aerospace sector and the construction sector, analysing the effect of AM on each phase in the value chain. In the aerospace sector, energy savings of 5-25% can be made, with the largest effect in the use phase because of weight reduction. In the construction sector, energy savings of 4-21% are achievable, with the largest effects in the feedstock, transport and use phases. Extrapolated to the global energy demand in 2050, a reduction of 26-138 EJ/yr, equivalent to 5-27% of global demand is achievable. It is recommended that energy policymakers should consider integrating AM and other disruptive technologies, such as robotics and the Internet of Things, into their long-term energy planning, policies and programmes, including Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement on climate change.","[Verhoef, Leendert A.] Delft Univ Technol, Green Off, Broekweg 2, NL-2628 CS Delft, Netherlands; [Budde, Bart W.; Chockalingam, Cindhuja; Nodar, Brais Garcia] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Appl Sci, NL-2628 CJ Delft, Netherlands; [van Wijk, Ad J.

Material deprivation is not only a threat to people who have problems with employment, but generally to persons who face some form of shortage in the items that their household cannot afford, because of their financial possibilities. Wages or other forms of income that represent the basic income of households may not be sufficient as an indicator of material deprivation. The relationship between income and material deprivation requires global attention in all EU countries as well as in Slovakia.

Moreover, the current production is causing severe environmental and energy security issues due to reliance on thermal sources. Stakeholders are hindered to address these issues due to a significant knowledge gap causing discrepancies in power policies. A comprehensive approach over the sustainability dimensions is missing due to non-adoption of life cycle thinking. This study adopts an integrated approach of life cycle sustainability assessment of the electricity sector in Pakistan for proposing policy guidelines and implementation framework to optimize the future energy mixes. In total, 20 sustainability indicators have been assessed covering life cycle of seven electricity generation sources, currently in use. These sources have been ranked by equally weighting the sustainability dimensions and respective indicators. Hydropower is found as the most sustainable option having lowest environmental and economic impacts. While due to worst economic and social impacts, oil is found to be the least sustainable option for the country. While establishing tradeoffs between different electricity generation sources, this study presents an unbiased view and highlights the worth of life cycle approach in sustainability assessment for improving the energy policies.","[Akber, Muhammad Zeshan; Thaheem, Muhammad Jamaluddin; Arshad, Husnain] Natl Univ Sci & Technol, NIT SCEE, Dept Construct Engn & Management CE &M, Islamabad, Pakistan",National University of Sciences & Technology - Pakistan,"Thaheem, MJ (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Sci & Technol, NIT SCEE, Dept Construct Engn & Management CE &M, Islamabad, Pakistan.",zeshan304@gmail.com; jamal.thaheem@nit.nust.edu.pk; husnain.cem06@nit.nust.edu.pk,"Thaheem, Muhammad Jamaluddin/N-3013-2019; Akber, Muhammad Zeshan/HZH-3827-2023","Thaheem, Muhammad Jamaluddin/0000-0001-6092-7842; Akber, Muhammad Zeshan/0000-0003-1754-1527; Arshad, Husnain/0000-0001-7950-2588",,,,,90,72,72,1,23,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2017,111.0,,,,,,111,126,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.09.022,0.0,,,16,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FN1VQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000415779700014,0

In this study, based on a sample of one million Taiwanese siblings, we examine university admission at age 18 as our outcome variable and find that at school entry, the oldest (September born) children are 31-38% more likely to be admitted into university at age 18 than the youngest (August born) children, indicating strong seasonality in university admission. The inclusion of controls for family background is found to explain only a small portion of these effects, particularly for males. Given that such results are at odds with the recent US evidence, we revisit the US Census data and find that when racial differences are properly controlled for in the estimation, even a rich set of family characteristics is capable of explaining only a minor proportion of the QOB effects. Furthermore, using data from the US and Indonesia, we find that seasonal temperature variation is unlikely to be an important contributor to the US-Taiwan disparity. Our findings imply that the validity of using QOB or MOB as an instrumental variable may be dependent on the population being studied and the sample selected.","[Fan, Elliott; Liu, Jin-Tan] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chen, Yen-Chien] Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Econ, Nantou, Taiwan",National Taiwan University; National Chi Nan University,"Fan, E (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan.",elliottfan@ntu.edu.tw; liujt@ntu.edu.tw; yenchien@ncnu.edu.tw,"Fan, Elliott/AAO-6499-2020","Fan, Elliott/0000-0002-2511-2581",,,,,33,5,5,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

Using microdata from the 2005 1 % population sample survey, this paper examines, for the first time, the migration of university entrants and graduates in China by describing their migration patterns and modeling their choices of destination location. The migration patterns show that recent university graduates are highly concentrated in three eastern provincial units, Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong, and that the destinations of university entrants tend to be more dispersed geographically. The results from conditional logit models indicate that highly educated youths, in particular those who study in a regular university, have a strong tendency to stay in the same province after graduation. The migration of university entrants is determined mainly by regional differences in university enrollment, while the distribution of national key universities, economic opportunities, and the cost of living plays a less important role in their location choices. The migration of university graduates is driven primarily by regional differences in wage levels. Comparing with vocational college entrants, regular university entrants are attracted to regions with more national key universities. Comparing with vocational college graduates, regular university graduates are attracted to regions with higher wage levels. Our findings suggest that increasing labor market returns is a more effective approach than investing in higher education to curb brain drain in China's less developed regions.","[Liu, Ye; Shen, Jianfa] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog & Resource Management, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Liu, Ye] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Shenzhen Res Inst, Shenzhen 518057, Peoples R China; [Xu, Wei] Univ Lethbridge, Dept Geog, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada; [Xu, Wei] East China Normal Univ, Ctr Modern Chinese City Studies, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wang, Guixin] Fudan Univ, Inst Populat Res, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China","Chinese University of Hong Kong; CUHK Shenzhen Research Institute; The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen; University of Lethbridge; East China Normal University; Fudan University","Liu, Y (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog & Resource Management, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Liu, Y (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Shenzhen Res Inst, Shenzhen 518057, Peoples R China.",liuye@cuhk.edu.hk,"Liu, Ye/J-2787-2019; Shen, Jianfa/H-8142-2013","Liu, Ye/0000-0003-2511-5413; Shen, Jianfa/0000-0003-4110-0561","Research Grants Council of HongKong [CUHK449013]; China Ministry of Education [11JJDZH006]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41329001, 41501151]; National Key Technology R&D Program of China [2012BAI32B07]; Research Centre for Urban and Regional Development, Hong Kong Institute of Asia-Pacific Studies","Research Grants Council of HongKong(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); China Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education, China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Technology R&D Program of China(National Key Technology R&D Program); Research Centre for Urban and Regional Development, Hong Kong Institute of Asia-Pacific Studies","The authors gratefully acknowledge the funding from Research Grants Council of HongKong (No. CUHK449013), China Ministry of Education (No. 11JJDZH006), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41329001, 41501151), and National Key Technology R&D Program of China (2012BAI32B07).

In the United States, where there is abundant, low-cost natural gas supply, increased NGCC deployment could be a cost-effective emissions abatement opportunity at relatively modest carbon prices. However, under scenarios in which carbon prices rise and deeper emissions reductions are achieved, other technologies may be more cost-effective than NGCC in the future. In this analysis, using a US energy system model with foresight (a version of the National Energy Modeling System or NEMS model), we find that varying expectations about carbon prices after 2030 does not materially affect NGCC deployment prior to 2030, all else equal. An important implication of this result is that, under the set of natural gas and carbon price trajectories explored here, myopic behavior or other imperfect expectations about potential future carbon policy do not change the natural gas deployment path or lead to stranded natural gas generation infrastructure. We explain these results in terms of the underlying economic competition between available generation technologies and discuss the broader relevance to US climate change mitigation policy.","[Mignone, Bryan K.] ExxonMobil Res & Engn Co, 1545 Route 22 East, Annandale, NJ 08801 USA; [Showalter, Sharon; Wood, Frances] OnLocation Inc, 501 Church St,Suite 300, Vienna, VA 22180 USA; [McJeon, Haewon] Joint Global Change Res Inst, Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, 5825 Univ Res Court, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Steinberg, Daniel] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, 15013 Denver West Pkwy, Golden, CO 80401 USA",Exxon Mobil Corporation; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA,"Mignone, BK (通讯作者)，ExxonMobil Res & Engn Co, 1545 Route 22 East, Annandale, NJ 08801 USA.",bryan.k.mignone@exxconmobil.com,,"Steinberg, Daniel/0000-0003-1769-2261; McJeon, Haewon/0000-0003-0348-5704",ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company,ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company(Exxon Mobil Corporation),"The authors from OnLocation, Inc., PNNL and NREL acknowledge support from the ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company.

Trends on indicators such as energy intensity and carbon intensity of energy were compared with decadal benchmarks derived from deep decarbonisation scenarios for the electricity, residential, transport, and industry sectors. The methodology applied provides a useful and informative approach to tracking decarbonisation of energy systems. The results show that the EU has made significant progress in decarbonising its energy systems. On a number of indicators assessed the results show that a significant acceleration from historical levels is required in order to reach the rates of change seen on the future benchmarks for deep decarbonisation. The methodology applied provides an example of how the research community and international organisations could complement the transparency mechanism developed by the Paris Agreement on climate change, to improve understanding of progress toward low-carbon energy systems.","[Spencer, Thomas; Pierfederici, Roberta; Sartor, Oliver; Berghmans, Nicolas] Inst Sustainable Dev & Int Relat IDDRI, 41 Rue Four, F-75006 Paris, France; [Samadi, Sascha; Fischedick, Manfred; Knoop, Katharina] Wuppertal Inst Climate Environm & Energy, Doppersberg 19, D-42103 Wuppertal, Germany; [Pye, Steve] UCL, Energy Inst, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Criqui, Patrick; Mathy, Sandrine] Grenoble Appl Econ Lab, 1241 Rue Residences Domain Univ, F-38400 St Martin Dheres, France; [Capros, Pantelis; Fragkos, Panagiotis] E3M Lab, 9 Iroon Politech St,15 773 Zografou Campus, Athens, Greece; [Bukowski, Maciej; Sniegocki, Aleksander] WiseEuropa, Al Jerozolimskie 99 Lok 18, PL-02001 Warsaw, Poland; [Virdis, Maria Rosa; Gaeta, Maria] ENEA, Lungotevere Thaon di Revel 76, I-00196 Rome, Italy; [Pollierh, Karine; Cassisa, Cyril] Enerdata, 47 Ave Alsace Lorraine, F-38000 Grenoble, France",University of London; University College London; Italian National Agency New Technical Energy & Sustainable Economics Development,"Spencer, T (通讯作者)，Inst Sustainable Dev & Int Relat IDDRI, 41 Rue Four, F-75006 Paris, France.",thomas.spencer@iddri.org,"Fragkos, Panagiotis/AAF-6123-2020; Spencer, Thomas/AAD-6434-2020","Sniegocki, Aleksander/0000-0003-1465-2416; Fragkos, Panagiotis/0000-0003-3596-0661; Bukowski, Maciej/0000-0003-1665-5186; Samadi, Sascha/0000-0002-4939-2872; Capros, Pantelis/0000-0002-8463-5729; Fischedick, Manfred/0000-0003-2893-5003",French government [ANR-10-LABX-01],French government,"This article has received financial support from the French government in the framework of the programme Investissements d'avenir, managed by ANR (the French National Research Agency) under the reference ANR-10-LABX-01.",,45,25,26,4,45,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2017,110.0,,,,,,509,517,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.08.053,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FP5LK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417660800050,0

The existing literature emphasizes two mechanisms through which land restrictions can affect economic outcomes: collateral value of land, and (in)security of property rights. Our analysis focuses on an alternative mechanism where land restrictions increase costs of migration out of villages. Testable prediction of collateral channel is that wages remain unchanged, but the effects on labour force participation are ambiguous. Insecurity of property rights in land reduces labour force participation, but leaves wages undisturbed. In contrast, if land restrictions work primarily through higher migration costs, labour force participation increases, while wages decline. For identification, we exploit a natural experiment in Sri Lanka where historical malaria played a unique role in land policy. We provide robust evidence of a positive effect of land restrictions on women's labour force participation, but a negative effect on female wages. The empirical results thus contradict a collateral or insecure property rights effect, but supports migration costs as the primary mechanism.","[Emran, M.

This study investigates a loss-averse EV manufacturer's optimal production strategy under uncertain market demand in the presence of both government subsidy and battery recycling. An analytical model is built and related optimal solution and numerical experiments are provided. Results indicate that increased subsidy promotes the manufacturer's optimal production quantity and expected utility. Increased battery recycling rate promotes the manufacturer's optimal production quantity. However, the manufacturer's expected utility decreases with the battery recycling rate if the optimal production quantity is sufficiently small. This result implies that the manufacturer may prefer a relatively small battery recycling rate when the market scale is small. Consequently, the government should establish regulations to promote battery recycling for environmental protection. We find that either subsidy or battery recycling can offset the negative effects of loss aversion on the optimal production quantity and expected utility. The majority of our results still hold if we consider multiple repurposing options for used batteries or an alternative subsidy mechanism. In particular, the manufacturer's optimal production quantity and expected utility are higher under cost subsidy mechanism than under consumer subsidy mechanism.","[Gu, Huaying; Liu, Zhixue] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Qing, Qiankai] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Automat, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Qing, Qiankai] Wuhan Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Automobile & Traff Engn, Wuhan 430081, Hubei, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Wuhan University of Science & Technology,"Qing, QK (通讯作者)，Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Automat, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.;Qing, QK (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Automobile & Traff Engn, Wuhan 430081, Hubei, Peoples R China.",qingqiankai@wust.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71320107001, 71401129]; Research Center of Service Science and Engineering at Wuhan University of Science and Technology",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Research Center of Service Science and Engineering at Wuhan University of Science and Technology,The authors thank the editor and three anonymous referees for their constructive suggestions that have significantly improved this paper.

The development model of electric vehicles is in urgent need of innovation. Considering the initial investment cost, operating costs, fuel cost and other expenses of electric vehicles, this paper designed a critical price model of alternative fuel vehicles in the whole life cycle from the consumers' point of view. The results showed that users can use the electric vehicles when the selling price is lower than the critical price. And the rise of oil prices, the reduction of the initial investment of electric vehicles and the imposition of carbon tax will help to improve the critical price and promote the development of electric vehicles. Four kinds of promotion models for the electric vehicle from three angles of risk transfer, risk reduction and risk sharing have been designed.

Technological progress does not only realize the energy savings, but also causes rebound effect by promoting output growth. Although the rebound effect is an important topic, there is still very little empirical research that focuses on the nonferrous metals industry in China. Using the LMDI method and the total factor productivity model (to calculate parameters), we estimate the size of the rebound effect in China's nonferrous metals industry over the period 1985-2014. According to the results, the average rebound effect is approximately 83.02% with a downward trend, which indicates that most of the expected energy savings are mitigated. The rebounds with a strong fluctuation are comparatively discussed in various periods, suggesting that China cannot count only on technological progress to save energy and reduce emission. Furthermore, the government should apply economic instruments, such as energy pricing mechanism reform, resource tax, and carbon tax, as supplements to realize the targets of energy conservation and emission reduction. Additionally, optimizing sub-sector structure and promoting substitution also play a significant role in the mitigation of the rebound effect.","[Lin, Boqiang; Chen, Yufang] Xiamen Univ, Sch Management, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Guoliang] Ind Bank Co Ltd, Risk Management Dept, Fuzhou 350000, Fujian, Peoples R China",Xiamen University; Industrial Bank China,"Lin, BQ (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Sch Management, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.",bqlin@xmu.edu.cn,"Lin, Boqiang/G-3960-2010","Lin, Boqiang/0000-0002-1308-400X",Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy [1260-Z0210011]; Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding [1260-Y07200]; Newcastle University Joint Strategic Partnership Fund,Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy; Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding; Newcastle University Joint Strategic Partnership Fund,"The paper is supported by the Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy (No: 1260-Z0210011), Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding (No. 1260-Y07200), and Newcastle University Joint Strategic Partnership Fund.",,61,57,60,2,71,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,520,529,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.07.031,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400050,0

Based on an Austrian case study, this paper investigates eight decisive patterns of acceptance and non-acceptance of wind energy. We apply qualitative research methods, such as interviews, focus groups, and WorldCafe discussions, with stakeholders on the national level and with citizens and local decision-makers at potential wind power expansion sites. The results show that local opposition to wind energy cannot be explained by single factors but is caused by a complex set of individual and collective preferences rooted in institutional and socio-political arrangements. The problem concerning these conflicting patterns is that they are trapped in often opposing or confronting policy core beliefs, which are unlikely to change. Hence, it is necessary to appeal to overarching targets like the claims of environmental justice to counterbalance the impacts of wind energy. We conclude that there is a strong demand for fair decision-making processes and an equal distribution of environmental and economic gains and losses.","[Scherhaufer, Patrick] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Inst Forest Environm & Nat Resource Policy, Vienna, Austria; [Hoeltinger, Stefan; Schmidt, Johannes] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Inst Sustainable Econ Developement, Vienna, Austria; [Salak, Boris; Schauppenlehner, Thomas] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Dept Landscape Spatial & Infrastruct Sci, Inst Landscape Dev & Conservat Planning, Vienna, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Scherhaufer, P (通讯作者)，Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria.",patrick.scherlaaufer@boku.ac.at,"Schauppenlehner, Thomas/AGD-8455-2022; Salak, Boris/CAE-8589-2022","Schauppenlehner, Thomas/0000-0002-2552-210X; Salak, Boris/0000-0002-4929-8376; Scherhaufer, Patrick/0000-0001-6531-296X",Austrian Climate Research Program - ACRP [KR12AC5K01257],Austrian Climate Research Program - ACRP,"This work was supported by the Austrian Climate Research Program - ACRP (5th call, grant number KR12AC5K01257).",,62,68,68,3,40,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,863,870,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.05.057,0.0,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400083,0

Adequately accounting for stakeholders' values and interests is key to understanding whether stakeholders' perspectives pose a risk to energy policy implementation. We present results from a case study on the implementation of a renewable energy project in Switzerland, where we applied Q methodology. Three perspectives were identified, namely: 1) promotion for local development and production of energy ('local pro-producers'); 2) promotion for a national level 'greener' environmental agenda ('National greens'); and 3) regional government empowerment for implementing energy policies ('Cantonal leverage'). These three perspectives reflect different sets of values and priorities for local, cantonal and national interests, revealing disagreements with the energy policy at different levels of government. The key basis for disagreement rests on which objectives of the policy to prioritize, i.e. energy efficiency, sustainable development, electricity reduction or production. Despite this disagreement, stakeholders largely agree on the importance of an inclusive and democratic decision process. These findings support calls for the explicit and systematic consideration for deep-seated values and perspectives amongst stakeholders on an evidentiary basis.","[Diaz, Paula; Patt, Anthony] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Climate Policy Grp, Univ Str 22, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Adler, Carolina] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Decis & Transdisciplinar Lab, Univ Str 22, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Díaz, P (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Climate Policy Grp, Univ Str 22, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",paula.diaz@usys.ethz.ch,"Adler, Carolina/P-6132-2019; Patt, Anthony/E-5437-2017","Adler, Carolina/0000-0002-8787-2797; Patt, Anthony/0000-0001-8428-8707","National Research Programme Energy Turnaround of the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [NRP 70, 153974]",National Research Programme Energy Turnaround of the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"This research project is part of the National Research Programme Energy Turnaround (NRP 70) of the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) (153974).

Private sector investment is key to achieving this. Along with Chinese-funded projects, Independent Power Projects (IPP) represent the fastest growing sources of power investment in Sub-Saharan Africa. IPP investment flows show little concern for electricity market structures, but are more likely to gravitate to countries with strong planning, procurement and contracting capacity, as well as good regulatory quality. Data from the continent also shows a variety of ownership and financing structures for IPPs, but generally development financing institutions (DFIs) play an important part in mitigating risk and bringing in private financiers. We also see renewable energy breaking through on the continent - both in scale and price. This breakthrough is in part being facilitated by competitive procurement or auctions, which deliver lower prices and increased transparency when compared with renewable energy feed-in tariffs or directly negotiated contracts. These developments have important policy implications, highlighting the need for: dynamic, least-cost planning, linked to the timely initiation of the competitive procurement of new generation capacity; the building of effective regulatory capacity; and appropriate risk mitigation mechanisms. Such efforts promise to promote sustainable economic and social development across the continent.","[Eberhard, Anton] Univ Cape Town, Grad Sch Business, Rondebosch, South Africa; [Gratwick, Katharine] Management Programme Infrastruct Reform & Regulat, Cape Town, South Africa; [Morella, Elvira; Antmann, Pedro] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",University of Cape Town; The World Bank,"Eberhard, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Grad Sch Business, Rondebosch, South Africa.",anton.eberhard@gsb.uct.ac.za,,,World Bank [UPI00217304],World Bank(The World Bank India),"This paper is based, in part, on research supported by the World Bank (UPI00217304).",,28,48,55,0,23,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2017,108.0,,,,,,390,424,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.05.023,0.0,,,35,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FC3FZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406725800039,0

However, more progress is needed to comply with current EU climate directives. The objective of this work is to analyze the main determining factors of primary energy use that drove energy decoupling in Portugal in 1995-2010 with a focus on understanding the contribution of the three levels of energy consumption, and on identifying opportunities for policy intervention. To do so, we perform a structural decomposition analysis on a novel energy input-output model that includes the primary, secondary and useful levels of energy consumption and the conversion processes between them. The results show that Portugal experienced relative energy decoupling. While final energy and non-energy demands contributed to energy coupling, sectoral useful energy intensity, the structure and efficiency of the energy sector, end-use energy conversion efficiency and structural changes in the rest of the economy were the main decoupling forces. Moreover, the advantages of the proposed three-level decoupling analysis for energy policy are shown. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, the present paper constitutes the first energy input-output study to include useful energy flows (measured as exergy).","[Guevara, Zeus] Univ Guadalajara, Univ Ctr Tonala, Avenida Periferico 555, Ejido San Jose Tatepozco 48525, Jalisco, Mexico; [Domingos, Tiago] Univ Lisbon, MARETEC Marine Environm & Technol Ctr, Inst Super Tecn, Dept Mech Engn, Avenida Rovisco Pais 1, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidad de Guadalajara; Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico,"Guevara, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Guadalajara, Univ Ctr Tonala, Avenida Periferico 555, Ejido San Jose Tatepozco 48525, Jalisco, Mexico.",zeus.guevara@tecnico.ulisboa.pt,"Guevara, Zeus/F-1628-2016; Domingos, Tiago/D-4558-2012","Guevara, Zeus/0000-0002-1254-8423; Domingos, Tiago/0000-0002-6194-0405","Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [UID/EEA/50009/2013, SFRH/BD/51297/2010]; CONACYT-SENER [2138]; MIT Portugal Program; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BD/51297/2010] Funding Source: FCT",Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); CONACYT-SENER; MIT Portugal Program; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"This work was financially supported by Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia through project UID/EEA/50009/2013 (PIDDAC) and grant SFRH/BD/51297/2010; and by the CONACYT-SENER Fund - Energy Sustainability 2015-2016, 2nd cut-off phase (Fideicomiso No. 2138).

This paper seeks to extend current conceptualizations of energy justice across entire energy lifecycles, from extraction to final use, to offer an analytically richer and more accurate picture of the (in)justice impacts of energy policy decisions. We identify two key areas that require greater attention and scrutiny in order to enact energy justice within a more democratized energy system. First, we call for greater recognition of the politics, power dynamics and political economy of socio-technical energy transitions. We use the example of the fossil fuel divestment movement as a way to shift energy justice policy attention upstream to focus on the under-researched injustices relating to supply-side climate policy analysis and decisions. Second, the idea of a just transition and the distributional impacts on and the role of labor in low-carbon transitions must be addressed more systematically. This focus produces a more directly political and politicizing framing of energy (in)justice and a just energy transition.","[Healy, Noel] Salem State Univ, Dept Geog, 352 Lafayette St, Salem, MA USA; [Barry, John] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Hist Anthropol Philosophy & Polit, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland",Massachusetts System of Public Higher Education; Salem State University; Queens University Belfast,"Healy, N (通讯作者)，Salem State Univ, Dept Geog, 352 Lafayette St, Salem, MA USA.",nhealy@salemstate.edu,,"Barry, John/0000-0002-6543-7698",,,,,84,368,400,30,261,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2017,108.0,,,,,,451,459,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.06.014,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FC3FZ,,Green Accepted,Y,N,2024-03-10,WOS:000406725800042,0

The German Energiewende policy together with insufficient transmission capacity between northern and southern Germany as well as the existence of the German-Austrian bidding zone heavily contribute to congestion in the Central European transmission system. To assess the exact impact on the transmission grid, the direct current load flow model ELMOD is employed. Two development scenarios for the year 2025 are evaluated on the basis of four representative weeks. The first scenario focuses on the effect of Energiewende on the transmission networks, the second one drops out nuclear phase-out and thus assesses isolated effect of increased feed-in. The results indicate that higher feed-in of solar and wind power increases the exchange balance and total transport of electricity between transmission system operator areas as well as the average load of lines and volatility of flows. Solar power is identified as a key contributor to the volatility increase, wind power is identified as a key loop-flow contributor. Eventually, it is concluded that German nuclear phase-out does not significantly exacerbate mentioned problems.","[Janda, Karel; Recka, Lukas] Charles Univ Prague, Prague, Czech Republic; [Janda, Karel] Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic; [Malek, Jan] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Charles University Prague; Prague University of Economics & Business; University of Amsterdam,"Recka, L (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.",Karel-Janda@seznam.cz; janmalek.jm@gmail.com; lukasrecka@gmail.com,"Rečka, Lukáš/C-3456-2013; janda, karel/A-3951-2008; janda, karel/GNP-1410-2022","Rečka, Lukáš/0000-0003-3115-5884; janda, karel/0000-0001-7096-6300;",European Union's Horizon Research and Innovation Staff Exchange programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant agreement [681228]; Czech Science Foundation [16-00027S]; Technology Agency of the Czech Republic [TD03000319],European Union's Horizon Research and Innovation Staff Exchange programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant agreement; Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Technology Agency of the Czech Republic,"The research leading to these results was supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Staff Exchange programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant agreement no. 681228.

Our results show that the mixture of two Gaussian distributions outperforms unimodal distributions in explaining China's historic urban-growth patterns, suggesting that the conventional unitary urban-hierarchy assumption lacks ground in China's context. We also find that the higher-density mixture component increasingly dominates the entire distribution, and this gradual transition toward a unimodal city-size distribution is partly related to increased domestic population mobility.","[Li, Xin] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Tat Chee Ave, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Nam, Kyung-Min] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Urban Planning & Design, Pokfulam Rd, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",City University of Hong Kong; University of Hong Kong,"Nam, KM (通讯作者)，Univ Hong Kong, Dept Urban Planning & Design, Pokfulam Rd, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",xinli87@cityu.edu.hk; kmnam@hku.hk,"Nam, Kyung-Min/M-7566-2014; Li, Xin/AAW-8559-2020","Nam, Kyung-Min/0000-0002-4579-4815; Li, Xin/0000-0002-3425-8566",Urban China Initiative; University of Hong Kong [201409159018],Urban China Initiative; University of Hong Kong(University of Hong Kong),"We acknowledge that this study is supported by the Urban China Initiative and the University of Hong Kong (Seed Funding Programme for Basic Research: 201409159018).

This, in turn, pushes the expected income in the city downward and reduces incentives for rural workers to migrate. Surprisingly, rural-urban migration increases. This happens because greater decentralization relaxes the competition for land throughout the city, which reduces urban costs for all urban residents and effectively increases the expected income in the city.","[Posada, Hector M.] Univ Antioquia, Fac Ciencias Econ, Medellin, Colombia; [Moreno-Monroy, Ana I.] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Appl Econ Dept, Barcelona, Spain",Universidad de Antioquia; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Posada, HM (通讯作者)，Univ Antioquia, Fac Ciencias Econ, Medellin, Colombia.",hector.posada@udea.edu.co; anaisabel.moreno@uab.cat,,"Moreno Monroy, Ana Isabel/0000-0002-8282-4067; Posada, Hector M./0000-0002-9600-561X","Universidad de Antioquia, Colciencias and Conalpe; Marie Curie Actions, Intra-European Fellowship LOCATE [PIEF-GA-2013-627114]","Universidad de Antioquia, Colciencias and Conalpe; Marie Curie Actions, Intra-European Fellowship LOCATE(European Union (EU))","Posada gratefully acknowledges financial support from Universidad de Antioquia, Colciencias and Conalpe.

Patent counts are used as an indicator for innovation. The factors considered are generally derived from the systems of innovation literature. Count data econometric model were used for the estimations. The suggest that patenting in wind power technology is positively related to public R&D in wind power (reflecting supply-side policy), the stock of wind capacity (reflecting learning effects), the number of patents per capita (reflecting a country's innovative capacity), and the share of Green party voters (reflecting the legitimacy of the technology). In particular, the presence of production or capacity targets for wind power or renewable energy sources and a stable policy environment (reflecting policy process) appear to be favourable for patenting wind power technologies. These results are robust to various model specifications, distributional assumptions, and alternative classifications of wind power technologies in the patent search.","[Schleich, Joachim; Walz, Rainer; Ragwitz, Mario] Fraunhofer Inst Syst & Innovat Res, Breslauer Str 48, D-76139 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Schleich, Joachim] Grenoble Ecole Management, 12 Rue Pierre Semard,BP 127, F-38003 Grenoble 01, France; [Schleich, Joachim] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Fraunhofer Gesellschaft; Grenoble Ecole Management; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Schleich, J (通讯作者)，Fraunhofer Inst Syst & Innovat Res, Breslauer Str 48, D-76139 Karlsruhe, Germany.",joachim.schleich@isi.fraunhofer.de; rainer.walz@isi.fraunhofer.de; mario.ragwitz@isi.fraunhofer.de,"Schleich, Joachim/I-4612-2019","Schleich, Joachim/0000-0001-6079-7240; Ragwitz, Mario/0000-0001-9997-9551; Walz, Rainer/0000-0002-4726-0593",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L015838/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/L015838/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,74,62,68,8,73,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2017,108.0,,,,,,684,695,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.06.043,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FC3FZ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406725800063,0

Despite the significant implications of this tradeoff, there is very little empirical evidence on the short-run responsiveness of extraction-related activities to changes in severance taxes. We conduct a comparative case study to evaluate the short-term impact of a severance tax increase on oil-related activities and development in Alaska. In 2007, the introduction of Alaska's Clear and Equitable Share (ACES) more than tripled the tax liability for much of the oil already under production in Alaska. We construct a synthetic Alaska from a set of U.S. energy states, with the purpose of estimating the counterfactual evolution of oil production, exploration and development wells, gross state product, and employment, in the absence of ACES. Overall, our results indicate that there is no discernible difference in the outcome variables of interest between Alaska and its synthetic control after the implementation of ACES, suggesting that ACES had a minimal effect on Alaskan oil-related activity and development in the short run.","[Reimer, Matthew N.; Guettabi, Mouhcine; Tanaka, Audrey-Loraine] Univ Alaska Anchorage, Inst Social & Econ Res, 3211 Providence Dr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA; [Reimer, Matthew N.; Guettabi, Mouhcine] Univ Alaska Anchorage, Dept Econ & Publ Policy, 3211 Providence Dr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA",University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Anchorage; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Anchorage,"Reimer, MN (通讯作者)，Univ Alaska Anchorage, Inst Social & Econ Res, 3211 Providence Dr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA.",mreimer2@alaska.edu; mguettabi@alaska.edu; chloetanaka@gmail.com,,"Reimer, Matthew/0000-0001-6087-9115",Northrim Bank,Northrim Bank,"This manuscript has benefited greatly from Ed King, who contributed to the motivation and background section of this evaluation, as well as from comments by two anonymous reviewers and by participants at the 2014 Western Regional Science Association meetings in San Diego.

Experiences show, however, that citizens may object to new energy infrastructure in their localities which may cause delays in achieving the targets. To avoid delays, it is crucial to understand what drives people's opinions. To explore people's opinions of different electricity generation and transmission technologies in Ireland, we conducted a nationally-representative survey. Concerning the drivers, we distinguish between socio-demographics, technology-specific perceptions, and energy policy preferences. Our results show that people generally have positive views of RES technologies. While this indicates that Irish citizens agree to move towards cleaner electricity sources, we find reluctance amongst people to have these technologies located close to their places of residence. We find that, across most technologies, the tradeoff people make between economic and environmental policy objectives drives their opinions of, and their tendencies to oppose, technology developments. The significance of most socio-demographic variables, however, is largely technology-dependent. This highlights that policy makers need to understand how people make tradeoffs between policy objectives and how these tradeoffs relate to their opinions of different technologies.","[Bertsch, Valentin] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland; Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin,"Bertsch, V (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland.",valentin.bertsch@esrl.ie; marie.hyland@esri.ie; michael.mahony@esri.ie,,"Bertsch, Valentin/0000-0001-9477-4805",Energy Policy Research Centre of the Economic and Social Research Institute,Energy Policy Research Centre of the Economic and Social Research Institute,"Hyland, Mahony and Bertsch acknowledge funding from the Energy Policy Research Centre of the Economic and Social Research Institute.

For the sake of urban agglomeration simulation, this paper attempts to develop a computable urban economic (CUE) model incorporated with economies of scale, through the approach of new economic geography. It is assumed that each firm produces a product variant in a monopolistic competition market, and the number of firms is explicit and determined endogenously. The Dixit-Stiglitz type utility function with product variety is adopted into the households' behavior to reflect consumers' preference for variety. On the other hand, internal increasing returns to scale and fixed cost are introduced in firms' behavior to extend the model with economies of scale. The model's parameter estimations and calibration are conducted on the basis of empirical data from several approved sources for Changzhou in 2008. Numerical computations are implemented by employing the extended CUE model incorporated with economies of scale to explain and examine how the urban agglomeration comes into being. Simulation results show that the extended model incorporated with economies of scale is able to commendably represent the urban agglomeration mechanism, providing a promising simulation tool for urban planning and policymaking.","[Zhang, Runsen; Matsushima, Kakuya; Kobayashi, Kiyoshi] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Kyoto 6158540, Japan; [Zhang, Runsen] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan",Kyoto University; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan,"Zhang, RS (通讯作者)，Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Kyoto 6158540, Japan.;Zhang, RS (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan.",zrsnju@gmail.com,"Zhang, Runsen/HTN-9716-2023; Zhang, Runsen/U-1815-2017; Matsushima, Kakuya/V-9179-2019","Matsushima, Kakuya/0000-0002-2196-3303",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26244051] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,19,8,8,0,36,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

It shows that an appropriate adaptation of the common trend assumption underlying the DiD strategy for the comparison of two treatments restricts the possibility of effect heterogeneity for at least one of the treatments. The required assumption of effect homogeneity is likely to be violated because of non-random assignment to treatment based on both observables and unobservables. However, this paper shows that, under certain conditions, the DiD estimate comparing two treatments identifies a lower bound in absolute values on the average treatment effect on the treated compared to the unobserved non-treatment state, even if effect homogeneity is violated. This is possible if the treatments have ordered treatment effects, that is, in expectation, the effects of both treatments compared to no treatment have the same sign, and one treatment has a stronger effect than the other treatment on the respective recipients. Such assumptions are plausible if treatments are ordered or vary in intensity.","[Fricke, Hans] Stanford Univ, Ctr Educ Policy Anal, 520 Galvez Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Fricke, H (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Ctr Educ Policy Anal, 520 Galvez Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",hfricke@stanford.edu,,,Swiss National Science Foundation [P1SGP1 158810]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [P1SGP1_158810] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF),Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"I thank Martin Huber, Michael Lechner, Giovanni Mellace and Conny Wunsch for helpful comments and suggestions.

Aside from broad appeals to differentiated responsibilities and 'greener' technologies, however, the goal leaves significant procedural questions unaddressed. This paper argues that the basic orientation of this approach is problematic, undermining possibilities for progress toward energy justice and equitable development. First, in framing the issue of global energy distribution in broad techno-managerial terms it obscures how particular geographies of energy poverty have been shaped by critical political economic influences. Second, in privileging modern forms of energy and focusing on an end state of universal adoption, over a broader goal of eliminating energy poverty, the approach of SDG7 presents tangible hazards to many of those it seeks to benefit. Using a case study of Sierra Leonean rural cooking energy policy, we demonstrate how the underlying mentality of SDG7 feeds into existing discourses that marginalise producers and users of 'traditional' energy sources, threatening important livelihoods. With such evidence, we argue that for justice in energy policy to be realised holistically, there is a need to question how our knowledge of energy 'problems' have emerged to avoid epistemologically autarchic policy positions.","[Munro, Paul; Healy, Stephen] Univ New South Wales, Sch Languages & Humanities, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [van der Horst, Greg] Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Melbourne,"Munro, P (通讯作者)，Univ New South Wales, Sch Languages & Humanities, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",paul.munro@unsw.edu.au,"Munro, Paul/AAJ-5532-2020","Munro, Paul George/0000-0003-3768-0006","Promoting Agriculture, Governance and Environment (PAGE) programme in Sierra Leone; ACDI/VOCA; USAID; Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) programme - European Union [PR 46643]","Promoting Agriculture, Governance and Environment (PAGE) programme in Sierra Leone; ACDI/VOCA; USAID(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) programme - European Union","This research presented in this report was co-financed by the Promoting Agriculture, Governance and Environment (PAGE) programme in Sierra Leone (funded by ACDI/VOCA and USAID), and the Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) programme funded by the European Union (grant number PR 46643) and administered by the United National's Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO).

This paper reports on an in depth qualitative analysis of 22 persons under different feed-in tariff (FiT) policy settings to explore consumer experiences in acquiring solar PV and their energy use behaviour.

The Croatian electricity markets are not fully integrated, and some regions are faced with statistically significant structural break(s), demonstrating thereby the Croatian gradual energy reform process with several sudden innovations, significant regional differences, and the market dependence on expectations, domestic and international economic and non-economic innovations. The impacts of innovations are likely to be permanent for most of the regions, and their electricity consumption behaviours are likely to be path dependent.

Environmental economics theory suggests that the evaluation of environmental externality is the basis of designing an efficient regulation. The purposes of this study are: (1) to identify Chinese respondents' preferences for green development of electric power industry and the socio-economic characteristics behind them; (2) to investigate the different attitudes of the respondents towards pollution and CO2 reduction; (3) to quantitatively evaluate the environmental cost of China's coal-fired power generation. Based on the method of choice experiments (CE) and the 411 questionnaires with 2466 data points, we found that Chinese respondents prefer PM2.5, SO2 and NOx reduction to CO2 reduction and that the environment cost of coal-fired power plants in China is 0.30 yuan per kWh. In addition, we found that the socioeconomic characteristics of income, education, gender, and environmental awareness have significant impacts on respondents' choices. These findings indicate that the environmental cost of coal-fired power generation is a significant factor that requires great consideration in the formulation of electric power development policies. In addition, importance should also be attached to the implementation of green power price policy and enhancement of environmental protection awareness.","[Zhao, Xiaoli] China Univ Petr, Sch Business Adm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Cai, Qiong; Luo, Kaiyan] North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ma, Chunbo] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Hu, Yanan] Kunshan China Resources City Gas Co Ltd, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Li, William] Swarthmore Coll, 500 Coll Ave, Swarthmore, PA 19081 USA",China University of Petroleum; North China Electric Power University; University of Western Australia; China Resources Group; Swarthmore College,"Zhao, XL (通讯作者)，China Univ Petr, Sch Business Adm, Beijing, Peoples R China.",email99zxl@vip.sina.com,"Luo, Kaiyan/N-6969-2019; Cai, Qiong/Q-1751-2018; Ma, Chunbo/D-3478-2011","Luo, Kaiyan/0000-0002-6193-7951; Ma, Chunbo/0000-0002-9973-2943","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71373078, 71573273]; China University of Petroleum Beijing [2462014YJRC052]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China University of Petroleum Beijing,"We would like to thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China for partially funding this study (Grant nos. 71373078 and 71573273), as well as the fund from China University of Petroleum Beijing (Grant no. 2462014YJRC052).

To mitigate these livelihood challenges, the government of Ethiopia has recognized the need for a national policy framework, which encourages the uptake of biogas technology. However, despite expectations of improved health and livelihood outcomes from biogas technology, rigorous impact evaluations of existing biogas interventions in Ethiopia do not exist. In this paper, we investigated the impact of biogas technology adoption on indoor air pollution (IAP) health symptoms in a sample of 200 households in the Tigray Region of Ethiopia. The average treatment effect results of the study revealed that households with small-scale biogas technology have significantly lower incidence of IAP-related illness than comparison (non-adopter) households in the matched sample. Consequently, small-scale biogas adopters spent less money for medication and had less absentee days from work due to illness. Results also show that biogas adopters spent less time per year collecting fuel energy. Overall, these findings are grounds for optimism about the potential for small-scale biogas to improve human capital formation through better health, which is one the major targets of the UN Sustainable Development Goals.","[Abadi, Nigussie] Mekelle Univ, Dept Nat Resource Econ & Management, Mekele, Ethiopia; [Abadi, Nigussie] Norwegian Univ Life Sci NMBU Norway, Inst Ecol & Nat Resource Management INA, POB 231, NO-1432 As, Norway; [Gebrehiwot, Kindeya] Mekelle Univ, Dept Land Resource Management & Environm Protect, POB 231, Mekelle, Ethiopia; [Techane, Ataldti] Mekelle Univ, Dept Nat Resource Econ & Management, POB 231, Mekelle, Ethiopia; [Nerea, Hailish] Mekelle Univ Ethiopia, Agroecol & Sustainable Dev, POB 231, Mekelle, Ethiopia",Mekelle University; Norwegian University of Life Sciences; Mekelle University; Mekelle University; Mekelle University,"Abadi, N (通讯作者)，Mekelle Univ, Dept Nat Resource Econ & Management, Mekele, Ethiopia.;Abadi, N (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Life Sci NMBU Norway, Inst Ecol & Nat Resource Management INA, POB 231, NO-1432 As, Norway.",nigussieabadi@gmail.com; kindeya.gebrehiwot@mu.edu.e; aticheck@gmail.com; hailishn@gmail.com,"Abadi, Nigussie/AAM-9682-2020; Kuang, Jinyi/L-8488-2017","Kuang, Jinyi/0000-0003-4173-3246",Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) under Agro ecology and Sustainable Development Project of Mekelle University,Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) under Agro ecology and Sustainable Development Project of Mekelle University,The authors would like to thank the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) for its financial support under the Agro ecology and Sustainable Development Project of Mekelle University.

When integrating, the main role is assigned to the market; the market is based on the voluntary participation of the parties, the subsidiary nature of supranational institutions, on a benevolent attitude and mutual consideration of the interests of the member states. Integration processes are quite popular nowadays. The most striking examples are the European Union, the Commonwealth of Independent States and the North Atlantic Alliance. All these alliances contribute to the development of international relations, the elimination of intercountry barriers and, as a result, simplification and improvement of the quality of citizens' life in different countries.

As the study showed there is significant flexibility for companies to disclose relevant information (including reporting in a separate report), as well as they may rely on international, European or national guidelines (UN Global Compact, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, ISO 26000, EMAS, GRI).

In member states of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), much progress in health care outcomes has been achieved in recent years. Despite these improvements, important questions about how successful countries are in achieving good results on different dimensions of health system performance remain. In our paper we study the health care outcomes of OECD countries as a function of health care spending, lifestyle variables and available health care resources. Multiple regression analysis is used to model the relationship between these indicators. Available data show that although health care indicators are related to the health expenditure (both government and private), the health outcomes are affected by environmental factors and cultural choices, as well. In our paper we show that higher health spending is usually associated with better health outcomes, however, this relationship is less clear in countries with the highest health spending per capita. Even though data generally indicate the overall improvement in health outcomes in OECD countries, we use the calculated multiple regression model for identification of most important weaknesses and potential threats.","[Bohm, Patrik; Bohmova, Gabriela] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Zilina, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Böhm, P (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Zilina, Slovakia.",patrik.bohm@fpedas.uniza.sk; gabriela.bohmova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Bohm, Patrik/P-4697-2016; Bohmova, Gabriela/P-4706-2016","Bohm, Patrik/0000-0002-3210-1055; Bohmova, Gabriela/0000-0001-6416-4352",[VEGA 1/0696/16],,This contribution was undertaken as parts of the research project VEGA 1/0696/16.,,17,1,1,0,3,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,187,193,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059200025,0

This global technology should be available both for private and business users. Creation of separate system for global railway transport purposes entails huge investment in development, certification and implementation of this technology (Barazzetta et al., 2016), (Parichehreh et al., 2016). Therefore, in authors opinion, it is possible to use public open radio networks to communicate among railway transport users. Such approach can significantly reduce the cost without decreasing the safety. It is necessary to develop the transmission allowing for safe exchange of information (in accordance with railway standards) via already existing public infrastructure. Thus, this paper will presents the concept of global data transmission in open networks for diagnostic of railway traffic control devices using LTE technology. The proper diagnostic is the crucial issue which ensures the right operation of railway traffic control devices. In Poland, relay based traffic control devices are gradually replaced with computer based systems. Thus, the data transmission among modern railway traffic control devices using LTE technology is one of the main tasks of the research project commissioned by NCBiR PBS3/A6/29/2015 and realized at University of Technology and Humanities in Radom. The simulation results for different encryption methods have been presented.

The article analyzes the state of the cross-border transport infrastructure of the Russian Federation, the dynamics of its development, its ability to integrate into the global transport infrastructure. It's analyzed the availability of the necessary terminal complexes and roads. Transport infrastructure investment is projected to increase at an average annual rate of about 5% worldwide over the period of 2014 to 2025. Roads will likely remain the biggest area of investment. Transport, for example, plays a key role in linking consumers and producers, and integrating markets by facilitating exports and imports. Improving transport infrastructure, logistics and cross-border trade facilities is central to reducing delivery times and costs, and therefore for the integration processes. For regions which are short on transport infrastructure, especially for landlocked regions, this is particularly important. Large -scale development of transport networks will likely continue in many Asia-Pacific economies, given the shift in economic power from the West to the East. In this regard, it is necessary to intensify the development of transport infrastructure to create the conditions for integration into the global transport system between the east and west.","[Dorokhin, Sergei, V; Nebesnaya, Anna Y.] Voronezh State Forestry Engn Univ, Timiryazeva St 8, Voronezh 394087, Russia",Voronezh State University of Forestry & Technologies named after G.F.

Therefore, there is a need for a system that would perform the support functions of the management and thus facilitate its successful operation. This helper tool is a controlling system, successfully implemented and used in many of the world's most advanced companies. Controlling through its functions and through the controller helps the company to overcome unexpected fluctuations on the markets, prepare for them or even predict them.

However, little is known about the economic value of headwater stream restoration and the associated improvement in ecosystem services. Here, we apply the contingent valuation method to assess the awareness, knowledge, and values held by different stakeholder groups regarding a change in the set of ecosystem services related to the restoration of sediment-stressed forest streams in a large boreal catchment. The majority of respondents (69%) place positive value on restoration. A multiple bound discrete choice (MBDC) format is applied and sensitivity analysis is carried out on willingness to pay (WTP) values with respect to preference uncertainty. Preference uncertainty related to willingness to support and pay for a forest stream restoration program is estimated and compared with ordered probit and non-parametric WTP models. According to our study, only 15% of the more than 450 respondents with a positive WTP are completely certain about their preferences. Higher preference certainty is significantly correlated with, for example, the stated easiness in revealing the household's WTP, trust in the restoration program, and support for the restoration of the living conditions of trout, in addition to a lower education level. Making restoration benefits more visible and involving the public and stakeholders in the projects could help in setting restoration targets, creating more effective plans with better public and stakeholder support, and establishing a stronger basis for the funding of restoration efforts.","[Lehtoranta, Virpi; Sarvilinna, Auri; Vaisanen, Sari] Finnish Environm Inst SYKE, Freshwater Ctr, POB 140, FI-00251 Helsinki, Finland; [Aroviita, Jukka] Finnish Environm Inst SYKE, Freshwater Ctr, POB 413, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland; [Muotka, Timo] Univ Oulu, Dept Ecol, FIN-90014 Oulu, Finland",Finnish Environment Institute; Finnish Environment Institute; University of Oulu,"Lehtoranta, V (通讯作者)，Finnish Environm Inst SYKE, Freshwater Ctr, POB 140, FI-00251 Helsinki, Finland.",Virpi.lehtoranta@ymparisto.fi; timo.muotka@oulu.fi,"Aroviita, Jukka/GQP-6335-2022; Muotka, Timo/JED-5466-2023","Aroviita, Jukka/0000-0003-3330-0731; Lehtoranta, Virpi/0000-0002-0670-328X; Vaisanen, Sari/0000-0002-3550-8862","Academy of Finland [263597, 275772]; EU [282656]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [263597, 275772] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA)",Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); EU(European Union (EU)); Academy of Finland (AKA),"This research was enabled by the projects Reffect (Assessing Restoration Effectiveness in Sediment-Stressed Forest Streams: Biodiversity Meets Hydrology) (Grant no. 263597), funded by the Academy of Finland, and REFORM (REstoring rivers FOR effective catchment Management), funded by the EU 7th Framework Programme for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration under Grant Agreement no. 282656.

Additionally, the idea of green logistics is addressed by including the costs for carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the optimization model. The model is applied to an industrial case of a commercial vehicle manufacturer. The results show that delivery frequencies and the consideration of the entire material flow of a transport relation are main influence factors.

Although the Maikop phenomenon was a fiasco, the AMC prospered. The company all but disappeared during the first years of the Bolshevik revolution, but between 1910 and 1914 it was able to make the transition from coal to oil in Southern Russia, and created a successful, vertically integrated oil holding. In this article, we argue that this success, which is in stark contrast to the failure of the company's peers, was mainly due to the fact that the AMC's founder, George Tweedy, was very knowledgeable of the Russian oil scene of the time, which was, at the beginning of the twentieth century, the most advanced oil industry in the world.","[Mane Estrada, Aurelia] Univ Barcelona, GATE, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain; [Mane Estrada, Aurelia] Univ East Anglia, Sch Hist, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of Barcelona; University of East Anglia,"Estrada, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, GATE, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain.;Estrada, AM (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Sch Hist, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",,"estrada, ana maría soto/D-8706-2012","Mane Estrada, Aurelia/0000-0002-8504-1375",University of Barcelona [CSO2011-29438-C05-02]; project The international dimension of the political transformations in the Arab-Islamic world [CSO2014-52998-C3-3-P],University of Barcelona; project The international dimension of the political transformations in the Arab-Islamic world,"My stay at UEA was possible thanks to the University of Barcelona, which granted a sabbatical, and the collaboration with the project New spaces, actors and instruments in Spain's foreign relations with the Arab and muslim worlds (CSO2011-29438-C05-02).

To that end, and using figures on the number of patents filed, the trajectory of innovation is analysed for the 1878-1935 period for ten of the main industrial distribts in Spain that had already become industrial districts in the early 20th century. The result supports the thesis that the capacity to innovate is an essential characteristic of industrial districts and clusters, but also shows that there were large differences between them in their propensity to innovate, linked to differences in human capital, sectoral specialisation and proximity to environments with a higher level of technological knowledge, among other factors.","[Miranda, Jose A.; Montano, Borja] Univ Alicante, Alicante, Spain",Universitat d'Alacant,"Miranda, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Alicante, Alicante, Spain.",,"Miranda Encarnacion, Jose Antonio/E-2882-2010","Miranda Encarnacion, Jose Antonio/0000-0003-0543-8784","MICINN [HAR2009-07571, HAR2012-33298]",MICINN(Spanish Government),This paper has benefited from the financial support of MICINN (HAR2009-07571: Origenes y desarrollo de los distritos industriales exportadores: un analisis desde la historia economica) and HAR2012-33298 (Ciclos y desarrollo industrial en la historia economica de Espana).,,104,3,3,0,3,"UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT HISTORIA, INST ECONOMIQUES",BARCELONA,"AVDA DIAGONAL 690, BARCELONA, 08034, SPAIN",1132-7200,2385-3247,,REV HIST INDUST,Rev.

In an employment contract, an employer agrees with an employee on substantial work-related elements and payment conditions. Wage policy should follow objectives leading to efficiency and work ethics, which should be reflected also by fair employee compensation. The International Office of Work created a list of factors, which lead to such employee reward strategy, so that wage system condition were balanced with wage-political decision making. That is why crisis management reviews and looks after the risk deficit of wage matters, which include employment matters in a business sector. When dealing with a specific situation, a corporate crisis management must be based on overall conditions given by a national, and in our case - Slovak economy.
